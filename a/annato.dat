50|$|Annatto, {{made from}} {{the seeds of the}} achiote tree. <b>Annato</b> {{contains}} carotenoids, the same ingredient that gives carrots and other vegetables their orange colour. <b>Annato</b> has been used to dye certain cheeses in Britain, particularly Gloucester cheese, since the 16th century. It is now commonly used to colour American cheese, snack foods, breakfast cereal, butter and margarine. It is used as a body paint by native populations in Central and South America. In India, women often put it, under the name sindoor, on their hairline to indicate that they are married.|$|E
5000|$|Sotanghon - A {{noodle soup}} that {{features}} cellophane noodles, chicken and vegetables. The broth is slightly oily as garlic and onion are sauteed and chicken meat browned before the broth is added. <b>Annato</b> {{is added to}} give it a distinct orange color.|$|E

Add some more potatoes, milk, salt, pepper and finely chopped coriander.|$|E
50|$|Chicken inasal, {{commonly}} known as Inasal, is a local variant roast chicken marinated {{in a mixture of}} lime, pepper, vinegar and <b>annato</b> then grilled over hot coals while basted with the marinade. It is served with rice, vinegar (sinamak* or white vinegar) and soy sauce. A common dish in the Negros Island Region and Western Visayas, it is a popular specialty in the city of Bacolod, as well as in neighboring cities and towns of Negros Occidental. Many restaurant chains are famous for serving inasal like Bacolod Chicken Inasal and Mang Inasal, which originated in Iloilo City.|$|E
5000|$|The dyeing of kippers was {{introduced}} as an economy measure in the First World War by avoiding {{the need for}} the long smoking processes. This allowed the kippers to be sold quickly, easily and for a substantially greater profit. Kippers were originally dyed using a coal tar dye called Brown FK (the FK is an abbreviation of [...] "For Kippers"), Kipper Brown or Kipper Dye. Today, kippers are usually brine dyed using a natural <b>annato</b> dye, giving the fish a deeper orange/yellow colour. European Community legislation limits the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of Brown FK to 0.15 mg/kg. Not all fish caught are suitable for the dyeing process, with mature fish more readily sought, because the density of their flesh improves the absorption of the dye. An orange kipper is a kipper that has been dyed orange.|$|E
50|$|Men of this {{ethnic group}} are easily {{distinguishable}} for an elaborate head decoration that they style by shaving the temporal areas {{of their heads}} and shaping the remaining hair into a helmet-like feature {{with a mixture of}} grease and <b>annato</b> sap/seeds which achiote. This tradition {{is believed to have been}} a paliative measure from a time when the Tsachila's were exposed to the ravages of Smallpox. A Tsáchila Shaman asked a Spirit to guide them to a cure by ceremony and prayer. They were guided to an Achiote bush. They covered themselves completely with the red juices of the seed-pods and after a few days the mortality in the group was drastically reduced. They are forever grateful to this plant for the protection that it offered to the entire community from Smallpox. The shape of their hair style is fashioned to look like the seed pods.|$|E
50|$|The {{mining sector}} {{represents}} 14% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the State, originated {{mainly from the}} extraction of iron, bauxite, manganese, limestone and tin, as well as gold, until recently extracted {{from one of the}} largest mines of recent history: Serra Pelada. The economy of Pará is based also on the extraction of vegetation, on agriculture and cattle raising; thanks to the rich soil and the important hydrographic basin - boats are the main means of transport in the region. Guaraná, a tree from which a powder is produced and used as a stimulant; and <b>annato</b> seeds, a fruit used for cooking, as a sunscreen and also for dye extraction. Marajó - the biggest fluvial-maritime island in the world, with an area of 50000 km2. Its territory has one of the largest mining areas in the country, located in the Carajás Mountains, a mining province where the Ferro Carajás Project is based, from Companhia Vale do Rio Doce. The complex produced 296 million metric tons of iron ore in 2007, exporting the product to many countries, among them Japan, Germany, Italy, France and Spain.|$|E
50|$|Masaya {{boasts a}} varied culinary {{tradition}} based on pre-Columbian recipes. However, {{the most famous}} Masayan dishes are Nacatamal, Vaho, and yucca. Nacatamal, is a giant tamal so it's a full meal on its own right. Nacatamals are made of corn flour sprinkled with <b>annato</b> and salt, and mixed with pork, bacon, a bit of rice, potato slices, onions, tomatoes, green peppers, mint, Congo chilis, and prunes. Then everything is covered in plantain leaves, tied up with ropes, and boiled {{for a couple of}} hours on a giant pot. Due to their large size, Nacatamals are normally eaten at breakfast or supper with a loaf of bread and black coffee to help with digestion. Now, Vaho is another heavy, hearty meal. So it is normally eaten at lunch to allow for digestion the rest of the day. It consists of thick, long slices of cecina (salted, dried beef) marinated in sour orange juice. Then, the cecina is mixed with yucca, green plantains, ripe plantains, tomatoes, onions, garlic, cabbage, and placed on a pot with the interior walls covered in plantain leaves. Then, everything's cover up with the same leaves and a lid, and steam-cooked very slowly. Vaho is eaten with a side of big, thick Nicaraguan tortillas, and a light natural fruit drink like linaza, chía, or maracuyá. Yucca is a tuber with brown, scaly skin and a pure white flesh. It can be boiled, steamed, fried, or broiled and used for different dishes like Vigorón which is boiled yucca, topped with sweet-and-sour Nicaraguan salad made of cabbage cut into strips, diced tomatoes, onions, green currants, Congo chilis, vinegar, and salt.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the nutritional value of elephant-grass silages containing <b>annato</b> byproduct. Twenty intact rams were distributed in a complete randomized block design with five diets (0; 4; 8; 12 and 16 % <b>annato</b> byproduct in the silage) and four replications and used to estimate the intake, apparent nutrient digestibility, content of total digestible nutrients and nitrogen balance. The addition of <b>annato</b> byproduct raised the intakes of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), ether extract (EE), total carbohydrates (TC), non-fibrous carbohydrates (NFC) and total digestible nutrients (TDN), in body weight (%BW) and in metabolic weight (g kg- 1 BW 0. 75). The digestibilities of DM (55. 95 %), OM (58. 19 %), CP (45. 34 %), NDF (52. 79 %), ADF (45. 79 %), EE (34. 96 %) and NFC (99. 86 %) were not influenced by the addition of <b>annato</b> byproduct. The inclusion of <b>annato</b> byproduct in elephant-grass silage increased digestibility of total carbohydrates, the TDN content and the nitrogen balance. The aditions of <b>annato</b> byproduct at levels up to 16 % of the elephant grass silage natural matter improves nutrient intake and nitrogen balance...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of the inclusion of <b>annato</b> (Bixa orellana L.) and turmeric (Turmeric longa L.) in layer feeds on live performance, egg quality, and yolk pigmentation and depigmentation time. A number of 144 layers were distributed in a completely randomized experimental design, with four treatments with six replicates of six birds each. In the basal diet, sorghum replaced 50 % of corn, and was supplemented or not with natural pigments to composse the following treatments: Control (0 % pigments), AS (2. 0 % <b>annato),</b> TR (2 % turmeric) and ASTR (1 % <b>annato</b> and 1 % turmeric). Egg weight (g), egg production (%), egg mass (%), feed intake (g), feed conversion ratio (kg/dz and kg/kg) and mortality were evaluated. The following egg quality parameters were evaluated: specific gravity (SG); yolk, albumen, and eggshell percentages, and yolk color. The treatments did not influence layer performance or egg quality parameters, except for egg production and yolk color. The dietary inclusion of 1 % turmeric root and 1 % <b>annato</b> seed promoted higher egg production. Diets containing <b>annato</b> resulted in more saturated, more intense, and redder yolk color, with increasing pigment deposition after day 10, with maximum values obtained on day 28. Dried turmeric root did not promote good yolk pigmentation, resulting in higher presence of white in the yolk, which was stabilized on day 4. Three days after pigments were withdrawn from the feeds, yolk color faded in the treatments with <b>annato</b> inclusion...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the nutritional value of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum, Schum.) silages with the addition of 0; 4; 8; 12 and 16 % of the by-product from SPU <b>annato</b> (Bixa orellana, L.) based on natural matter. A complete random design was used with four replications. The nutritional composition, pH, ammonical nitrogen and lactic, acetic, propyonic and butyric acids were determined. Levels of <b>annato</b> by-product had an increasingly linear effect on contents of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, ether extract, non-fibrous carbohydrates, propionic acid and ammonical nitrogen. The insoluble nitrogen contents in detergent and acid detergent, calculated on the percentage of total nitrogen and lactic, acetic and butyric acids were not altered by adding the <b>annato</b> by product. The annatto by-product improves the bromatological characteristics of the silages and it can be added in levels up to 16 % of the natural matter at the moment of elephant grass ensilage...|$|E
30|$|In 1997, antocyanins {{extracted}} from blackberries gave a conversion efficiency of 0.56 % [268]. The roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa containing anthocyanin) flowers and papaw (Carica papaya containing chlorophyll) leaves {{were also investigated}} as natural sensitizers for DSSCs. Eli et al. sensitized TiO 2 photoelectrode with roselle extract (η[*]=[*] 0.046 %) and papaw leaves (η[*]=[*] 0.022 %), respectively and found better efficiency for roselle extract-sensitized cell because of the broader absorption of the roselle extract onto TiO 2 [278]. Tannins have also been attracted as a sensitizer in DSSCs due to their photochemical stability. DSSCs using natural dyes tannins and other polyphenols ({{extracted from}} Ceylon black tea) have given photocurrents of up to 8  mAcm−[*] 2 [168]. Haryanto et al. fabricated a DSSC using <b>annato</b> seeds (Bixa orellana Linn) as a sensitizer [279]. They demonstrated VOC and JSC for 30  g, 40  g, and 50  g as 0.4000  V, 0.4251  V, and 0.4502  V and 0.000074  A, 0.000458  A, and 0.000857  A, respectively. The efficiencies of the fabricated solar cells using <b>annato</b> seeds as a sensitizer for each varying mass were 0.00799 %, 0.01237 %, and 0.05696 %. They observed 328 – 515  nm wavelength range for <b>annato</b> seeds {{with the help of}} a UV-vis spectrometer. Hemalatha et al. reported a PCE of 0.22 % for the Kerria japonica carotenoid dye-sensitized solar cells in 2012 [280].|$|E
40|$|Study on {{the soil}} {{physical}} and hydrological characteristics under monoculture (cupuacu, pupunha) and an agroforestry systems (cupuacu + pupunha + urucu (<b>annato)</b> + castanha-do-Para (Brazil nut) with a cover crop of pueraria, in Manaus-AM (Brasil). The investigated soil showed an unusual behavior: the hydraulic conductivty was high close to and at saturation as it is commonly found in sady soils; however, at high soil water suction, it can retain large amounts of water which is a typical characteristics for clayey soils. This phenomenon may explained to the particle size distribuition (predominatly clay) and its strong aggregation. The sustainability of this soil is related with the stability of its aggregation, therefore the flocculation index {{may be a good}} parameter to evaluate its physical stability. 200...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{preparations}} of natural colours from vegetable, insect and algae sources are presently used in various foods, {{although many of}} them have not been evaluated in relation to their safety of use. In evaluating the toxicity of food additives the concept of the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) has been used to provide an indication of safety for use and to enable regulatory authorities to take adequate legislative measures for their control. This paper will focus on the principles for the safety assessment of food additives, with emphasis on the guidelines that have been established by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants (JECFA) for evaluating natural food colours. Recent data on the potential intake of <b>annato</b> extracts in Brazil and current aspects of regulation of food colours at the level of MERCOSUR will also be presented...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the nitrogen dynamics and the fate of applied nitrogen fertilizer in the soil-plant system of a mixed cropping system consisting of peach palm, cupuacu, urucu, and Brazil nut, in the Manaus-AM (Brasil). According the results, <b>annato,</b> cupuacu and peach palm seemed to take up more than 90 % of th incorporated nitrogen fertilizer under their own canopy. However, Brazil nut took up more than 70 % of the fertilized nitrogen from the fertilized areas under the canopies of the neighboring trees (peach palm: 40 %, annato: 25 %, cupuacu: 8 %) two weeks of the fertilizer application. At the end of the rainy season, Brazil nut even took up more than 80 % from underneath neighboring trees crops (peach palm: 42 %, annato: 36 %, cupuacu: 6 %). Furthemrmore, peach palm and Brazil nut were better able than the other two trees in reducing nutrient leaching due to their deep root system. 200...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The sc-CO 2 {{extraction}} of <b>annato</b> pigment from seed, piperine from black pepper corns and caffeine from coffee beans {{was shown to}} be feasible, yielding extracts comparable to those obtainable by solvent extraction. A principal feature of the investigation was that it revealed the contribution of quite a few variables not normally considered {{to have a major}} influence on sc-CO 2 botanical extraction. One of these is the natural moisture and light oil content of the plant material that act like internal cosolvents influencing the solvent characteristics of sc- CO 2 in a similar way as an added external cosolvent adjusts the polarity of the fluid. The extraction data were processed by linear regression analysis and goal seek statistics available in a commercial software package. It offered the possibility to predict the outcome of an extraction for a moderate change in one parameter while all others are kept constant. The regression fit, however, was not based on real process modelling but rather on an algebraic summation of the contribution of different variables, thus preventing statistical weighting to be applied to the different parameters. The extractions were performed on both micro and pilot plant scale and thereby demonstrated the ability to upscale supercritical work. The mechanism of botanical extraction by sc-CO 2 was shown to be principally governed by dissolution of a desired substance by virtue' of the density and thus the solvent strength of the fluid and by the magnitude of the corresponding activation energy. This suggests that the extraction process is chemical in nature. Master...|$|E
