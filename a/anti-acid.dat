40|$|Background: Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is {{a common}} {{complaint}} of sulphur mustard (SM) -exposed subjects. Routine treatments such as proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), H 2 -blockers and <b>anti-acids</b> cannot control GERD symptoms completely. Aloe vera is a medicinal plant that {{has been shown to}} reduce gastric acid secretion. The efficacy of pantoprazole with or without A. Vera juice in alleviating GERD symptoms was investigated in SM-exposed subjects. Methods: Male patients with a history of SM exposure and diagnosed GERD were enrolled and assigned to treatment with pantoprazole (40 mg before breakfast) plus A. vera syrup (5 mL bid before breakfast and at bedtime) (n= 44), or pantoprazole alone (40 mg before breakfast) (n= 41) for a period of 6 weeks. GERD symptoms were assessed at baseline and weeks 3 and 6 of study using the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) questionnaire. Results: Seventy-five patients (n= 38 and 37 in the A. vera + pantoprazloe and pantoprazole group, respectively) completed the study. No significant difference was found between the groups regarding demographic characteristics and baseline RSI score (p> 0. 05). A decreasing trend in RSI score was observed in both groups by the 3 rd and 6 th week of study (p< 0. 001). There was a greater reduction of RSI score in the A. vera + pantoprazloe versus pantoprazole group (p< 0. 001). There was no report of any side effects from A. vera during the course of trial. Conclusion: Findings of the present study suggested a significant improvement in the severity of GERD symptoms in SM-exposed subjects following addition of A. Vera to pantoprazole...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionInpatients in {{neurological}} rehabilitation {{units are}} often polymedicated. This polypharmacy {{is at risk}} of adverse events. It justifies the analysis of prescriptions by a pharmacist. The objective is to describe drug-related problems detected by pharmacist, pharmaceutical interventions (PI) performed and PI clinical impact {{over a period of}} 1 year. MethodsThe computerized prescriptions of 165 beds were analyzed by one pharmacist and one resident pharmacist once a week based on the methodology of the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy. Detected drug related problems and proposed PI were collected. Their clinical impact was evaluated by two physicians and two hospital pharmacists independently, according Hatoum 1988 [1]: zero impact (âˆ’), significant (+), highly significant (++), lifesaving (+++). ResultsFour thousand two hundred and twenty-eight prescriptions resulted in 999 PI (24 %) and 788 accepted by physicians (79 %). The most involved drugs were: analgesics/anti-inflammatory drugs (25 %), <b>anti-acids</b> (20 %), psychotropic drugs (17 %) and anti-infectives (14 %). The main problems found were: no clinical indication (26 %), non-conformity with guidelines (16 %) and supra or infratherapeutic dose (15 %). Most common suggestions (PI) were drug discontinuation (33 %) and dose adjustment (22 %). After excluding IP only having an economic impact, 842 IP were evaluated in a clinical point of view. They concerned mainly: antiacids (n= 198), analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs (n= 170), psychotropic drugs (n= 136), anti-infectives (n= 110) and anticoagulants (n= 76). The evaluations were: no impact (n= 96); significant (n= 574) very significant (n= 169); lifesaving (n= 3). These 3 PI were related anticoagulants. Drugs with a great number of IP (++) were: anticoagulants (60 %), intravenous electrolytes (43 %), anti-infectives (37 %) and analgesics/anti-inflammatory drugs (24 %). Physicians have found a large number of PI (++) concerning anti-infectives compared pharmacists (43 % versus 30 %). Conversely, pharmacists felt more PI (++) involving intravenous electrolytes (71 % versus 15 %) and psychotropic drugs (21 % versus 8 %). ConclusionPharmacists detected many drug-related problems during analysis of prescriptions. Their potential adverse clinical consequences are supported by a high rate of acceptance, objectivized by prescription modification...|$|R

40|$|Background Abnormal acid {{gastro-oesophageal}} reflux {{is common in}} patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and is considered {{a risk factor for}} development of IPF. Retrospective studies have shown improved outcomes in patients given <b>anti-acid</b> treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between <b>anti-acid</b> treatment and disease progression in IPF. Methods In an analysis of data from three randomised controlled trials, we identifi ed patients with IPF assigned to receive placebo. Case report forms had been designed to prospectively obtain data about diagnosis and treatment of abnormal acid gastro-oesophageal refl ux in each trial. The primary outcome was estimated change in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 30 weeks (mean follow-up) in patients who were and were not using a proton-pump inhibitor or histamine-receptor- 2 (H 2) blocker. Findings Of the 242 patients randomly assigned to the placebo groups of the three trials, 124 (51 %) were taking a proton-pump inhibitor or H 2 blocker at enrolment. After adjustment for sex, baseline FVC as a percentage of predicted, and baseline diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide as a percentage of predicted, patients taking <b>anti-acid</b> treatment at baseline had a smaller decrease in FVC at 30 weeks (- 0. 06 L, 95 % CI - 0. 11 to - 0. 01) than did those not taking <b>anti-acid</b> treatment (- 0. 12 L, - 0. 17 to - 0. 08; difference 0. 07 L, 95 % CI 0 - 0. 14; p= 0. 05).

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antioxidant activty and <b>anti-acid</b> property of Acalypha wilkesiana foliage extract. Materials and Methods: Hot and cold aqueous extracts were prepared from healthy leaves of A. wilkesiana. Free radical scavenging activity and H +, K + -ATPase inhibition activities of aqueous foliage extracts was screened by in vitro models. Statistical Analysis Used: All experiments were performed in triplicate and results are expressed as mean Â± SEM. Results: A. wilkesiana hot aqueous extract (AWHE) showed significant antioxidants and free radical scavenging activity. Further, AWHE has shown a potent H +, K + -ATPase inhibitory activity (IC 50 : 51. 5 Â± 0. 28 Î¼g/ml) when compare to standard proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (56. 2 Â± 0. 64 Î¼g/ml); however, latter activity is equal to A. wilkesiana cold aqueous extract (AWCE). Quantitative analysis of AWHE has revealed more content of phenols and flavonoids; this is found to be the reason for good antioxidant activity over AWCE. Molecular docking was carried out against H +, K + -ATPase enzyme crystal structure to validate the <b>anti-acid</b> activity of A. wilkesiana major phytochemicals.

40|$|Recently, we have {{demonstrated}} that anti-ulcer drugs, such as H 2 -receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors, promote the development of immediate type food allergy toward digestionlabile proteins in mice. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the allergological relevance of these findings in humans. In an observational cohort study, we screened 152 adult patients from a gastroenterological outpatient clinic with negative case histories for atopy or allergy, who were medicated with H 2 -receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors for 3 months. IgE reactivities to food allergens before and after 3 months of <b>anti-acid</b> treatment were compared serologically. Ten percent of the patients showed a boost of preexisting IgE antibodies and 15 % de novo IgE formation toward numerous digestion-labile dietary compounds, like milk, potato, celery, carrots, apple, orange, wheat, and rye flour.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the H 2 {{blockers}} cimetidine and ranitidine on drug induced damage to gastric cell monolayers has been evaluated in conditions independent of systemic factors and their <b>anti-acid</b> properties. Monolayers of mucous cells from a human cell line MKN 28, obtained from a human gastric adenocarcinoma, have been studied. Cell damage has been assessed qualitatively by trypan blue dye exclusion test and quantitatively by 51 Cr release assay. Cimetidine and ranitidine significantly protected cultured cells against damage induced by sodium taurocholate decreasing taurocholate induced 51 Cr release by 36 % (p less than 0. 001) and 28 % (p less than 0. 01), respectively. Cimetidine was also protective in concentrations lower than ranitidine. This protection was not prevented by the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin nor by the sulph-hydryl blocker N-ethylmaleimide. Incubation with cimetidine and ranitidine did not increase the production of PGE 2 by cultured cells nor did it affect the cellular level of sulph-hydryl compounds. Cimetidine and ranitidine did not afford protection against damage induced by indomethacin and ethanol. Cimetidine in a concentration of 10 4 M increased ethanol induced damage significantly. In conclusion (1) cimetidine and ranitidine protect gastric cells against taurocholate induced damage in vitro, independently of their <b>anti-acid</b> effect; (2) this protection is not mediated by prostaglandin E 2 or sulph-hydryl compounds; (3) cimetidine and ranitidine do not protect gastric cells against damage induced by indomethacin and ethanol...|$|E

O omeprazole, a potent acid inhibitor with prolong effects on gastric pH. Patients with gastric pH higher than 4 and active G. I bleeding were excluded from the study. The patients were given omeprazole in daily doses of 20 mg and 40 mg via nasogastric tube. Gastric pH was measured at 8. 00 A. M. about 30 min before each dose of omeprazole and thereafter every 8 hours for 3 days. In 10 patients receiving 20 mg omeprazole mean intragastric pH in-creased from 2. 6 Â± 0. 13 to 4. 28 Â± 0. 33 (p 4 in I. C. U. patients...|$|E
40|$|To {{adjust the}} {{properties}} of the macromolecular structure of cellulose, chemical modification can take place to find different applications. In the current study, cellulose was extracted from bagasse, where it was derivatized to carboxymethyl cellulose, and carbanilated cellulose. These two cellulose derivatives were further chemically modified in homogenous system by tosyl and trimethylsilylation to synthesize cellulose macromolecular derivatives, namely tosylcellulose derivatives and trimethylsilylcellulose derivatives. The compositional microstructure of the synthesized cellulose derivatives was investigated by 1 HNMR analysis, FT-IR and SEM. This study demonstrated that cellulose, cellulose derivatives and both tosyl and trimethylsilyl cellulose derivatives formed under homogeneous conditions can be evaluated as potential carriers for controlled release of <b>anti-acid</b> drugs. The release was investigated as a function of pH and time in various pH solutions, namely 2. 0, 3. 5 and 5. 0. The results indicated that the release is controlled by the type of the modified cellulose and thus it was concluded that modification is important for the use in slow drug release...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although {{many people}} {{discussed}} {{the strength and}} durability of concrete with natural sand in severe environment, few people investigated the mechanics performance of concrete with manufactured-sand under condition of freeze-thaw cycle, at present. Experimental studies on C 30 concrete with manufactured-sand were carried out under condition of freeze-thaw cycle, which based on the testing of raw material performance and concrete mix ration, in this paper. Comparative studies on the changing laws of the mass, strength and the relative dynamic elastic modulus of concrete were developed in three cases which were freeze-thaw cycle, freeze-thaw cycle and acid corrosion and freeze-thaw cycle and alkali corrosion. The test {{results showed that the}} mass, strength and the relative dynamic elastic modulus of concrete with manufactured-sand decreased evidently with the increasing of times of freeze-thaw cycle. The durability of acid and alkali-resistant of concrete with manufactured-sand was also remarkably weakened due to the action of freeze-thaw cycle. The capability of acid and alkali-resistant of the concrete was decreased with the increasing of times of freeze-thaw cycle and the <b>anti-acid</b> capability was decreased more seriously...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 17 -year-old male {{admitted}} to our academic hospital with massive rectal bleeding. Since childhood he had reported recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and had two exploratory laparotomies 5 and 2 years previously. An emergency abdominal computed tomography scan, gastroscopy and colonoscopy, performed after hemodynamic stabilization, were considered normal. High-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy was initiated and bleeding stopped spontaneously. Two other massive rectal bleeds occurred 8 h after each cessation of PPI which led to a hemostatic laparotomy after negative gastroscopy and small bowel capsule endoscopy. This showed long tubular duplication of the right colon, with fresh blood in the duplicated colon. Obscure lower gastrointestinal bleeding is a difficult medical situation and potentially life-threatening. The presence of ulcerated ectopic gastric mucosa in the colonic duplication explains the partial efficacy of PPI therapy. Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding responding to empiric <b>anti-acid</b> therapy should probably evoke the diagnosis of bleeding ectopic gastric mucosa such as Meckel&#x 2019;s diverticulum or gastrointestinal duplication, and gastroenterologists should be aware of this potential medical situation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} prevalence, {{incidence and}} {{risk factors of}} colonization by extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriacae (ESBLE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in aged subjects admitted to an acute geriatric unit at a teaching hospital. METHODS: During 12 months, 337 patients were screened by nasal, oropharyngeal, groin, axillary and rectal swabs upon admission and at discharge. RESULTS: The prevalence of ESBLE, MRSA and VRE carriage upon admission was 11. 6 %, 7. 5 % and 0. 6 %, respectively. The incidence density of ESBLE and MRSA carriage was respectively of 1. 77 and 2. 40 new cases for 1000 patient-days. No cases of VRE acquisition were found. Risk factors for ESBLE colonization on admission were: multiple contacts with the hospital within the previous year, chronic catheter use and {{a high level of}} dependency. For MRSA, risk factors were: chronic wounds, <b>anti-acid</b> use and a high level of dependency. CONCLUSION: This study shows a high prevalence of asymptomatic colonization of ESBL-producing Escherichiacoli in patients admitted to an acute geriatric ward, as high as MRSA carriage. A low functional status is a common risk factor both for ESBLE and for MRSA colonization and it highlights the need to reinforce infection control measures...|$|E
