40|$|Interest {{in various}} forms of reduced tillage is {{steadily}} increasing, in line with today’s high machinery and fuel costs and increasing awareness of harmful effects of soil compaction. Reduced tillage in its various forms does, however, place higher proportions of coarse aggregates and greater quantities of plant residues. In the summer of 1995, the Väderstad Concorde underwent evaluation in field trials. The Väderstad Concorde is essentially a seedbed harrow with a seed hopper installed above it. The seed is fed pneumatically, with each harrow tine functioning as a seed coulter. Depth control is achieved using a wheel which follows the contour of the land, transmitting control signals to the hydraulics unit to raise or lower the machine as required. The Concorde was developed to allow farmers {{to reduce the number}} of machinery passes required. The trails encompassed spring drilling (With different numbers of harrow passes and various drilling depth), and involved studies of the bottom of the drill and the seedbed itself to investigate seed placement, the size distribution of aggregates and the moisture content of the bottom of the drill and the rest of the seedbed. During the growing season there followed monitoring of the number of plants, shoots (tillers) and ears, and of yields. The number of weeds at the various stages of growth was also investigated. Another aspect of these trials involved drilling nitrogen fertilizer amongst growing <b>autumn</b> <b>wheat</b> in the spring (drilled both along and across the direction of seed drilling). In spring drilling, an implement with Crosskill rollers was used after the Concorde. The result showed that seed placement after the Concorde in spring drilling was good, with, at lowest, 96 % of seed placed at the bottom of the drill. The number of plants per square metre after the Concorde was higher where no prior harrowing had taken place. This indicates that harrowing prior to drilling does not improve the result, provided that the field has been harrowed in the autumn or levelled. In the trail crops which had not been harrowed prior to drilling, pressure on the crop from weeds was lower than in the crops which had been harrowed twice before drilling. The harvest result also indicated that a reduced number of harrow passes before drilling with Concorde produced increased yields. Drilling nitrogen fertiliser in <b>autumn</b> <b>wheat</b> produced increased yields when compared with topdressing, in spite of the fact that a great deal of precipitation fell on the following night. It is difficult to determine whether the increased yield was a result of the tillage effect or the placement of the fertiliser. Even greater effects are probably to be expected if rain does not fall on the crop immediately after the fertiliser is drilled in this way...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorous losses with {{surface runoff}} are {{affected}} by how the soil is cultivated. In a plot study, located in central Sweden, eight different treatments were; conventional autumn plowing, spring plowing with and without catch crop, no tillage, deep cultivation (40 cm), direct drilling, ley alternating with <b>autumn</b> <b>wheat,</b> and addition of organic material. The two spring-plowed treatments had the lowest losses of total phosphorous; the catch crop did not develop sufficiently to affect the losses. The largest losses were from the autumn-plowed and the deep-cultivated plots, beeing almost twice those of the spring-plowed plots. The loss of phosphate-phosphorous were largest from the direct-drilled plot, where it contributed {{with half of the}} loss, compared to 10 - 20 % in the other treatments. The treatments that gave the best ratio between phosphorous loss and harvest were the two spring-plowed plots and the one with addition of organic matter. [...] - As a part of nation-wide monitoring of the impact of agriculture on the aquatic system, total and dissolved phosphorus (P) transport was measured from eleven subsurface drained fields in Sweden between 1977 - 1998. The P leaching revealed marked spatial variation depending on soil type, P soil status and other factors. Notably leaching from three of the fields together accounted for another 19 %, while leaching from the other four fields was more or less negligible. During the investigation period a surplus of P added to the soil during the initial years was transformed to a slight underbalance of P. Leaching from most fields was found to be relatively constant, but two fields with highest P losses showed increasing trend during the 1970 and 1980. On average 0, 4 kg/ha and year leached from all fields during the entire period. This figure may have been an underestimation, especially on clay soils, depending on the sampling technique. [...] A database was set up covering analysis of pesticides in surface water and groundwater during the period January 1985 to June 1999. The data were obtained from more than 4000 water samples collected primarly by Swedish municipalities. Many of these samples were taken because either problems were expected, or pesticides had been detected earlier at the particular site. Pesticides were found in drinking water from 15 municipalities. The most frequently occurring pesticide found in drinking water was a metabolite from the herbicide dichlobenil; i. e. 2, 6 -dichlorobenzamide (abbreviated BAM). The greatest number of water localities containing pesticides was found in Skåne, the county with the highest number of investigations but also the county with the most intensive use of pesticides. The substances most often detected in surface water, apart from BAM were MCPA, atrazine, dichlorprop and mecoprop, and the median concentrations of detection were in the range 0. 1 - 0. 3 µg/l. An analytical method to detect glyphosate in water was developed in 1997, whereafter glyphosate was detected quite frequently in surface water samples. An additional 13 substances were recovered fairly frequently, and another 42 pesticides were occasionaly detected. There were indications that the concentrations of pesticides in surface water decreased during the period, though this could not be statistically demonstrated...|$|E

50|$|The most {{effective}} and widely used management strategy for common bunt is to treat seed with fungicide before planting. According to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, it is recommended to buy certified, fungicide-treated seed or have it cleaned and treated by a commercial seed conditioner. There are ways that farmers can manipulate {{the severity of the}} infection to a certain extent. For example, they can plant the seed when the soil temperature is higher than what is ideal for teliospore germination, e.g., above 68 °F. For winter wheat this means planting in early fall and for spring wheat planting in late spring. This tactic can reduce the amount of smut that occurs, but it typically does not completely eliminate the disease. Typically, smut poses more of a problem in winter wheat than in spring <b>wheat</b> because in <b>autumn,</b> when winter <b>wheat</b> is planted, there is a longer period of more favorable temperatures for teliospore germination than compared to the planting season for spring wheat. There are no current wheat cultivars on the market with good resistance to common bunt.

The experiment was run parallel after grass clover (high N status) and oats (low N status). N uptake, soil mineral nitrogen (Nmin) and nitrate leaching of all stands were determined. Especially with winter wheat intercropping with catch crops increased N-uptake in autumn. In all stands forage rape and oats led to a higher N uptake than common vetch.

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of the {{monitoring}} carried out in three farms of the project MO. NA. CO. in order to verify the effectiveness of the cross-compliance standard 1. 1 c which obliges the farmer to the ‘Maintenance of farm channel networks and field convexity’ in order to ensure its efficiency and functionality in draining water. It was also examined the competitiveness gap induced to the agricultural enterprise by the application of the standard, that is to say the additional costs borne by the beneficiary of the single payment determined by cleaning farm collector channels. Effectiveness was determined by evaluating the degradation of soil structure at the end of winter, on flat fields  sown in <b>autumn</b> with winter <b>wheat,</b> in the two cases: a) Factual (channels along the field edges not clogged and no waterlogging present on the cultivated soil) b) Counterfactual (channels clogged and waterlogging present on the cultivated soil). The monitoring confirmed a positive effect of the adoption of this standard on predisposing soil to the ideal conditions for the maintenance of the structure. Despite the statistical evidence found, it must be said that the change in the surface roughness factor was so small as not to take any practical significance in order to affirm that the functional maintenance of collectors channels have been effective in reducing erosion. Overall, the soils were unstructured and crusted {{at the end of the}} observation period. Indexes Icli, NTU, and DS show a structural fragility from medium to high for soils of the three monitoring farms. This explains the lack of appreciable differences in the soil roughness parameter, especially in relation to   heavy rains and long waterlogging periods in the cropping years of monitoring. The competitiveness gap induced by the application of this standard, amounted to 19. 89 ±€ 6. 35 ha - 1 year - 1. Atmospheric emission of CO 2, was equal to 14. 53 ± 6. 62 kg ha - 1 year - 1. It is considered important to point out that at the present Annex II: ‘Rules of cross-compliance’ of Regulation (EU) No. 1306 / 2013 includes a BCAA not taking into account the environmental threats determined by waterlogging in cultivated land to soil, crops and to atmosphere, due to the possible production of greenhouse gases. As regards the infringement criteria to the standard it is suggested the introduction of the verification of the presence of convexity on cultivated fields in the plain. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to develop a}} clearer understanding of inter-relationships between climate variability and food security in New Zealand. It was considered important to both clarify crop-climate relationships and possible response options available to regional planners and individuals. This is particularly relevant {{in the context of a}} probable global climate warming. An empirical-statistical analysis of crop-climate interactions was carried out. This was followed by a more detailed agroclimate analysis of the Canterbury region, and an evaluation of one possible response option in the face of present, and possible future, climate variability and change. This involved a field based study of shelterbelt effects. The final part of the Thesis gives a tentative assessment of the possible impacts on agriculture in New Zealand of regional greenhouse warming scenarios. Monthly rainfall and mean temperature data were used for the crop-climate analyses. Adjustments for site changes were made where necessary and missing values estimated. Trend removal was performed on temperate grain and pipfruit yield time series. Quadratic, and in the case of pears linear, trend lines were fitted to the yield data. Analyses were performed on the residuals. No trend removal was carried out on stonefruit data. Principal component analysis, followed by stepwise multiple regression, showed the barley crop to be the most spatially responsive to climate of the three temperate grain crops examined. Wheat was intermediate in its response and oats the least spatially responsive. <b>Autumn</b> sown <b>wheat</b> showed a negative relationship with winter rainfall and spring temperature. The dominant result with oats and barley was a negative effect on yield of late spring to early summer temperatures. Analyses of national stonefruit data met with mixed success. Peaches and nectarines, although of the same species, gave different significant predictors. This was attributed to differences in weighting on the climate data, related to geographic distribution. The susceptibility of apricots to late frosts appeared to show through with this crop. Cherries showed a strongly negative relationship with rainfall at blossom and harvest time. The most significant predictor with plums was a positive relationship with May temperature. This was treated with scepticism. These results highlight the need for further detailed analysis of these crops at the district level. The limited district analyses of apple yields showed a graded response to rainfall. At the extremes, the wetter Auckland district showed predominantly negative responses and the drier Central Otago district showed positive responses. A negative relationship between apple yield and July temperature was found to be a climatic response from the Hawkes Bay district. This may be related to poor fruit set and flower quality, leading to low yields, as suggested by research in England. The dominant response apparent with pears, in earlier years, was a negative relationship with January temperature. This appears to have become less limiting and may be related to increased use of irrigation over this moisture sensitive period. As with stonefruit more detailed analyses, particularly at the district level are required. A spatial analysis of Canterbury plains climate confirmed that the climate of this region is relatively homogenous. However a general north/south division was apparent with the Rakaia river as a general 'dividing line. Closer analysis of rainfall data revealed that this north/south contrast is predominantly between the Christchurch area, influenced by Banks Peninsula, and South Canterbury, influenced by the narrow coastal strip and proximity to the foothills. Differences between these two areas are greater than similarities. Principal component analysis of Canterbury county wheat yields confirmed results from the weighted national and Canterbury district analyses. Waimate, in South Canterbury, proved to be anomalous in its yield response, which was consistent with the spatial analyses of rainfall and deficit day data. Drought in Canterbury was shown to become a regional phenomenon in the driest of the dry years, and to be persistent in these years. Correlation analysis between deficit day data and time series of detrended Canterbury district yield data, for temperate grains and pipfruit, showed a significant negative relationship between agricultural drought and yield. Analysis of shelter effects revealed a hierarchical classification of sites based on the site roughness parameter, z₀. The most exposed, reference, site was well representative of open plains conditions. The least exposed, highly sheltered, orchard site showed a high degree of "decoupling" from the regional environment. Mean temperatures were significantly higher in the three, more sheltered, remote sites as compared to the reference site. Maximum temperatures were significantly higher in the most sheltered sites. In all remote sites there were significant reductions in wind speed in relation to the reference site. Evapotranspiration, based on Penman estimates, was significantly lower in the two orchard sites. Priestley-Taylor estimates proved to be more conservative, attributed to the use of a constant not calibrated for different site conditions. It is speculated that these significant differences in site microclimate could lead to yield benefits in Canterbury, through greater water use efficiency. This could contribute significantly to mitigating the effects of non-periodic, but recurrent and persistent droughts in this region. The tentative assessment of agricultural impacts of a greenhouse warming drew from past climate analogue scenarios. The temperate grains showed slight to moderate yield reductions. It was suggested that Southland may increase in importance as a temperate grain growing district. Assessment of fruit crops was more speculative, as shown in the results. The east coast of the South Island and Central Otago could increase in importance for the growing of temperate fruit crops. From the Canterbury regional greenhouse scenario it would appear that in the future there will be greater potential for agricultural drought in this region. The results from the agroclimate analysis and field study of shelter effects are particularly relevant in this context. This Thesis highlights the considerable uncertainty that exists in the field of crop-climate analyses. Data bases need to be consolidated and more critical analyses made of possible response options, particularly in the face of a probable global climate warming...|$|R
40|$|Ukraine is {{the tenth}} largest wheat {{producer}} {{in the world}} but average yields are low, about 3 ton ha- 1. A better understanding of growth conditions and factors limiting yield is importantin developing strategies to increase grain yield. This Master’s thesis examined the conditions for winter wheat cultivation (Grain Alliance strategy) in Berezan in the Kiev region of northern Ukraine, and the potential to increase crop yields. The wheat cultivation in seven nearby fields in Berezan was compared with one reference field in Uppsala in Sweden. The effect of sowing date was studied by determining plant development and growth in fields with different sowing dates. The effect of fertilization level was also studied in these fields. In the sowing date trials, the factors plants per square meter in late autumn and spring, shoots per plant in late autumn and spring, and plant weight in late autumn were measured. The yield-forming factors ears m- 2, kernels per ear, grain size and grain yield were also measured. In the fertilization trials, only grain yield factors were measured. To determine the growing conditions the soil physical properties and water availability were measured. The development of the winter wheat was also simulated by a phenology model with data from local weather stations. The climate in Kiev is 3 - 5 ˚C warmer than for Uppsala during the period April-August. It results in more rapid plant development in Kiev compared with Uppsala and 4 - 5 weeks earlier maturity. Precipitation and evapotranspiration are higher in Kiev than in Uppsala. Soil conditions in the Kiev region are favourable, with good soil aeration and low bulk density combined with relatively high amounts of plant-available water. A normal year the amount of precipitation and soil water storage is adequate to supply the wheat with water and avoid drought on both the clay soil in the field in Uppsala and the silty loam in the fields in Kiev. The relatively high temperature and availability of water motivates a cultivation strategy with relatively high ear densities to achieve high yield, as ear size can be reduced by rapid plant development. If winter wheat is sown during the first 2 - 3 weeks of September there are good opportunities to use relatively low seed rates, as lower plant number can be compensated by tillering. If sowing is postponed quite high seed rates are justified. The early-sown winter wheat in this study had significantly greater biomass and tillering in <b>autumn</b> than late-sown <b>wheat.</b> Plant number was higher for late sowing dates, depending on higher seed rates. Both early- and late-sown wheat survived winter very well. Plant stand density was high in all the seven fields in Berezan, much higher than in the reference field in Uppsala. There was a large reduction of tillers in spring, but final number of ears was still relatively high. As variety and seed rates varied between trials with different sowing dates, {{it is not possible to}} claim significant effects of grain yield depending on sowing date. Kernel size was normal but ear size was relatively low, and was the yield factor with highest correlation to yield level in the different fields. Yield level was generally high, even in treatments with low fertilization, and yield increases for high fertilization rates (above 160 kg N ha- 1) were relatively low. This indicates quiteextensive mineralization from the soil. No significant difference in yield level was found between wheat fertilized with equal amounts of nitrogen applied in autumn and spring compared with spring only. From a crop perspective, nitrogen from fertilizer must be available at the beginning of stem jointing, when the need is highest. By dividing the fertilization into 2 - 3 application occasions from early spring to heading, it is possible to adjust the nitrogen rate to development and growth conditions to match stand requirements. The Grain Alliance cultivation strategy gave considerably higher winter wheat yield than the average for the Kiev region, probably due to more intensive management, with the crop not limited by fertilizer deficiency or plant protection problems. Using varieties that combine hardiness and high yield potential, establishing plant stands of sufficient density and performing field operations, for example sowing and fertilization, at the right time are issues to work with for further improvement of winter wheat yield in Ukraine...|$|R
