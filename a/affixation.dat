25|$|Gaulish verbs have {{present and}} future tenses; indicative, subjunctive, and {{imperative}} moods; and active and passive voices. Verbs show a number of innovations as well. The Indo-European s-aorist evolved into the Gaulish t-preterit, formed by merging an old 3rd personal singular imperfect ending -t- to a 3rd personal singular perfect ending -u or -e and subsequent <b>affixation</b> to all forms of the t-preterit tense. Similarly, the s-preterit is formed from the extension of -ss (originally from the third person singular) and the <b>affixation</b> of -it to the third person singular (to distinguish it as such).

The partial form copies {{on the initial}} consonant and inserts a high front vowel, while the full form copies the first consonant and vowel. Both types are then prefixed with o-. For example, -go 'buy' partially reduplicates to form ògigo 'buying,' and -bu 'carry' fully reduplicates to form òbubu 'carrying. Some other noun and verb forms also exhibit reduplication, but because the reduplicated forms are semantically unpredictable, reduplication in their case is not synchronically productive, and they are better described as separate lexical items.|$|E

40|$|Most of spell {{checkers}} and morphological analyzers {{of natural}} languages {{are based on}} the affixes (suffixes and prefixes) extraction. But there are some other languages which use another kind of word changes like infixes and circumfixes. An infix is an affix that is inserted within a root. or stem. A circumfix is an affix, a morpheme that is placed around another morpheme. Circumfixes contrast with prefixes, attached {{to the beginning of the}} words; suffixes, that are attached at the end; and infixes, inserted in the middle. This features are not implemented now in spellcheckers, and can give more puissance and facility to model more languages rules and <b>affixations.</b> This paper concerns Arabic language which uses internal word changes and has more affixes dependency, and diacritics (HARAKAT) which are ignored usually.

40|$|Dialect is a {{substandard}} form {{of language}} that generally associated with particular group of speaker in more isolated {{part of the}} world. Tengger people live in the isolated highland region in and around Bromo-Tengger-Semeru National Park in East Java. Tengger people are Javanese sub-community who have special characteristics of culture and language. In fact, the culture and language are different from Javanese. The specification of differences {{can be seen from}} their dialects, that their dialect is known as Java dialect Tengger. Focus of this research is to know dialect variation used by Tengger people in Javanese regional language especially in the form of vocabularies and sound patterns used. This research used descriptive qualitative method, because this research revealed the existence of dialect variations between the Javanese and Tengger people. The variations were in the vocabularies and sound patters that contained of differences. Data obtained from the informants who live in Tengger highland. The informants used in this research were selected by using the criteria of NORMs (Non-on Mobile Older Rural and Males) to obtain actual data. The data were collected by using observation and interview techniques. They were appropriate to the purpose and statement of the problem. The data of this research were analyzed qualitatively. The result of this research is there were some differences in the form of vocabularies and sound patterns used by Tengger people in Javanese regional language. And also, there were some variations of Tengger dialect in Javanese regional language in the phoneme, morpheme, and lexicon especially in the vocabularies and sound patterns used. The variations also happen in the form of <b>affixations.</b> The accent of Tengger dialect has unique characteristics in stressing of vowel, whether a vowel in the end of syllable pronounced long, also Tengger dialect has flat intonation in sentences used. It is concluded that factors that influence the diversity of languages and dialects Tengger regional Javanese language were external and internal.

25|$|The verbal {{morphology}} of Hurrian {{is extremely}} complex, {{but it is}} constructed only through the <b>affixation</b> of suffixes (indicated by '-') and clitics (indicated by '='). Hurrian clitics stand for unique words, but are attached to other words {{as though they were}} suffixes. Transitivity and intransitivity are clearly indicated in the morphology; only transitive verbs take endings that agree with the person and number of their subject. The direct object and intransitive subject, when they are not represented by an independent noun, are expressed through the use of clitics, or pronouns (see below). Moreover, suffixes can be added to the verb stem that modify its meaning, including valency-changing morphemes such as -an(n)-- (causative), -ant (applicative) and -ukar (reciprocative). The meanings of many such suffixes have yet to be decoded.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a grammar of Lha'alua (known as Saaroa), an Austronesian {{language}} of Taiwan. Lha'alua is spoken in Taoyuan Village and Kaochung Village, Taoyuan District, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. Lha'alua {{belongs to the}} morphological type of synthetic-agglutinating; usually a word consists of a largish number of morphemes (roots, affixes and clitics) {{but by and large}} morpheme boundaries are clear. The basic constituent order is V(pred) AO, if transitive, or V(pred) S(E), if intransitive. The bound pronoun is a core argument either in S function or in A function, whereas the independent pronoun is either a core argument in S (when topicalized), E, A or O function or a peripheral argument. Prefixation is productive, whereas other <b>affixations</b> are not. Reduplication is widely deployed. The two major word classes are verb and noun, with rich morphology marking. Despite some grammatical distinctions differentiating adjectival elements from dynamic verbs and noun, 'adjective' is not recognisable as an independent word class. Adjectival elements are treated as stative verbs in that they exhibit the same morphosyntactic properties. The basic constituent order is VAO, if transitive, or VS(E), if intransitive. The pronominal system consists of bound pronouns and independent pronouns. The bound pronoun is a core argument in S function or A function, whereas the independent pronoun is a core argument in S (when topicalized), E, A or O function. The bound pronouns can be divided into two sets: nominative pronouns, marking arguments in S function, and genitive pronouns, marking arguments in A function and possessor function. The case system includes core, oblique and genitive. The core case covers arguments in S, A and O functions. The oblique case marks extended arguments (i. e. E function) and peripheral arguments, e. g. location. The genitive case is used to encode possessor function. There are three verbal clause patterns in Lha'alua: (i) Pattern 1 : monovalent intransitive clauses, (ii) Pattern 2 : bivalent intransitive clauses and (iii) Pattern 3 : (a) bivalent transitive clauses and (b) bivalent applicative clauses. (i) and (ii) take Actor voice (AV), marked by um-/ /u-/m-/ø-; (iiia) takes patient voice (PV), marked by -a/-ø; (iiib) takes locative voice (LV), marked by -a(na) /-i/-ani. The definiteness effect plays a role in determining the manifestation of voice in an independent clause, and the manifestation of voice in independent clauses plays a role in determining grammatical subjects. The thesis consists of 10 chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the people, the language, and some ethnographic notes of Lha'alua. Chapter 2 describes phonology and morphophonology. Chapter 3 discusses word classes, including nouns and subclasses of nouns, verbs and subclasses of verbs, adjectives and subclasses of adjectives, numerals, closed classes of shifters, and closed grammatical systems. Chapter 4 deals with morphological units and morphological processes. Chapter 5 describes nominal morphology, including common nouns, kinship terms, person names, family names, locative nouns, and temporal nouns. Chapter 6 describes verbal morphology, including verb classification, non-spatial setting, voice, imperative, negation, third person agreement marking and lexical prefix copying. Chapter 7 addresses transitivity and grammatical relations, including constituent order, construction markers, personal pronouns and agreement forms. Chapter 8 discusses clause types, including independent clauses (verbal, nominal, existential, possessive, and locative) and dependent clauses (relative, adverbial, and complementation strategies). Chapter 9 deals with speech act distinctions, including interrogative, imperative, and declarative sentences. Chapter 10 addresses numerals and the counting system...|$|R
