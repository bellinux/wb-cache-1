5|$|In 1985, US218 was {{bypassed}} around Iowa City and Coralville, joining I-380 at the I-80 interchange. US218 to Cedar Rapids {{was replaced}} by Iowa 965. In the early 1990s, most of I-380 was designated {{as part of the}} <b>Avenue</b> <b>of</b> the Saints corridor, which connects St. Louis, Missouri, to St. Paul, Minnesota. <b>Avenue</b> <b>of</b> the Saints route markers were erected along the route the next year. In August 2001, the <b>Avenue</b> <b>of</b> the Saints in Iowa was given a single designation, Iowa27, to facilitate following the route through the state.|$|E
5|$|A {{landscaped}} {{park with}} lakes and statues {{was laid out}} around the house, and the drive to the house was along a semicircular <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> trees. Sir Edward died in 1766. Sir Gregory Page-Turner, 3rd Baronet considered the house too large, so in 1767 he sought to demolish part of it to create a smaller house. This proved impossible so in 1768 he had the entire house demolished.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division than they did, and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel's stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. German documents and prisoners of war confirmed that the German commanders had believed in the existence of the decoy unit, and had not anticipated the true <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> attack. Bertram had succeeded in all its objectives.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Ace Books {{became a major}} {{division}} of the old publisher, Charter Communications, which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 <b>Avenue</b> <b>of</b> the Americas, in New York City. In 1972, Ace was acquired by Grosset & Dunlap, and in 1982, Grosset & Dunlap was in turn acquired by G.P. Putnam's Sons. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset & Dunlap empire by this time. Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.|$|E
5|$|Construction of I-380 took 12 {{years to}} complete, ending in 1985. After the interstate opened, US218 was moved onto the new freeway. In the 1990s, the I-380 {{corridor}} {{was selected as}} part of the <b>Avenue</b> <b>of</b> the Saints corridor, which Iowa designated as Iowa Highway 27 in 2001. I-380 has been affected by two major floods, the Great Flood of 1993 and the Iowa flood of 2008, both of which closed the road at the Iowa River for two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{to better}} {{understand}} the mechanisms of sebum production are underway. The aim of this research is to develop medications that target and interfere with the hormones that are known to increase sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). Additional sebum-lowering medications being researched include topical antiandrogens and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators. Another <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> early-stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin's hair follicles in order to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance.|$|E
5|$|Land {{immediately}} {{south of}} the priory {{was used by the}} Chaloners for formal gardens attached to Old Gisborough Hall. In the early 18th century they planted an oval-shaped double <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> trees, the Monks' Walk, where stonework recovered from mid-19th century excavations was deposited. In between the trees was a manicured lawn used to hold musical and theatrical productions. The Monks' Walk fell into disuse and became overgrown but is under restoration by the Gisborough Priory Project.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Highway Administration {{approved}} the Georgetown Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2014. As with the Ellendale area, DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 along its present alignment from south of <b>Avenue</b> <b>of</b> Honor north of Millsboro to south of Redden Road. Interchanges are planned near Piney Grove Road and <b>Avenue</b> <b>of</b> Honor north of Millsboro; at Governor Stockley Road at Stockley; near Speedway Road, Alms House Road, and Kruger Road north of Stockley; at Shortly Road and South Bedford Street {{on the southern}} edge of Georgetown; at Arrow Safety Road in Georgetown; at US 9 in Georgetown; at DE 18 and DE 404 in Georgetown; and at Wilson Road north of Georgetown. The U.S. Highway's intersection with DE 18 and DE 404 has the highest crash rate and the highest level of traffic congestion in the study area, so that intersection will be replaced with an interchange first. US 113 will be expanded to six lanes throughout the corridor, and right-in/right-out access to adjoining businesses would be maintained, with efforts {{to reduce the number of}} contact points.|$|E
40|$|This study {{summarizes}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> trees in urban street canyons on traffic pollutant dispersion. We describe various wind-tunnel experiments with different tree-avenue models {{in combination with}} variations in street-canyon aspect ratio W/H (with W the street-canyon width and H the building height) and approaching wind direction. Compared to tree-free street canyons, in general, higher pollutant concentrations are found. <b>Avenues</b> <b>of</b> trees do not suppress canyon vortices, although the air ventilation in canyons is hindered significantly. For a perpendicular wind direction, increases in wall-average and wall-maximum concentrations at the leeward canyon wall and decreases in wall-average concentrations at the windward wall are found. For oblique and perpendicular wind directions, increases at both canyon walls are obtained. The strongest effects <b>of</b> <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> trees on traffic pollutant dispersion are observed for oblique wind directions for which also the largest concentrations at the canyon walls are found. Thus, the prevailing assumption that attributes the most harmful dispersion conditions to a perpendicular wind direction does not hold for street canyons with <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> trees. Furthermore, following dimensional analysis, {{an estimate of the}} normalized wall-maximum traffic pollutant concentration in street canyons with <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> trees is derived...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} these circles {{were built in the}} area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being smaller than those found elsewhere. Most of these Dorset circles are made of sarsen stone, although the Rempstone circle is unique in being made from local sandstone. The southern half of the circle has been destroyed, with five upright and three recumbent stones remaining extant. Having been damaged by eighteenth century clay workings, the monument is at present situated within dense woodland. In 1957, a possible <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> stones leading to the circle was discovered by ploughing but subsequently removed. Local folklore holds that the stones arrived in their position after being thrown at Corfe Castle by the Devil.|$|E
5|$|After having {{displaced}} the British as {{the dominant}} outside power following the War of 1812, the United States had {{assumed the role of}} mediator in intertribal disputes. Before the Black Hawk War, U.S. policy discouraged intertribal warfare. This was not strictly for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare made it more difficult for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. U.S. efforts at mediation included multi-tribal treaty councils at Prairie du Chien in 1825 and 1830, in which tribal boundaries were drawn. Native Americans sometimes resented American mediation, especially young men, for whom warfare was an important <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> social advancement.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1700s, John Tynte owned {{what is now}} the Tyntesfield estate; at that time the house was {{approached}} by an <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> elm trees, planted after they were bequeathed in the 1678 will of Sir Charles Harbord to the people of Wraxall in memory of two boys he had apprenticed from the village. The Tynte's had originally lived on the estate, but by the early 1800s, John had made Chelvey Court in Brockley his principal residence. Tynte's Place was downgraded to a farmhouse and leased to John Vowles. In 1813, George Penrose Seymour of the adjoining Belmont estate purchased the property and gave it to his son, the Rev. George Turner Seymour. He in turn built a new Georgian mansion {{on the site of the}} former Saddler's Tenement, and demolished the old farmhouse. Further remodelling was undertaken by Robert Newton of Nailsea.|$|E
5|$|During early December 1944, the American's {{defensive}} {{line in the}} Ardennes had a gap south of Losheimergraben. General Leonard T. Gerow, in command of V Corps, recognized this area as a possible <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> attack by the Germans. This area, which lay between V Corps and Troy H. Middleton's VIII Corps, was undefended; just patrolled by jeep. The patrols {{in the northern part}} of the area were conducted by the 99th Infantry Division's 394th Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon, whereas those in the south were conducted by the 18th Cavalry Squadron, 14th Cavalry Group, which was attached to the 106th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|Frederiksberg, a {{separate}} municipality within the urban area of Copenhagen, lies {{to the west}} of N√∏rrebro and Indre By and north of Vesterbro. Its landmarks include Copenhagen Zoo founded in 1869 with over 250 species {{from all over the world}} and Frederiksberg Palace built as a summer residence by Frederick IV who was inspired by Italian architecture. Now a military academy, it overlooks the extensive landscaped Frederiksberg Gardens with its follies, waterfalls, lakes and decorative buildings. The wide tree-lined <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> Frederiksberg All√© connecting Vesterbrogade with the Frederiksberg Gardens has long been associated with theatres and entertainment. While a number of the earlier theatres are now closed, the Betty Nansen Theatre and Aveny-T are still active.|$|E

5|$|General Lee {{responded to}} the British landing with several actions. He began {{reinforcing}} positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an <b>avenue</b> <b>of</b> retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at {{the northern end of}} Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the {{original}} clock was moved from its location near 42nd Street, {{and the building}} where the sign had been mounted was demolished so One Bryant Park could be built. An updated model was installed one block away {{on the side of}} a Durst building at 1133 <b>Avenue</b> <b>of</b> the Americas, facing Sixth Avenue near the southeast corner of the intersection with West 44th Street. The new clock is located next to an Internal Revenue Service office. The new clock, which can run backward, is outfitted with a brighter seven-segment display with multiple LEDs per segment, allowing the numbers to be read more easily.|$|E
5|$|In other respects, {{individual}} countries had different preferences for styles of memorial. French communities usually chose simple monuments, located in public spaces, and deliberately avoided political or religious imagery and rhetoric. In Australia and the US, memorial halls ‚Äì {{some of which}} were large, grand structures ‚Äì were popular. Australia also created the idea of an <b>Avenue</b> <b>of</b> Honour, involving lines of trees, with memorial plaques, along a road. Canadians often brought back various material from Europe for their memorials, including pieces of local European churches and soil from the relevant battlefields. Individual countries also had typical national symbols that were widely incorporated, from the British Britannia, to the Gallic rooster to the Romanian vulture. Postcards of war memorials were widely produced in Britain and Italy, and ceramic models of the more famous ones, such as the Cenotaph, were sold as souvenirs.|$|E
