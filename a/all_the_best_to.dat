It is not a book and does not cover each point in detail, but a simple overview of what may be worth considering in your daily life and looking into developing into habits. It`s still a draft, so do expect to find some typographical mistakes. I`m still working on it ☺ Much of what I present in this manual you already know. It serves as a reminder, feedback and reinforcement of your own knowing, and I hope it will help you achieve your peak in life. I’ve kept it brief with some illustrations of what I consider most important. This manual is free for you to distribute to your friends. You can also download it from my website. Integrate the parts which make sense to you, question that which doesn’t. Also if you feel that I’ve missed something, or some parts are unclear, feel free to send me your comments and feedback so I can make the updates. Your feedback is most welcome and appreciated! Know that you all have different goals in life, and you all have special abilities and strength that you can use towards your success in life. Some of you may have already discovered these skills, and some of you may discover them in the near future.

40|$|Given the {{increased}} pressure on educational system in Bosnia and Herze-govina (BiH) to fully embrace inclusive education {{and to provide}} appropriate supports to all students, {{there was a need}} for establishing a new department of Education and Rehabilitation in BiH. Thus, the Faculty of the Educational Sciences at the University of Sarajevo initiated and made a feasibility study on the need for establishing the new department. The feasibility study was then approved by the Government and Assembly of the Sarajevo Canton. To date, there were only two such departments at the state Universities in BiH, one in Tuzla (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) and one in Foča (Republic of Srpska). This will be the third, state-supported, department for educating experts in the field of special education and rehabilitation of children with developmental disabilities. The courses offered at the new department follow the long tradition of courses offered at the similar institutions in the region, such as the Faculty for Special Education and Rehabilitation in Belgrade, Serbia and the Faculty of Education and Rehabilitation Sciences in Zagreb, Croatia. Besides taking into account these regional guidelines for the study program, we also had in mind programs offered at the best world universities for special education such as Vanderbilt University and University of Kansas. The leading idea was that the students at the Department of Education and Rehabilitation deserve the best, current, up-to-date programs that will provide them with the competencies to provide full support to children with disabilities. The graduates from the Department of Education and Rehabilitation will have the competencies to work with children and adults with various forms of disabilities. The graduates of the Department will be competent in areas of work with children with intellectual disability, hearing and visual impairments. They will be able to provide supports to children from the early childhood period, through the school years and high school years all the way to supporting them in the transitional period (finding employment). The programs offered at the Department are aimed at equipping the students to work with a heterogeneous group of children and to respond {{to a wide variety of}} educational challenges that they might face in everyday work. Thus, for example, the Department offers courses on evidence-based educational strategies in work with children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder such as Applied Behaviour Analysis, courses on methods of work with children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder etc. One of the newly designed courses is Cognitive Rehabilitation that teaches students some practical strategies on how to improve certain cognitive domains (attention, memory, executive functions) of children with developmental disabilities. Of the old, well-established courses, there are the ones that deal with sensory impairments such as Sign Language and Braille’s alphabet. All in all, the staff at the Department believes that the graduates will be fully competent in dealing with current educational challenges and be able to provide full educational and rehabilitation support to all children with developmental disabilities. In this academic year (2016 / 2017), 20 students enrolled at the Department. In the academic 2017 / 2018 the Department plans to enrol 65 students. We wish <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> all our current and prospective students and invite all to consider the Department of Education and Rehabilitation at the University of Sarajevo as the next step in their careers...|$|E

40|$|The year 2004 {{had been}} marked by events and {{activities}} that will be of strategic relevance for our institute. In February our institute was reviewed together with the GSI {{within the framework of}} the “Program Oriented Funding”, which represents a new paradigm for science funding of the Helmholtz centres. This evaluation took place at the GSI, scrutinizing the Research Program “Physics of Hadrons and Nuclei”, which is part of the Research Field “Structure of Matter”. As the major recommendations of this council, an “on-site” and “in-depth” review of the future activities of the institute, especially with respect to our close collaboration with GSI within the FAIR-project was proposed as well as to present a full proposal for the transfer of WASA from Uppsala to COSY to a dedicated review committee. The HGF-Senate has decided to postpone/defer any decision on budgets for the years 2006 to 2009 until the findings of the on-site review, which will take place in April 2005, are available. The WASA proposal has been critically examined in October 2004 by an extended program advisory committee. It concluded unanimously that this detector in connection with COSY would constitute an outstanding physics opportunity and that the proposed physics program has unquestionably strategic relevance. The institute has significantly intensified its engagement in the FAIR-project, which will set the stage for the mid- and long-term perspective in hadron physics. In collaboration with other partners our institute has taken on a leading role in the consortium that is planning, designing (and later building) the “High Energy Storage Ring” (HESR) of FAIR. In 2004 the IKP has played a prominent role in the timely completion of the Technical Reports for HESR, PANDA, PAX and FLAIR. As outlined in our PoF-application, the institute has the following strategy for its future position within the scientific portfolio of the Helmholtz organisation (HGF) : • Scientific exploitation of COSY and its experimental facilities: – Hadron physics with hadronic probes – Preparatory investigations for the FAIR project of GSI (Darmstadt) • Involvement in FAIR: – Planning, designing and building of HESR, the “High Energy Storage Ring” for anti-protons – Contributions to antiproton experiments and corresponding detector systems (PANDA, PAX, FLAIR) It is evident that the timescale for the transition from COSY to HESR needs to be intertwined with the actual realization of the FAIR-project. As a result of an intense discussion within CANU (COSY Association of Networking Universities), it was agreed that COSY will be an indispensable experimental facility for the intervening period in order to sustain a viable hadron physics community. An efficient migration of the CANU-user community to the HESR is only conceivable if experimental activities can continue nearly seamlessly. As mentioned above, we intend to transfer WASA (currently installed at CELSIUS of TSL, Uppsala, Sweden) to COSY — a corresponding Memorandum-of-Understanding between Uppsala University and FZJ was signed in December. As significant resources will be allocated to the HESR, PANDA, and other activities related to the FAIR-project, WASA — together with ANKE and TOF — will be the only detector systems operated at COSY in the near future. We already phased out nuclear spectroscopy and JESSICA during the past year. As in the years before we had meetings of our international advisory committees, the IKP-Beirat and PAC for the COSY experimental program. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all of its members for their valuable advice and constructive discussions. We also have had retirements of colleagues in 2004; I would like to mention: Prof. Detlev Filges and Prof. Kurt Kilian, long-term director of IKP I. I want to express our deep thanks to all retirees for their work and contributions as well as our best wishes for their future. We are very pleased to have successors for two retired directors (J. Speth, K. Kilian) : • Prof. Ulf-G. Meißner, holding a chair at the “Helmholtz Institut für Strahlen- und Kernphysik” at the “Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms Universität Bonn”, who had acted as provisional director of the IKP-theory since 2003, took over as director in October. • Prof. James Ritman from the “Justus-Liebig Universität Gießen”, holding now a chair at the “Ruhr-Universität Bochum”, is the new head of IKP I since September. A hearty welcome and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> the new leadership and to all other new staff members of IKP. In closing, I would like to thank all colleagues, collaborators, friends from within the institute, the Research Center (FZJ) — in particular ZAM, ZAT and ZEL — and national and international universities and institutions for their support and dedication that was key to make COSY a world class facility and the IKP a center for hadron physics with hadronic probes...|$|E

Individuals and organizations who wish to request the participation and/or support of FEPSAC in proposals for an EU/international or nationally-funded project are invited to send {{a brief description of the}} project, or a preliminary draft proposal, a budget and an outline for the task and respective budget for FEPSAC to the FEPSAC MC (office@fepsac. com). More information about the specific requirements for an application and FEPSAC MC's decision making process can be found on our website. Internships in Sport Psychology: Call for supervisors One main goal of FEPSAC is to increase mobility and improve the quality and breadth of educational experience within Europe. For that reason, FEPSAC now provides a contact form on our website where potential supervisors/supervisees can state their interest to offer, or take an (un) remunerated temporary placement. This contact form will be available to supervisors and supervisees who can then contact the other party directly. To kick off such an initiative we would like to invite all those potentially interested supervisors to contact us with an expression of interest at office@fepsac. com.

EASY networking conference. By Anna van Wel and Vana Hutter (Conference Organizers). The network for educators in applied sport psychology, the EASY-network, held her first networking conference the 19 th of May. It was a very inspirational day with great presentations and interesting exchanges of experiences. The first part of the day, new criteria for future FEPSAC accreditation were discussed and feedback was given by the experienced educators in the EASY network. After this, practical experiences and challenges for educators teaching applied sport psychology were elaborated on. After an energizing lunch the network was ready for the afternoon program consisting of discussions on what competencies a good applied sport psychologist should have and how best to asses them. Also, the educational program formats of the British Psychological Society and the postmaster program for applied sport psychology in the Netherlands were discussed. Interesting differences were the fuel of the discussions that followed, hopefully inspiring the development of such programs. All in all, it was an amazing day which couldn't have been possible without the positive and active input of all attendees! Many thanks and we hope to see you next year!

40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} research, many mutation selection {{techniques have}} been proposed {{to reduce the cost}} of mutation analysis. After a mutant subset is se-lected, researchers could obtain a test suite which can detect <b>all</b> mutants in <b>the</b> mutant subset. Then they run all mutants over this test suite, and the detection ratio to all mutants is used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} mutation selection techniques. The higher the ratio is, the better this selection technique is. Obvi-ously, this measurement has a presumption that <b>the</b> set of <b>all</b> mutants is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> evaluate test cases. However, there is no clearly evidence to support this pre-sumption. So we conducted an experiment to answer the question whether <b>the</b> set of <b>all</b> mutants is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> evaluate test cases. In this paper, our experiment results show that a subset of mutants may be more similar to faults than <b>all</b> <b>the</b> mutants. Two evaluation metrics were used to measure the similarity – rank and distance. This finding reveals that it may be more appropriate to use a subset ra-ther than <b>all</b> <b>the</b> mutants at hand to evaluate the fault detection capability of test cases. ...|$|R
