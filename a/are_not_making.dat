However, from a chemical perspective, synephrine is also related to {{a very large number of}} other drugs whose structures are based on the phenethylamine skeleton, and although some properties are common, others <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> <b>making</b> unqualified comparisons and generalizations inappropriate.|$|E

25|$|Second, average {{profitability}} {{is itself}} {{determined by a}} huge variety of influences on costs, sales and income which are all linked together in various ways. Therefore, if the crisis is blamed on lower profitability, this either states a tautology which must be true by definition ("people <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>making</b> {{as much money as}} they used to"), or else it is substantially false – since the crisis is just as much caused by a drop in sales, output, investment, incomes and employment – which all react on each other.|$|E

They believe this is the gathering of believers who wait upon the Lord to discover God's will, believing that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>making</b> their own decisions. They seek to understand God's will for the religious community, via the actions of the Holy Spirit within the meeting.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{praised the}} game's use of cel-shading. IGN's Hilary Goldstein stated, [...] "To capture the 'comic book feel,' Raven Soft {{chose to go}} for a cel-shaded look with Legends. It's not that the characters look two-dimensional, but they have very basic textures and a cut-out look". GameSpot reviewer Jeff Gerstmann pointed out that though the characters are cel-shaded, the environments <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> <b>making</b> them easy to distinguish. The gameplay was lauded for its role-playing elements, character powers and melee combat. Eurogamer praised the Xbox version's control system for character powers and melee attacks, as well as the [...] "fluid" [...] combat.|$|E
500|$|The {{score of}} Sense8 was {{composed}} by Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer; {{the two had}} previously co-composed the score for Cloud Atlas and had a minor contribution in the soundtrack of The Matrix Revolutions as part of Pale 3. Responsible for the orchestration was their fellow Cloud Atlas collaborator Gene Pritsker, and the recording {{was done by the}} MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra. Each season's score was written up to {{a year and a half}} before filming began, enabling the production to play it back to the actors before shooting a scene. Tykwer, who has made the music for all of his movies this way, introduced to the Wachowskis the concept of first writing the music during pre-production of Cloud Atlas and the sisters have since commented they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>making</b> a movie again a different way. Once a first cut is completed by the editors, the composers do further developing of their tracks. [...] "We flesh things out; both expand and refine, write new material and even change direction if it is prudent", the composers have explained.|$|E

500|$|The Langlois Bridge {{reminded}} Van Gogh of Hiroshige's print [...] [...] Inspired by the Japanese {{wood block}} prints, Van Gogh sought to integrate techniques from Japanese artwork into his own. In {{a letter to}} Émile Bernard about the Langlois Bridge, he wrote: [...] "If the Japanese <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>making</b> any progress in their own country, still it cannot be doubted that their art is being continued in France." [...] With a Japanese aesthetic, Van Gogh's Langlois Bridge paintings reflect a simplified use of color to create a harmonious and unified image. [...] Outlines were used to suggest movement. He used fewer shades of colors, preferring multiple subtle color variations. The Langlois Bridge reminded Van Gogh of Hiroshige's Sudden Shower on the Great Bridge inspiring him to use blocks of colors, like patterns of yellow against a blue sky, colors chosen {{to create a sense}} of vitality of the Japanese prints and the vibrant quality of light in [...] southern France. These approaches created a more powerful impact and depicted the simpler, primitive quality of the country lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|Though, as per the {{statutes}} for the Bharat Ratna, the {{recommendations for the}} award can only {{be made by the}} Prime Minister to the President, there have been several demands from various political parties to honour their leaders. In January 2008, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader L. K. Advani wrote to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recommending Singh's predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee for the award. This was immediately followed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) lobbying for their leader, Jyoti Basu, former Chief Minister of West Bengal. Basu, India's longest-serving chief minister, said that he would decline the honour, even if awarded. Similar demands were made by Telugu Desam Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, and Shiromani Akali Dal for their respective leaders N. T. Rama Rao, Kanshi Ram, and Parkash Singh Badal. In September 2015, regional political party Shiv Sena demanded the award for the independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar stating that he had been [...] "deliberately neglected by previous governments" [...] but his family clarified that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>making</b> such demand and that the freedom fighter is known for his contribution towards independence movement and did not need an award for recognition.|$|E

2500|$|By 2011 several councils had {{realized}} {{that they did not}} have to permit BASW access, and those that were challenged by skilled professional representation of their staff were withdrawing permission. For this reason BASW once again took up trade union status by forming its arms length trade union section, SWU (Social Workers Union).

[...] At 2015 the TUC was still resisting SWU application for admission to congress membership and while most employers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>making</b> formal statements of recognition until such a time as the TUC may change its policy, they are all legally required to permit SWU (BASW) representation at internal discipline hearings etc.|$|E

It is a very much more difficult task to feed the nation than it is to wreck it". Baldwin wrote, [...] "The general strike is a challenge to the parliament and is the road to anarchy". The British Worker, the TUC's newspaper, wrote: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>making</b> war on the people.

2500|$|As {{opposed to}} duress and actual undue influence, where illegitimate {{pressure}} is applied, or presumed undue influence which {{depends on a}} relationship of trust and confidence being abused, further cases allow a vulnerable person to avoid an agreement merely {{on the basis that}} they were vulnerable and exploited. In The Medina the Court of Appeal found that a group of pilgrims shipwrecked on a rock in the Red Sea did not need to pay £4000 they promised to a rescue ship, because the [...] "rescuers" [...] had exploited the pilgrims vulnerable position. To prevent unjust enrichment, the Court substituted an award of £1800. Similarly, in Cresswell v Potter, Ms Cresswell conveyed her ex-husband her share of their joint property in return for release from mortgage repayments, later making him £1400 profit. Because Potter took advantage of Ms Creswell's ignorance of property transactions, Megarry J held the agreement was voidable. One potential exception to this pattern, and now very heavily restricted, is the defence of [...] "non est factum", which originally applied in favour of illiterate people in the 19th century allowed a person to have a signed contract declared void if it is radically different from what was envisaged. In Lloyds Bank Ltd v Bundy, Lord Denning MR proposed it was time that all cases be placed into one unified doctrine of [...] "inequality of bargaining power". This would have allowed escape from an agreement if without independent advice one person's ability to bargain for better terms had been heavily impaired, and would have essentially given courts broader scope to change contracts to the advantage of weaker parties. The idea of a general unified doctrine was disapproved by some members of the House of Lords from 1979. However, specific legislation, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, or the Employment Rights Act 1996 creates targeted rights for contracting parties who lack bargaining power, in the same way specific legislation circumscribes a duty of [...] and good faith. Thus, just as there is no unified theory of bargaining power, a unified doctrine of freedom of contract was dismantled long ago where the parties <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>making</b> commercial deals in the course of business.|$|E
