5|$|A.J. Styles {{suffered}} a tendon injury during his title bout with Samoa Joe at Sacrifice. TNA management {{kept him out}} of the following Impact! tapings, hoping to keep him rested and not risk any further injury despite expectations {{that he would not be}} sidelined long. Styles, however, canceled an appearance in the Ring of Honor promotion on August20. He came back for a promotion on August27 at their Dragon's Gate Invasion event, losing <b>a</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> CIMA.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{matching}} mitochondrial DNA, geneticist Turi King continued {{to pursue a}} link between the paternally-inherited Y-DNA and that of descendants of John of Gaunt. Four living male-line descendants of Gaunt have been located, and their results are <b>a</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> each other. The Y-DNA from the skeleton is somewhat degraded, but proved not to match any of the living male-line relatives, showing that a false-paternity event had happened somewhere in the 19 generations between Richard III and Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort; work by Turi King and others has shown that historical rates of false paternity are around 1–2% per generation.|$|E
5|$|Doll {{returned}} to PNW, where {{he held the}} tag team title another seven times with various partners. King remained in Tennessee, winning the USWA World Tag Team Championship with Joey Maggs. He later moved to Puerto Rico, where he wrestled for the World Wrestling Council. With Ricky Santana as his new partner, he held the WWC World Tag Team Championship twice.

After the unsuccessful segment, The Miz returned to in-ring competition {{with a more}} intense style and began to pick up wins once again. On the June 11, 2007 episode of Raw, Mizanin faced off against Snitsky in <b>a</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> determine a draft pick for SmackDown!. Snitsky easily defeated The Miz to give ECW the draft pick, but after constantly assaulting The Miz after the match, the referee reversed the decision and awarded the match to Miz, thus allowing SmackDown! a draft pick. SmackDown!'s pick was then revealed to be Chris Masters.|$|E
5|$|In July and August, Carlsen won the Biel Grandmaster Tournament with a 6/10 {{record and}} a PR of 2753. His score was matched by Alexander Onischuk and they played <b>a</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> break the tie. After drawing two rapid and two blitz games, Carlsen won the armageddon game. Immediately after the Biel tournament, Carlsen entered the open Arctic Chess Challenge in Tromsø, but his fourth-place result with +5=4 was a slight {{underperformance}} in terms of rating. In the first round, Carlsen conceded a draw to his classmate Brede Hagen (rated 2034) after having a lost position at one point. A game which attracted some attention was his sixth-round win over his father, Henrik Carlsen.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{scaled back}} his {{participation}} in Sheffield Shield cricket in the 1938–39 season, making himself unavailable {{for most of the}} campaign to spend time with his newborn son after half a year in England; he played in only two matches, against South Australia and arch-rivals Victoria. He took a ten-wicket haul in the latter match, but his figures of 6/152 and 4/60 were not enough to prevent defeat. Both teams were at full strength and eight of O'Reilly's victims were Test players, including batsman Lindsay Hassett twice. O'Reilly's only other match was for Bradman's XI against Rigg's XI in <b>a</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> commemorate the centenary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, in which he took a total of 7/129, to end the season with 19 wickets at 23.16.|$|E

5|$|Several other bouts {{were planned}} for Genesis, of these the most {{significant}} were a No Disqualification match and <b>a</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> determine the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The No Disqualification match was between Abyss and Sabu. This was a rematch from TNA's Unbreakable PPV event on September11, which Abyss won. Abyss and Sabu also fought in Monster's Ball II at Bound for Glory, which Rhino won. TNA advertised Monty Brown versus Jeff Hardy to determine the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship heading into Genesis. This was a continuation of a storyline in which Brown sought to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Both of these encounters were advertised on TNA's website following Bound for Glory.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Man Tag Team match pitting {{the team of}} Rhino and Team 3D (Brother Ray & Brother Devon) against the team of Jeff Jarrett and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris & James Storm). Rhino and Team 3D won the encounter. The TNA X Division Championship was defended by then-champion A.J. Styles against the {{challenger}} Petey Williams at the event. Styles defeated Williams to retain the championship. A No Disqualification match between Abyss and Sabu {{was held at the}} show. Abyss won the contest. <b>A</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> determine the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship took place at Genesis, in which Monty Brown defeated Jeff Hardy for a future title match.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} on Raw, during an {{appreciation}} ceremony held by Vince McMahon for Randy Orton, Shawn Michaels {{returned from a}} five-month hiatus and superkicked Orton {{in the face to}} end the show. At Survivor Series in November, Orton defeated Michaels in <b>a</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> retain his WWE Championship. That same month, on the November 16 edition of SmackDown!, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Matt Hardy lost the WWE Tag Team Championship in a match against John Morrison and The Miz.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode, {{in which}} two players team up to accomplish various challenges and fight against waves of increasingly difficult enemies in the Roman Colosseum, a gladiator arena setting. The environments of the Colosseum change dynamically in <b>a</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> add variety to the mode. Players can gain access to increasingly advanced armor and weapons as they progress through these multiplayer matches. Microtransactions are also featured, allowing players to purchase in-game upgrades with real-life currency.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{following}} this, the bad blood {{between the two}} sides intensified, {{so much so that the}} new management of TNA (now renamed Impact Wrestling) Anthem Sports & Entertainment issued a cease and desist letter to The Hardys' new promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), in which Anthem essentially ordered ROH as well as any broadcasting company airing ROH's 15th Anniversary pay–per–view show (on which The Hardys were to participate in <b>a</b> <b>match)</b> <b>to</b> not in any way speak of, indicate or acknowledge the existence of the Broken Matt and Brother Nero characters and instead to refer to The Hardys as simply Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. The issue with this is that while The Hardys were in TNA, they had full creative control over the Broken gimmick, with them even filming their own segments to air on TNA programming in some circumstances, thus making the Hardy family (in their belief) the owners of the Broken gimmick. It is believed that civil litigation will follow and a potential court hearing will take place regarding the final outcome on who owns the Broken gimmick: Anthem or the Hardy family. Until then, the status of the Broken gimmick remains undecided. Despite this, Matt continues to use the Broken gimmick through his social media accounts, but neither him or Jeff use the Broken gimmick at any professional wrestling shows for ROH or on the independent circuit, presumably until the results of the expected legal proceedings have been finalized.|$|E
5|$|After {{dropping}} the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship {{for a third}} and final time, the Blond Bombers began to challenge for the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship. They defeated George Gulas and Ken Lucas to win the belts on December 15, 1979. While holding the title, they continued to feud with Gulas. When they attacked him one day, his estranged partner Bobby Eaton rescued him; Gulas and Eaton reunited as The Jet Set and defeated the Bombers to win the championship. Latham and Farris regained the belts in a rematch against The Jet Set but later dropped them to Rocky Brewer and Pat Rose. The Blond Bombers had one last reign with the Mid-America belts, as they defeated Eaton and Great Togo in July 1980. They held the title until September 3, when they lost <b>a</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> Robert Gibson and Don Fargo. After losing the belts, Farris left to compete in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council. Upon returning to Tennessee, he found other partners and had two more reigns as an AWA Southern Tag Team Champion. Latham soon left Tennessee {{to compete in the}} World Wrestling Federation, where he held the WWF Tag Team Championship as Spot, a member of The Moondogs.|$|E
