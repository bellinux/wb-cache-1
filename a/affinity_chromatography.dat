An excess of imidazole is passed through the column, which displaces the His-tag from nickel coordination, freeing the His-tagged proteins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> {{is based}} on {{selective}} non-covalent interaction between an analyte and specific molecules. It is very specific, but not very robust. It is often used in biochemistry in the purification of proteins bound to tags. These fusion proteins are labeled with compounds such as His-tags, biotin or antigens, which bind to the stationary phase specifically. After purification, some of these tags are usually removed and the pure protein is obtained.|$|E

40|$|Background: This paper {{describes}} the isolation and characterization of pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) from fetal cotyledonary tissue (FCT) and maternal caruncular tissue (MCT) collected from fallow deer (Dama dama) pregnant females. Proteins issued from FCT and MCT were submitted to <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatographies</b> by using Vicia villosa agarose (VVA) or anti-bovine PAG- 2 (R# 438) coupled to Sepharose 4 B gel. Finally, they {{were characterized by}} SDSPAGE and N-terminal microsequencing. Results: Four distinct fallow deer PAG (fdPAG) sequences were identified and submitted to Swiss-Prot database. Comparison of fdPAG with PAG sequences identified in other ruminant species exhibited 64 to 83 % identity. Additionally, alpha-fetoprotein was identified in fetal and maternal tissues. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the efficacy of VVA and bovine PAG- 2 <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatographies</b> for the isolation of PAG molecules expressed in deer placenta.

Peptide mass fingerprinting is the most popular analytical application of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers. MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometers are used to reveal amino acid sequence of peptides using post-source decay or high energy collision-induced dissociation (further use see mass spectrometry).|$|E
25|$|Galectin-1 and galectin-3 {{have been}} found, surprisingly, to {{associate}} with nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes including the spliceosome. Studies revealed that galectin-1 and -3 are required splicing factors, since removal of the galectins by <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> with lactose resulted in loss of splicing activity. It appears that the splicing capability of galectins is independent of their sugar-binding specificities. Site-directed mutagenesis studies to the carbohydrate recognition domain removes glycan binding but does not prevent association with the spliceosome.|$|E
25|$|Many {{membrane}} proteins are glycoproteins {{and can be}} purified by lectin <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Detergent-solubilized proteins can {{be allowed}} to bind to a chromatography resin that has been modified to have a covalently attached lectin. Proteins that do not bind to the lectin are washed away and then specifically bound glycoproteins can be eluted by adding {{a high concentration of}} a sugar that competes with the bound glycoproteins at the lectin binding site. Some lectins have high affinity binding to oligosaccharides of glycoproteins that is hard to compete with sugars, and bound glycoproteins need to be released by denaturing the lectin.|$|E
40|$|A solubility-insolubility {{transition}} assay {{was used}} to screen the bark and stems of seven leguminous trees and plants for self-aggregatable lectins. Novel lectins were found in two trees, Robinia pseudoacacia and Wisteriafloribunda, {{but not in the}} leguminous plants. The Robinia lectin was isolated from coexisting lectin by combined <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatographies</b> on various sugar adsorbents. The purified lectins proved to be differently glycosylated glycoproteins. One lectin exhibited the remarkable characteristics of self-aggregatable lectins: localization in the bark of legume trees, self-aggregation dissociated by N-acetylglucosamine/mannose, and coexistence with N-acetylgalactosamine/galactose-specific lectins, which are potential endogenous receptors. Self-aggregatable lectins are a functional lectin group that can link enhanced photosynthesis to dissociation of glycoproteins...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA high {{molecular}} mass latent form of transforming growth factor type-β (TGF-β) was purified to homogeneity from rat platelets by a seven-step procedure involving group-specific <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatographies</b> on Red-Toyopearl and zinc chelating-Sepharose.

Analysis of the peptide structure by gel electrophoresis showed that the masking protein consisted of two subunits of 39 kDA and 105 – 120 kDA linked by disulfide bonds. N-terminal amino-acid sequencing of the 39 kDA subunit indicated that this subunit was identical to the N-terminal part of the TGF-β precursor...|$|R

25|$|Cyanogen bromide {{is often}} used to {{immobilize}} proteins by coupling them to reagents such as agarose for <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Because of its simplicity and mild pH conditions, cyanogen bromide activation is the most common method for preparing affinity gels. Cyanogen bromide is also often used because it reacts with the hydroxyl groups on agarose to form cyanate esters and imidocarbonates. These groups are reacted with primary amines in order to couple the protein onto the agarose matrix, as shown in the figure. Because cyanate esters are more reactive than are cyclic imidocarbonates, the amine will react mostly with the ester, yielding isourea derivatives, and partially with the less reactive imidocarbonate, yielding substituted imidocarbonates.|$|E
25|$|A much quicker, single-step {{method of}} {{separation}} is protein A/G <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatography.</b> The antibody selectively binds to protein A/G, so {{a high level}} of purity (generally >80%) is obtained. However, this method may be problematic for antibodies that are easily damaged, as harsh conditions are generally used. A low pH can break the bonds to remove the antibody from the column. In addition to possibly affecting the product, low pH can cause protein A/G itself to leak off the column and appear in the eluted sample. Gentle elution buffer systems that employ high salt concentrations are available to avoid exposing sensitive antibodies to low pH. Cost is also an important consideration with this method because immobilized protein A/G is a more expensive resin.|$|E

The enzyme protein was rich in glutamic acid + glutamine, aspartic acid + asparagine, glycine and alanine. The enzyme catalysed no significant glucose transfer {{to any of}} the glycoproteins tested, except for collagens. This included all the glycoproteins that have previously served as glucosyl acceptors for impure enzyme preparations, thus indicating a high degree of specificity of the enzyme for galactosylhydroxylysine. Galactosylsphingosine would act as a glucosyl acceptor, however. This compound has a close structural similarity to galactosylhydroxylysine in that they both have an unsubstituted amino group next to the hydroxy group to which the galactose is attached...|$|R
40|$|Fractions {{enriched in}} Golgi {{membranes}} were prepared from rat liver by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. These enriched membranes were further subfractionated {{on the basis}} of their solubilities in EGTA, 150 mM sodium carbonate, pH 11. 5, sodium deoxycholate, Triton X- 100, or sodium dodecyl sulfate. This led to isolation of peripheral, luminal, and integral membrane proteins of the Golgi-enriched membranes. Luminal and membrane proteins were further purified by wheat germ agglutinin and concanavalin A lectin <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatographies.</b> Some proteins from these lectin columns were resolved by preparative gel electrophoresis and microsequenced.

By using protein-A Sepharose CL- 4 B <b>affinity</b> column <b>chromatography</b> of rabbit anti-KMT- 50 serum, CDA was shown to bind protein A. Complement dependent-cytotoxicity (CDC), however, was demonstrated in both the adsorbed fraction (eluate) and the non-adsorbed fraction (effluent) to protein A from the same <b>affinity</b> column <b>chromatography.</b> These data confirmed that CDA was IgG with an intact Fc portion. Inhibition of ADCC occurred by pretreatment of effector cells with rabbit anti-effector (human PBL) serum even with extremely small amounts of antiserum. Such inhibition was demonstrated with the eluate {{but not with the}} effluent from protein-A Sepharose CL- 4 B <b>affinity</b> column <b>chromatography</b> of rabbit anti-effector serum. F(ab') 2 fragments of the same eluate (IgG) did not inhibit the ADCC activity. These data showed that the inhibition of ADCC was induced by the blocking of Fc receptors of effector cells with the Fc portions of IgG in anti-effector serum. The data obtained indicate the usefulness of protein A in separation and analysis of CDA and in investigation of the inhibitory mechanisms of ADCC...|$|R

2500|$|The pool {{is first}} {{subjected}} to a selection step, during which the catalytic strands are separated from the non-catalytic strands. The exact separation method {{will depend on the}} reaction being catalyzed. As an example, the separation step for ribonucleotide cleavage often utilizes <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatography,</b> in which a biological tag attached to each DNA strand is removed from any catalytically active strands via cleavage of a ribonucleotide base. This allows the catalytic strands to be separated by a column that specifically binds the tag, since the non-active strands will remain bound to the column while the active strands (which no longer possess the tag) flow through. A common set-up for this is a biotin tag with a streptavidin affinity column. Gel electrophoresis based separation can also be used in which the change in molecular weight of strands upon the cleavage reaction is enough to cause a shift in the location of the reactive strands on the gel. After the selection step, the reactive pool is amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to regenerate and amplify the reactive strands, and the process is repeated until a pool of sufficient reactivity is obtained. Multiple rounds of selection are required because some non-catalytic strands will inevitably make it through any single selection step. Usually 4–10 rounds are required for unambiguous catalytic activity, though more rounds are often necessary for more stringent catalytic conditions. After a sufficient number of rounds, the final pool is sequenced and the individual strands are tested for their catalytic activity. The dynamics of the pool can be described through mathematical modeling ...|$|E
