By the end, she had traveled more than Mondale and more than Reagan and Bush combined.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton nearly {{failed to}} make the trip. His {{newspaper}} editor Eric Baume ordered to write a column <b>attacking</b> <b>the</b> Australian Board of Control for vetoing players from going on a private tour of India, threatening to sack him if he refused—criticism of the board typically resulted in exclusion from selection. Fingleton was reluctant to comply, and was reprieved when the editor-in-chief overruled Baume.|$|E

Instead, he pressed for attacks against residential areas. Hitler refused. He ordered that only military targets in London were to be attacked.|$|E

Although there were eight attempts to force a new Licensing Act through Parliament between 1697 and 1713, none of them succeeded. Despite {{the freedom of the}} press from censorship by the government, the judiciary held a different view; it regularly tried people for seditious libel if they printed material <b>attacking</b> <b>the</b> government. From 21 November 1768, letters written by a man under the pseudonym of Junius were published in the Public Advertiser, a London newspaper run by Henry Sampson Woodfall. In them, Junius attacked many political leaders, including Lord Granby and Mansfield. As his letters were wildly popular, the circulation of the Public Advertiser doubled in just five months.|$|E

After the Portuguese had withdrawn their fleet, the Vijayanagara King (Sri Ranga) residing at Ratnagiri then <b>attacked</b> <b>the</b> Dutch at Pulicat but was paid a handsome tribute by the Dutch. Thereafter, the Dutch were not troubled.|$|R

This paper presents an efficient and flexible password authenticated key agreement protocol for session initiation protocol associated with Voice over Internet Protocol.
