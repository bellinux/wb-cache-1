5|$|This last {{task was}} {{particularly}} unpopular with American prospectors, who faced paying {{an average of}} 25 percent {{of the value of}} their goods and supplies. The Mounties had a reputation for running these posts honestly, although accusations were made that they took bribes.

5|$|Hamilton {{suggested}} that Congress should charter the National Bank with a capitalization of $10million, one-fifth {{of which would}} be handled by the Government. Since the Government did not have the money, it would borrow the money from the bank itself, and repay the loan in ten even annual installments. The rest was to be available to individual investors. The bank was to be governed by a twenty-five member board of directors that was to represent a large majority of the private shareholders, which Hamilton considered essential for his being under a private direction. Hamilton's bank model had many similarities to that of the Bank of England, except Hamilton wanted to exclude the Government from being involved in public debt, but provide a large, firm, and elastic money supply for the functioning of normal businesses and usual economic development, among other differences. For tax revenue to ignite the bank, it was the same as he had previously proposed; increases on imported spirits: rum, liquor, <b>and</b> <b>whiskey.</b>|$|E

Chester saloonkeeper John Harper, unhappy with the splitting of Delaware County from Chester County, led a militia with the intent of destroying the unfinished courthouse in 1785. Bringing a cannon, muskets, <b>and</b> <b>whiskey,</b> Harper's men were ready to fight. They eventually gave up their pursuit after being stopped by a group of men led by Hannum.

25|$|While {{bringing}} {{wealth to}} a few select French traders and the French regime, the fur trade also brought profound changes to the indigenous groups living along the St. Lawrence. European wares, such as iron axe heads, brass kettles, cloth, and firearms were bought with beaver pelts and other furs. The widespread practice of trading furs for rum <b>and</b> <b>whiskey</b> led to problems associated with inebriation and alcohol abuse. The subsequent destruction of beaver populations along the St. Lawrence heightened the fierce competition between the Iroquois and Huron {{for access to the}} rich fur-bearing lands of the Canadian Shield. The competition for hunting is believed to have contributed to the earlier destruction of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians in the valley by 1600, likely by the Iroquois Mohawk tribe, who were located closest to them, were more powerful than the Huron, and had the most to gain by controlling this part of the valley.|$|E
25|$|On March 13, 1922 Wedge {{appeared}} in District Court in Watertown, Massachusetts after being arrested for public intoxication late {{the previous evening}} in Mary's lunch room, but was released without penalty as a first offender. After an investigation by Harry W.

Despite claims by Harvard authorities that he had left Harvard due to a recurrence of tuberculosis, Wedge admitted that he had left as he was missing his wife and son who were still living in Arizona, and that the weather was affecting him adversely. Later he acknowledged that lack of finances also compelled him to leave Harvard. Wedge planned to return to Harvard with his family in September 1922.|$|E
25|$|Like the English and Irish country houses it {{was modeled}} on, the White House was, from the start, {{open to the}} public until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his {{swearing-in}} ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice <b>and</b> <b>whiskey.</b> Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President Bill Clinton would briefly revive the New Year's Day open house in his first term.|$|E
