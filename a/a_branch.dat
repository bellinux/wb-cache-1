We can simplify <b>a</b> <b>branched</b> covering surface-knot by an addition of 1 -handles with chart loops to a form such that its chart is the union of free edges and 1 -handles with chart loops. We investigate properties of such simplifications for the case when branched covering surface-knots have a non-zero number of branch points, by using chart moves involving black vertices.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{behaviour}} of <b>a</b> <b>branching</b> process is completely described by the generating function of the offspring law and its fixed points. Branching random walks are a natural generalization of <b>branching</b> processes: <b>a</b> <b>branching</b> process can be seen as <b>a</b> one-dimensional <b>branching</b> random walk. We define a multidimensional generating function associated to <b>a</b> given <b>branching</b> random walk. The present paper investigates the similarities and the differences of the generating functions, their fixed points and the implications on the underlying stochastic process, between the one-dimensional (branching process) and the multidimensional case (branching random walk). In particular, we show that the generating function of <b>a</b> <b>branching</b> random walk can have uncountably many fixed points and a fixed point may not be an extinction probability, even in the irreducible case (extinction probabilities are always fixed points). Moreover, the generating function might not be a convex function. We also study how the behaviour of <b>a</b> <b>branching</b> random walk is affected by local modifications of the process. As a corollary, we describe a general procedure by which we can modify <b>a</b> continuous-time <b>branching</b> random walk which has a weak phase and turn it into <b>a</b> continuous-time <b>branching</b> random walk which has strong local survival for large or small values of the parameter and non-strong local survival for intermediate values of the parameter...|$|R
