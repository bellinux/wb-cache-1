5|$|Age of Empires {{requires}} the player {{to develop a}} civilization {{from a handful of}} hunter-gatherers to an expansive Iron Age Empire. To assure victory, the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and more advanced technology. Resources must also be preserved, as no new resources become available as the game progresses, for example, trees that <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> down will not grow back.|$|E

5|$|Fish steaks <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> {{perpendicular}} to the spine and include bones. Although their delicate flesh requires quicker cooking than beef, steaks from swordfish, halibut, tuna, salmon and mahi-mahi can be grilled. They are frequently cooked whole or as fillets. Fish steaks may also be poached or baked using a court bouillon, wine or sauce or cooked en papillote.|$|E

The {{corrosion}} {{behaviors of}} {{304 stainless steel}} (304 SS) which has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> and 304 SS which has not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> in two different solutions were investigated using polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The results show that 304 SS which has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> and 304 SS which has not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> have the similar corrosion voltage in two different solutions. However, the corrosion velocity of 304 SS which has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> more than 304 SS which has not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> both in the two solutions and the corrosion behaviors of two 304 SS in the water solution are better than in the water which has little oil...|$|R

These rocks are called roof pendants because they were once {{the roof of the}} underlying granitic rock.|$|E

5|$|Pork steaks are {{generally}} {{cut from the}} shoulder of the pig, but can also be cut from the loin or leg of the pig. Shoulder steaks <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> from the same primal cut of meat most commonly used for pulled pork, and can be quite tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the meat; therefore, pork shoulder steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beef steak, and may be stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.|$|E
5|$|The Central Highlands rise {{sharply to}} the north of the Grijalva, to a maximum {{altitude}} of , then descend gradually towards the Yucatán Peninsula. They <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> by deep valleys running parallel to the Pacific coast, and feature a complex drainage system that feeds both the Grijalva and the Lacantún River, which feeds into the Usumacinta River. The Central Highlands feature high rainfall and diverse vegetation dependent upon altitude, from high-altitude pine forests to lowland tropical forest further north and east towards the plains of Tabasco and Petén. At the eastern end of the Central Highlands is the Lacandon Forest, which is largely mountainous with lowland tropical plains at its easternmost extreme.|$|E

5|$|Typically {{carried out}} by a {{traditional}} circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> {{before the age of}} five. Procedures differ according to the country or ethnic group. They include removal of the clitoral hood and clitoral glans; removal of the inner labia; and removal of the inner and outer labia and closure of the vulva. In this last procedure, known as infibulation, a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid; the vagina is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.|$|E
5|$|Fallout 3 {{takes place}} in the year 2277, and within the region that covers most of the ruined city of Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and parts of Maryland. The game's {{landscape}} includes war-ravaged variants of numerous real-life landmarks such as the White House, the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, Arlington National Cemetery and the Washington Monument, with a small number of settlements dotted around the Capital Wastelands that consist of descendants of survivors from the Great War, including one that surrounds an unexploded bomb, another consisting primarily of ghoul inhabitants, and another formed within the hulking remains of an aircraft carrier. While the city can be explored, much of the interior zones <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> off by giant rubble over many of the roads leading in, meaning that access can only be achieved by using the city's former underground metro tunnels (loosely based on the real-life Washington Metro).|$|E

5|$|Generally, each {{household}} prepares one badnjak, {{although more}} <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> in some regions. Depending {{on the local}} custom, Montenegrin Serbs may fell two, three, an arbitrary number greater than two, or the number equal to the male members of household plus one. The latter means {{that each of the}} males has a log associated with him, with the thickest log representing the head of household and the thinnest linked to the family's prosperity. If there is only one man in the household, three rather than two logs are prepared. The logs may be cut from different species of tree. In parts of the Bay of Kotor, each household prepares four sets of badnjaks, as they are burned there not only on Christmas Eve, but also on the eves of New Years Day, Epiphany, and the Feast of Saint Sava.|$|E
5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E
5|$|Once {{purchased}} by Sightholders (which is a trademark term {{referring to the}} companies that have a three-year supply contract with DTC), diamonds <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> and polished in preparation for sale as gemstones ('industrial' stones are regarded as a by-product of the gemstone market; they are used for abrasives). The cutting and polishing of rough diamonds is a specialized skill that is concentrated in {{a limited number of}} locations worldwide. Traditional diamond cutting centers are Antwerp, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, New York City, and Tel Aviv. Recently, diamond cutting centers have been established in China, India, Thailand, Namibia and Botswana. Cutting centers with lower cost of labor, notably Surat in Gujarat, India, handle a larger number of smaller carat diamonds, while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds {{are more likely to be}} handled in Europe or North America. The recent expansion of this industry in India, employing low cost labor, has allowed smaller diamonds to be prepared as gems in greater quantities than was previously economically feasible.|$|E
