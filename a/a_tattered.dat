5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt by Marge {{to win the}} money on the game show Jeopardy!, the Simpsons arrive home to find {{everyone}} in Springfield gathered on their lawn and Marge thinks they have forgiven them. However, while that is the case, they steal all of their belongings in order to cover the $15,000 debt. In the end, the family playfully fight over <b>a</b> <b>tattered</b> washcloth, {{the only thing they}} have left.|$|E
5|$|In a Victorian village, Victor Van Dort, {{the son of}} nouveau riche fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot, the {{neglected}} {{daughter of}} snobbish yet impoverished aristocrats, are preparing for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of Victor's parents and restore the wealth of Victoria's penniless family. Both have concerns about marrying someone they do not know, but upon meeting for the first time, they fall for each other. After the shy Victor ruins the wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows, he flees and practices his wedding vows in the nearby forest, placing the wedding ring on a nearby upturned tree root. The root {{turns out to be}} the finger of a murdered woman in <b>a</b> <b>tattered</b> bridal gown named Emily, who rises from the grave claiming that she is now Victor's wife. After fainting, Victor wakes up and finds himself spirited away to the Land of the Dead. The bewildered Victor learns the story of how Emily was murdered years ago by an unknown perpetrator on the night of her secret elopement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{the loss of}} Franklin's {{expedition}} inspired a number of paintings in both the United States and Britain. In 1861, Frederic Edwin Church unveiled his great canvas The Icebergs; later that year, prior to taking it to England for exhibition, he added {{an image of a}} broken ship's mast in silent tribute to Franklin. In 1864, Sir Edwin Landseer's Man Proposes, God Disposes caused a stir at the annual Royal Academy exhibition; its depiction of two polar bears, one chewing on <b>a</b> <b>tattered</b> ship's ensign, the other gnawing on a human ribcage, was seen at the time as in poor taste, but has remained {{one of the most powerful}} imaginings of the expedition's final fate. The expedition also inspired numerous popular engravings and illustrations, along with many panoramas, dioramas, and magic lantern shows.|$|E

25|$|Tom Brinkman's {{opposition}} to almost everything undercuts his credibility, {{and does a}} disservice to both the district and the region. His reflexive {{opposition to}} much government spending, his willingness to tolerate <b>a</b> <b>tattered</b> social services safety net, his advocacy of an entirely unregulated concealed carry gun permit system, we submit, are out of step even with such a thoroughly Republican constituency.|$|E
25|$|Warwick {{town centre}} was gaily {{decorated}} and businesses closed {{for an hour}} to ensure a large gathering. A guard of honour was formed by the local school children waving flags. Commanding Officer, Lieutenant David Binnie, and the Warwick contingent led the march under a new Union Jack presented by the Mayor of Warwick while the Stanthorpe boys held <b>a</b> <b>tattered</b> and battle-stained Australian flag. It {{had been the first}} flag hoisted by the 9th battalion at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.|$|E

25|$|Gandhi {{inherited}} <b>a</b> <b>tattered</b> {{economy in}} her second term; harvest failures {{and a second}} oil shock in the late 1970s had again caused inflation to rise. During Charan Singh's short reign in office {{in the second half}} of 1979, inflation averaged 18.2%, compared to 6.5% during Gandhi's last year in office (1984). General economic recovery under Gandhi led to an average inflation at 6.5% from 1981–82 to 1985–86; the lowest since the beginning of India's inflation problems in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In 1888 his mother, Pilar Defilló de Casals, who {{was born}} in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico of Catalan ancestry, took him to Barcelona, where he {{enrolled}} in the Escola Municipal de Música. There he studied cello, theory, and piano. In 1890, when he was 13, he found in a second-hand sheet music store in Barcelona <b>a</b> <b>tattered</b> copy of Bach's six cello suites. He spent the next 13 years practicing them every day before he would perform them in public for the first time. Casals would later make his own version of the six suites.|$|E
25|$|A legendary blood fighter, {{considered}} a , {{founder of the}} Big Dipper style blood technique and the master of Zapp & Zed. It is not known if he is alien or human, as he lost most of his body during blood training, being only {{an arm and a}} barely visible face under <b>a</b> <b>tattered</b> robe & a wild boar skull. With a biting personality and brutal discipline of training, he and Zapp stood on acrimonious terms. Known for disappearing for decades at a time and taking down high-ranked Blood Breeds, he comes to Hellsalem's Lot while fighting the Blood Breed Herlelle Lucando Lozo Thietkaua gi Murmhavat, along the way testing Zapp and leaving Zed at the hands of Libra, before a sudden disappearance.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous version of the cricket cap in the modern setting is the baggy green cricket cap of the Australian cricket team, for which the players and fans of Australia hold a degree of reverence. The cap is treated {{with a degree of}} mysticism, and players who have long careers often refuse to replace the {{original}} one they receive as they often feel the cap is a lucky talisman. This sometimes results in players who have long careers wearing their cricket caps in quite <b>a</b> <b>tattered</b> state. The Australian side has long worn their baggy cricket cap, rather than alternatives such as a sun hat, for the first session of each match as a symbol of team solidarity.|$|E
25|$|After {{detention}} in Woking and Aylesbury prisons, Florence Maybrick {{was released}} in January 1904, having spent fourteen years in custody. Although {{she had lost her}} American citizenship when she married her British husband, she returned to the United States. Initially she earned a living on the lecture circuit, protesting her innocence. In later life, after some months spent unsuccessfully as a housekeeper, Florence became a recluse, living in a squalid three-room cabin near Gaylordsville, South Kent, Connecticut with only her cats for company. Few residents had any knowledge of Florence's true identity and the lady who had once charmed Victorian Liverpool died alone and penniless on 23 October 1941, and was buried in the grounds of South Kent School. Among her few possessions was <b>a</b> <b>tattered</b> family Bible.|$|E
25|$|John Shaw Neilson {{had little}} more {{education}} than his father. When {{about eight years}} old he was for 15 months at the state school at Penola, {{but he had to}} leave in 1881 when the family removed to Minimay in the south-west Wimmera in Victoria. There was no school at Minimay then, but four years later one was opened and Neilson attended for another 15 months. There was, however, a Bible and <b>a</b> <b>tattered</b> copy of Robert Burns' poems in the house, and when at the age of 15 a copy of Thomas Hood's poems came in his way, Neilson read them all with great joy. Driven out by drought, Neilson's father took his family to Nhill in 1889, and was employed as a farm worker and on the roads. His son soon after began to write verses of which some appeared in the local press and one in The Australasian in Melbourne.|$|E

5000|$|According to Etta James, Brown and {{his group}} {{came up with the}} idea for their first song, because Brown [...] "used to carry around <b>an</b> old <b>tattered</b> napkin with him, because Little Richard had written the words, 'please, please, please' on it and James was {{determined}} to make a song out of it".|$|R
500|$|In {{a review}} of Manson's album, his {{rendition}} of [...] "Cease to Exist" [...] was regarded as [...] "one of Manson's signature performances, and has justifiably invited comparison with Jim Croce and José Feliciano". Critic Michael Little considers Manson's version superior to the Beach Boys', having praise especially for Manson's vocals. Naturally, Little attests, [...] "you expect <b>a</b> <b>tattered,</b> raw, and raggedy voice, {{with a touch of}} lunatic rage, but what you get is a smooth-voiced folk singer". He also wrote that Manson's raw, stripped-down take [...] "gives the song an impressive lo-fi immediacy that is a million miles away from the Beach Boys' treatment".|$|E
500|$|His {{association}} with Kenshi in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance was loosely adapted for two episodes in the 2013 second season of director Kevin Tancharoen's [...] web series. Under Shao Kahn's orders, {{he serves as}} the guardian of [...] "the sword of Sento" [...] that is hidden in a cave, and strikes Kenshi blind when he attempts to take the sword. The following episode shows Ermac battling Kenshi in the Mortal Kombat tournament in attempt to repossess the sword before Kenshi fatally impales him with the weapon. Ermac was played by stuntman and martial artist Kim Do Nguyen, and he was depicted as a decaying, hooded demon outfitted in <b>a</b> <b>tattered</b> black robe, with his makeup designed by Christien Tinsley.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Aguilera {{wearing a black}} velvet kimono, with a pale {{complexion}} and long black hair, refers to a larva. Initially, she is trapped in a glass box, and her kimono is billowing like a balloon. Three Gothic ballerinas eat fruit and then collapse. Aguilera then breaks free from the box by pounding on it until it shatters. She furiously removes three moth pins from her back, and then tosses aside her kimono. <b>A</b> <b>tattered,</b> white, moth-covered dress is revealed, symbolizing her metaphoric evolution from the larva to a pupa. In addition, her hair becomes white, and moths fly around her. Near the end, Aguilera wears an Elvira-type spider dress, again proclaiming {{that she is a}} [...] "fighter".|$|E

However, his pleas were ignored and a disappointed ahbez left the sheet music of [...] "Nature Boy" [...] with Cole's valet, Otis Pollard. From him, Cole came to know of the song and loved it. Cole began playing [...] "Nature Boy" [...] for live audiences, and he received much acclaim. Irving Berlin, who was present during one of the performances, initially offered to buy the track from Cole, but Cole decided to record it for himself. He needed to get permission from ahbez, however, before releasing it as a single, but {{he was not able to}} find the songwriter since ahbez had disappeared without providing any contact details. After ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign, Cole got his permission and recorded the song.|$|E
