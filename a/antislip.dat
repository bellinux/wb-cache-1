30|$|In {{the case}} of the Gushan Mine, the Pingzhuang coal mining {{district}} of Inner Mongolia, the average thickness of seam 6 - 2 was 7.5  m; the dip angle was 28 °– 41 °, and the hardness coefficient was 0.92 – 1.03. This seam showed various degrees of contact metamorphism. As a result, part of the seam was believed to be unrecoverable. However, guaranteed by the aforementioned key technology and technological research, the safe and efficient mining was achieved under such complex conditions. Industrial tests indicated that the equipment was pretty stable in the fully mechanized top coal caving faces, and top coal recovery was as high as 80  %. This example was a typical fully mechanized top coal caving face of large dip angle with safety and high efficiency, which is a good reference for the equipment antitoppling and <b>antislip</b> in fully mechanized top coal caving faces under similar conditions.|$|E

30|$|Coated paper-to-coated paper {{friction}} properties {{were examined}} in relation to printing runnability difficulties like erroneous double feeding of paper sheets. Higher ratios of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) to clay in mixed pigment coatings resulted in higher static and kinetic coefficients of friction (COFs). Microroughness {{in the order of}} pigment particle size is considered to relate to COF, because cube-shaped particles of PCC resist sliding. Calendering decreased COF at larger amounts of PCC, but did not change COF of the sole clay formulation at all. Addition of ground calcium carbonate (GCC) decreased COF. The rate of decrease in kinetic COF with increasing number of sliding for the GCC-rich formulation was higher than that for the PCC-rich formulation, presumably because protruding parts, characteristic of the GCC-rich formulation, on the surface were selectively flattened. Addition of styrene-butadiene (SB)-latex up to 14 pph decreased COF, but static COF had the highest value at 18 pph. The <b>antislip</b> property (as a rubber) of SB-latex developed only in the static mode. Among lubricants formulated, the wax type decreased COF the most remarkably with more effect on kinetic COF than on static COF.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTo {{identify}} {{the impact of}} weight, table surface, and table type on slipping in a simulation of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. MethodsA mannequin was placed into increasing Trendelenburg until a slip was observed; the table angle {{at the time of}} the event was measured (slip angle). The influence of mannequin position (supine vs. lithotomy), weight, table surface, and model was evaluated. A linear regression model was used to analyze the data. ResultsMannequin weight, bed surface, and bed type all significantly impacted the slip angles. In general, higher mannequin weights tolerated significantly more Trendelenburg before slipping in the supine position but less in lithotomy compared to lower weights. In lithotomy, the disposable sheet and gelpad performed worse than the bean bag, egg crate foam, and bedsheet. There was no difference in slipping because of bed surface in the supine model. The Skytron operating table performed significantly better than the Steris operating table when tested with the bedsheet. ConclusionOperative position, patient weight, and bed surface together influence the slipping propensity. In lithotomy, heavier patients were more prone to slipping while the inverse was true in supine. The egg crate foam, bean bag, and bedsheet were the best <b>antislip</b> surfaces.

40|$|The {{proportion}} of elderly {{in the society}} increases and fall frequency increases with advancing age. Many falls result in fractures and also soft tissue injuries, longstanding pain, functional impairment, reduced quality of life, increased mortality, and excess in healthcare costs. Due to the magnitude of these negative effects, a variety of single- and multicomponent fall-preventive intervention programs has been initiated. This review identifies programs that, in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), have been shown with fall-reductive effects. The most effective strategies in community-dwelling elderly include regular physical training with program that includes several different training modalities. Modification of the overall or patient-specific risk factor profile in home hazard modification program has been proven to decrease fall risk in community-living elderly. The elderly in the community benefit also from wearing <b>antislip</b> shoe devices when walking in icy conditions, from adjustment of psychotropic medication, and from structured modification of multipharmacy. If vitamin D levels in blood are low, supplementation is beneficial as is the first eye cataract surgery and pacemaker implantation in patients with cardioinhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity. In addition to modification of specific risk factors, generalized and individualized multifactorial preventive programs, all including some sort of physical training, {{have been found to}} decrease the fall risk. In summary, there is now strong evidence in the literature that structured fall-preventive programs in the elderly, especially in high-risk groups, are beneficial in reducing both the number of fallers and the number of falls in community...|$|E

40|$|To better {{understand}} the physical mechanisms of slow slip events (SSEs) detected worldwide, we explore the scaling relationships of various source parameters and compare them with similar scaling laws for earthquakes. These scaling relationships highlight differences and similarities between slow slip events and earthquakes and hold implications for the degree of heterogeneity and fault-healing characteristics. That static drop remains constant for different-sized events as is observed for earthquakes. However, the static stress drop of slow slop events is within a range of 0. 01 - 1. 0 MPa, 1 - 2 orders of magnitiude lower than that found for earthquakes, which {{could be related to}} the low stress state on the fault. The average rupture velocity, ranging from kilometers per second to kilometers per day, decreases linearly with increasing seismic moment in log-log space, unlike earthquakes that are nearly constant. This inverse relationship of rupture velocity with seismic moment could be related to the heterogeneity of fault properties. Slow slip events typically have ratios of event duration over dislocation rise time less than 3, while earthquakes have ratios greater than 3. This indicates that slow slip events are less pulselike than earthquakes in their mode of propagation and suggests that the healing behind the rupture front is delayed. The recurrence statistics of slow slip events on the northern Cascadia subduction zone are weakly time predictable and moderately <b>antislip</b> predictable (that is, the event size and preevent recurrence interval are anticorrelated), which may indicate that healing between events strengthens the fault with time...|$|E

To resolve the global technical problems in stability control of the FMM equipment used in seams with large dip angle, China Coal Technology & Engineering Group Corp. invented hydraulic supports suitable to seams with large dip angle on the basis of many years of research and development, creatively established supporting systems for the FMM/full mechanized top coal caving faces with large dip angles, and solved the key technical problems associated with anti-toppling equipment and stability control of hydraulic supports used in seams with large dip angles of 35 °– 55 °. Moreover, the company developed a coupling mechanical model for hydraulic supports used in seams with large dip angles and surrounding rock, provided stability control strategy for hydraulic supports used in seams with large dip angles, and creatively developed a “self-support, adjacent support pulling, bottom pushing, top extrusion” antitoppling and <b>antislip</b> mechanism coupling hardness with softness and a three-dimensional (3 D) protective device for hydraulic supports.

40|$|M. Ing. Adaptive {{traction}} control can greatly enhance {{the mobility of}} vehicles on varying road surfaces. Traction control includes Antilock Braking Systems (ABS) and <b>Antislip</b> Regulation Systems (ASR). During braking, wheel slip is controlled with ABS, while wheel slip during acceleration is controlled by an ASR. Since the friction between a vehicle's tyre and the road surface {{is a function of}} wheel slip, there is an optimum wheel slip value at which the best road holding performance can be achieved. This optimum wheel slip value will however change with differing road surfaces and vehicle speeds. Optimising the wheel slip values has several advantages: both vehicle stopping and acceleration distances can be optimised, vehicle handling during in-turn braking and acceleration are optimised and tyre wear is reduced. Currently there are various ABS and ASR systems available, with the common goal of optimising wheel slip. These systems are however mechanically complex, while the operation of both these systems is usually triggered when some wheel slip value is exceeded. Differing road surfaces can greatly influence the effectiveness of these systems. The central theme of this research is the development of a fuzzy logic control algorithm for vehicle {{traction control}}. The control algorithm is tested with an experimental setup. The operating conditions experienced by an ABS are closely simulated in order to study the feasibility of fuzzy logic for traction control. The results obtained indicates the viability of fuzzy logic for wheel slip control. Confirmation of these results, obtained with the experimental ABS, have to be validated during vehicle testing. The main goal is to improve the performances of existing traction control systems and the feasibility of fuzzy controllers in automobile applications...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{treatment}} methods based on mechanical tools, sand blasting and flaming lead to undesirable {{features such as}} chromatic modifications, production of micro-cracks, mechanical alterations. Water jetting {{is a relatively new}} process of stone surface treatment based on the action of very high velocity water jets generated at constant pressure. Water jet treated stone surfaces are of higher level of aesthetical appearance than the other methods It is used to increase the roughness to improve its <b>antislip</b> properties while preserving aesthetic appearance of the stone without having thermal shock, mechanical stress and the production of fumes and dust. Therefore roughness is the most important performance parameters in stone surface treatment with a water jet. Because of this, {{the purpose of this study}} is to determine the effects of different operational parameters such as; traverse velocity, standoff distance and pump pressure on performance parameter namely roughness in stone surface treatment with a water jet by using Italian basalt natural stone samples, commercially referred to as Sardinian Basalt. 27 surface treatment tests were performed using the Water Jet Cutting-Surface Treatment Machine with a constant nozzle diameter of 0. 3 mm at varying standoff distances (50, 100 and 150 mm), traverse velocities (15, 20, 25 m/min) and pump pressures (200, 250, 300 MPa). After each surface treatment, roughness measurements were performed on all of the treated surfaces in two perpendicular directions by using Mitutoyo SJ- 400 roughness measurement equipment. The roughness parameter [absolute deviation (Ra) ] was then calculated. Absolute deviation can be defined as the average of the absolute deviations of height from the mean. The data obtained from this study were evaluated graphically and the relationships between operational parameters and roughness values were put forth. As a result of this study, it is observed that operational parameters have direct effects on performance namely roughness in surface treatment with water jet...|$|E
