During the 3,000 years that Kanaks lived in the remote islands, they were unprepared for the arrival of European viruses and bacteria.

5|$|The 1896 {{establishment}} of the Gympie Truth, a newspaper {{that he was to}} partly own, was part of his response. Intended as a medium to broadcast Labour's message, the newspaper played a vital role in Fisher's return to parliament in 1899. This time, he was the beneficiary of a scare campaign, in which conservative candidate Francis Power was consistently painted by the Gympie Truth as being a supporter of black labour and the alleged economic and social ills that accompanied it. In that year he was Secretary for Railways <b>and</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Works</b> in the seven-day government of Anderson Dawson, the first parliamentary Labour government in the world.|$|E

5|$|Bernier {{went on to}} win his {{election}} in Beauce with 62% of the vote. Harper won re-election as prime-minister; he did not appoint Bernier to a cabinet position. Bernier would eventually return to the cabinet following the 2011 election, in which the Conservatives won a majority government, as Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism. Bernier continues to sit as an MP, and is currently a candidate for the Conservative Party leadership. Stemming from Couillard's actions during the entire affair, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) launched investigations on how she obtained the secret documents; on whether Couillard's mother was offered a patronage appointment by a Conservative Party official to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada; and on whether there was influence peddling during the land sale between the Kevlar Group <b>and</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Works.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dunstan {{wasted no}} time in organising his new ministry, taking several {{portfolios}} for himself, and again taking the position of Treasurer of South Australia. Deputy Premier Des Corcoran took on most infrastructure portfolios—Marine and Harbours, <b>and</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Works.</b> Corcoran became the face of the Dunstan ministry in its relationship with the Labor caucus, with his ability to use his strong manner to settle disputes. Bert Shard became Health Minister, overseeing the construction and planning of new, major public hospitals: the Flinders Medical Centre and Modbury Hospital. Hugh Hudson took on the Education portfolio, an important role in a government that was determined to bring about profound change to the South Australian education system. Geoff Virgo, the new Transport Minister, was to deal with the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS) plans. Len King was made Attorney-General and Aboriginal Affairs Minister despite being a new member of parliament. Dunstan formed a strong circle of loyal ministers around him, in a style radically different from his predecessors.|$|E
5|$|He {{served as}} the first head of the newly created Ministry of Agriculture, Commerce <b>and</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Works</b> from 2 March 1861 until 21 April.

The cabinet resigned on 24 May 1862 after losing its majority in the Chamber of Deputies (the national legislature's lower house).

5|$|Most Catholic clergy in Buenos Aires willingly backed Rosas' regime. The Jesuits, {{the only}} ones who refused to do so, were {{expelled}} from the country. The lower social strata in Buenos Aires, which formed the vast majority of its populace, experienced no improvement in the conditions under which they lived. When Rosas slashed expenditures, he cut resources from education, social services, general welfare <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>works.</b> None of the lands confiscated from Indians and Unitarians were turned over to rural workers, including gauchos. Black people did not experience any improvement in their conditions either. Rosas was himself a slave-owner, and helped revive the slave trade. Despite doing little to promote their interests, he remained popular among blacks and gauchos. He employed blacks, patronized their festivities and attended their candombles. The gauchos admired his leadership and willingness to fraternize with them to some extent.|$|E
5|$|The Fairbanks economy, which briefly boomed in {{the period}} between the {{discovery}} of oil and the legal challenge, stagnated as legal challenges dragged on. The challenges were ended by approval of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act in late 1973. When pipeline work began in early 1974, it sparked a boom in Fairbanks unlike anything since the years immediately after the city's founding. Alyeska Pipeline Service Company alone spent an estimated $800,000 a day in Fairbanks, which housed the construction headquarters on Fort Wainwright. Tens of thousands of workers poured into the city, straining the economy, infrastructure, <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>works.</b> The population of the Fairbanks North Star Borough increased by 40 percent between 1973 and 1976. The number of businesses in the area doubled during the same period.|$|E
5|$|The Raid on Saint Paul was an {{important}} demonstration of Rowley's ability to strike at the French anchorages directly. Landing men at unwatched beaches, the British soldiers, sailors and Royal Marines of the landing party were able to storm the defences from the landward side and rout the defenders. This allowed Rowley's squadron to enter the harbour and capture Caroline {{and a number of}} smaller ships that were docked there. The attack caused consternation on the island and its commander, Nicolas Des Bruslys, committed suicide rather than order his troops to attack the British positions. Unopposed, Rowley was able to destroy the defences <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>works</b> in the town before leaving with large quantities of captured supplies and ships.
