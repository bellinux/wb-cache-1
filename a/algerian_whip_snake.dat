40|$|All snakes {{currently}} {{present on}} the Maltese Islands belong to the family Colubridae, all members of which are non-poisonous to man. Some colubrids, exemplified by the local Cat Snake; have fangs {{at the back of}} the mouth. Though technically venomous, bites from these snakes are harmless to humans. The other Maltese snakes include the harmless Black Whip Snake, the Leopard Snake and the <b>Algerian</b> <b>Whip</b> <b>Snake.</b> Snakes are usually fairly timid creatures and they only bite humans in defence, when touched, trodden upon or cornered. When they strike, they do so with amazing speed, usually at the legs or hands of their attacker. In the majority of instances snakes prefer to avoid human contact. N/...|$|E
