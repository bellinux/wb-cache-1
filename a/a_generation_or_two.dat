25|$|By the mid-eighties {{the stock}} of {{purebred}} mares had dwindled to just a handful, though there were some mares only <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> removed. In 1983 a group of supporters formed a special breed association {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Weser-Ems Studbook, approving stallions that were half-Hanoverian, half-Ostfriesen or Alt-Oldenburg. However, as the mares themselves were typically only halfbred, the foals did not have the desired type, and furthermore the genepool was simply too small. To replenish it, the breeders looked to the studs where Ostfriesen/Alt-Oldenburger stallions had stood for generations, picking up a few horses here and there. More horses came from greater strongholds: Silesian Heavy Warmbloods of Poland, the Danish Oldenbourgs, and the Groningen horse of the Netherlands. But the efforts of Dr. Herta Steiner, Moritzburg State Stud Equerry, were the keystone to saving the breed. She had championed for the last remaining heavy warmbloods in Saxony and Thuringia. Soon the old type was revived.|$|E

25|$|Giovanni died in 1429. According to Lorenzo, {{his fortune}} upon {{his death was}} worth around 180,000 gold florins. His death did not greatly affect the bank's operations, and the {{transition}} to Cosimo went smoothly, aided by Ilarione, who was retained as ministro. Fortunately for the bank, Lorenzo di Giovanni di Bicci de Medici was on excellent terms with Cosimo, and did not insist on dissolving the partnerships so he could receive {{his share of the}} patrimony (primogeniture not being operative here); many Florentine banks and mercantile businesses lasted only <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> because some of the inheriting sons usually wished to strike out on their own. At this time, the Medici bank was flourishing: besides the branches in Rome and Florence, the Venetian and Genevan branches had been founded. Ilarione would not last long in his position, and is mentioned as dead in a letter written in February 1433. The timing was unfortunate because the Albizzi government of Florence was moving against the young Medici-led resistance (galvanized by the Albizzi government's failure in a war against Lucca and Milan), culminating in Cosimo's exile to Venice. Despite the unfavorable politics in this period of the bank's history, its Italian branches turned in bumper profits, with as much as 62% of the total coming from Rome (in 1427, the Roman branch of the Medici bank had approximately 100,000 florins on deposit from the Papal Curia; in comparison, the total capitalization of the entire Medici bank was only about 25,000 gold florins) and 13% from Venice between 1420 and 1435 (with the later Medici branches opened in Bruges, London, Pisa, Avignon, Milan, and Lyon contributing nothing as they had not been founded yet). At this time, there seems to have been some sort of Medici office in Basel, and it seems to have lasted until 1443. De Roover speculates that it was a sub-branch of the Medici bank's Geneva branch serving the General Council of the Church, and was closed when the Council no longer made it worth their while to maintain it.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> ago, {{many colleges}} with music {{programs}} now offer {{students the opportunity}} to major in euphonium. [...] However, due to the small number of euphonium students at most schools (2–4 is common), it is possible, and even likely, that they will study with a professor whose major instrument is not the euphonium. [...] Most often tubas and euphoniums will be combined into a studio taught by one professor, and at small schools they may be grouped with trombones and/or French horns as well, taught by one low brass professor. Universities will usually require professors in this situation to have a high level of proficiency on all the instruments they teach, and some of the best college euphonium studios are taught by non-euphonium players.|$|E
50|$|The family {{organization}} {{was based on}} these two patterns to avoid the partitioning of their estates. <b>A</b> <b>generation</b> with <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more conjugal families was seen as unstable because it could produce serious conflicts that could divide their corporate family land.

5000|$|Social {{mobility}} is {{the movement}} of individuals, social groups or categories of people between the layers or strata in a stratification system. This movement can be intragenerational (within <b>a</b> <b>generation)</b> <b>or</b> intergenerational (between <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more <b>generations).</b> Such mobility is sometimes used to classify different systems of social stratification. Open stratification systems are those that allow for mobility between strata, typically by placing value on the achieved status characteristics of individuals. Those societies having {{the highest levels of}} intragenerational mobility are considered to be the most open and malleable systems of stratification. [...] Those systems in which there is little to no mobility, even on an intergenerational basis, are considered closed stratification systems. For example, in caste systems, all aspects of social status are ascribed, such that one's social position at birth is the position one holds for a lifetime.|$|R
60|$|As {{neither side}} would yield, the higher {{authorities}} were compelled {{to settle the}} matter for them, and ordered the cost to be divided between the two parishes, the gibbet to be erected on the boundary line, {{as far as it}} could be ascertained. This was accordingly done, the gibbet being erected at the highest point crossed by the line, on a stretch of beautiful smooth elastic turf, among prehistoric earthworks--a spot commanding one of the finest and most extensive views in Southern England. The day appointed for the execution brought the greatest concourse of people ever witnessed at that lofty spot, at all events since prehistoric times. If some of the ancient Britons had come out of their graves to look on, seated on their earthworks, they would have probably rubbed their ghostly hands together and remarked to each other that it reminded them of old times. All classes were there, from the nobility and gentry, on horseback and in great coaches in which they carried their own provisions, to the meaner sort who had trudged from all the country round on foot, and those who had not brought their own food and beer were catered for by traders in carts. The crowd was a hilarious one, and no doubt that grand picnic on the beacon was the talk of they country for <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> longer. The <b>two</b> wretches having been hanged in chains on one gibbet were left to be eaten by ravens, crows, and magpipes, and dried by sun and winds, until, after long years, the swinging, creaking skeletons with their chains on fell to pieces and were covered with the turf, but the gibbet itself was never removed.|$|R
2500|$|Refuge in Israel was {{not without}} its tragedies: [...] "in <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> millennia of rooted Oriental civilization, unified even in its diversity,” had been wiped out, writes Mizrahi scholar Ella Shohat. The trauma of rupture from their {{countries}} of origin was further complicated by {{the difficulty of the}} transition upon arrival in Israel; Mizrahi immigrants and refugees were placed in rudimentary and hastily erected tent cities (Ma'abarot) often in development towns on the peripheries of Israel. Settlement in Moshavim (cooperative farming villages) was only partially successful, because Mizrahim had historically filled a niche as craftsmen and merchants and most did not traditionally engage in farmwork. As the majority left their property behind in their home countries as they journeyed to Israel, many suffered a severe decrease in their socio-economic status aggravated by their cultural and political differences with the dominant Ashkenazi community. Furthermore, a policy of austerity was enforced at that time due to economic hardships.|$|E

40|$|In most respects, {{this was}} a routine spring. While a few rarities and several {{interesting}} reports appeared, perhaps most interesting was {{the arrival of the}} electronic age. Foremost was the start-up of 2 ̆ 2 NEBIRDS, 2 ̆ 2 the Nebraska Birding Listserver set up and operated by Robert Price at Kearney. This resource should greatly enhance communication and collective learning amongst birders in the state. We have culled several reports from observations submitted to NEBIRDS, and several reporters now contact us by email. We urge observers to forward their email addresses; if we have questions on their reports, communication would be easy! Submit reports and comments to Ross Silcock by email at silcock@sidney. heartland. net. We also gather sightings reported to the Nebraska Birdline, operated by Loren and Babs Padelford at Bellevue; these reports are placed on the Internet through BIRDCNTR, a service of the National Bird Hotline Cooperative. We should note here that this report contains unverified observations as well as documented observations. And now to the birds! Considerable discussion has taken place about a very 2 ̆ 2 slow 2 ̆ 2 warbler migration, 2 ̆ 2 slow 2 ̆ 2 for birders, meaning low numbers of birds, While this is true, most species were indeed found, although very low numbers were found of Magnolia, Black-throated Green, Blackburnian, and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, and those that were reported occurred rather late in the migration period. Usually when we do not see many migrating warblers it means they have made long, non-stop flights with beneficial tailwinds right over us to their breeding ranges. Much has been made of the scarcity of migrant warblers this spring in the eastern United States, with blame allocated to habitat loss in the tropical wintering ranges, to forest fragmentation in the breeding ranges (in particular with the result of allowing cowbird access to deep-woods birds), and to extensive smoke encountered while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. The smoke, from major fires in Mexico, may have contributed to a slower migration for some species, but we will have to be patient (<b>a</b> human <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> <b>two?)</b> to see what if anything is actually happening. Joel Jorgensen, who did weekly surveys of the eastern Rainwater Basin in April and May, gathered important shorebird data. These data are presented in the relevant shorebird species accounts. Although few early and late dates were set, a few amazing high counts occurred during the report period: for example, 39 Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Grebes, 236 Horned Grebes, and 1, 732 McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspurs. Some interesting waterfowl appeared in the Rainwater Basin this spring, suggesting that scrutiny of the immense flocks can yield exciting discoveries: 2 nd state Bean Goose, 2 nd state Garganey, and even a Barnacle Goose, probably not a wild bird. Additional rarities of note included a 1 st documented spring Red-throated Loon, 5 th and 6 th state Neotropic Cormorants, 4 th nesting record White-faced Ibis, 3 Eurasian Wigeon, a 3 rd documented spring Surf Scoter, 4 th state Ruff, 1 st state Short-billed Dowitcher of the eastern subspecies Limnodromus griseus griseus, 10 th and 11 th individual Mew Gulls for the state, 1 st May Glaucous Gull, nesting Eurasian Collared-Doves, a possible nesting population of Monk Parakeets, 6 th southeast Nebraska Say 2 ̆ 7 s Phoebe, documented nesting Pinyon Jays south of Redington, at least 13 Blue-gray Gnatcatchers in the Panhandle, 2 nd state Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler, 10 th spring Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler, 2 nd spring Panhandle Prothonotary Warbler, 2 Hooded Warblers, the lingering of an Omaha Black-throated Sparrow until 12 April, a photographed Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow in York Co, and the 2 nd Panhandle breeding record for Great-tailed Grackle...|$|R
