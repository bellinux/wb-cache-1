5|$|The Kibble balance {{requires}} extremely {{precise measurement}} of the local gravitational <b>acceleration</b> <b>g</b> in the laboratory, using a gravimeter. For instance, the NIST compensates for Earth's gravity gradient of 309µGal per metre when the elevation {{of the center of}} the gravimeter differs from that of the nearby test mass in the Kibble balance; a change in the weight of a one-kilogram test mass that equates to about 316µg/m.|$|E
25|$|Most often, {{the known}} wave {{parameters}} are the wave height H, mean water depth h, gravitational <b>acceleration</b> <b>g,</b> and either the wavelength λ {{or else the}} period τ. Then the above relations for λ, c and τ are used to find the elliptic parameter m. This requires numerical solution by some iterative method.|$|E
500|$|Gravity and {{the nature}} of the Kibble balance, which oscillates test masses up and down against the local {{gravitational}} <b>acceleration</b> <b>g,</b> are exploited so that mechanical power is compared against electrical power, which is the square of voltage divided by electrical resistance. However, g varies significantly—by nearly 1%—depending on where on the Earth's surface the measurement is made (see Earth's gravity). There are also slight seasonal variations in g due to changes in underground water tables, and larger semimonthly and diurnal changes due to tidal distortions in the Earth's shape caused by the Moon. Although g would not be a term in the definition of the kilogram, it would be crucial in the delineation of the kilogram when relating energy to power. Accordingly, g must be measured with at least as much precision and accuracy as are the other terms, so measurements of g must also be traceable to fundamental constants of nature. For the most precise work in mass metrology, g is measured using dropping-mass absolute gravimeters that contain an iodine-stabilized helium–neon laser interferometer. The fringe-signal, frequency-sweep output from the interferometer is measured with a rubidium atomic clock. Since this type of dropping-mass gravimeter derives its accuracy and stability from the constancy of the speed of light as well as the innate properties of helium, neon, and rubidium atoms, the 'gravity' term in the delineation of an all-electronic kilogram is also measured in terms of invariants of nature—and with very high precision. For instance, in the basement of the NIST's Gaithersburg facility in 2009, when measuring the gravity acting upon Pt10Ir test masses (which are denser, smaller, and have a slightly lower center of gravity inside the Kibble balance than stainless steel masses), the measured value was typically within 8ppb of [...]|$|E
