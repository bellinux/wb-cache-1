5|$|After {{this section}} of the game, the player takes control of Jade. Katarn reveals that he has {{discovered}} information as to the whereabouts of a Sith temple on Dromund Kaas. He leaves for the temple, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> Jade must take on new assignments for the Republic and continue her studies of the Force.|$|E
5|$|San {{hunter and}} gatherers, {{ancestors}} of the Khoisani peoples, were the first known inhabitants of the region that is now Mozambique, followed in the 1st and 4th centuries by Bantu-speaking peoples who migrated there across the Zambezi River. In 1498, Portuguese explorers landed on the Mozambican coastline. Portugal's influence in East Africa grew throughout the 16th century; she established several colonies known collectively as Portuguese East Africa. Slavery and gold became profitable for the Europeans; influence was largely exercised through individual settlers {{and there was no}} centralised administration <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> Portugal had turned her attention to India and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The roll of honour was not {{completed}} as quickly. After {{a series of}} budget reductions, it was delivered in June 1929 but was of poor quality, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> the trustees of the castle museum had decided that the castle was not an appropriate place for the roll to be kept. It had also exceeded the reduced budget of £500, though Lutyens waived his fee and offered to pay the difference. The trustees changed their minds after improvements {{were made to the}} quality, and the roll of honour was installed in the castle on 13 January 1931 without ceremony as a result of embarrassment over the delay.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 it {{has been}} decided to issue a new edition (Editorial board: Paul Hawkshaw, Thomas Leibnitz, Andreas Lindner, Angela Pachovsky, Thomas Röder), which will include {{the content of the}} current edition <b>and</b> {{integrate}} <b>the</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> retrieved sources.|$|R
50|$|Finally in 1902 Bellesheim was {{appointed}} as provost at the Aachen Cathedral and he practised this ministry {{until his death}} <b>in</b> 1912 <b>and</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> honoured with <b>the</b> title as a Protonotary apostolic.|$|R
50|$|Girls in Hawaii's first {{release was}} Found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ground: <b>The</b> Winter EP <b>in</b> early 2003, {{after which the}} band toured through Belgium <b>and</b> France. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> they started {{recording}} what would become their first LP.|$|R
5|$|Shepard was {{assigned}} to Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42), flying the Vought F4U Corsair. The squadron was nominally based on the aircraft carrier , but the ship was being overhauled at the time Shepard arrived, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> the squadron was based at Naval Air Station Norfolk in Virginia. He departed on his first cruise, of the Caribbean, on Franklin D. Roosevelt with VF-42 in 1948. Most of the aviators were, like Shepard, on their first assignment. Those that were not were {{given the opportunity to}} qualify for night landings on a carrier, a dangerous maneuver, especially in a Corsair, which had to bank sharply on approach. Shepard managed to persuade his squadron commander to allow him to qualify as well. After briefly returning to Norfolk, the carrier set out on a nine-month tour of the Mediterranean Sea. He earned a reputation for carousing and chasing women. He also instituted a ritual of, whenever he could, calling Louise at 17:00 (her time) each day.|$|E
5|$|Benbow {{was soon}} at sea again in March 1695, being {{appointed}} commander-in-chief of His Majesty's ships {{which were then}} {{off the coast of}} France. His squadron was highly successful, taking a number of French merchants in early April and bringing them to England as prizes. Benbow was recommended by Lord Berkeley, who had served with Benbow at Saint-Malo, to be promoted to rear-admiral at the next opportunity, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> he was appointed to the command of the 70-gun HMS Northumberland. He was soon joined by a volunteer – his then fourteen-year-old son – also named John Benbow. Benbow then sailed with Berkeley and the Dutch lieutenant-admiral Philips van Almonde to Saint-Malo, intending to operate against privateering operations being conducted from the area. Benbow moved to command HMS Charles Galley, to direct the inshore operations of ten English and Dutch warships, nine English bomb vessels, and seventeen small boats and vessels. They began operations on their arrival off Saint-Malo on 4 July, remaining in action until evening the next day when they withdrew, without having achieved any decisive result. Several houses had been destroyed for the damage and loss of a few of the bomb vessels. Benbow was given eight bomb vessels and seven or eight frigates and was dispatched down the coast. He attacked Granville on 8 July, shelling it with over 900 bombs over several hours, and departed having set the town ablaze.|$|E
5|$|Lafontaine had hesitated {{over the}} 24 hours since the {{afternoon}} of 13 May. He spent hours reconnoitring the terrain, sometimes trying to contain and reason with fleeing, routing scores of French infantrymen and artillerymen of the 55th and 71st Infantry Divisions, and travelling around the area to various regimental headquarters, looking for his Corps commander, General Gransard (whom was deliberately reconnoitring the terrain, for some time, at that relative point in time), for an order to attack, <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> extemporarily assessing and conferring with some local command personnel. Owing to this Lafontaine also delayed issuing orders to the tactical attack units until 05:00 on 14 May, by which time the Germans had consolidated their bridgehead and the Panzer divisions' combined arms infantry teams were already advancing inland to Bulson. Lafontaine had had a mission plan since 20:00 on 13 May to defeat the Germans and retake the Meuse bridgeheads, but he waited for an order to proceed. Lafontaine's need for an order was contrary to the unit actions of the Germans, who operated the tactically more efficient Auftragstaktik (Mission Command) system. Ultimately, Lafontaine had squandered valuable hours essential for a prompt, perhaps opportune and timely, perhaps potentially decisive counter-attack effort.|$|E
50|$|Hostilities {{began again}} {{on the night of}} December 13 <b>and</b> 14. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> {{epidemic}} typhus had begun to spread within the walls of Gaeta: Francis' field adjutant was himself struck down and died on December 12.|$|R
50|$|He {{studied in}} primary school {{for six years}} in Baldovinești, after being held back twice. He then earned his living as an {{apprentice}} to a tavern-keeper, then as a pastry cook <b>and</b> peddler. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> he was a prolific reader.|$|R
50|$|After {{the battle}} of Filottrano (July 1944), Italian troops {{were sent to the}} rear lines to rest <b>and</b> re-train. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> they were re-kitted with {{standard}} British/Commonwealth equipment including Battle Dress uniforms and helmets (mostly new and not taken off corpses as hearsay sometimes has it).|$|R
5|$|On August 20, 2003, Delaware {{officials}} unveiled {{plans at}} a public workshop for a new bridge to replace the 1965 bridge and its 1976 addition. A tied-arch design spanning the inlet slightly west of the 1976 addition to the 1965 bridge, the new bridge {{would have had the}} longest arched span in the world, with a length of 1,000 feet (305 meters). With an estimated cost of $65 million, the new bridge would have had no piers in the water, avoiding the scouring problems that had plagued the earlier spans. Delaware officials hoped that work could begin in the autumn of 2004 and be completed two years later. However, the tied-arch design deterred all but one bidder on the construction contract, and that bid came in much higher than expected and was more than DelDOT could afford at the time. By the autumn of 2005, a $200 million shortfall in the state transportation budget had delayed construction projects all over Delaware and forced the state to put plans for the new bridge on hold, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> rising labor and materials costs drove the cost of the bridge up to $200 million, $50 million above the budget.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was {{originally}} offered to Michael Keaton, but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After Matthew Fox's casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim. The pilot wound up being played by Greg Grunberg, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects. Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She {{was not going to be}} a fugitive, instead her husband was going to go to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's (L. Scott Caldwell) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.|$|E

50|$|Estigarribia {{advanced}} unopposed to the south, {{taking on}} São Borja <b>and</b> Itaqui. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> Estigarribias's column was attacked and partially destroyed {{on the outskirts}} of São Borja, in combating Mbuty. Some of the Paraguayan forces were stationed <b>in</b> Sao Tome <b>and</b> São Borja while Duarte was heading south.|$|R
50|$|Dorothy McGuire {{was cast}} as Cooper's wife after Wyler's choice, Katharine Hepburn, declined. It was Perkins' second film, after his debut <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1953 film The Actress; his Broadway success with Tea <b>and</b> Sympathy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> tempted him {{to remain on}} the stage, though {{ultimately}} he decided to do the film.|$|R
50|$|A {{son of a}} {{military}} father and a housewife mother, he was born <b>in</b> Tehran <b>and</b> grew up <b>in</b> Mashhad. He started performing <b>in</b> plays at <b>the</b> age of 12.

25|$|The {{result of}} this new {{offensive}} was another failure for Francis I. In Flanders, the army of Maarten van Rossum, supported by a German army under the Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, came up against a strong Imperial-Spanish defense of Leuven and Antwerp. The Duke of Orleans attacked Luxembourg, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> in Piedmont, the French army only managed to capture some towns due to the cunning of Claude d'Annebault.|$|E
25|$|On 13 September 1923, General Miguel Primo de Rivera, at {{the time}} Captain General of Barcelona, led a {{military}} revolt against the parliamentary government, and established himself as dictator. He proposed to keep the dictatorship in place long enough {{to clean up the}} mess created by the politicians, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> he would use the state to modernize the economy and alleviate the problems of the working class.|$|E
25|$|Cook {{departed}} from Plymouth on 26 August 1768, carrying 94people and 18 months of provisions. The ship rounded Cape Horn and continued westward across the Pacific {{to arrive at}} Matavai Bay, Tahiti on 13 April 1769, where the observations were to be made. The transit was scheduled to occur on 3 June, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> he commissioned {{the building of a}} small fort and observatory at what is now known as Point Venus.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 1895, <b>the</b> International Skating Union {{organized}} the first World Figure Skating Championships committee, {{which consisted of}} 5 people.

5|$|A second Anglo-Franco-Hellenic {{force would}} then attack the 1st Bulgarian Army between Kožuf and Lake Doiran, {{preventing}} it from forming new defensive positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The initial advance {{would allow the}} Armée d'Orient to progress in support of other units first to Prilep, Disma <b>and</b> Borran. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> an Anglo-Hellenic force would strike Mount Belasica, occupying the Rupel Pass.|$|R
25|$|When the First Balkan War broke out, {{members of}} the Balkan League {{captured}} most of the territory that was promised to be Albanian Vilayet in period October—December 1912. Balkan allies planned the partition of the European territory of the Ottoman Empire among them <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> the conquered territory was agreed to have status of the Condominium. The final fate of the captured territory was {{to be decided by}} the Treaty of London and Treaty of Bucharest.|$|E
25|$|The city {{played an}} {{important}} role in the Great Siege of Malta of 1565, when it was repeatedly attacked by the invading Ottoman forces. It did not fall, and was given the title of Città Invicta (unconquered city). After the siege, the Order began to build its new capital of Valletta, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> Senglea was neglected. The architect Francesco Laparelli even proposed that the city should be razed. Eventually, this proposal was ignored and the city's defences were repaired, being completed by 1581.|$|E
25|$|Coke spent a {{considerable}} amount of time {{trying to figure out where}} it had made a mistake, ultimately concluding that it had underestimated the public reaction of the portion of the customer base that would be alienated by the switch. This would not emerge for several years afterward, however, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> the public simply concluded that the company had, as Keough suggested, failed to consider the public's attachment to the idea of what Coke's old formula represented. While that has become conventional wisdom in the ensuing years, some analyses have suggested otherwise.|$|E
50|$|In 1882 he {{accompanied}} Sir Garnet Wolseley to Egypt as brigadier general, and {{his forces}} {{had a great}} share <b>in</b> <b>the</b> victorious campaign against Urabi Pasha. In 1884 he took the field against Osman Digna, whose army he defeated at El-Teb <b>and</b> Tamai. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> he had urged {{a plan for the}} assistance of Gordon, which, however, was not accepted.|$|R
50|$|Governor William Gooch {{urged that}} the Capitol be rebuilt, but many legislators {{preferred}} relocating {{the government to}} a city more accessible to trade <b>and</b> navigation. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> <b>the</b> burgesses met again at the nearby Wren Building. Finally, in November 1748, reconstruction of the Capitol was approved (by only two votes: 40 to 38). The burgesses met inside {{for the first time}} on November 1, 1753.|$|R
50|$|Besides his History, Belknap {{began work}} on an American biographical {{dictionary}} in 1779. This effort caused him to begin corresponding {{with many of the}} leading men of letters, politics, and religion throughout the colonies. He would eventually publish his American Biographies in two volumes <b>in</b> 1794 <b>and</b> 1798. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> his efforts brought him to the attention of intellectual leaders across the country.|$|R
25|$|Japanese Canadians {{tried to}} resist the forced sale of their properties. At an {{internment}} camp in Kaslo, BC, Japanese-Canadian property owners formed the “Japanese Property Owners’ Association” with branches at other internment camps across BC. Their aim was to explore the possibilities for legal action, and in May 1944 they launched a claim with the Exchequer Court in Ottawa. The claim was delayed in courts until August 28, 1947, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> approximately $11.5 million worth of Japanese-Canadian property had been sold for just over $5 million.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{trenches}} at launch pad 39A that channels flames {{away from the}} shuttle during lift-off was significantly damaged. The subsequent mishap investigation found that the damage {{was the result of}} carbonation of epoxy and corrosion of steel anchors which held the refractory bricks in place. These had been exacerbated by the fact that hydrochloric acid is an exhaust by-product of the solid rocket boosters. Repairs to the trench were completed before the STS-125 mission's then scheduled launch attempt on 8 October 2008. In fact STS-125 finally launched in May 2009, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> STS-126 (November 2008) and STS-119 (March 2009) had both been successfully launched from pad 39A.|$|E
25|$|Finally in 1937 the B {{bought the}} first {{multiple}} unit diesel locomotives to power its passenger trains. And in 1937 they ran the first {{coast to coast}} use of diesel electric locomotives. The railroad {{put an end to}} the steam locomotive experiments, though wartime pressures would lead to purchase of many other new steam locomotives. Dieselization took many years, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> a long program of upgrading older locomotives was continued. The P-7 Pacifics were particularly targeted for improvements, culminating in the Cincinnatian, for which four of the engines were upgraded and streamlined to a design by Olive Dennis, who also supervised the refurbishment of the rolling stock.|$|E
50|$|After {{the fall}} of the capital, Vietnamese units {{continued}} their advance in two columns into western Cambodia, capturing Battambang and Siemréap. The columns met at Sisophon and drove on to the Thai border, where there was heavy fighting <b>in</b> March <b>and</b> <b>in</b> April. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> some remaining Khmers rouges units offered scattered resistance before they melted away into less accessible areas. There the Khmer rouges leaders soon rekindled an insurgency against <b>the</b> new government <b>in</b> power, just as they had <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s, <b>and</b> insecurity persisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> countryside <b>in</b> spite of <b>the</b> continued Vietnamese presence.|$|R
