5000|$|The {{concept of}} a {{business}} model has been incorporated into certain accounting standards. For example, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) utilizes an [...] "entity's business model for managing the financial assets" [...] as a criterion for determining whether such assets should be measured <b>at</b> <b>amortized</b> <b>cost</b> or at fair value in its financial instruments accounting standard, IFRS 9. In their 2013 proposal for accounting for financial instruments, the Financial Accounting Standards Board also proposed a similar use of business model for classifying financial instruments. The concept of business model has also been introduced into the accounting of deferred taxes under International Financial Reporting Standards with 2010 amendments to IAS 12 addressing deferred taxes related to investment property.|$|E
5000|$|IFRS 9 {{retained}} {{the concept of}} fair value option from IAS 39, but revised the criteria for financial assets. [...] Under a fair value option, an asset or liability {{that would otherwise be}} reported <b>at</b> <b>amortized</b> <b>cost</b> or FVOCI can use FVPL instead. IFRS 9 also incorporated a FVOCI option for certain equity instruments that are not held for trading. [...] Under this option, the instrument is reported at FVOCI similar to FVOCI for debt. However, this version of FVOCI does not permit [...] "recycling." [...] Whereas when debt instruments using FVOCI are sold, the gain or loss on sale is [...] "recycled" [...] from other comprehensive income to profit and loss, for FVOCI equities the gain or loss is never reported in profit and loss, but rather remains in other comprehensive income.|$|E
5000|$|IFRS 9 {{requires}} an impairment allowance against the amortized cost of financial assets held <b>at</b> <b>amortized</b> <b>cost</b> or FVOCI. [...] The {{change in this}} allowance is reported in profit and loss. [...] For most such assets, when the asset is acquired the impairment allowance is measured as {{the present value of}} credit losses from default events projected over the next 12 months. [...] The allowance remains based on the expected losses from defaults over the next 12 months unless there is a significant increase in credit risk. [...] If there is a significant increase in credit risk, the allowance is measured as the present value of all credit losses projected for the instrument over its full lifetime. [...] If the credit risk recovers, the allowance can once again be limited to the projected credit losses over the next 12 months.|$|E

5000|$|As amended, IFRS 9 {{had four}} {{possible}} classification categories for financial assets, including a FVOCI classification for debt instruments. [...] The classification {{is dependent on}} two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI as Solely Payments of Principal and Interest) and a business model assessment. [...] Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at fair value with all changes in fair value reporting in profit and loss (FVPL). [...] In {{order to meet the}} contractual cash flow test, the cash flows from the instrument must consist of only principal and interest. [...] Among the amendments to classification and measurement made in the 2014 update, de minimis and [...] "non-genuine" [...] features can be disregarded from the test, meaning that a de minimis feature would not preclude an instrument from being reported <b>at</b> <b>amortized</b> <b>cost</b> or FVOCI. [...] However, equity instruments, derivatives and instruments that contain other than de minimis embedded derivatives would have to be reported at FVPL.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{elements}} of IFRS 9 as issued were criticized by some key IASB constituents. The model for classifying debt instrument assets permitted only two approaches, fair value with all changes in fair value reported in {{profit and loss}} (FVPL), or amortized cost. [...] This represented a significant deviation from FASB decisions, which would also have a category of fair value with certain changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income (FVOCI). [...] In addition to creating significant divergence with FASB, {{the lack of a}} FVOCI category would have been inconsistent with the accounting model being developed by the IASB for insurance contracts. [...] There were also concerns that the criteria for qualifying for the amortized cost category were overly stringent and would force many financial instruments to be reported at fair value even though they could be appropriately accounted for <b>at</b> <b>amortized</b> <b>cost.</b> [...] To address these concerns, IASB issued an exposure draft in 2012 proposing limited amendments to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.|$|E

The core problem turns out to be one-dimensional: we present a new data structure called an anonymous segment tree, which allows us to compute the expected length covered by a set of probabilistic segments in logarithmic time per update. Building on this foundation, we then generalize the problem to d dimensions by combining it with the ideas of Overmars and Yap [13]. Surprisingly, while the expected value of the volume can be efficiently maintained, we show that the tail bounds, or the probability distribution, of the volume are intractable— specifically, it is NP-hard to compute the probability that the volume of the union exceeds a given value V even when the dimension is d = 1. ...|$|R
5000|$|Although FAS 157 {{does not}} require fair value to be used on any new classes of assets, it does apply to assets and {{liabilities}} that are recorded at fair value in accordance with other applicable rules. The accounting rules for which assets and liabilities are held at fair value are complex. Mutual funds and securities companies have recorded assets and some liabilities at fair value for decades in accordance with securities regulations and other accounting guidance. For commercial banks {{and other types of}} financial services companies, some asset classes are required to be recorded at fair value, such as derivatives and marketable equity securities. For other types of assets, such as loan receivables and debt securities, it depends on whether the assets are held for trading (active buying and selling) or for investment. All trading assets are recorded at fair value. Loans and debt securities that are held for investment or to maturity are recorded <b>at</b> <b>amortized</b> <b>cost,</b> unless they are deemed to be impaired (in which case, a loss is recognized). However, if they are available for sale or held for sale, they are required to be recorded at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value, respectively. (FAS 65 and FAS 114 cover the accounting for loans, and FAS 115 covers the accounting for securities.) Notwithstanding the above, companies are permitted to account for almost any financial instrument at fair value, which they might elect to do in lieu of historical cost accounting (see FAS 159, [...] "The Fair Value Option").|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we provide {{efficient}} distributed protocols for generating shares of random noise, secure against malicious participants. The {{purpose of the}} noise generation {{is to create a}} distributed implementation of the privacy-preserving statistical databases described in recent papers [14, 4, 13]. In these databases, privacy is obtained by perturbing the true answer to a database query by the addition of a small amount of Gaussian or exponentially distributed random noise. The computational power of even a simple form of these databases, when the query is just of the form P i f(di), that is, the sum over all rows i in the database of a function f applied to the data in row i, has been demonstrated in [4]. A distributed implementation eliminates the need for a trusted database administrator. The results for noise generation are of independent interest. The generation of Gaussian noise introduces a technique for distributing shares of many unbiased coins with fewer executions of verifiable secret sharing than would be needed using previous approaches (reduced by a factor of n). The generation of exponentially distributed noise uses two shallow circuits: one for generating many arbitrarily but identically biased coins <b>at</b> an <b>amortized</b> <b>cost</b> of two unbiased random bits apiece, independent of the bias, and the other to combine bits of appropriate biases to obtain an exponential distribution. ...|$|R
40|$|Arrays are {{probably}} the most widely used data structure in imperative programming languages, yet functional languages typically only support arrays in a limited manner, or prohibit them entirely. This is not too surprising, since most other mutable data structures, such as trees, have elegant immutable analogues in the functional world, whereas arrays do not. Previous attempts at addressing the problem have suffered from one of three weaknesses, either that they don't support arrays as a persistent data structure (unlike the functional analogues of other imperative data structures), or that the range of operations is too restrictive to support some common array algorithms efficiently, or that they have performance problems. Our technique provides arrays as a true functional analogue of imperative arrays with the properties that functional programmers have come to expect from their data structures. To efficiently support array algorithms from the imperative world, we provide O(1) operations for single-threaded array use. Fully persistent array use can also be provided <b>at</b> O(1) <b>amortized</b> <b>cost,</b> provided that the algorithm satisfies a simple requirement as to uniformity of access. For those algorithms which do not access the array uniformly or single-threadedly, array reads or updates take at most O(log n) amortized time, where n is the size of the array.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} {{of a series of}} case studies on various areas of financial accounting. The areas of financial accounting discussed include inventory valuation, relevant income and assets, statement of cash flows, accounts receivable and estimations, inventory and revenue recognition, depreciation, international accounting standards, long-term debt, stockholders’ equity, securities, income and regulation, deferred taxes, and pension and retirement plans. In the financial accounting case on inventory valuation, two companies’ financial statement values were analyzed through evaluating the related balance sheets and income statements to determine which company would be a better investment. Through ratio analysis related to profitability and liquidity of the companies, it was determined that Glenwood Heating, Inc. is the better potential investment. For the second case on financial accounting, several different kinds of income and assets were evaluated to determine which income statement and balance sheet accounts are most relevant for investors and other users of the financial statements. The income accounts that were considered include persistent income, equity income, interest income, and other income from operations. The the asset accounts that were determined critical for decision making by investors and other users of the financial statements include total operating assets, assets from affiliates, and investments. The third case provides a thorough discussion and explanation on the purpose, format, and usage of the statement of cash flows. The purpose of the statement of cash flows is to report cash receipts or inflows and cash payments or outflows during the fiscal period. For the fourth case, Accounts Receivable and Estimations, several different contributors to the accounts receivable account are discussed and analyzed for a specific company, Pearson. Accounts that affect accounts receivable include current receivables, trade receivables, allowance for doubtful accounts, and allowance for sales returns. Additionally, journal entries are expressed to show how the specific account affects accounts receivable. The fifth case addresses the revenue recognition financial accounting principle to determine if a specific company, GAC, has accurately calculated financial statement accounts, such as revenue, accounts receivable, inventory, and unearned revenue. Through an evaluation of the revenue recognition principle and GAC’s financial statements, it was determined that the company was breaking the revenue recognition principle and must change the account values accordingly. The sixth case evaluates different depreciation methods considering both legal and illegal methods for decreasing depreciation expense in the fiscal period. Northwest, Delta, and United Airlines used legal methods to depreciate the same asset different over a certain period, but Waste Management used illegal depreciation methods to falsify earnings to investors, the public, and the SEC. The seventh case explains the differences between GAAP and IFRS when accounting for various liabilities. For the eight case, long-term debt was evaluated in Rite Aid to explore different kinds of debt, methods of issuance, interest expense, and discounts on bond payables through journal entries and calculations. The ninth case, Stockholders’ Equity, evaluates the common stock, treasury stock, dividends, and related ratios in two companies to consider different method for accounting for these values and transactions and to determine what the resulting values tell investors about the company. For the tenth case, State Street Corporation’s financial statements were analyzed to determine what securities the company current held. Through exploration of the unclassified balance sheet, it was established that State Street Corporation held trading securities, listed at fair value, available-for-sale securities, listed at fair value, and held-to-maturity securities, accounted for <b>at</b> <b>amortized</b> <b>cost.</b> The eleventh case considers several large corporations’ business models to establish what risks these companies face and which aspects of the financials are most important in determining risk. It was decided that revenue and revenue growth are more important than income and income growth. For the twelfth case, ZAGG, Inc. ’s financial statements were analyzed to determine what factors contribute to the total income tax calculation for a company with international operations. The factors included in the income tax calculation were tax at federal statutory rate, state tax, non-deductible expense, domestic production activities deduction, return to provision adjustment, and increase in valuation allowance.

30|$|The Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology (AGBoM) {{installed}} {{the last of}} nine new wind profiling radars (WPRs) across mainland Australia in 2017. These new systems complement an existing AGBoM network of 5 legacy WPRs which have recently undergone software and minor hardware upgrades, resulting in 14 operational systems. All but 2 of these systems are located on Bureau operational sites, while Cairns and Mackay are installed {{in the center of}} horse racing tracks. The legacy network and 5 of the new WPRs are boundary layer profilers (BL/BLP), intended to provide winds from 300 -m to 3 -km. The remaining 4 new WPRs, and the subject of this paper, are stratospheric tropospheric profilers (ST/STP), intended to provide winds from 500 m to 16 km. Profiler locations and instrument types were selected in an effort to maintain the Australian upper air network, while moving to automated operation at some AGBoM sites. At some sites, particularly where radar tracked sondes were launched, profilers replace this equipment, while at others, particularly where auto-sondes are installed, the profilers provide complementary observations. An additional aim was for the network to run <b>at</b> an <b>amortized</b> <b>cost</b> of 25 % of the cost of operating radiosondes over a period of 10  years. This figure has been easily met and is drastically reduced when costs are considered per profile, as the wind profilers run continuously as compared to two flights per day. Network design considerations called for robust systems capable of operating in remote and harsh Australian environments with very low maintenance, to be both modular and scalable to meet changing requirements over time, for system operation which is not susceptible to single-point failures, and a commonality of hardware across both ST and BL systems to minimize spares storage and user training requirements.|$|R
