40|$|Abstract—Identification {{of small}} {{electrical}} appliances via power consumption requires accurate detection {{and evaluation of}} steady-state <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> transient <b>sections.</b> However, the steady-state <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> transient <b>sections</b> are extracted from low frequency sampled (1 Hz) power measurements. We gain the steady-state <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> transient <b>sections</b> by processing real and reactive power measurements with a robust bucketing technique and unsupervised clustering. Macroscopic features for detected steady-state <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> transient <b>sections</b> are then extracted. Besides, our method estimates the similarity of steady-state <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> transient <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> determines recurred <b>sections</b> accurately. The proposed method is applicable for an inexpensive, unsupervised learning of small electrical appliances in real time...|$|R

5|$|Multiculturalism in Canada {{was adopted}} as the {{official}} policy of the government during the premiership of Pierre Trudeau in the 1970s and 1980s. The Canadian government has often {{been described as the}} instigator of multicultural ideology, because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration. Multiculturalism is administered by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and reflected in the law through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act <b>and</b> <b>section</b> 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Several further {{protections for}} voters are {{contained}} in Section 11. Section 11(a) prohibits any person acting under color of law from refusing or failing to allow a qualified person to vote or to count a qualified voter's ballot. Similarly, Section 11(b) prohibits any person from intimidating, harassing, or coercing another person for voting or attempting to vote. Two provisions in Section 11 address voter fraud: Section 11(c) prohibits people from knowingly submitting a false voter registration application to vote in a federal election, <b>and</b> <b>Section</b> 11(e) prohibits voting twice in a federal election.|$|E

5|$|Two {{provisions}} require certain jurisdictions {{to provide}} election materials to voters in multiple languages: Section 4(f)(4) <b>and</b> <b>Section</b> 203(c).

Language minority groups protected by these provisions include Asian Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Alaskans. Congress enacted the provisions to break down language barriers and combat pervasive language discrimination against the protected groups.|$|E

5|$|At all levels, Scouts {{are governed}} by an {{executive}} of trustees, known as executive committees – these could be volunteers from the local community who have had ties with the association, either themselves or through their children. An executive normally consists of a chairman, secretary, treasurer, {{and a number of}} other officers. In Group Executive Committees, Group Scout Leaders <b>and</b> <b>Section</b> Leaders also form part of the committee. Their role is to ensure that the best interests of the young people and the community are served by the group, district, county, or national levels of the association.|$|E

5|$|First, the High Court held, upon an {{examination}} of section 3 of the UPA <b>and</b> <b>section</b> 24(1) of the SA, {{that there was no}} express requirement for the Minister to have given the affected parties a right to be heard before the orders were made. Further, {{there was no room for}} the appellants' contention that the principles of natural justice had to be complied with fully. The orders had been made with respect to both the public interest and the public order, and their objective was clearly the preservation of national security. The Court affirmed the conclusion of Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, in R. v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, ex parte Hosenball (1977) that in such situations the ordinary principles of natural justice have to be modified to accommodate the public interest.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 English and Welsh breeders {{established}} a breeders' association, the Welsh Pony and Cob Society, {{and the first}} stud book was published in 1902. It was decided that the Welsh Stud Book should be separated into sections divided by type and height. Welsh Ponies were originally only classified as Section A, but in 1931, with the rising demand for riding ponies for children, Section B was added. In the first stud books, the Section B was the Welsh Pony of Cob Type, and the Welsh Cob was Section C <b>and</b> <b>Section</b> D. The upper height limit for Section D Cobs was removed in 1907 and in 1931 Sections C and D were combined as simply Section C. The current standards of Cobs as Sections C and D were finalised in 1949. Until the mid 20th century, the British War Office considered the Welsh Cob so valuable that they paid premiums to the best stallions. After World War II, only three stallions were registered in Section C, but numbers have since recovered.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} men in {{leadership}} positions {{were likely to be}} wounded or killed, soldiers learned the jobs of those beside and above them. At the British First Army headquarters, a large-scale plasticine model of the Vimy sector was constructed and used to show commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers the topographical features of the battlefield and details of the German trench system. In addition, upwards of 40,000 topographical trench maps were printed and distributed to ensure that even platoon sergeants <b>and</b> <b>section</b> commanders possessed a wider awareness of the battlefield. These measures gave each platoon a clearer picture of how it fitted into the greater battle plan and in so doing, reduced the command and control problems that plagued First World War combat.|$|E

All the children are listed as the children of Noble Rot Senior Citizens <b>and</b> <b>Section</b> 9 begins to suspect a larger conspiracy when {{they are part of}} a larger body of 20,000 children. Soon afterwards, the Puppeteer causes the disappearance of the sixteen children and Batou reveals to Togusa that he believes Kusanagi to be the Puppeteer. Section 9 next intercepts a Siak sniper that is targeting the supposed mastermind of Ka Rum's assassination. After his capture it is revealed the informant and the target are one in the same. The sniper says that the Puppeteer is a mechanism in the Solid State and cannot be killed.|$|E
5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} under Article 15(4) of the Constitution {{restrictions}} {{on the right of}} freedom of religion could be imposed only if public order, public health or morality is affected, <b>and</b> <b>section</b> 24(1)(a) of the SA provides for registered organizations to be dissolved only if they threaten public peace, welfare or good order. The appellants therefore submitted that {{there had to be a}} clear and immediate danger to public order before freedom of religion can be circumscribed. Since the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses posed no such threat, the deregistration order was unconstitutional and ultra vires the SA.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} departed the Middle East on 10 March 1942 {{aboard the}} troopship SS Otranto; however, on the voyage back to Australia the 16th and 17th Brigades were disembarked in Ceylon, due to {{fears of a}} Japanese attack. For nearly four months they were stationed on the island, initially in Galle, around the fort, and then later around the bay, where observation posts <b>and</b> <b>section</b> defensive positions were established. Throughout April and May, the 2/5th Battalion endured heavy rains but nevertheless undertook a series of exercises and training. In early July, the battalion finally received orders to return to Australia and, after being relieved at the Galle Fort by the 3rd Battalion, 8th Gurkhas, was transported to Colombo to embark upon the Athlone Castle. On 4 August 1942, the battalion arrived in Melbourne, having been away for over two years.|$|E
