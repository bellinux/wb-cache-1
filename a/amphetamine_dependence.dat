There was also a high prevalence of psychological symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations and violence which were related to frequency of amphetamine use, and use by injection.

50|$|To {{differentiate}} between {{different types of}} hypothyroidism, a specific test may be used. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is injected into the body through a vein. This hormone is naturally secreted by the hypothalamus and stimulates the pituitary gland. The pituitary responds by releasing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Large amounts of externally administered TRH can suppress the subsequent release of TSH. This amount of release-suppression is exaggerated in primary hypothyroidism, major depression, cocaine dependence, <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> and chronic phencyclidine abuse. There is a failure to suppress in the manic phase of bipolar disorder.|$|E
50|$|Amphetamines tend {{to cause}} the same {{behavioral}} and subjective effects of cocaine. Various forms of amphetamine are commonly used to treat the symptoms of {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) and narcolepsy, or are used recreationally. Amphetamine and methamphetamine are indirect agonists of the catecholaminergic systems. They block catecholamine reuptake, in addition to releasing catecholamines from nerve terminals. There is evidence that dopamine receptors {{play a central role in}} the behavioral responses of animals to cocaine, amphetamines, and other psychostimulant drugs. One action causes the dopamine molecules to be released from inside the vesicles into the cytoplasm of the nerve terminal, which are then transported outside by the mesolimbic dopamine pathway to the nucleus accumbens. This plays a key role in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of cocaine and amphetamine in animals, and is the primary mechanism for <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction and Aims. Understanding {{the risk}} factors that predict {{amphetamine}} use and development of <b>amphetamine</b> abuse or <b>dependence</b> (disorder) may help guide preventive interventions. This study aimed to investigate the correlates and predictors of young adults 2 ̆ 7 amphetamine use and use disorders. Design and Methods. Prospective cohort, population-based study which started in Brisbane, South East Queensland (Australia) in 1981. The study participants were a cohort of 2042 young adults, followed up from birth to young adulthood. At the 21 -year follow-up, amphetamine use was assessed via a self-report questionnaire, and amphetamine use disorder (AUD) was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-Auto). Potential predictors (15 risk factors) were assessed between baseline (antenatal visit) and the 21 -year follow-up. These included participant 2 ̆ 7 s gender, mother 2 ̆ 7 s age and education, maternal marital status and quality of marital relationship, maternal tobacco and alcohol consumption, mother-child communication, child mental health and problem behaviours, child smoking and alcohol consumption and child school performance. Results. Young adult amphetamine users {{were more likely to}} have concurrent symptoms of mental illness and problem behaviours and to use or abuse cigarettes, cannabis, or other illicit drugs. In multivariate analyses, young adults 2 ̆ 7 amphetamine use and disorder were disproportionately more common among males and those who have prospectively reported aggression/delinquency or smoking at 14 years, or who have experienced childhood sexual abuse. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that problem behaviours, smoking and childhood sexual abuse are predictors of initiation to use of amphetamines and development of <b>amphetamine</b> abuse and <b>dependence.</b> [Hayatbakhsh MR, Najman JM, Bor W, Williams GM.

40|$|Background: Long-term <b>amphetamine</b> and methamphetamine <b>dependence</b> {{has been}} linked to {{cerebral}} blood perfusion, metabolic, and white matter abnormalities. Several studies have linked methamphetamine abuse to cortical grey matter reduction, though with divergent findings. Few publications investigate unmethylated amphetamine's potential effects on cortical grey matter. This work investigated if amphetamine dependent patients showed reduced cortical grey matter thickness. Subjects were 40 amphetamine dependent subjects and 40 healthy controls. While all subjects were recruited to be free of alcohol dependence, structured clinical interviews revealed significant patterns of alcohol use in the patients. Structural magnetic resonance brain images were obtained from the subjects using a 1. 5 Tesla GE Signa machine. Brain cortical thickness was measured with submillimeter precision at multiple finely spaced cortical locations using semi-automated post-processing (FreeSurfer). Contrast analysis of a general linear model was used to test for {{differences between the two groups}} at each cortical location. In addition to contrasting patients with controls, a number of analyses sought to identify possible confounding effects from alcohol. Results: No significant cortical thickness differences were observed between the full patient group and controls, nor between non-drinking patients and controls. Patients with a history of co-morbid heavy alcohol use (n = 29) showed reductions in the superior-frontal right hemisphere and pre-central left hemisphere when compared to health...|$|R

40|$|Aim. Amphetamine and its {{derivates}} can induce, usually {{after many}} intoxications, schizophrenia-like psychosis. These disorders appeared only in part patients with <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence.</b> Aim {{of the study}} was to establish prevalence of selective risk factors of schizophrenia development in amphetamine users: 1) with amphetamine – induced schizophrenia – like psychosis, 2) with schizophrenia, and 2) without psychotic symptoms. Material. In the study 3 groups of subjects were included: 30 amphetamine users with amphetamine induced schizophrenia – like psychosis, 30 amphetamine users with schizophrenia and 30 amphetamine users without psychotic symptoms (37 female and 53 male in mean age= 17. 78 years). Methods. <b>Amphetamine</b> <b>dependence,</b> schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis induced amphetamine were diagnosed according to ICD- 10 criteria after at least 1 year of amphetamine abstinence. The next procedure was used: 1) Structured interview with subjects and their mothers/caregivers regarding: a) amphetamines use (duration of abuse, doses of psychoactive substance) b) family history of psychosis (especially schizophrenia) 2) The Questionnaire of Child Development for assessment of prevalence of selected risk factors of schizophrenia development 3) The Premorbid Adjustment Scale (Cannon – Spoor) for assessment of premorbid psychosocial functioning in thelast year before psychosis. Conclusions. Amphetamines users with amphetamine-induced psychosis were more similar in prevalence of selective risk factors of schizophrenia development to subjects with schizophrenia and <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> than to amphetamine users without psychosis.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> largely {{depends on the}} effects of amphetamine in the brain reward systems. Ghrelin, an orexigenic peptide, activates the reward systems and is required for reward induced by alcohol, nicotine, cocaine and amphetamine in mice. Human genetic studies have shown that polymorphisms in the pre-proghrelin (GHRL) as well as GHS-R 1 A (GHSR) genes are associated with high alcohol consumption, increased weight and smoking in males. Since the heritability factor underlying drug dependence is shared between different drugs of abuse, we here examine the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the GHRL and GHSR, and <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence.</b> GHRL and GHSR SNPs were genotyped in Swedish amphetamine dependent individuals (n = 104) and controls from the general population (n = 310). A case-control analysis was performed and SNPs and haplotypes were additionally tested for association against Addiction Severity Interview (ASI) composite score of drug use. The minor G-allele of the GHSR SNP rs 2948694, was more common among amphetamine dependent individuals when compared to controls (pc = 0. 02). A significant association between the GHRL SNP rs 4684677 and ASI composite score of drug use was also reported (pc = 0. 03). The haplotype analysis did not add to the information given by the individual polymorphisms. Although genetic variability of the ghrelin signalling system is not a diagnostic marker for <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> and problem severity of drug use, the present results strengthen the notion that ghrelin and its receptor ma...|$|E
40|$|Reward-seeking {{behaviors}} can be potentiated {{by exposure}} to cues that have been paired with a reward. This phenomenon is called Pavlovian instrumental transfer (PIT). PIT-like effects are thought to contribute to relapse of drug intake upon exposure to drug-associated cues. PIT was shown to be enhanced by prior exposure to psychostimulants; however, the molecular mechanisms involved are unknown. We previously found that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) critical for PIT. Here we examine a possible involvement of NAc ERK signaling in the potentiation of PIT by prior exposure to psychostimulants. Rats underwent Pavlovian conditioning to associate a tone with food delivery, then underwent instrumental training to press a lever for food, and finally were tested for PIT. After each Pavlovian session half of the rats were treated with amphetamine (1 mg/kg; i. p.) and the rest with saline (1 ml/kg; i. p.). Some rats received Pavlovian conditioning only to assess the effect of prior amphetamine exposure specifically on cue-evoked ERK activation in the NAc. To determine the importance of timing of amphetamine exposure {{in relation to the}} Pavlovian conditioning training, some rats were treated with drug or saline 6 hrs after the daily session. Amphetamine treatment after daily Pavlovian training increased cue-evoked NAc ERK activation, without affecting basal ERK activation or discriminative food cup approach. Amphetamine exposure caused a marked increase in PIT accompanied by an increase in cue-evoked ERK activation. There were no drug effects on basal lever pressing, inactive lever pressing, or discriminative food cup approach during the PIT test. The effect of prior amphetamine exposure on cue-evoked NAc ERK activation and PIT were observed when amphetamine was administered immediately after the daily Pavlovian conditioning but not when it was administered 6 hrs later. These findings are consistent with a role for cue-evoked NAc ERK activation in the enhancement of PIT observed days after repeated exposure to <b>amphetamine.</b> Potentiation <b>dependence</b> on the timing of amphetamine administration relative to Pavlovian conditioning argues against an explanation in terms of general sensitization but instead suggests a drug effect on the consolidation of the cue-reward association...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} increase in the use of amphetamine type stimulants (ATS) in Australia over the last decade, and according to the National Drug Strategy Household Survey (2004) results, amphetamine is the second most commonly reported illicit substance used by Australians after cannabis. It has been widely documented that illicit drug users, and in particular ATS users, experience high levels of psychiatric comorbidity and particularly high levels of depression. Depression is one of the leading diseases in the modern world and causes significant burden to those who suffer from it. The main aim of this study is to determine the levels of depression among a sample of regular amphetamine users and investigate the subjective experience of life quality among those with comorbid depression and those without. This study was a separate component of a randomised controlled trial for regular amphetamine users in Queensland and New South Wales (Baker, Lee, Claire, Lewin, Grant et al, 2003). Participants were required to be 18 years and over and regular users of amphetamines as defined by use of amphetamines on at least four occasions in the previous month. A total of 2 14 participants were recruited from a range of sources into the study. Levels of depression (measured by the BDI- 11), quality of life (WHOQoL BREF), dependence status (SDS) and drug use patterns (OTI) were all examined. High levels of depression were found among the same with 84. 6 % of the sample reporting clinically significant depression with a large proportion of this group falling into the moderate to severe spectrum (7 1 %). Results identified several areas of major risk for poor quality of life for <b>amphetamine</b> users, including <b>dependence,</b> frequency of use and route of administration, and showed how these risks areas can be compounded by level of depression to create significantly decreased quality of life. No amphetamine withdrawal scales were administered in the assessment protocol for this study. It is possible that some of the reported symptoms of depression could be related in part to an amphetamine withdrawal syndrome. Further study of the natural history of withdrawal and the prevalence of related metal health symptoms is warranted. This sample was a treatment seeking, dependent group of amphetamine users. The results confirm the high rates of mental health comorbidity among regular amphetamine users and highlights the added burden of disease that this group suffers. The results have implications for treatment services, which need to manage both comorbidity and individual aspects that contribute to an improved quality of life. Further analyses examining treatment outcomes for this group would be useful...|$|R
40|$|Amphetamine {{addiction}} {{is a disease}} that affects millions of people worldwide and lacks effective treatment. An estimated 35 million persons are reported to abuse amphetamines, {{which is more than}} the total number of cocaine and heroin abusers combined. A majority of intravenous drug users in Sweden abuse amphetamine, pushing this disorder to the forefront of psychiatric problems. At present, there is no approved pharmacotherapy for <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence.</b> Several lines of evidence point towards involvement of the endogenous opioid system in the pathophysiology of stimulant addiction. The opioid antagonist naltrexone has shown to modulate some of the behavioral and neurochemical effects of amphetamine in animal models. The aim of this thesis was to investigate naltrexone in humans as a potential pharmacotherapy for the treatment of <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence.</b> In the first study, we examined the effect of an acute dose of naltrexone in drugnaïve individuals. Structured batteries of subjective, physiological and behavioral measures were systematically administered to investigate the interaction effect of naltrexone and amphetamine. The results demonstrated that pre-treatment with naltrexone significantly reduces the subjective effects of amphetamine. Pre-treatment with naltrexone had no effect on the physiological and behavioral measures. In the next study, we examined the effect of an acute dose of naltrexone on the subjective, physiological and biochemical effects of amphetamine in dependent individuals, using a double-blind placebo controlled design. Pre-treatment with naltrexone significantly attenuated the subjective effects of amphetamine. In addition, craving for amphetamine was blunted by naltrexone. This data provide the proof-ofconcept that naltrexone not only dampens the subjective effect of amphetamine in the event of drug use, but also decreases the likelihood of additional drug consumption Thereafter, we investigated the effect of chronic treatment with naltrexone in amphetamine dependent individuals, in an open-label design. The aim was to assess the tolerability and compliance to naltrexone in this new population. Twelve weeks of treatment with naltrexone led to a reduction in both frequency and quantity of drug consumption. Overall, the results showed that naltrexone was well tolerated with minimal side effects. Finally, we investigated naltrexone for the treatment of <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Patients either received 12 -weeks of treatment with naltrexone or placebo. Twice-weekly urine toxicology tests were performed and in addition patients received weekly relapse prevention therapy. The results indicate that treatment with naltrexone reduced the percentage of amphetaminepositive urine samples in patients with chronic <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence.</b> Continued treatment with naltrexone also led to a reduction in craving as compared to placebo. In addition, the medical safety of naltrexone was further confirmed in this population. In conclusion, naltrexone pharmacotherapy significantly reduces the reinforcing effects of amphetamine in acute and chronic dosing models. Taken together, this thesis provides support for the potential use of naltrexone as a treatment for <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> {{constitutes}} {{a public health}} problem with many consequences and complications. Amphetamine abuse refers to a maladaptive and hazardous pattern of use considered to be less severe than dependence. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved for amphetamine abuse or dependence, and psychotherapy remains the best treatment option. Long-term amphetamine use reduces dopamine levels in the brain. Drugs increasing dopamine and mimicking the effects of amphetamines with lower abuse liability {{could be used as}} replacement therapy in <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence.</b> Several psychostimulants have been studied recently for this purpose. In this review, the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants for amphetamine abuse or dependence were studied. We found eleven studies enrolling 791 amphetamine-dependent participants and assessing the effects of four different psychostimulants: dexamphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate and modafinil. Psychosocial interventions were additionally provided to all participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Australia or Northern Europe, and study length ranged from 8 to 20 weeks. Psychostimulants did not reduce amphetamine use or amphetamine craving and also did not increase sustained abstinence in comparison with placebo. Retention in treatment was similar and low with both treatments. Psychostimulants also did not increase the risk of adverse events that were intense enough to induce dropouts. Research with larger and longer trials is needed to determine whether psychostimulants can be a useful replacement therapy for patients with amphetamine abuse or dependence. The design of future trials should consider the level of dependence at study entry, the potency and the dose of the psychostimulant administered, the length of the trial and the representativeness of included participants...|$|E
40|$|<b>Amphetamine</b> <b>dependence,</b> besides its {{substantial}} economical consequence, is {{a serious}} cause of mortality and morbidity. By investigations of the neurochemical correlates through which addictive drugs, such as amphetamine, activate the mesoaccumbal dopamine system unique targets for treatment of drug addiction can be identified. This reward link consists of a dopamine projection from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) suggesting that these brain areas are important for reward. The physiological function of gut-brain peptides has expanded beyond food intake modulation and involves regulation of drug reinforcement. A novel candidate for reward regulation is the anorexigenic peptide neuromedin U (NMU). We therefore investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of NMU on amphetamine's well-documented effects on the mesoaccumbal dopamine system, i. e. locomotor stimulation and accumbal dopamine release in mice. In addition, the effect of accumbal NMU administration on locomotor activity was examined. The effect of NMU, icv or intra-NAc, on the expression of conditioned place preference (CPP) was elucidated. Firstly, we showed that icv administration of NMU attenuate the amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation, accumbal dopamine release and expression of CPP in mice. Secondly, we found that a lower dose of NMU (icv) reduce the amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation in mice. Thirdly, we demonstrated that NMU administration into the NAc block the ability of amphetamine to cause a locomotor stimulation in mice. However, accumbal NMU administration did not attenuate the amphetamine-induced expression of CPP in mice. Our novel data suggest that central NMU signalling is involved in development of <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> is {{a global}} health problem, often giving rise to severe medical and social {{complications}} in affected individuals. Unfortunately, there is still limited evidence for any specific treatment that would help amphetamine dependent patients to avoid relapse. One {{of the most promising}} treatments is the opioid antagonist naltrexone, which has been shown to attenuate the subjective effects of amphetamine and in some randomized clinical trials also reduce the risk of relapse. The aim of this thesis work was to investigate the mechanism of action of naltrexone for <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence,</b> in order to better understand the neurobiology involved and facilitate further treatment development. We used the neuroimaging techniques positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study these processes in the human brain. In Study I, we tested the hypothesis that an amphetamine injection causes a release of endogenous opioids in the brain, which might explain why an opioid antagonist such as naltrexone attenuates the subjective effects of amphetamine. However, using PET and the µ opioid radioligand 11 C-carfentanil, we found no evidence of such an amphetamine-induced opioid release in healthy human subjects without any previous experience of amphetamine. Study II investigated whether naltrexone pre-treatment affects the dopamine release that occurs in the brain after amphetamine intake, an effect that some previous studies have found to correlate with the subjective effects of amphetamine. If naltrexone were to attenuate this dopamine release, it might help to explain why it affects the subjective effects of amphetamine. In a first experiment, we used PET and the radioligand 11 C-raclopride, but found no evidence that naltrexone affected amphetamine-induced dopamine release in healthy, previously amphetamine-naïve human subjects. We proceeded with experiments using in vivo microdialysis in rats, where similar results were found: pre-treatment with naltrexone did not affect the dopamine release caused by an acute amphetamine dose in rats without previous exposure to amphetamine. However, in rats that had been treated with amphetamine for a longer time period, naltrexone did attenuate the dopamine release when amphetamine was reinstated, suggesting that the brain opioid system might be involved in the adaptations to chronic amphetamine exposure. In Study III, we investigated the effects of naltrexone on cue reactivity, i. e. the reaction of substance dependent patients to environmental stimuli reminding them of drug use. This process is interesting as it can be an important trigger of relapse. For this study, we included 40 men with severe, intravenous <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence,</b> who received one oral dose of naltrexone or placebo and then underwent an fMRI examination including exposure to drugrelated and neutral film clips. The hypothesis was that the drug-related films would cause a subjective craving reaction and increase the activity of a number of motivationally relevant brain regions, and that naltrexone would attenuate this reactivity. We found that the films did cause strong craving and wide-spread fMRI activations, but {{there was no evidence of}} any effect of naltrexone on these measures. Study IV investigated the proposed phenomenon of subliminal cue reactivity, where the brains of substance dependent patients have been reported to react specifically to drug-related pictures, even when the pictures are presented very fast and with a backward mask, so that they never reach conscious awareness. In our study, which used the same patient sample as Study III and 30 healthy controls, we found no evidence of any subliminal drug cue reactivity. Upon closer examination of the earlier studies, we found that the reliability of their statistical inferences could be questioned, which together with our negative results suggest that there is no strong evidence for subliminal cue reactivity in addiction. In summary, the studies of this thesis have not corroborated the hypotheses we started out with regarding the mechanisms behind naltrexone’s effects in <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence.</b> Instead, the results have inspired new hypotheses, for example regarding how the interplay between the brain dopamine and opioid systems may change with long-term amphetamine use.

Method: Structured interviews gathered information from 1, 457 individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of marijuana dependence, 1, 262 with histories of cocaine dependence, 647 with <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence,</b> and 368 subjects with opiate dependence. For each drug, the clinical course was compared for subjects whose dependence included a history of withdrawal (group 1), those dependent on each drug who denied withdrawal but reported tolerance (group 2), and those who denied both tolerance and withdrawal (group 3). Results: The proportion of dependent individuals who denied tolerance or withdrawal (group 3) ranged from 30 % for marijuana to 4 % for opiates. For each substance...|$|E

Testing {{of a new}} scale, the Amphetamine Cessation Symptom Assessment (ACSA), in {{a sample}} of treatment-seeking {{amphetamine}} users (N = 133) showed satisfactory reliability, while factor analysis identified three components explaining 64. 7 % of the variance in scores. Scores were inversely related to subjective general well-being (r = -. 33, p <. 01) and directly related to the Beck Depression Inventory (r =. 59, p <. 01). There were positive relationships between the ACSA and measures of <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> (r =. 36, p <. 01) and the intensity of recent amphetamine use (r =. 24, p <. 01). The ACSA discriminated between "low-dose" and "high-dose" users, indicating discriminant validity. In inpatients (n = 63), ACSA scores declined significantly over time, while higher scores in inpatient treatment dropouts indicated predictive validity. The ACSA showed satisfactory reliability and validity, with a three-factor solution providing the best fit to the data. The ACSA could {{play an important role in}} providing clinical outcome data, particularly in outcome evaluation of new treatment protocols.

40|$|Effects of {{adenosine}} receptor agonists and antagonists in amphetamineinduced conditioned place {{preference test}} in rats. E. POLESZAK, D. MA-LEC. Pol. J. Pharmacol., 2003, 55, 319 – 326. The influence of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on amphetamine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) was examined in male Wistar rats. Selective adenosine A 1 receptor agonist, CPA, significantly reduced {{the acquisition of}} CPP induced by amphetamine. NECA (A 2 /A 1 adenosine receptor agonist) produced similar effect, but selective A 2 adenosine receptor agonist CGS 21680, attenuated acquisition of amphetamineinduced CPP only at the lower dose used. The blockade of adenosine receptors by CPT, DMPX and caffeine, did not influence the expression and acquisition of amphetamine-induced CPP. With regard to the expression of amphetamine-induced CPP, only A 2 A adenosine agonist (CGS 21680) slightly decreased the action of amphetamine. Other adenosine agonists were without effect. Our results indicate that activation of A 1 receptor decreases the acquisition of CPP induced by amphetamine. It suggests that adenosine A 1 receptor is involved in rewarding effects of amphetamine. Therefore, it seems that selective adenosine A 1 receptor agonists may have some attenuating influence {{on the development of}} <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence...</b>|$|E
40|$|Amphetamine {{abuse and}} {{dependence}} are global health problems, affecting {{large numbers of}} individuals. Despite extensive research efforts, {{there has been no}} evidence-based pharmacotherapy available for <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence.</b> However, recent clinical trials have suggested that the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone reduces drug consumption and craving in amphetamine dependent patients. To further elucidate the interaction between amphetamine and the endogenous opioid system, the present thesis investigated the effect of naltrexone on amphetamine-induced behaviours in the rat. In addition, the effect of naltrexone on specific amphetamine-induced changes in brain neurochemistry, i. e. dopamine release in the striatum, was investigated using both in vivo microdialysis in animals as well as PET imaging in humans. Firstly, the effect of naltrexone on drug-induced reinstatement was investigated in animals previously self-administering amphetamine. Naltrexone significantly attenuated drugseeking behaviour induced by a low priming dose of amphetamine. The effect of naltrexone was not due to a general disruption of behaviour since the same doses of naltrexone had no effect on operant responding maintained by food. Next, the effect of naltrexone on different phases of the conditioned place preference paradigm was investigated. Naltrexone had no effect on the acquisition, expression or on the reinstatement of amphetamine-induced place preference. Further, naltrexone by itself did not induce place preference or place aversion. In contrast, naltrexone significantly attenuated the locomotor response to a priming dose of amphetamine on reinstatement, without altering general locomotor behaviour. A behavioural sensitization paradigm was used to further investigate the involvement of the endogenous opioid system in amphetamine cue- and drug-induced drug seeking behaviour. A single dose of naltrexone attenuated the amphetamine-induced locomotor activity in response to a drug challenge during the expression of sensitization. In addition, pre-treatment with naltrexone blocked the conditioned locomotor response induced by re-exposure to the context previously associated with amphetamine. Finally, possible interactions between amphetamine and naltrexone were investigated using both preclinical and clinical experimental models, i. e. in vivo microdialysis in rats and PET imaging in humans. Amphetamine induced a dose-dependent increase in dopamine release in the rat striatum, and a reduction in [11 C]raclopride binding in the human that corresponded with a marked increase in self-reported rating of drug effects (high, arousal and liking). An acute dose of naltrexone attenuated the subjective effects of amphetamine, without altering the amphetamine-induced changes in [11 C]raclopride binding in the ventral striatum. Taken together, the results from the present thesis show an involvement of the endogenous opioid system in some, but not all, amphetamine-induced behaviours. The results strengthen the hypothesis that the endogenous opioid system could be a potential target for the treatment of <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: While methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is {{increasing}} in prevalence globally, Sweden {{is still a}} low-prevalence country enabling studies on the natural MRSA spread in subpopulations unaffected by a surrounding highly infected population. Substance dependence and injection drug use have been risk factors for MRSA carriage and infection in other countries. In this retrospective, longitudinal register study, we investigated MRSA epidemiology 1997 – 2013 in opioid and amphetamine-dependent individuals, in comparison with alcohol-dependent subjects. Methods: Data from the national Swedish in- and outpatients registers included 73, 201 individuals from 1997, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2013. We analyzed substance use disorder and demographic predictors for MRSA using generalized estimating equations. Results: The main finding was that both opioid (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2. 82; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 16, 3. 67) and <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> (AOR = 2. 71; 95 % CI = 1. 70, 4. 16) {{were significantly associated with}} MRSA diagnosis compared with alcohol dependence, when adjusting for age, sex and year. Conclusions: These findings are of value to understand the dynamics of MRSA epidemiology among substance dependent persons with presumably low socioeconomic status and potential injection drug use, and implicate repeated surveillance of MRSA among these patients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Long-term {{amphetamine}} and methamphetamine dependence {{has been}} linked to cerebral blood perfusion, metabolic, and white matter abnormalities. Several studies have linked methamphetamine abuse to cortical grey matter reduction, though with divergent findings. Few publications investigate unmethylated amphetamine's potential effects on cortical grey matter. This work investigated if amphetamine dependent patients showed reduced cortical grey matter thickness. Subjects were 40 amphetamine dependent subjects and 40 healthy controls. While all subjects were recruited to be free of alcohol dependence, structured clinical interviews revealed significant patterns of alcohol use in the patients. Structural magnetic resonance brain images were obtained from the subjects using a 1. 5 Tesla GE Signa machine. Brain cortical thickness was measured with submillimeter precision at multiple finely spaced cortical locations using semi-automated post-processing (FreeSurfer). Contrast analysis of a general linear model was used to test for {{differences between the two groups}} at each cortical location. In addition to contrasting patients with controls, a number of analyses sought to identify possible confounding effects from alcohol. Results No significant cortical thickness differences were observed between the full patient group and controls, nor between non-drinking patients and controls. Patients with a history of co-morbid heavy alcohol use (n = 29) showed reductions in the superior-frontal right hemisphere and pre-central left hemisphere when compared to healthy controls (n = 40). Conclusions Amphetamine usage was associated with reduced cortical thickness only in patients co-morbid for heavy alcohol use. Since cortical thickness is but one measure of brain structure and does not capture brain function, further studies of brain structure and function in <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> are warranted. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aims The {{present study}} extends the {{findings}} of a pilot study conducted among regular amphetamine users in Newcastle, NSW, in 1998. It compares key features between current participants in a state capital city (Brisbane) and a regional city (Newcastle) and between the 1998 and current Newcastle sample. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Brisbane and Newcastle, Australia. Participants The survey was conducted among 214 regular amphetamine users {{within the context of a}} randomized controlled trial of brief interventions for amphetamine use. Measurements Demographic characteristics, past and present alcohol and other drug use and mental health, treatment, amphetamine-related harms and severity of dependence. Findings The main findings were as follows: (i) the rate of mental health problems was high among regular amphetamine users and these problems commonly emerged after commencement of regular amphetamine use; (ii) there were regional differences in drug use with greater accessibility to a wider range of drugs in a state capital city and greater levels of injecting risk-taking behaviour outside the capital city environment; and (iii) there was a significant increase in level of amphetamine use and percentage of alcohol users, a trend for a higher level of <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> and a significant reduction in the percentage of people using heroin and benzodiazepines among the 2002 Newcastle cohort compared to the 1998 cohort. Conclusions Further longitudinal research is needed to elucidate transitions from one drug type to another and from recreational to injecting and regular use and the relationship between drug use and mental health in prospective studies among users. Implications Intervention research should evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at: preventing transition to injecting and regular use of amphetamines; toward reducing levels of depression among amphetamine users and interventions among people with severe psychopathology and personality disorders; and toward reducing the prevalence of tobacco dependence among amphetamine users...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{demands on}} <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> {{treatment}} services {{point to a}} need for effective pharmacotherapies for withdrawal symptom suppression. However, empirical data {{on which to base}} effective treatments are scarce. To address the need for an evidence base, four studies were conducted in two countries - Australia and Thailand. Firstly, the time course and severity of amphetamine withdrawal symptoms were characterised in two inpatient samples of amphetamine users. Results identified the first week of abstinence as an acute withdrawal phase characterised by increased sleeping, eating and a cluster of mood and anxiety - related symptoms. Following the acute phase, most withdrawal symptoms remained stable and at low levels for the remaining two weeks of abstinence (the sub - acute phase). Data from these two studies formed the basis for a new instrument, the Amphetamine Cessation Symptom Assessment scale (ACSA). On psychometric testing, the ACSA showed satisfactory reliability and a clear psychometric structure, delineating symptom clusters and their correlates with a three factor solution providing the best fit to the data. Using the ACSA to measure outcome, the safety and efficacy of the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor antidepressant mirtazapine (15 - 60 mg per day, n = 13), and the wake-promoting drug, modafinil (400 mg per day, n = 14) were assessed in successive, open - label, inpatient pilot trials. Study medication was administered for up to ten days. An historical comparison group (n = 22) who received treatment as usual consisting of pericyazine 2. 5 - 10 mg per day for control of agitation served as a comparison. Results showed that modafinil and mirtazapine were well tolerated, producing minimal positive subjective effects. There were significant group differences in withdrawal severity (F = 18. 6, df 2, 219 p < 0. 001). Post - hoc analysis showed that modafinil was more effective than mirtazapine (p = 0. 041), and both were more effective than treatment as usual (both p < 0. 001) in ameliorating withdrawal severity. Overall, these studies identified a peak in withdrawal severity {{during the first week of}} abstinence; demonstrated the reliability and validity of the ACSA and identified modafinil as a safe and potentially effective pharmacotherapy for the treatment of amphetamine withdrawal symptoms.

40|$|Introduction: South Africa has {{witnessed}} a tremendous rise in methamphetamine consumption since the year 2000. Sex trading {{is a phenomenon}} that has been observed in active drug users, globally and within South Africa, and {{has been associated with}} risks for HIV infection and violence. This paper is a secondary analysis examining sex trading among active methamphetamine users in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods: Respondent driven sampling was used to recruit 360 active methamphetamine users in a peri-urban township in Cape Town. A structured clinical interview and computerized survey were used to assess history of sex trading, demographics, drug use, sexual risk behaviors, history of violence, and mental health. Logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of sex trading, separately for men and women. Results: In a total sample of 201 men and 159 women, 40 % of men and 33 % of women endorsed trading sex for tik or money in the past 3 months. Those who traded sex were more likely to meet the criteria for ICD- 10 <b>amphetamine</b> <b>dependence</b> among both men (OR= 4. 59, 95 % CI= 1. 31 - 16. 13) and women (OR= 8. 00, 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 62. 59). Men who were concurrent heroin users {{were also more likely to}} exchange sex (OR= 2. 58, 95 % CI: 1. 06 - 6. 28). Sexual risk behaviors were significantly associated with sex trading. Notably, unprotected sex with a casual partner was correlated with sex trading in men (OR= 3. 57, 95 % CI: 1. 66 - 7. 69) and women (OR= 3. 68, 95 % CI: 1. 63 - 8. 29). Among women, those who experienced childhood sexual trauma (OR= 3. 79, 95 % CI: 1. 89 - 7. 59) and had the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (OR= 2. 95, 95 % CI: 1. 45 - 5. 99) were also more likely to trade sex. Discussion: This study offers insight into the interventions needed for this high-risk population in a LMIC (low and/or middle income countries) context. The results stress a need for linkage to drug treatment, as addiction may be fueling sex trading. The risky sexual practices illustrate how targeted interventions geared toward safe sex practices may help this population. More research is needed to explore the experiences of men who have sex with men given their particularly high rates of sex trading behavior. In a context of high rates of trauma and violence, women need interventions that are attuned to their particular vulnerabilities and offer empowerment through counseling. Thesi...|$|E
