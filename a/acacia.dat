5|$|The red-capped robin prefers more arid habitat {{than its}} relatives, and inhabits dryer areas while the scarlet robin {{occupies}} wetter forests where they co-occur. The red-capped robin's preferred habitat is dry <b>Acacia,</b> Callitris or mixed scrubland or woodland, dominated by such species as mulga (<b>Acacia</b> aneura), Georgina gidgee (<b>Acacia</b> georginae), raspberry jam (<b>Acacia</b> acuminata), black cypress-pine (Callitris endlicheri), white cypress-pine (C. columellaris), and slender cypress-pine (C. preissii) with understory shrubs such as Cassia, hop-bush (Dodonaea), emu bush (Eremophila) and spinifex (Triodia).|$|E

5|$|A 1994 {{study of}} the nilgai's diet in the Sariska Reserve {{revealed}} its preference for herbs and grasses; grasses became {{more important in the}} rainy season, while during winter and summer it fed additionally on flowers (Butea monosperma), foliage (Anogeissus pendula, Capparis sepiaria, Grewia flavescens and Zizyphus mauritiana), pods (<b>Acacia</b> nilotica, A. catechu and A. leucophloea) and fruits (Zizyphus mauritiana). Preferred grass species include Cenchrus species, Cynodon dactylon, Desmostachya bipinnata, Scirpus tuberosus and Vetiveria zizanoides. Woody plants eaten include <b>Acacia</b> nilotica, A. senegal, A. leucophloea, Clerodendrum phlomidis, Crotalaria burhia, Indigofera oblongifolia, Morus alba and Zizyphus nummularia; herbs favoured are Cocculus hirsutus, Euphorbia hirta and Sida rhombifolia. Seeds of Paspalum distichum occurred in the dung of nilgai most of the year; <b>Acacia</b> nilotica and Prosopis juliflora seeds were discovered in the dry season and those of Echinochloa crusgalli during the monsoon.|$|E
5|$|The grey currawong {{is found}} in wet and dry sclerophyll forests across its range, as well as mallee scrubland, and open areas such as parks or {{farmland}} near forested areas. It also inhabits pine plantations. Preferences vary between regions; subspecies versicolor {{is more common in}} wetter forests in southeastern mainland Australia, while the Tasmanian subspecies arguta is found most commonly in lowland dry sclerophyll forest. The subspecies melanoptera and intermedia are found mainly in mallee scrublands and woodlands, while in Western Australia, subspecies plumbea {{is found in}} various forests and woodlands, such as jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), karri (E.diversicolor), tuart (E.gomphocephala) and wandoo (E.wandoo), as well as paperbark woodlands around swampy areas, and <b>acacia</b> shrublands dominated by summer-scented wattle (<b>Acacia</b> rostellifera) and mulga (<b>Acacia</b> aneura) with Eremophila understory.|$|E
5|$|The park's {{predominant}} {{environment is}} open grass plain with scattered <b>Acacia</b> bushes. The western uplands {{of the park}} have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked <b>Acacia</b> xanthophloea. There is a riverine forest along the permanent river {{in the south of}} the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly <b>Acacia</b> and Euphorbia candelabrum. Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include Euphorbia brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.|$|E
40|$|Australian <b>acacias</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} notable invaders worldwide. Across Australian states, <b>acacias</b> became {{invasive}} or even naturalized after being introduced to ecosystems outside their natural distribution range. The relative importance of soil biota in their invasion success remains unknown, particularly that of rhizobial and fungal communities. We tested the Enemy Release Hypothesis and the Acquired Mutualism Hypothesis to disentangle the belowground invasion mechanisms that may have assisted in the invasion success of these <b>acacias</b> across Australia...|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>acacias,</b> {{whistling}} thorns have {{leaves that}} contain tannins, which {{are thought to}} serve as deterrents to herbivory. Like all African <b>acacias,</b> they are defended by spines. In addition, Whistling thorn <b>acacias</b> are myrmecophytes that have formed a mutualistic relationship with some species of ants. In exchange for shelter in the bulbous thorns (domatia) and nectar secretions, these ants appear to defend the tree against herbivores, such as elephants and giraffes, as well as herbivorous insects.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} {{infertile}} {{areas of the}} Swan Coastal Plain, Hamersley would have supported open forests of Eucalyptus marginata (Jarrah) with Corymbia calophylla (Marri) or Eucalyptus gomphocephala (Tuart), and an understorey of Banksia attenuata (Candlestick Banksia), B.menziesii (Firewood Banksia), B.grandis (Bull Banksia), Allocasuarina fraseriana (Western Sheoak) and Agonis flexuosa (Swan River Peppermint). The main shrub species would have been Jacksonia sternbergiana (Stinkwood), J.furcellata (Grey Stinkwood), <b>Acacia</b> cyclops (Coastal Wattle), <b>Acacia</b> saligna (Orange Wattle), Hibbertia species, Allocasuarina humilis (Dwarf Sheoak), Calothamnus quadrifidus (One-sided Bottlebrush) and Grevillea thelemanniana (Spider Net Grevillea). Biodiversity surveys in 2006 have also identified a relatively rare species, Jacksonia sericea (Waldjumi), in two eastern Hamersley reserves.|$|E
5|$|In the Sahara, 332 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} as food plants of the dromedary. These include Aristida pungens, <b>Acacia</b> tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The dromedary eats <b>Acacia,</b> Atriplex and Salsola when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and Euphorbia tannensis. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding. They graze for 8–12 hours per day and ruminate for {{an equal amount of}} time.|$|E

5|$|The genus Iridomyrmex inhabits rural, arid, and {{semi-arid}} areas.

5|$|The {{seeds of}} conifers, {{the largest group}} of gymnosperms, are {{enclosed}} in a cone and most species have seeds that are light and papery that can be blown considerable distances once free from the cone. Sometimes the seed remains in the cone for years waiting for a trigger event to liberate it. Fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the jack pine, and also enriches the forest floor with wood ash and removes competing vegetation. Similarly, a number of angiosperms including <b>Acacia</b> cyclops and <b>Acacia</b> mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|To {{accomplish}} this goal, Harle helps Lynx manipulate the <b>Acacia</b> Dragoons, the powerful militia governing {{the islands of}} El Nido. As the Dragoons maintain order, they contend with Fargo, a former Dragoon turned pirate captain who holds a grudge against their leader, General Viper. Though tussling with Serge initially, the <b>Acacia</b> Dragoons—whose ranks include the fierce warriors Karsh, Zoah, Marcy, and Glenn—later assist him when the militaristic nation of Porre invades the archipelago. The invasion brings Norris and Grobyc to the islands, a heartful commander of an elite force and a prototype cyborg soldier, respectively, as they too seek the Frozen Flame.|$|E
5|$|A saprobe or parasite, O.nidiformis is nonspecific in its {{needs and}} is {{compatible}} {{with a wide variety}} of hosts.
