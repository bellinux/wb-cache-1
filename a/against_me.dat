5|$|Due to his doping ban, he {{was barred}} from the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, {{and much of the}} European racing circuit, from 2006 to 2012. The Court of Arbitration for Sport {{overturned}} his lifetime Olympic ban, deeming it non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, and he competed in the 2012 London Olympics. He produced a ghost-written autobiography with writer Ken Scott, Race <b>Against</b> <b>Me,</b> in 2009. He is of Afro-Caribbean- Jamaican descent and has two sons with his partner Leonie Daley.|$|E

5|$|The record-breaking {{performance}} {{brought him}} an invite from the Berlin IAAF Golden League meet, although organising group Euromeetings condemned the move. Revelations in Chambers' autobiography Race <b>Against</b> <b>Me</b> brought further controversy {{as the book}} had in-depth accounts of his past drug abuse and claimed drug use remained rife in athletics, estimating that half the American Olympic athletes in Beijing had used illegal substances. Chambers signed a statement with UK Sport, verifying that he believed the information to be true, which brought a close to the organisation's inquiries into his drug use. An IAAF investigation concluded that the book demanded no further action on their part. Olympic gold medallist and anti-drugs campaigner Ed Moses gave his support, saying that Chambers admissions provided a useful insight, but that athletes and administrators remained in denial about {{the high levels of}} doping in athletics.|$|E
5|$|Blink-182 {{first began}} touring {{in support of}} Neighborhoods with the 10th Annual Honda Civic Tour in August 2011. The 2011 tour marked the tenth anniversary of the tour, which Blink-182 headlined in its first incarnation. The trio headlined the 10th Annual Honda Civic Tour with My Chemical Romance, which ran from August to October 2011, with {{additional}} dates scheduled in Canada with Rancid and <b>Against</b> <b>Me!.</b> In 2012 the band embarked on a worldwide 20th Anniversary Tour. The band continued touring in 2012 with their 20th Anniversary Tour, where they performed the rescheduled European dates originally canceled {{in order to continue}} recording. They were scheduled to headline the Bamboozle 2012 Music Festival but cancelled when Barker had to undergo an operation for tonsilitis. The 20th Anniversary Tour extended into Australia for in 2013 as part of the Soundwave festival, as well as 4 sideshows along the east coast with punk acts The Vandals and Sharks. Barker, who still suffers a fear of flying, did not attend; Brooks Wackerman, drummer of Bad Religion at the time, filled-in for Barker's position for the Australian tour.|$|E
5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians <b>against</b> <b>me.</b> Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

25|$|<b>Against</b> <b>Me!</b> is an American {{rock band}} formed in 1997 in Gainesville, Florida by singer and guitarist Laura Jane Grace. Since 2001, the band's lineup has also {{included}} guitarist James Bowman. After releasing three studio albums through independent record labels, <b>Against</b> <b>Me!</b> moved to Sire Records for 2007's New Wave, which reached no. 57 on the Billboard 200. In 2011, the band launched their own record label, Total Treble Music, {{through which to}} release future albums.|$|E
25|$|<b>Against</b> <b>Me!</b> {{was formed}} in 1997 by singer/guitarist Laura Jane Grace as a solo act, amidst the breakup of her {{previous}} band(s). The first <b>Against</b> <b>Me!</b> release was an eponymously titled demo tape in 1997. It was self-released in very limited numbers. With the addition of drummer Kevin Mahon, a second demo, Vivida Vis! (1998), was released in limited numbers by Misanthrope Records. The band started their first tour in March 1999, a month-long tour of the East coast, during which they met Jordan Kleeman in Baltimore, Maryland. The band's first EP, <b>Against</b> <b>Me!,</b> was released twice through Crasshole Records, (once in 1999 and 2000). James Bowman joined the band in 2000 somewhere around this time. Grace, Bowman, and Mahon supported the EP on a month - and - a - half- long tour of the West coast that year. The band toured in Grace's 1976 Buick LeSabre, of which the engine blew {{up at the end}} of the tour. Their first widely distributed release was the EP Crime as Forgiven by <b>Against</b> <b>Me!</b> (2001), released by Plan-It-X Records and Sabot Productions (run by longtime <b>Against</b> <b>Me!</b> tour manager Jordan Kleeman). On April 23, 2001, while heading south on I-75, returning home from their first tour as a four-piece band, their van was struck by a semi truck. They landed upside-down in a ditch. No one was harmed, but the van and equipment were destroyed, after which Bowman and Mahon left the band. The band broke up for a few months that year. A third EP, a self-titled acoustic recording by Grace and bassist Dustin Fridkin, was released in November 2001.|$|E

Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books.
