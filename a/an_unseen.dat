40|$|We have highligthed the {{importance}} of meteorological measurements,using <b>a</b> <b>unseen</b> instrument:Pludix, that is a Present Weather Sensor working in the modern forecast way called 'now casting', {{that is a very}} short-term forecasting based on remote sensing. Being <b>a</b> <b>unseen</b> instrument, to value the good estimate of datum,it's fundamental the metrological valuation:we have made it weighting datum uncertainties. Comparing to the traditional instruments,Pludix has presented lower relative errors. Moreover,it's effective because it measures on the ground. So it's irreplaceable;in fact, satellites can't distinguish,for instance, two different areas in an interface. Instead,measuring on the ground,Pludix can indicate the real meteorological even...|$|R

5|$|Based on {{apparent}} {{changes in}} the position of Epsilon Eridani between 1938 and 1972, Peter van de Kamp proposed that <b>an</b> <b>unseen</b> companion with an orbital period of 25years was causing gravitational perturbations in its position. This claim was refuted in 1993 by Wulff-Dieter Heintz and the false detection was blamed on a systematic error in the photographic plates.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, paleontologists David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski {{suggested}} that extinction events on Earth followed a periodic trend.

He that works, whatsoever be his work, he bodies forth the form of Things Unseen; a small Poet every Worker is. The idea, were it but of his poor Delf Platter, how much more of his Epic Poem, is as yet 'seen,' half-seen, only by himself; to all others it is <b>a</b> thing <b>unseen,</b> impossible; to Nature herself it is <b>a</b> thing <b>unseen,</b> <b>a</b> thing which never hitherto was;--very 'impossible,' for it is as yet <b>a</b> No-thing!

Alas, if he look to the Seen Powers only, he may as well quit the business; his No-thing will never rightly issue as a Thing, but as a Deceptivity, a Sham-thing,--which it had better not do! ...|$|R
