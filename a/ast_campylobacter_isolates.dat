Two hundred forty-five samples from an organic broiler farm were collected weekly from the first week {{to the end of}} the production cycle, and they were cultured for thermophilic Campylobacter. Tetracycline resistance of these <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> was identified by the agar dilution method, whereas DNA fingerprinting profiles of tet-susceptible and tet-resistant strains were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). None of the <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> from the third and the fourth week of the production period were resistant to tetracycline, whereas 66. 7 % of the isolates from the fifth week were resistant to this antibiotic. Although the prevalence of tetracycline resistance reached 100. 0 % during the sixth and seventh week, less than 34. 0 % of the isolates from the 10 th week were resistant to this antimicrobial agent. In addition, only 13. 8 % of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> from the intestinal tracts of these organically raised broilers were resistant to tetracycline. The presence of the tet(O) gene was detected in 98. 9 % of tet-resistant <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates,</b> and tet-susceptible and tet-resistant Campylobacter strains showed distinct PFGE genotypes.

40|$|Background: Thermophilic campylobacters, {{particularly}} Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli are {{the main}} agents of human campylobacteriosis.

A total of 694 <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> from the conventional and organic poultry operations were tested for antimicrobial resistance to nine antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method. Although Campylobacter species were highly prevalent in both the conventional and organic poultry operations, the antimicrobial resistance rates were significantly different between the organic operations and the conventional operations.

40|$|Campylobacter {{species are}} one of the leading causes of {{foodborne}} disease in the United States. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the two main species of concern to human health and cause approximately 95 % of human infections. Molecular typing methods, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) are often used to source track foodborne bacterial pathogens. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare PFGE and MLST in typing strains of C. jejuni and C. coli that were isolated from different Oklahoma retail meat sources. A total of 47 <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> (28 C. jejuni and 19 C. coli) isolated from various retail meat samples (beef, beef livers, pork, chicken, turkey, chicken livers, and chicken gizzards) were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). PFGE was able to group the 47 <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> into two major clusters (one for C. jejuni and one for C. coli) but failed to differentiate the isolates according to their source. MLST revealed 21 different sequence types (STs) that belonged to eight different clonal complexes. Twelve of the screened <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> (8 C. jejuni and 4 C. coli) did not show any defined STs. All the defined STs of C. coli isolates belonged to ST- 828 complex. The majority of C. jejuni isolates belonged to ST- 353, ST- 607, ST- 52, ST- 61, and ST- 21 complexes. It is worthy to mention that, while the majority of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> in this study showed STs that are commonly associated with human infections along with other sources, most of the STs from chicken livers were solely reported in human cases. In conclusion, retail meat <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> tested in this study particularly those from chicken livers showed relatedness to STs commonly associated with humans.

Among 208 campylobacters tested, more than 90 % of isolates were susceptible to 4 out of 9 antibiotics (nalidixic acid, erythromycin, chloramphenicol and gentamicin). Most campylobacters were resistant to 3 antibiotics and multiple resistance {{was found in}} 4 %. Ciprofloxacin resistance was 11 %. Campylobacter contamination (28 %) in imported chickens (n = 150) was almost half that found in local whole chickens (50 %), but the resistance of imported isolates (n = 42) {{was similar to that}} of local campylobacters. Resistance in isolates from imported chicken breasts was generally more common, but to only 4 antibiotics. Resistance patterns of chicken isolates were compared to human clinical isolates (n = 494), and a greater similarity was found between the clinical and local isolates than with imported campylobacters. Lower chloramphenicol resistance was found in clinical <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> than in those from chicken sources...|$|R
40|$|In Switzerland, a {{national}} database with 1028 <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> from poultry, pigs, cats, dogs, cattle, humans, zoo animals and {{water has been}} created. The database contains the genetic fingerprint and background information of each <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolate.</b> Dominant species could be identified in the different sources with a majority of Campylobacter jejuni in poultry (73 %), humans (79 %), cattle (95 %), zoo animals (40 %) and water (100 %), of Campylobacter coli in pigs (72 %), and of Campylobacter upsaliensis/helveticus in cats and dogs (55 %). The comparison of three genotyping methods, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), pulsed field gel electrophoresis and restriction fragment length polymorphism, revealed that AFLP allows discrimination between the different Campylobacter species and is the most appropriate method to distinguish specific strains within the same species. Genotyping analysis demonstrated that the Campylobacter population is heterogeneous among the different sources and that no dominant clone is spread in the country. Genotyping and the resulting database are useful tools to trace back future Campylobacter infections...|$|R
40|$|Campylobacter is {{recognized}} as one of the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, and is frequently isolated from the small intestines and ceca microflora of chickens. Twenty-one out of 81 Campylobacter-positive poultry flocks were selected to evaluate the genetic diversity of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> and to study the distribution of genotypes among flocks. <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> recovered from chicken carcasses and ceca were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Little diversity was found among <b>Campylobacter</b> strains <b>isolated</b> from a given carcass, with a maximum of 2 different genotypes being present. However, at flock level, as many as 4 different profiles were observed. Typing of strains showed that most strains isolated from ceca were similar to those isolated from corresponding broiler carcasses. A total of 39 different macrorestriction profiles were observed, with evidence of Campylobacter cross-contamination among broiler flocks in Quebec slaughterhouses. Surprisingly, some flocks shared related genotypes both with and without sharing similar rearing practices. Existence of such cross-contamination must be considered to in developing strategies to control Campylobacter in chickens, and to avoid bacteria contamination of noncolonized flocks. Further typing studies of Campylobacter found in hatcheries, farm environment, and crates or trucks in Quebec might be helpful in elucidating the kinetics of broiler chicken Campylobacter contamination...|$|R

Rectal swabs from 155 sheep and 252 goats from Grenada were evaluated to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter spp., antibiotic resistance, and multilocus sequence types. Fifteen <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> were obtained (14 C. jejuni and 1 C. coli). The prevalence (3. 7 %) {{did not differ significantly}} between sheep (4. 5 %) and goats (3. 2 %). Among the seven antimicrobials tested, resistance was only detected for tetracycline (30. 8 %) and metronidazole (38. 5 %). <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> showed no significant difference between sheep and goats for type of antimicrobial resistance or percent of resistant isolates. Twelve of the isolates were successfully genotyped consisting of four recognized clonal complexes and three novel sequence types. Importantly, one isolate from one goat was identified as the C. jejuni sequence type- 8, a zoonotic and tetracycline-resistant clone reported to be a highly virulent clone associated with ovine abortion in the USA. Althoughmost samples were from comingled sheep and goat production units, there were no shared sequence types between these two host species. None of the sequence types identified in this study have previously been reported in poultry in Grenada, suggesting sheep- and goat-specific Campylobacter clones in Grenada. This is the first report of genotyping of <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>isolates</b> from sheep and goats in the Eastern Caribbean. 1...|$|R
