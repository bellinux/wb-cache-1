40|$|The {{biology and}} {{immature}} stages of 11 species of native <b>Australian</b> <b>bugs</b> of the superfamily Coreoidea are studied and their {{relevance to the}} status of the included taxa are considered. The immature stages of Hyocephalidae and Agriopocorinae are described {{for the first time and}} an account of the life cycle of the former is given. The morphology of the coreoid larvae is studied in detail and the relative growth of pronotum and antennal and leg segments is studied in six species of Coreidae and Alydidae.

40|$|Third-instar nymphs of the <b>Australian</b> assassin <b>bug,</b> Pristhesancus plagipennis (Walker) were {{released}} into cotton and soybean plots {{at a number}} of release densities to test their biological control potential. The number of Helicoverpa spp. larvae in cotton was reduced with the release of three or more P. plagipennis nymphs per m crop row. In the soybeans, populations of green mirids, Creontiades dilutus (Stål), and looper caterpillars, Chrysodeixis spp., were significantly reduced when P. plagipennis {{were released}} at 2 nymphs per m crop row. The potential yield of cotton (but not soybean) was increased in the plots to which P. plagipennis were added. The data suggest that P. plagipennis has the capacity to be an effective biological control agent of soybean and cotton insect pests when released inundativel...|$|R
40|$|The tribe Leucophoropterini (Miridae: Phylinae) is {{a diverse}} {{assemblage}} of primarily Indo-Pacific and <b>Australian</b> <b>bugs</b> which are united by simple, small genitalia and a trend towards ant-mimetic body forms. Previous to this work, {{the relationship of}} the Leucophoropterini to the other tribes of Phylinae, as well as the generic relationships within the lineage, was unresolved. Further, the characters initially proposed to unite the tribe are brought into question with the addition of several recently discovered taxa from Australia. The Leucophoropterini is first re-evaluated within a phylogenetic analysis of the subfamily Phylinae, using a combined molecular and morphological dataset to test the monophyly of the lineage, re-test the character synapomorphies supporting it, and to determine the closest relatives to the tribe. The molecular dataset includes 4 genes (COII, 16 S, 28 S, and 18 S), and 123 morphological characters for 104 taxa, which is analyzed in a parsimony analysis using Tree analysis using New Technology [TNT], a model-based analysis in RAxML, and a Bayesian analysis in Mr. Bayes. All three methods resulted in phylogenetic trees with nearly identical generic and tribal groupings, and a lineage containing Pseudophylus Yasunaga, Decomia Poppius and Tuxedo Schuh being sister-group to the Leucophoropterini. With the closest relatives to the Leucophoropterini determined for outgroup selection, a generic revision of the tribe including both Australian and Indo-Pacific taxa is accomplished using 137 morphological characters and is analyzed in an un-weighted and implied weighted parsimony analysis using TNT for 86 leucophoropterine taxa. The Indo-Pacific taxa of Leucophoropterini are found {{to be related to the}} Australian Leucophoropterini, and at least two genera within the tribe (Sejanus Distant, Leucophoroptera Poppius) were found to be paraphyletic. Lastly, taxa are revised within the context of the generic-level phylogenetic analysis, with new genera and species from Australia and the Indo-Pacific being described...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} demographic {{performance of}} biological invaders may often {{depend on their}} escape from specifically adapted enemies. Here we report that native taxa in colonized regions may swiftly evolve to exploit such emancipated exotic species because of selection caused by invaders. A native <b>Australian</b> true <b>bug</b> has expanded it host range to include a vine imported from tropical America {{that has become a}} serious environmental weed. Based on field comparisons and historical museum specimens, we show that over the past 30 - 40 years, seed feeding soapberry bugs have evolved 5 - 10 % longer mouthparts, better suited to attack the forest-invading balloon vines, which have large fruits. Laboratory experiments show that these differences are genetically based, and result in a near-doubling of the rate at which seeds are attacked. Thus a native biota that initially permits invasion may rapidly respond in ways that ultimately facilitate control...|$|R
40|$|Third-instar nymphs of the <b>Australian</b> assassin <b>bug,</b> Pristhesancus plagipennis (Walker), were {{released}} into cotton plots at two release densities and two crop growth stages {{to test their}} biological control potential. Release rates of 2 and 5 nymphs per metre row resulted in field populations of 0. 51 and 1. 38 nymphs per metre row, respectively, indicating that over 70 % of nymphs died or emigrated within two weeks of release. Effective release rates of 1. 38 nymphs per metre row {{reduced the number of}} Helicoverpa spp. larvae in the plots for a 7 -week period. Crop yields were significantly greater in the plots to which P. plagipennis nymphs {{were released}}, with the effective release rate of 1. 38 nymphs per metre row providing equivalent yields as insecticide treated plots. The data suggest that P. plagipennis has the capacity to reduce Helicoverpa spp. larvae densities in cotton crops when augmented through inundative release...|$|R
40|$|Ongoing {{adaptation}} {{in native}} populations to anthropogenic change both facilitates and challenges ecologically appropriate and sustainable management. Human disturbance promotes adaptive responses at the genomic, individual and population levels. Traits vary widely in whether adaptation occurs through plasticity or evolution, and these modes inter-act within and among traits. For example, plasticity in one trait may be adaptive because it permits homeostasis and lessens {{the intensity of}} selection in another. Both opportunity and catastrophe generate adaptive responses. Recently evolved adaptations characterize the responses of many native species to biotic invasions. Several well-known examples involve native phytophagous insects colonizing introduced plants. For example, our studies of North American and <b>Australian</b> soapberry <b>bugs</b> on nonindigenous plants demonstrate both diversifying and homogenizing contemporary evolution. Modes of adaptation differ among traits and populations and {{as a function of}} the host on which they develop. The genetic architecture of the evolving adaptations involves a substantial degree of nonadditive genetic variation. One important consequence of contemporary adaptation may be an enhanced capacity of native communities to provide adaptive biological control of invasive species. Conservation scientists may manipulate adaptation to achieve conservation goals, but must also decide how deeply they wish to attempt to control the phenotypes and geno-types of other species...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{adaptation}} of plant feeding insects to introduced hosts provides clear cases of ecologically based population divergence. In {{most cases the}} mechanisms permitting rapid differentiation are not well known. Here we study morphological and genetic variation associated with recent shifts by the <b>Australian</b> soapberry <b>bug</b> Leptocoris tagalicus onto two naturalized Neotropical balloon vines, Cardiospermum halicacabum and C. grandiflorum that differ in time since introduction. Our results show that these vines have much larger fruits than the native hosts (Whitewood tree -Atalaya hemiglauca- and Woolly Rambutan -Alectryon tomentosus-) and that bugs living on them have evolved significantly longer beaks and new allometries. Genetic analyses of mitochondrial haplotypes and amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers indicate that the lineage of bugs on the annual vine C. halicacabum, the older introduction, is intermediate between the two subspecies of L. tagalicus found on native hosts. Moreover, where the annual vine and Whitewood tree co-occur, the morphology and genomic composition of the bugs {{are similar to those}} occurring in allopatry. These results show that hybridization provided the genetic elements underlying the strongly differentiated Halicacabum bugs 2 ̆ 7. In contrast, the bugs feeding on the recently introduced perennial balloon vine (C. grandiflorum) showed no evidence of admixture, and are genetically indistinguishable from the nearby populations on a native host...|$|R
40|$|Web-invading araneophagic predators hunt a {{dangerous}} prey, and thus risk becoming the hunted {{rather than the}} hunter. As a result, these predators require considerable skill when hunting. An <b>Australian</b> araneophagic assassin <b>bug,</b> Stenolemus bituberus (Heteroptera, Reduviidae), is known to hunt {{a wide range of}} spiders by invading their webs. We observed the predatory behaviour of S. bituberus hunting 5 species of sympatric spider: Achaearanea sp. (Theridiidae), Achaearanea extridium (Theridiidae), Badumna longinqua (Desidae), Pholcus phalangioides (Pholcidae) and Uloboridae sp., all of which constitute a part of the natural prey range of S. bituberus. Stenolemus bituberus utilises two distinct predatory strategies whilst hunting these spiders: (1) luring, wherein S. bituberus manipulates the silk of the spider webs, appearing to attract the resident spider within attacking range; and (2) stalking, in which S. bituberus stealthily approaches and attacks the resident spider. We propose that the luring strategy adopted by S. bituberus may be a form of vibratory aggressive mimicry, a hypothesis that we are currently testing using a combination of comparative and playback experimental techniques. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Soapberry bugs are {{worldwide}} seed predators {{of plants}} in the family Sapindaceae. Australian sapinds are diverse and widespread, consisting of about 200 native trees and shrubs. This flora also includes two introduced environmental weeds, plus cultivated lychee (Litchi chinensis Sonn.), longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) and rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum L.). Accordingly, <b>Australian</b> soapberry <b>bugs</b> may be significant in ecology, conservation and agriculture. Here we provide the first account of their ecology. We find five species of Leptocoris Hahn in Australia, and list sapinds that do and do not serve as reproductive hosts. From museum and field records we map the continental distributions of the insects and primary hosts. Frequency of occupation varies among host species, {{and the number of}} hosts varies among the insects. In addition, differences in body size and beak length are related to host use. For example, the long-beaked Leptocoris tagalicus Burmeister is highly polyphagous in eastern rainforests, where it occurs on at least 10 native and non-native hosts. It aggregates on hosts with immature fruit and commences feeding before fruits dehisce. Most of its continental range, however, matches that of a single dryland tree, Atalaya hemiglauca F. Muell., which has comparatively unprotected seeds. The taxon includes a smaller and shorter-beaked form that is closely associated with Atalaya, and appears to be taxonomically distinct. The other widespread soapberry bug is the endemic Leptocoris mitellatus Bergroth. It too is short-beaked, and colonises hosts phenologically later than L. tagalicus, as seeds become more accessible in open capsules. Continentally its distribution is more southerly and corresponds mainly to that of Alectryon oleifolius Desf. Among all host species, the non-native environmental weeds Cardiospermum L. and Koelreuteria Laxm. are most consistently attacked, principally by L. tagalicus. These recent host shifts have biocontrol implications. In contrast, the sapinds planted as fruit crops appear to be less frequently used at present and mainly by the longer-beaked species...|$|R
40|$|Host range expansion, or {{adaptation}} of insects to new hosts, is a worldwide phenomenon {{that has been}} observed repeatedly and extensively; still, the genetic mechanisms behind host-shifts are not well known. In this thesis I focus on the morphological and genetic variation associated with two recent anthropogenic host shifts in two species of soapberry bug, Leptocoris tagalicus and Jadera haematoloma [...] First, I investigated the host-associated genetic differentiation in <b>Australian</b> Leptocoris soapberry <b>bugs,</b> as determined by genome-wide variation patterns. My results show that specimens feeding on two naturalized Neotropical balloon vines, (Cardiospermum halicacabum and C. grandiflorum) have longer “beaks” that those living on the native trees Atalaya hemiglauca and Alectryon tomentosus. Genetic analyses of mitochondrial haplotypes and amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers indicate that the lineage of bugs on the annual vine C. halicacabum, is intermediate between two subspecies of L. tagalicus found on the native hosts. Moreover, where this annual vine and whitewood tree (A. hemiglauca) co-occur, the morphology and genomic composition of the bugs {{are similar to those}} occurring in allopatry. These results show that hybridization provided the genetic elements underlying the strongly differentiated ‘halicacabum bugs’. In contrast, the bugs feeding on the recently introduced perennial balloon vine (C. grandiflorum) showed no evidence of admixture, and are genetically indistinguishable from the nearby populations on a native host. Second I used a candidate gene approach to investigate the molecular genetic basis of host-adaptation in Floridian populations of the red-shouldered soapberry bug, J. haematoloma. While in Southern Florida soapberry bugs have long beaks to penetrate the large fruits of the native balloon vine (C. corindum), in northern and central Florida, bugs have evolved to feed on an introduced, flat-podded host, the Taiwanese Golden rain tree (Koelreuteria elegans). Specifically I focused on five genes because of their potential role in host preference (orco), “beak” length (Dll, dac, hth) and the adaptation to the toxic compounds of host-plants (Na+/K+-ATPase). My results suggest these genes are highly conserved in this system, and that genetic variation at these loci is not associated with the different host-plants...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential of companion planting as a strategy {{to aid in the}} management of Helicoverpa armigera in tomato and capsicum cropping systems. The investigaitons showed that a companion planting type system is unlikely to confer any benefits to the management of H. armigera in these crops. The project has contributed to the understanding of H. armigera host selection and how the pest responds to a diversified environment. Companion planting and vegetational diversity are strategies for reducing pest incidence on crops. Many theories have been devised to explain how introducing more than one plant species to a cropping space may reduce the incidence of a pest. Five ecological theories formed the basis of experiments in this study: The resource concentration hypothesis - Herbivores are more likely to find and remain on hosts that are growing in dense or nearly pure stands (Root, 1973). Associational resistance/Plant apparency - Crop plants grown as monocultures are more apparent to herbivorous insects than plants in diverse natural systems (Tahvanainen and Root, 1972). Trap cropping – the use of plants within a cropping area to attract oviposition away from the main crop (Banks and Ekbom, 1999). The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host seleciton (Cunningham et al., 1998 a). The natural enemies hypothesis - generalist and specialist natural enemies are expected to be more abundant in diverse rather than simple systems (Root, 1973) A tall variety of sorghum (the forage variety Chopper) was tested for its ability to disrupt host location. Sorghum was planted around plots of tomatoes to act as a screen to disrupt visual cues for host location by Helicoverpa spp. No difference was found in egg numbers on tomatoes with or without sorghum companions. However, significantly higher numbers of Helicoverpa spp. larvae were found in the sorghum at flowering than in the tomatoes. This suggested the sorghum was acting as a trap crop, diverting oviposition away from the tomato crop. However, due to a short period of flowering and therefore peak attractiveness to H. armigera, sorghum was not considered to be a suitable companion plant for inclusion in commercial tomato production systems. A host preference study was conducted to determine the preferences of H. armigera for crop plants and possible companions in the hope of finding a suitable trap crop species. Tomatoes were shown to be a highly preferred plant making it difficult to find a compatible trap crop species that would be more attractive than the main crop. However, capsicums were less prefered and therefore more suitable for this type of experimentation. Marigolds were also found to be a highly preferred plant and formed the basis for further investigations into trap cropping systems. Field experiments were conducted in successive years in two geographical locations to assess the suitability of marigolds as a trap crop for capsicums in a field situation. However, in both years H. armigera incidence was extremely and unusually low leading to inconclusive results. A glasshouse experiment was performed to assess if the ratio of capsicum plants to marigolds plants had an effect on which species H. armigera would choose for oviposition. It was found that as more capsicum plants were introduced, moths became less likely to oviposit on the supposedly more preferred marigold plant. The diminishing attractiveness of a more preferred host in the presence of other hosts is a new observation of H. armigera behaviour. This result suggests that marigolds would be unlikely to be a successful trap crop in a field situation. The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host selection and the influence of this on host selection in the field was investigated. No evidence of learning was found. This was the first study investigating the effect of learning in a field situation; previously the behaviour had only been investigated in a laboratory situation (Cunningham, et al. 1998 a). The ability of the <b>Australian</b> assassin <b>bug,</b> Pristhesancus plagipennis (Walker) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) to predate H. armigera larvae on capsicum plants was investigated. This predator has been sucessfully been used for H. armigera management in cotton (Grundy, 2000 b), but had not been investigated in horticultural crops. Significant reductions in larvae were achieved in treatments where assassin bugs were introduced. This predator warrants further investigation for inclusion in commercial integrated pest managment programs for capsicums. Pest repellent plants were also considered. Previous to this study, very little research work had been conducted on repellent plants for H. armigera. The herbs investigated were catnip (Nepta cataria), tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), basil (Ocium basilicum) and coriander (Coriander sativum). An olfactometer system was designed and built to test H. armigera moths’ responses to odours from the herbs. Glasshouse experiments were also conducted. No repellent activity was recorded with any of the herbs tested. The results of this study support the theory that Helicoverpa spp. employ a strategy of passive host selection as suggested by Firempong (1986). This means that all available plants in an area may be oviposited on with successful ovipostion and larval development leading to the future utilisation of a species as a host plant. The implication of this finding is that in-field trap cropping is unlikely to be a successful strategy for reducing H. armigera oviposition in tomato or capsicum production systems in Australia. In cotton crops in Australia, trap cropping is used as part of an area wide management strategy and aims to reduce the total Helicoverpa spp. population of a region. Such a strategy may also be successful in horticultural crops but only with the full participation of the growers of all crops that are attractive to H. armigera in a horticultural growing region. Due to the diverse nature of horticultural production this may be a difficult task...|$|R
