25|$|James VI's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, was {{considered}} a plausible successor to the English throne. At the beginning of Elizabeth's reign she sent ambassadors to England when a parliament was summoned, anticipating a role for parliament in settling the succession in her favour. Mary was a Roman Catholic, and her proximity to the succession {{was a factor in}} plotting, making her position <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>problem</b> for the English government, eventually resolved by judicial means. She was executed in 1587. In that year Mary's son James reached the age of twenty-one, while Arbella was only twelve.|$|E
500|$|Early Restoration Movement leaders {{varied in}} {{their views of}} slavery, {{reflecting}} the range of positions common in the antebellum U.S. [...] Barton W. Stone was a strong opponent of slavery, arguing {{that there was no}} Biblical justification for the form of slavery then being practiced in the United States and calling for immediate emancipation. [...] Alexander Campbell represented a more [...] "Jeffersonian" [...] opposition to slavery, writing of it as more of <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>problem</b> than as a religious or moral one. [...] Having seen Methodists and Baptists divide over the issue of slavery, Campbell argued that scripture regulated slavery rather than prohibited it, and that abolition {{should not be allowed to}} become an issue over which Christians would break fellowship with each other. [...] Like the country as a whole, the assumption of white racial superiority was almost universal among those on all sides of the issue, and it was common for congregations to have separate seating for black members.|$|E

Then again, {{she would be}} as fond of him as ever. In 1583 she informed ambassadors that Lettice Dudley was [...] "a she-wolf" [...] and her husband a [...] "traitor" [...] and [...] "a cuckold". Lady Leicester's social life was much curtailed. Even her movements could pose <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>problem,</b> as Francis Walsingham explained: [...] "I see not her Majesty disposed to use the services of my Lord of Leicester. There is great offence taken at the conveying down of his lady." [...] The Earl stood by his wife, asking his colleagues to intercede for her; there was no hope: [...] "She [...] doth take every occasion by my marriage to withdraw any good from me", Leicester wrote even {{after seven years of}} marriage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{example of}} the term Islamofascism, according to William Safire, occurs in an article penned by the Scottish scholar and writer Malise Ruthven writing in 1990. Ruthven used it {{to refer to the}} way in which traditional Arab dictatorships used religious appeals in order to stay in power. Malise Ruthven, Construing Islam as a Language, The Independent 8 September 1990. [...] "Nevertheless there is what might be called <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>problem</b> affecting the Muslim world. In contrast to the heirs of some other non-Western traditions, including Hinduism, Shintoism and Buddhism, Islamic societies seem to have found it particularly hard to institutionalise divergences politically: authoritarian government, not to say Islamo-fascism, is the rule rather than the exception from Morocco to Pakistan." [...] Ruthven doubts that he himself coined the term, stating that the attribution to him is probably due to the fact that internet search engines don't go back beyond 1990.|$|E

2500|$|After the Nazis came {{to power}} {{at the end of}} January 1933, their {{position}} changed rapidly. [...] Fritz Todt produced a report arguing for the building of highways, Straßenbau und Straßenverwaltung, known as the [...] "Brown Report" [...] (Braune Denkschrift or Brauner Bericht), and in a speech at the Berlin Motor Show on February 11, Hitler presented it as a necessity and as the future measure of a people, as railroads had been in the past. A law establishing the Reichsautobahn project under that name was passed on June 27, 1933, and the Gesellschaft Reichsautobahnen (Reichsautobahns Association) was founded on August 25 as a subsidiary of the Reichsbahn, thereby removing its objections. Todt was named Generalinspektor für das deutsche Straßenwesen (Inspector-General for the German Road System) on June 30. HAFRABA and other organizations were folded into the planning arm, known as GEZUVOR (Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung der Reichsautobahn, Society for the Preparation of the Reichsautobahn). The Chairman of the Board of HAFRABA, Dr. Ludwig Landmann, the Mayor of Frankfurt, was Jewish, which provided the Nazis with a reason to take it over. The autobahn was presented to the German public as Hitler's idea: he was represented as having sketched out the future network of highways while in Landsberg Prison in 1924. They were to be [...] "the Führer's roads", a myth promoted by Todt himself, who coined the phrase and warned close associates not to [...] "in any way [...] the impression arise that I built the autobahns. They are to be reckoned as simply and solely the Führer's roads." [...] Hof, an enthusiastic party member, resigned on December 22, 1934; the editor of the HAFRABA magazine, Kurt Kaftan, had caused <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>problem</b> by presenting Hof as the originator of the idea, or jointly responsible for it with Hitler. The overlapping responsibilities of the Gesellschaft Reichsautobahnen (in charge of construction) and of Todt's office (in charge of planning but also of all roads in the Reich) exemplified the growth of central authorities in the Third Reich and inevitably led to conflicts, but only on January 1, 1941 was the Gesellschaft Reichsautobahnen removed from the Reichsbahn and placed directly under Todt.|$|E
