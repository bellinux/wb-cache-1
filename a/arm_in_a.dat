Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later {{seen on a}} flight with his own boxed lunch, his <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what {{is assumed to be}} part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Initially reluctant, Lecter then assents.|$|E
5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian {{aeronautical}} pioneer John Stringfellow (1799–1883) first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. James Gillingham (1839–1924) from Chard pioneered the development of articulated artificial limbs when he produced a prosthesis for a man who lost his <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cannon accident in 1863. Chard Museum has a display of Gillingham's work.|$|E

5|$|Megaera– The {{first of}} the three Furies, she was {{ruthless}} in her punishment and accidentally facilitated Kratos' freedom from his imprisonment. Despite her best efforts of having Aegaeon's infected parts destroy Kratos, the Spartan overcame the brute and killed Megaera. In a flashback two weeks prior, Kratos cut off her right <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> battle in Delos, which also involved Tisiphone, and facilitated in Kratos' capture. The character was voiced by Nika Futterman.|$|E
5|$|In early 1941, the Second Echelon was redesignated the 5th Infantry Brigade, 2nd New Zealand Division, and {{was sent}} to Greece {{as part of an}} Allied {{contingent}} set to counter a likely invasion by the Germans. His battalion was positioned at the Olympus Pass, and shortly after the invasion commenced, engaged advancing German tanks. The New Zealanders withdrew after a day, beginning a gradual retreat from the country. Evacuated to Crete on 25 April, 22nd Battalion was defending Maleme airfield when German paratroopers attacked on 20 May. The airfield was abandoned that evening much to Elliott's displeasure as his platoon was holding their positions. The Allies were eventually evacuated to Egypt a week later, but not before Elliott was wounded in the <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> skirmish with enemy paratroopers.|$|E
5|$|McCall played {{football}} for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning {{goal for the}} latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute with his <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sling. While McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy, football was a focus, and he captained the Leeds under-11 boys team and played for other Leeds representative sides. McCall's parents split and he made up for his size {{when he moved to}} one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14. He moved schools to Harrington High and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later Farsley Celtic. McCall thought he had missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played Bradford City's junior side in a friendly and he impressed coach Bryan Edwards enough to be asked for a trial.|$|E

5|$|Pierce's 1954 {{season was}} {{interrupted}} when he reported {{pain in his}} left <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> May 25 win over Cleveland; after several days of difficulty in determining the problem, he had oral surgery to remove an infected wisdom tooth and adjacent molar on June 3. He did not pitch again until June 20, but a lack of arm strength caused him to be ineffective in that start before slowly coming back with two relief appearances and another poor start, finally picking up wins with consecutive 3–0 shutouts on July 5 and 11, the latter being his fourth career two-hitter. It was later reported that the tooth problem had possibly existed as early as spring training, when Pierce initially suffered arm problems. But although he recorded only nine wins that season, {{he was one of}} just four pitchers to defeat the Indians three times as they racked up a league-record 111 victories, after also having been one of four pitchers to defeat the champion Yankees four times in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The second divisional game of {{the year}} for the 3–0 Bears, looking for their first 4–0 start in seven seasons, took place at Ford Field against the 2–1 Detroit Lions. Since 2001, the Bears had won 17 of the {{meetings}} between the two, compared to Detroit's 9. The Bears defense, ranked 19th in scoring defense with 24.7 points per game and 25th in yards allowed with 383.0, had {{to keep up with the}} Lions' 4th-ranked offense, who recorded 410.7 yards per game 27.3 PPG, sixth in the league. The Lions also had running back Reggie Bush return from a knee injury; Bush had recorded 260 yards and a touchdown in the first two games. However, the Lions' leading receiver Nate Burleson broke his <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car accident, which meant additional focus on Calvin Johnson for the Bears. Expectations were for Charles Tillman to cover Johnson, who was limited by Tillman to 15 catches, no touchdowns and an average of 62.3 receiving yards in the last three games. Although Tillman had suffered groin and knee injuries that left him questionable for the game, he was later listed as active against the Lions. However, Johnson recorded 40 catches for 20+ yards in 2012, and the Bears allowed the Steelers to gain 20 yards or more in nine plays. To attempt to combat Johnson, the Bears switched from the pressure defense run in the first three games to the cover 2. In the battle on the line of scrimmage, the Bears had to contain Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley, while the Lions had to protect Matthew Stafford from Julius Peppers and Corey Wootton. Offensively, the Bears also had to survive the crowd, who helped the Bears commit nine false start penalties in 2011.|$|E

He suffered a broken <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fall from a stable attic while visiting his mother in law, Lady Willoughby de Eresby at Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire. Tryon showed considerable regard for his mother in law, who died not long afterwards in November 1888.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter never flew another {{mission in}} space. After taking {{a leave of}} absence from the {{astronaut}} corps in the fall of 1963 to train for and participate in the Navy's SEALAB program, Carpenter sustained a medically grounding injury to his left <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> motorbike accident. After failing to regain mobility in his arm after two surgical interventions (in 1964 and 1967), Carpenter was ruled ineligible for spaceflight. He resigned from NASA in August 1967. He spent the last part of his NASA career developing underwater training to help astronauts with future spacewalks.|$|E
25|$|Kickers and slingshots are {{rubber pads}} which propel {{the ball away}} upon impact, like bumpers, but are usually a {{horizontal}} side of a wall. Every recent pinball machine includes slingshots to the upper left and upper right of the lowest set of flippers; older games used more experimental arrangements. They operate similarly to pop bumpers, with a switch {{on each side of}} a solenoid-operated lever <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> typical arrangement. The switches are closed by ball contact with the rubber {{on the face of the}} kicker and this activates the solenoid.|$|E

25|$|West Indies beat India 5–0 at home next year, and in 1963, {{they beat}} a fine English team by three matches to one. The Lord's Test {{of this series}} saw a famous finish. With two balls left, England needed six runs to win, and West Indies one wicket. The {{non-striker}} was Colin Cowdrey, who had his left <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sling, having fractured it earlier in the day. However, David Allen safely played out the last two balls and the match ended in a draw. Worrell retired {{at the end of}} the series. The selectors picked Garry Sobers to succeed him.|$|E

25|$|Aoki has {{received}} criticisms by the mixed martial arts community for his disrespectful victory celebrations and perceived {{lack of care}} for his opponents, often causing injuries which are seen as needless. He firstly became known for breaking Keith Wisniewski's arm, then doing the same with Kuniyoshi Hironaka via flying armbar in a Brazilian jiu-jitsu bout, sidelining him for a year. In 2009, controversy would come when he faced Mizuto Hirota in a super bout. After Aoki won by breaking Hirota's <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> brutal fashion, he gave the middle finger to the downed fighter and the crowd while running excitedly.|$|E

In April 2006, Noble {{was involved in a}} motorbike accident, and both fractured and dislocated his collarbone. Conveniently he crashed right outside a hospital. Noble performed his shows over the following weeks with his <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sling. During his 'Things' tour, in Bristol on 1 March 2009, he claimed that before the ambulance officers would help him, he was forced to do his Stephen Hawking impression.|$|E
25|$|Ahead of the tour, drummer Jonny Quinn {{broke his}} <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> snowboarding {{accident}} in the French Alps. The band had to cancel several of their shows before on the tour, when bassist Paul Wilson injured his arm and shoulder, and when vocalist Gary Lightbody developed laryngitis and lost his voice. Not wanting to cancel shows, the band recruited longtime friend Graham Hopkins to replace Quinn. Hopkins got one rehearsal to learn his drum parts before the tour dates began. Quinn was expected to return for the Australian Tour, but however his injuries healed {{in time for the}} US tour which started late February 2007.|$|E
