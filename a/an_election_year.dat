5|$|With the 1950 mid-term {{elections}} drawing near, and Truman abstaining from overt campaigning {{while the}} troops were fighting in Korea, members of Truman's staff, most notably George Elsey, came up with another way to garner votes for the Democratic Party. In July 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt had traveled to Hawaii to meet with MacArthur and Admiral Chester Nimitz. At this meeting, Roosevelt {{made the decision to}} attack the Philippines in the final year of the Pacific war. It was a political triumph in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>year,</b> refuting Republican claims that Roosevelt fixated on Europe {{at the expense of the}} Pacific.|$|E
5|$|With {{the state}} still {{recovering}} from an economic recession and <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>year</b> upcoming, legislators refused to raise taxes. Collins eventually withdrew her request and submitted a continuation budget instead. Some education proposals advocated by Collins were passed, including mandatory kindergarten, remedial programs for elementary school children, mandatory testing and internship for teachers, and the implementation of academic receivership for underperforming schools. Among the other accomplishments of the 1984 legislative session were passage of a tougher drunk driving law, and a measure allowing state banking companies to purchase other banks within the state.|$|E
5|$|Limited to {{two terms}} as governor, Hatfield {{announced}} his candidacy in the 1966 U.S. Senate election {{for the seat}} vacated by the retiring Maurine Neuberger. During the Vietnam War, and during <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>year,</b> {{he was the only}} person to vote against a resolution by a governors' conference that expressed support for the U.S. involvement in the war in 1966. At that time the war was supported by 75percent of the public, and was also supported by Hatfield's opponent in the November election. He won the primary election with 178,782 votes compared to a combined 56,760votes for three opponents. Hatfield then defeated Democratic Congressman Robert Duncan in the election. In order to finish his term as governor, which ended on January 9, 1967, he delayed taking his oath of office in the Senate until January 10 instead of the usual January 3.|$|E

5|$|Little {{thought was}} given to the Chinese {{reaction}} to the Open Door note; the Chinese minister in Washington, Wu Ting-fang, did not learn of it until he read of it in the newspapers. Among those in China who opposed Western influence there was a movement in Shantung Province, in the north, that became known as the Fists of Righteous Harmony, or Boxers, after the martial arts they practiced. The Boxers were especially angered by missionaries and their converts. As late as June 1900, Rockhill dismissed the Boxers, contending that they would soon disband. By the middle of that month, the Boxers, joined by imperial troops, had cut the railroad between Peking and the coast, killed many missionaries and converts, and besieged the foreign legations. Hay faced a precarious situation; how to rescue the Americans trapped in Peking, and how to avoid giving the other powers an excuse to partition China, in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>year</b> when there was already Democrat opposition to what they deemed American imperialism.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>year</b> if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E

25|$|In between {{legislative}} sessions, Stevenson {{increased his}} prominence in Bloomington. He rose to become grandmaster of his Masonic chapter and founded the Bloomington Daily Bulletin in 1881, a Democratic newspaper {{that sought to}} challenge the Republican Pantagraph. Stevenson directed the People's Bank and co-managed the McLean County Coal Company with his brothers. The company founded Stevensonville, a company town near the mine shafts. Employees were purportedly fired {{if they did not}} support Stevenson in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{two other}} {{stabilization}} plans amounted to renewed attempts at bringing inflation down from very high levels. It was soon clear {{that without a}} thorough reform of the public sector, controlling inflation would be impossible. Both plans introduced a price freeze and eliminated indexation, but there were differences between them, and with the Cruzado Plan. Neither was able to address the public-sector disequilibrium effectively. The objective of the Summer Plan, for instance, was mainly to avoid hyperinflation in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

25|$|In March 2010, when Charles Rangel {{was forced}} to resign as Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means over ethics charges, Van Hollen {{played a key role in}} having Sander Levin succeed to the Chairmanship over Pete Stark.

However, Van Hollen and other younger members saw Stark's past intemperate comments as a liability to the Democrats in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{the largest}} {{newspaper}} in Rhode Island, and the state's leading {{voice for the}} new Republican Party (then only six years old), the editorship of the Journal put Angell in a powerful public position for the first time. His first foray into electoral politics came early on, as 1860 was <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>year.</b> He lent the paper's backing to the gubernatorial candidacy of abolitionist Republican nominee Seth Padelford, which failed when a coalition of various interests instead led to the election of fellow Republican William Sprague. In the presidential contest, Angell felt that Rhode Island's interests would be best served by the nomination of staunch abolitionist William H. Seward as the Republican candidate. But when the somewhat more moderate (and virtual unknown in Rhode Island) Abraham Lincoln was unexpectedly nominated, he put {{the power of the}} Journal behind Lincoln's candidacy, requesting favorable letters from his old pupil John Hay, who was working in Lincoln's law offices at the time, in order to generate enthusiasm for Lincoln. In the end, Lincoln won Rhode Island by a margin of 61.4% to 38.6%.|$|E

25|$|A {{second major}} {{educational}} issue which arose during Chavous' third term was {{another round of}} reform aimed at the D.C. Board of Education. On September 24, 2003, Mayor Williams announced that the city's public school system was so dysfunctional and provided such low-quality education that he was introducing legislation to strip the Board of nearly all its power. Control over the school system would {{be given to the}} mayor, who would have the right to hire and fire the superintendent, principals, teachers, and other workers and who would gain significant new powers to reconstitute programs, operations, curriculum, and schools. Although Chavous was working on his own bill to give the Council and mayor more power over the school system, he immediately threw his support behind Williams' plan. But little action on the mayor's plan had been taken by January 2004. Chavous argued that Williams had not been forceful enough in making the case for his proposal, and journalist Craig Timberg linked Chavous' lack of activity on the measure to a reluctance to take on a controversial issue in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>year.</b> (Chavous' own bill was also delayed, and he said it would not be ready until at least March 2004.) Williams said he might seek a third term as mayor merely to fight for his school reform bill, if the council did not act more expeditiously. In February 2004, Chavous announced he no longer supported the mayor's bill. The school district was without a superintendent, and Chavous argued that no individual would want the job if the council was considering such a significant change to the position. He also said that giving the mayor hiring and firing authority over the superintendent would require congressional approval or a voter referendum, and both processes would take too long. Chavous then introduced a bill which largely undid the 2000 reforms. The new bill provided for a nine-member board, with eight elected members (one from each ward) and a president elected citywide. Chavous' committee approved the bill in April 2004 without a hearing. Although Mayor Williams submitted an altered form of his original proposal two weeks after the defeat, it was rejected in mid-May and the Chavous bill approved by the council in July on a close 7-to-6 vote.|$|E
500|$|Despite Fillmore's zeal {{in the war}} effort, he was {{attacked}} in many newspapers when he gave a speech in early 1864 calling for magnanimity towards the South at war's end, and counting the heavy cost, financial and in blood, of the war. [...] The Lincoln administration saw this as an attack on it, {{that could not be}} tolerated in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>year,</b> and Fillmore was called a Copperhead and even a traitor. This led to lasting ill-feeling against Fillmore in many circles. In the 1864 presidential election Fillmore supported Democratic candidate George B. McClellan for the presidency, believing that the Democratic Party's plan for immediate cessation of fighting and allowing the seceded states to return with slavery intact was the best possibility for restoring the Union.|$|E
500|$|The tax cut {{extension}} for {{the remainder}} of the year was passed as the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 on February 17, 2012, by a vote of 293â€“132 in the House and 60â€“36 in the Senate. [...] The bill also contained a further extension of unemployment benefits and the Medicare reimbursement rates. [...] The cost of the tax cut was not offset by spending cuts, but the other provisions were offset by cuts in federal healthcare and pension programs.
