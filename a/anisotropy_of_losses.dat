Methods: Controls (12) and patients with BD (12) were included. MR [GE Signa Horizon- 1. 5 T] scans were performed. BD patients presented Fazekas's score= 6 and leukoaraiosis extension ³ 75 %, as assessed on FLAIR sequence. Standard parameters for DTI-FA acquisition were used. Functool was employed for post-processing, and ROIs placed on the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum on one axial plane at the basal ganglia level. Statistics [ANOVA] for genu and splenium comparison were analyzed. Results: DTI-FA showed reduction <b>of</b> <b>anisotropy</b> in both regions of the corpus callosum, more prominently in anterior (genu) than posterior (splenium) in BD patients versus controls. Conclusion: The reduction <b>of</b> <b>anisotropy</b> reflects <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> integrity of fibers of the studied regions of the corpus callosum. This finding indicates an interruption of the most important inter-hemispheric commissure, and component of neural networks that underlies cognitive, behavioral, motor and sensory integration.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} {{artificial}} materials demonstrate that substantial improvements in electromagnetic response can be attained by combining different materials subject to desired metrics. However, the perfect material combination {{is unique and}} extremely difficult to determine without automated synthesis schemes. In this paper, we develop a versatile approach to design the microstructure of periodic materials with prescribed dielectric and magnetic material tensors. The proposed framework {{is based on a}} robust material model and generalized inverse synthesis tool relying on topology optimization. The former is derived using homogenization theory and asymptotic expansion applied to Maxwell equations and can characterize the effects <b>of</b> <b>anisotropy</b> and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> materials with periodic unit cells of arbitrary geometries and multi-phases much smaller than the wavelength. Resulting Partial Differential Equation (PDE) is solved numerically using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and is validated with results in literature. The material model proves to be fast and numerically stable even with complex inclusions. The topology optimization problem is applied for the first time towards designing the unit cell topology of periodic electromagnetic materials from scratch with desired dielectric and magnetic tensors using off-the-shelf materials, i. e., readily available constituents obtained from isotropic ceramic powders. The proposed framework's capability is demonstrated with five design examples. Design with anisotropic permittivity is also fabricated. Results show that the framework is capable of designing, in an automated fashion, non-intuitive material compositions from scratch with desired electromagnetic properties...|$|R

Although these developmental processes have been investigated in detail with histology, three-dimensional and quantitative imaging methods for rodent brains may be useful for genetic and pharmacological studies in which cortical developmental abnormalities are suspected.

One of them {{is based on the}} {{equation of state}} for hard spherocylinders in random porous media obtained from the scaled particle theory.

The obtained equation is used for the investigation of the gas-liquid-nematic phase behavior of a molecular system depending on the <b>anisotropy</b> <b>of</b> molecule shapes, <b>anisotropy</b> <b>of</b> attractive intermolecular interactions, and porosity of a porous medium. It is shown that the anisotropic phase is formed by the <b>anisotropy</b> <b>of</b> attractive intermolecular interactions and by the <b>anisotropy</b> <b>of</b> molecular shapes.
