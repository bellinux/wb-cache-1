The real reason I didn't {{want to make}} the picture is because, at long last, John Ford is getting ready to produce The Last Hurrah, the life of James Michael Curley, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> so long to get John and to do this story, which I want to do more than {{anything}} else. So, I couldn't run the risk of starting one picture and losing John Ford." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brian and Patrick {{continued}} to combat homophobia in the NHL after Brendan's death; Patrick, along with Brian Kitts and Glenn Witman, founded You Can Play {{as a tribute}} to his brother. The name You Can Play originates from a piece Patrick Burke wrote for outsports.com. In the piece, Patrick talks about the overwhelmingly positive experience surrounding Brendan's coming out: [...] "I waited to get a negative email, or to read a damning article, or to hear a snide comment at a game. I waited, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited,</b> and I waitedâ€¦and I got what I should have expected the entire time: love, support, and admiration." [...] He talks of letters and emails that poured in to his family, and he also talks of fellow scouts and hockey personnel pulling him aside and giving their support. He summarizes his feelings in the revelation that across the hockey world, what matters is whether or not you can play. [...] "If you can play, we welcome you." [...] The quote was adapted to the catchier [...] "If you can play, you can play" [...] by the campaign.|$|E

60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> to {{hear how}} Polyphemus is to look--and also Adonis.|$|R
60|$|Blow! blow! blow! Blow up, sea-winds, along Paumanok's shore! <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait,</b> {{till you}} blow my mate to me.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> for you, <b>and</b> you didn't come. <b>And</b> at last <b>I</b> couldn't <b>wait</b> any longer.|$|R
60|$|I {{left them}} alone! There {{was nothing else}} which I could do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> in the hall below for Lady Dennisford.|$|E
60|$|He did not answer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> {{for some}} {{time for him to}} speak. At last I had to break the silence myself.|$|E
60|$|The {{stress of}} this meeting was still over him, as I could see and hear, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> {{for him to go}} on.|$|E
60|$|In that {{enforced}} stillness <b>and</b> silence <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> expectant {{for some}} moments.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I am a king-vulture, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> for {{the sick}} bull to die," [...] he answered, {{pointing}} to the Great Place beneath him. [...] "Say, why should I bring Hafela to prey upon a carcase I have marked down for my own?" ...|$|R
60|$|He stopped <b>and</b> shuddered. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> {{in silence}} till he had {{controlled}} himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "So neat, so orderly {{he always}} was," [...] murmured old Gadley again, {{smoothing}} the page affectionately with his hand, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> for his dictation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay, gone, {{and there}} stood Bougwan {{staring at the}} wall like one asleep, and {{presently}} he went too, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> a while and came away also.' ...|$|E
60|$|Wallace puffed huge {{clouds of}} white smoke, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited,</b> knowing that I was to hear {{at last the}} story of the Colonel's great {{adventure}} in the Northland.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} said you knowed the rules," [...] {{returned}} Silver contemptuously. [...] "Leastways, if you don't, <b>I</b> do; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> here--and I'm still your cap'n, mind--till you outs with your grievances <b>and</b> <b>I</b> reply; in the meantime, your black spot ain't worth a biscuit. After that, we'll see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I think not. I {{seem to be}} {{just making}} it, <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>I</b> might lose my grip." [...] He offered Bushwick a {{friendly}} hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "The supper can <b>wait</b> awhile, Bessie, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>wait.</b> <b>I</b> am {{starting}} for Paarde Kraal to-morrow at day-break, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> want to {{say good-bye}} to you first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] I {{replied with}} resignation. It was no task to discard that hollow mask of humor. A silence ensued, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> {{for it to}} be broken.|$|E
60|$|He {{considered}} again. I {{saw that}} I {{had succeeded in}} interesting him in some way unknown to myself; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> patiently until {{he was prepared to}} answer me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard by}} {{accident}} {{of the house}} {{he had taken the}} house where he means to live. I went there <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited.</b> Later, Richard Graveling came there, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{asks for}} her valise {{to be sent}} to her town address," [...] Mrs Fyne uttered reluctantly <b>and</b> stopped. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> a bit--then exploded.|$|R
6000|$|I {{boarded the}} cars the more contentedly {{that there was}} a note in my pocket from Lucille Haldane. [...] "Father tells me the time is ripe for you and your friends to strike at last," [...] it ran. [...] "I want to ask you to assist him in every way you can; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> anxiously to hear of your success." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{stopped him}} with a startled look in her great eyes. [...] "Don't talk about him-it ain't right. I mean it don't do any good. What could I do, after Father died? Mother <b>and</b> <b>I.</b> Besides, <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> three years to hear from you, Will." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was gone}} for some minutes. Charles <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> outside in breathless expectation. Then Medhurst sneezed. We flung the door open at once, and burst in upon the creature.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were going}} to be married and I had {{actually}} gone to the church. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> and waited and he didn't come; {{and what do you think}} had happened?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{smiled as}} she replied. 'I saw you pass my house a little while ago; I guessed {{you were going to}} Matteo d'Orsi, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> for you on your return.' ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> {{crouched}} down, <b>and,</b> while <b>I</b> <b>waited,</b> {{watched the}} puffs of dust {{raised by the}} bullets. We began the return side by side and running.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, first I {{transformed}} the octopus into a jellyfish, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> for the tide to turn. When my tail was untied, the pain stopped." ...|$|R

6000|$|I waited {{till the}} noise of his {{footsteps}} had died out of the dining-room, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> a little longer. Then turning towards the distant door I raised my voice along the verandah: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{immediately}} after I {{got it from}} you; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> {{to see if there}} was an answer, but she said there wasn't. It must have contained bad news, I fear, for she turned pale while she read it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{invited me}} once, last week," [...] Bruno said, very gravely. [...] "It was to wash up the soup-plates--no, the cheese-plates I mean that was grand enough. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> at table. And I didn't hardly make only one mistake." ...|$|E
