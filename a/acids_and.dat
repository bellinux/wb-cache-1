40|$|A {{method for}} the {{identification}} and determination of tannic <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> its phenolic metabolites in biological fluids by high-performance liquid chromatography was developed. Tannic <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> four phenolic compounds, namely gallic acid, pyrogallol, 4 -O-methylgallic <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> ellagic <b>acid,</b> were successfully extracted from the biological fluids by using ethyl acetate at acidic conditions.

Tannic acid was found in the plasma apart from the abomasal fluid into which it was administered. The concentrations of tannic acid, gallic acid, pyrogallol, 4 -O-methylgallic <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> ellagic <b>acid</b> in plasma, abomasal fluid and urine were measured. This method could be applied to measurement of other hydrolysable tannins and their phenolic metabolites in bioligical materials...|$|R
40|$|Uric <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> {{allantoin}} {{are the key}} compounds of purine nucleotide catabolism {{formed in}} liver and many other organs of the rat. We observed that, after administration of 14 C-formate, incorporation of radioactivity into uric <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> allantoin is not similar, as one would expect. The phenomenon was demonstrated to be specific to liver and perfused liver, and not to other organs such as heart, jejunal mucosa, lung, spleen, and kidney. To interpret these results, the specific radioactivity of uric <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> allantoin in rat liver were analysed comparatively, after administration of the following labelled precursors: 14 C-glycine, 14 C-formate, 14 C-hypoxanthine, 14 C-uric <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> 14 C-adenine. After administration of 14 C-formate the specific radioactivity of allantoin was {{higher than that of}} uric <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> the same behavior was observed after 14 C-uric <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> 14 C-hypoxanthine, but not after 14 C-glycine and 14 C-adenine administration. The results indicate that the rate of their incorporation into uric <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> allantoin, and the subsequent export of these compounds into serum, can only partially explain the observed phenomenon, while the presence of different pools of uric <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> allantoin may give a complete explanation...|$|R

The present study sought to characterize the protein glycation inhibitory activity of cinnamic <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> its derivatives in a bovine serum albumin (BSA) /fructose system. The results demonstrated that cinnamic <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> its derivatives significantly inhibited the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) by approximately 11. 96 – 63. 36 % at a concentration of 1 mM. The strongest inhibitory activity against the formation of AGEs was shown by cinnamic acid. Furthermore, cinnamic <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> its derivatives reduced the level of fructosamine, the formation of Nɛ-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), and the level of amyloid cross β-structure. Cinnamic <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> its derivatives also prevented oxidative protein damages, including effects on protein carbonyl formation and thiol oxidation of BSA.

5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating {{the central role}} of ammonia, ammonia levels do not always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means that more ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low.

The importance of acetic acid to attraction of V. germanica and V. pensylvanica to these lures supports the hypothesis that this response is food-finding behavior.
