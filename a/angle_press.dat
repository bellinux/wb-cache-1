40|$|For {{planning}} forming processes it {{is important}} to know how the process parameters influence the properties of the material. Local properties like stiffness and strength are predictable with good accuracy. The main aim of the present work is to include also evolution of grain size in simulation processes. Therefore equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) was analyzed regarding to grain size during severe plastic deformation of a conventional Al-Mg-Si alloy (AW 6082 T 651). The basic principle of the ECAP process is characterized by pressing a square-profiled sample rod through an <b>angled</b> <b>press</b> channel. Thereby a strong shear deformation is acting in the sample which leads to a grain refinement in the material. By varying the angle of the channel and the number of pressing operations different true strains can be generated in the material. In this work angles of 90 ° and 120 ° were used and the samples were pressed repeatedly up to 4 steps. Characterization of the microstructure was done by electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis. The results show a clear dependence of the grain size on true strain which is directly affected by the channel angle and number of passes. It could be observed that every deformation step leads to grain refinement. After 4 passes a minimal grain size of 700 nm was found, which is 5 % of initial grain size. The knowledge about the relationship between grain size and stress-strain state allows the development of models for a grain size prediction. To characterize the mechanical properties of the aluminium after every deformation step compression tests were applied. The resulting flow curves of every step were accumulated. This method allows to display deformation degrees up to 4, 4. The work was done in the context of the SFB 692 HALS "High-strength aluminium-based lightweight materials for safety components"...|$|R

40|$|It is {{advantageous}} to use small scale {{testing in the}} design phase of tires due to the costs and uncontrollable environmental conditions of outdoor testing. Therefore a laboratory abrasion and skid tester is used to obtain more insight in the contact of a tread compound with the road for dry conditions. In the experimental setup a small solid tire, with adjustable slip <b>angle,</b> is <b>pressed</b> on an abrasive corundum disk. The present friction between the abrasive disk and solid tire drives the tire and the resulting forces are measured with a triaxial force sensor. Several experiments under different normal loads, slip angles and velocities of the disk are conducted. To explain observed phenomena of lateral force measurements for a free rolling tire under a number of slip angles a FE model is used. The relevant parts of the setup are modeled in Abaqus and the steady state performance of the small tire under different slip angles is evaluated. It is shown that the present turnslip, which has great impact on the slip velocity field at {{the trailing edge of}} the contact area, is captured well with the model.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and distribution of}} residual stresses in structural carbon steel sections have been thoroughly investigated. However, few residual stress measurements have been made on structural stainless steel sections. Stainless steel has differing material stress-strain characteristics and thermal properties to carbon steel, both of which influence the formation of residual stresses. This suggests that established carbon steel residual stress models may not be appropriate for stainless steel. With increased use of stainless steel in load bearing applications, {{it is important to}} establish the residual stresses that exist within structural members. An experimental program to quantify the residual stresses in stainless steel sections from three different production routes has therefore been carried out. Comprehensive residual stress distributions have been obtained for three hot rolled <b>angles,</b> eight <b>press</b> braked <b>angles</b> and seven cold rolled box sections, with a total of over 800 readings taken. This paper presents the experimental techniques implemented and the residual stress distributions obtained as well as discussing the assumptions commonly made regarding through thickness residual stress variations. In the hot rolled and press braked sections, residual stresses were typically below 20 % of the material 0. 2 % proof stress, though for the cold rolled box sections, whilst membrane residual stresses were relatively low, bending residual stresses were measured to be between 40 % and 70 % of the material 0. 2 % proof stress...|$|R

Comparisons were made using a two factor Analysis of Variance ANOVA with repeated measures on one factor. When significance was found a Scheffe' post hoc test was performed. Statistical analysis revealed significant (p <. 05) differences for AS as measured by 1 RM tests for PS and LP training. Significance (p <. 05) occurred for RP as measured by MK test for PS training.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of stainless ultra-high strength steels with ferritic-martensitic and martensitic microstructure into sheet metal manufacturing depends on proper welding processes for these steel grades. The chromium and carbon content {{as well as}} the lack of appropriate process information for thermal joining of these steel grades in press hardened condition with UTS of up to 2. 000 MPa at 15 % fracture strain classifies the weldability of these materials as limited. Efficient heat control and minimum heat input enable the welding of ferritic-martensitic and martensitic stainless steels by laser beam. This paper presents the results of strength evaluations of laser welded joints for the steel grades 1. 4003, 1. 4021, and 1. 4034 in similar and dissimilar combinations with already established steels.

40|$|Context. Reflected {{light from}} a {{spatially}} unresolved planet yields unique insight into the overall optical properties of the planet cover. Glories are optical phenomena caused by light that is backscattered within spherical droplets following a narrow distribution of sizes; they are well known on Earth as localised features above liquid clouds. Aims. Here we report the first evidence for a glory in the disk-integrated photometry of Venus and, in turn, of any planet. Methods. We used previously published phase curves of the planet that were reproduced over {{the full range of}} phase angles with model predictions based on a realistic description of the Venus atmosphere. We assumed that the optical properties of the planet as a whole can be described by a uniform and stable cloud cover, an assumption that agrees well with observational evidence. Results. We specifically show that the measured phase curves mimic the scattering properties of the Venus upper-cloud micron-sized aerosols, also at the small phase angles at which the glory occurs, and that the glory contrast is consistent with what is expected after multiple scattering of photons. In the optical, the planet appears to be brighter at phase angles of 11 - 13 deg than at full illumination; it undergoes a maximum dimming of up to 10 percent at phases in between. Conclusions. Glories might potentially indicate spherical droplets and, thus, extant liquid clouds in the atmospheres of exoplanets. A prospective detection will require exquisite photometry at the small planet-star separations of the glory phase <b>angles.</b> Comment: In <b>press.</b> Astronomy & Astrophysics.

40|$|An acute bout of {{resistance}} exercise (RE) can up-regulate processes that stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS). Additionally, nutritional strategies involving carbohydrate (CHO) and whey protein (WP) supplementation can augment MPS. However, resistance training (RT) induced muscle anabolism {{during the early}} phases of training can attenuate over time. The use of a short-term cessation of training (detraining; DT) can potentially restore the attenuated muscular anabolic adaptive responses. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to explore the effects of a successive cycle of detraining and retraining (ReT) in humans on body composition and muscle performance. Resistance-trained males (age 20. 95 ± 1. 23 y; n= 20) were recruited and randomized into one of two groups (WP or CHO; 25 grams) in a double-blind fashion. Both groups followed a standardized 4 days per week resistance-training program for 4 weeks, carried out 2 weeks of DT and continued the resistance-training program for another 4 weeks of ReT. Participants were instructed to consume their respective supplement only on workout days during RT, but every day during DT. Research visits were conducted at baseline, 4 weeks (post-RT), 6 weeks (post- 2 -week-DT), and after 10 weeks (post-ReT). Each visit consisted of body composition assessments and muscular strength and endurance testing using the bench <b>press</b> and <b>angled</b> leg <b>press</b> exercises. Four-day diet records, workout logs, and supplement compliance forms were utilized. Factorial 2 x 4 (group by time) ANOVAs with repeated measures were conducted using SPSS (version 20. 0) with a probability level of ≤. 05. There were no significant group by time interactions for lean or fat mass changes throughout the study (p 3 ̆e. 05). However, both groups were able to retain lean mass following 2 weeks of DT. The WP group appeared to have an elevation in lean mass (+ 1. 58 kg on average) by the end of ReT in comparison to baseline, even though it was not statistically significant (p 3 ̆e. 05). Leg press strength (LPS) increased throughout the study (p=. 003), and neither group showed a decrease in LPS following DT. There were no group-by-time interactions or group differences between WP and CHO for bench press strength (BPS), bench press endurance (BPE), leg press endurance (LPE), or any dietary variables (p 3 ̆e. 05). Interestingly, the WP group presented a non-significant overall increase in lean mass compared to the CHO group by the end of 10 weeks. LPS and BPS were also elevated and retained respectfully following DT. In summary, a short-term 2 week cycle of DT in resistance trained males maintained both muscle mass and muscular strength, which potentially reinforces the importance of recovery...|$|R
