Its external funding liquidity level grew from 190% in 2010 to 266% in 2011. It has a 2.6:1 debt-to-equity ratio and holds 6.6% in reserves against losses on loans to its disbursement portfolio.

25|$|Historically, the US {{public debt}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) has increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined. The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease {{as a result of}} a government surplus or due to growth of GDP and inflation. For example, debt held by the public <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> GDP peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 35 years. In recent decades, aging demographics and rising healthcare costs have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.|$|E

25|$|Several {{measures}} {{serve as}} indicators of the long-term financial status of Medicare. These include total Medicare spending <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> gross domestic product (GDP), the solvency of the Medicare HI trust fund, Medicare per-capita spending growth relative to inflation and per-capita GDP growth; general fund revenue <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> total Medicare spending; and actuarial estimates of unfunded liability over the 75-year timeframe and the infinite horizon (netting expected premium/tax revenue against expected costs). The major issue in all these indicators is comparing any future projections against current law vs. what the actuaries expect to happen. For example, current law specifies that Part A payments to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities will be cut substantially after 2028 and that doctors will get no raises after 2025. The actuaries expect that the law will change to keep these events from happening.|$|E
