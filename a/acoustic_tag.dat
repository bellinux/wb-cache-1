50|$|A typical <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Tag</b> {{consists}} of a piezoceramic transducer, drive/timing electronics, and a battery power source. Cylindrical or “tube” transducers are often used, which have metalization on {{the inner and outer}} walls of the structure. In normal operation, an alternating current (AC) electrical signal generated by the drive/timing electronics is impressed across the two metalization layers. This voltage creates stress in the material, which in turn cause the transducer to emit an acoustic signal or “ping”, which emanates outward {{from the surface of the}} tube. An acoustic “ping” can be detected by specialized receivers, and processed using advanced signal processing techniques to determine if a fish swimming into the reception area carries a specific <b>acoustic</b> <b>tag.</b>|$|E
50|$|At present, {{acoustic}} tags {{are most}} commonly used to monitor fish approaching diversion and guidance structures at hydropower dams. This allows hydropowered dam facilities, public utility districts, and municipalities to evaluate specific migration pathways used by the fish (most often salmon smolts), identify where fish mortality occurs and assess fish behavior in relation to hydrodynamic conditions and/or any other environmental parameters. Ultimately, working to improve bypass effectiveness and protect fish populations, <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Tag</b> Tracking Systems are a significant breakthrough in the preservation of migrating salmon populations. For an example of <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Tag</b> Tracking Systems {{at work on the}} Columbia River, see Grant County's most recent application or Chelan County's most recent application.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>tags</b> can be {{attached}} to, gastrically inserted in or surgically implanted into fish (or almost any aquatic life).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>Tags</b> {{transmit}} {{a signal}} {{made up of}} acoustic pulses or [...] "pings" [...] that sends location information about the tagged fish to the hydrophone receiver. By tying the received acoustic signature to the known type of programmed signal code, a specific fish is identified. The transmitted signal can propagate up to 1 km (in freshwater). Each [...] "ping" [...] comes at a predetermined interval. The signals are encoded for strength to improve range and resolution. Thus, an array of receivers allows the user to record the movement of a particular fish over many kilometers. Unique to <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Tags</b> is the capability to have over 100,000 user-specified individual tag ID codes with battery lives up to four years. These variables allows a custom fit for unique projects.|$|R
50|$|Acoustic tags come in an {{assortment}} of sizes and weights. To-date, the smallest <b>acoustic</b> <b>tag</b> successfully employed to provide fish behavior data in three dimensions was approximately 0.65 grams (tracking a juvenile salmonid at a length of 125 mm). Tag size increases significantly when tracking larger fish {{for longer periods of}} time (i.e. sturgeon).|$|E
50|$|Several {{different}} types of methods are used to attach the tag to the fish. The tag may be embedded in the fish by cutting a small incision in the abdominal cavity of the fish (surgical implantation), or put down the gullet to embed the <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Tag</b> in the stomach (gastric implantation). External attachment using adhesive compounds is typically not used for fish as scale fluids do not allow for any successful attachment to scale tissue.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic tags {{are small}} {{sound-emitting}} devices {{that allow the}} detection and/or remote tracking of fish in three dimensions for fisheries research. Acoustic telemetry (including acoustic tags) are commonly used to monitor the behavior of fish. Studies can be conducted in lakes, rivers, tributaries, estuaries or at sea. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>tag</b> tracking technology allows researchers to view 3D fish tracks in real-time with sub-meter resolution. Acoustic tags have been employed to help public utility agencies, private firms, and {{state and federal agencies}} meet fisheries regulations as defined by the Federal Regulations and Oversight of Energy known as FERC.|$|E
40|$|Many marine animals use sound passively or {{actively}} for communication, foraging, predator avoidance, navigation, and {{to sense}} their environment. The advent of <b>acoustic</b> recording <b>tags</b> has allowed biologists {{to get the}} on-animal perspective of the sonic environment and, in combination with movement sensors, to relate sounds to {{the activities of the}} tagged animal. These powerful tools have led {{to a wide range of}} insights into the behaviour of marine animals and have opened new opportunities for studying the ways they interact with their environment. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>tags</b> demand new analysis methods and careful experimental design to optimize the consistency between research objectives and the realistic performance of the tags. Technical details to consider are the suitability of the tag attachment to a given species, the accuracy of the tag sensors, and the recording and attachment duration of the tag. Here we consider the achievements, potential, and limitations of <b>acoustic</b> recording <b>tags</b> in studying the behaviour, habitat use and sensory ecology of marine mammals, the taxon to which this technology has been most often applied. We examine the application of <b>acoustic</b> <b>tags</b> to studies of vocal behaviour, foraging ecology, acoustic tracking, and the effects of noise to assess both the breadth of applications and the specific issues that arise in each. © Inter-Research 2009.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Fisheries, 2011 A {{total of}} sixty-nine wild {{juvenile}} steelhead were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters and tracked within the estuary and main stem of the Russian River, California, {{for up to}} 141 days from mid-July to early December, 2005 and 2006. Each implanted transmitter emitted a unique code that allowed identification of individual steelhead. Estuarine use, movement behavior, and extended estuarine residency were documented using an array of fixed telemetry receiver stations and frequent mobile tracking surveys. Continuous water quality monitoring was conducted throughout the estuary and manual water quality measurements were taken at site specific locations of detected <b>acoustic</b> <b>tagged</b> steelhead during mobile tracking surveys. Manual water quality measurements {{were used to determine}} the association of physical parameters (i. e., water quality and depth) with estuarine use. Minimum estuary residence time was derived from the duration of detection and ranged from 4 to 121 days with significant growth occurring with longer residency. Accelerated growth rates in the estuary were observed in scale patterns from untagged and tagged wild steelhead and confirmed by observed growth and scale patterns of three <b>acoustic</b> <b>tagged</b> steelhead that were recaptured after more than 100 days at-large. Estuarine use, movement behavior, extended estuarine residency, and scale patterns of these recaptured steelhead were similar to those of other tagged and untagged steelhead utilizing the same areas of the Russian River estuary. Fall upstream movements of <b>acoustic</b> <b>tagged</b> wild steelhead and captures of untagged estuary steelhead observed aggregating with <b>acoustic</b> <b>tagged</b> steelhead provided evidence that long estuarine residency coupled with accelerated growth resulted in life history traits similar to those of more northern populations in which the half-pounder life history is present. Observed, extended estuarine residency, accelerated growth, and occurrence of half-pounder-like steelhead indicate a very productive rearing environment within the Russian River estuary.

40|$|Sound-recording {{acoustic}} {{tags attached}} to marine animals {{are commonly used}} in behavioural studies. Measuring ambient noise is of interest to efforts to understand responses of marine mammals to anthropogenic underwater sound, or to assess their communication space. Noise of water flowing around the tag reflects {{the speed of the}} animal, but hinders ambient noise measurement. Here, we describe a correlation-based method for stereo acoustic tags to separate the relative contributions of flow and ambient noise. The uncorrelated part of the noise measured in digital acoustic recording tag (DTAG) recordings related well to swim speed of a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), thus providing a robust measure of flow noise over a wide frequency bandwidth. By removing measurements affected by flow noise, consistent ambient noise estimates were made for two killer whales (Orcinus orca) with DTAGs attached simultaneously.

40|$|Abstract—A pulsed RADAR {{approach}} is investigated to probe acoustic delay lines used as passive sensors. In order {{to comply with}} the requirements of compact, low power receiver electronics, a stroboscopic equivalent time sampling {{approach is}} demonstrated. A strategy for generating high resolution time delays while allowing for long interrogation durations (up to 5 µs) is implemented by combining an FPGA-based delay generator with commercially available programmable digital delay lines. The measurement sequence of generating interleaved combs is due to the long delay line reconfiguration duration (SPI communication) with respect to the coarse comb (FPGA based counter). The response of the sensor is recorded and processed to acquire the coarse acoustic velocity information through magnitude measurement, and an accurate physical quantity estimate is computed thanks to the phase information. We demonstrate an improved software measure-ment strategy which prevents the slow process associated with a stroboscopic approach and allows to reach refresh rates of up to 20 kHz when probing an <b>acoustic</b> <b>tag</b> for a physical property measurement, while keeping the hardware to a bare minimum.

40|$|Carcharhinus plumbeus (sandbar shark) and C. obscurus (dusky shark) {{occur in}} many global {{fisheries}} as targeted species and/or by catch. However, {{little is known}} about their movement and the possible fate of discards. We redressed this lack of knowledge using pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT) and acoustic tagging technologies off the eastern coast of Australia. Eight sharks of each species were caught by demersal longline, fitted with both types of tag and then released. PSATs indicated that 2 C. plumbeus and 1 C. obscurus died within 8 h of release, while tracks over periods of 1 to 60 d were obtained for 13 sharks. All surviving sharks first swam in an easterly, offshore direction to outer-shelf waters during the first 24 h. All C. plumbeus then moved approximately south (i. e. increasing latitude) by distances of up to 350 km. In contrast, most C. obscurus moved approximately north by distances between 212 and 606 km. Over an 18 mo period following release, <b>acoustic</b> <b>tag</b> detections occurred for 4 C. plumbeus (mostly within 30 km of release, suggesting some philopatry) and 6 C. obscurus (515 km south and 310 km north).

Our data revealed a home reef area (residency rate of 44. 9 %) with an increased activity revealed by movements at dawn and dusk toward and between two adjacent reef passages, probably for foraging. The fish was absent from its resident reef between October and December 2010 and 2012, corresponding to the time known for spawning aggregations of this species in New Caledonia. A skipped spawning seems to have occurred in 2011. We hope these data will be complemented in the future by locating the spawning site or sites and thus provide adequate conservation measures. The Coral Sea links two World Heritage Sites, the Australian Great Barrier Reefs and the New Caledonian coral reefs.

40|$|The use of stereotyped calls within {{structured}} bouts {{has been}} described {{for a number of}} species and may increase the information potential of call repertoires.

In this study, digital <b>acoustic</b> <b>tag</b> recordings were used to investigate social call use within bouts, the use of bouts across different social contexts, and whether particular call type combinations were favored. Call order within bouts was investigated using call transition frequencies and information theory techniques. Call bouts were defined through analysis of inter-call intervals, as any calls within 3. 9 [*]s of each other. Bouts were produced significantly more when new whales joined a group compared to groups that did not change membership, and in groups containing multiple adults escorting a female and calf compared to adult only groups. Although social calls tended to be produced in bouts, there were few repeated bout types. However, the order in which most call types were produced within bouts was non-random and dependent on the preceding call type. These bouts appear to be at least partially governed by rules for how individual components are combined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{behavioral}} {{physiology of}} bigeye tuna was investigated using acoustic tags in the 1990 s. They {{spend most of}} the daylight hours below the thermocline but make regular brief excursions into the mixed layer. In doing so, they reduce the efficacy of their vascular countercurrent heat exchangers while gaining heat from the warmer environment and then increase it again when they return below the thermocline. Recently, archival tags have been used on a range of tuna species including bluefin. This tag, recovered when the tuna is har-vested, yields time-series data over longer periods than acoustic tags. Although immature Pacific bluefin {{spend most of the}}ir time at the surface, they often dive below the thermocline, maintaining a peritoneal temperature. This might be due either to heat conservation or high heat production. Further, while giant Atlantic bluefin show an ability to maintain their tem-perature above the ambient, there are occasions in cold water when some physiological process is clearly limiting their dive time. Solution of the growth conundrum that their warm body temperature may pose an ecological problem as they grow in body mass, should be clar-ified by using tag data. This will lead to investigation of their adaptation mechanisms to their habitats. key words: archival tag, tuna, thermo-physiology, <b>acoustic</b> <b>tag,</b> adaptation mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a system of}} multiple coordi-nating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) that can localize and track a shark tagged with an acoustic transmitter. Each AUV {{is equipped with a}} stereo-hydrophone system that provides measurements of the relative bearing to the transmitter, as well as an acoustic modem that allows for inter-AUV communication and hence cooperative shark state estimation and decentralized tracking control. Online state estimation of the shark’s state is performed using a Particle Filter in which measurements are shared between AUVs. The decentralized control system enables the AUVs to circumnavigate a dynamic target, (i. e. the estimated shark location). Each AUV circles the target by tracking circles of different radii and at different phase angles with respect to the target so as to obtain simultaneous sensor vantage points and minimize chance of AUV collision. A series of experiments using two AUVs were conducted in Big Fisherman’s Cove in Santa Catalina Island, CA and demonstrated the ability to track a tagged leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata). The performance of the tracking was compared to standard manual tracking performed using an directional hydrophone operated by a researcher in a boat. In an additional experiment, the AUVs tracked an <b>acoustic</b> <b>tag</b> attached to the tracking boat to quantify the error of the state estimation of the system. I...|$|E

40|$|Lateralized {{behaviour}} {{refers to}} a preference for using a specific limb or direction of movement that is consistent across events. We investigated apparent lateralized behaviour in North Atlantic humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, in the southern Gulf of Maine using digital <b>acoustic</b> <b>tag</b> (‘DTAG’) technology to analyse feeding behaviours during 2004 – 2009. An ideal tool to examine lateralized behaviours, DTAGs allowed continuous measurements of whale depth, heading, pitch and roll throughout the attachment period (less than 24 h). Side preference (right or left) in rolling behaviours (e. g. bottom rolling and side lunging) and directional preference (clockwise or anticlockwise) in feeding behaviours such as looping and spiraling were determined from visual examination of DTAG data. A ‘handedness index’ (HI) was used to quantify side bias and strength of preference. We found a population-level right-side bias similar to the 90 / 10 right-hand bias in humans. Furthermore, photos of jaw scuffing and direct tag data on rolling behaviour were used to assign a bottom-rolling side preference for 11 individuals for whom both of these data were available, 10 (90. 9 %) of which demonstrated a right-side bias. Consistent laterality was observed between individuals that performed bottom rolling and directional feeding behaviours, which was biased in the right/clockwise direction. Younger individuals tended to show weaker lateralization scores than older individuals, even among adults (P = 0. 048), suggesting that lateralization develops, and continues to do so, beyond sexual maturity...|$|E
