5|$|<b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> which {{developer}} {{control was}} asserted involved Blizzard Entertainment's action against Tristan Pope's Not Just Another Love Story. Blizzard's community managers encouraged users to post game movies and screenshots, but viewers complained that Pope's suggestion of sexual actions through creative camera and character positioning was pornographic. Citing the user license agreement, Blizzard closed discussion threads {{about the film}} and prohibited links to it. Although Pope accepted Blizzard's right to some control, he remained concerned about censorship of material that already existed in-game in some form. Discussion ensued about boundaries between MMORPG player and developer control. Lowood asserted that this controversy demonstrated that machinima could be a medium of negotiation for players.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> {{which the}} Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from {{the chief justice}} was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage {{for women in the}} District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E

5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E

5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> point being the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s. With commercial exploitation increasing {{in many parts of}} the world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E

The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making an arrest in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the arrest, they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. Glik then sued the City of Boston and the arresting officers, claiming that they violated his constitutional rights.|$|E

The bottle was then placed into the hearth and heated until it exploded, with this supposedly defeating the witch's machinations.|$|E

An enhanced version with better sound, graphics and other modifications was marketed in the USA by Timex as the Timex Sinclair 2068.
