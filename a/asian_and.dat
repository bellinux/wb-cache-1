40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown an association between racism-related stress and negative health outcomes among African Americans and the moderating effect of coping strategies on this relationship.

Using the 2009 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) and a framework derived from stress process and biopsychosocial models, this study examines the relationship between self-reported racism-related stress, coping strategies, and self-rated general health among <b>Asians</b> <b>and</b> Latinas/os in the U. S. Findings demonstrate that racism-related stress has a negative effect on the general health of <b>Asians</b> <b>and</b> Latinas/os; however, and contrary to research to prior research, coping strategies do not moderate this relationship. This study contributes to health disparities research by documenting racism as a stressor that negatively impacts the health of <b>Asians</b> <b>and</b> Latinos/as and the limits of coping strategies to moderate this relationship...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether ethnic differences in diabetes, dyslipidemia, and ectopic fat deposition account for ethnic differences in incident cardiovascular disease. Background: Coronary heart disease risks are elevated in South <b>Asians</b> <b>and</b> are lower in African Caribbeans compared with Europeans. These ethnic differences map to lipid patterns and ectopic fat deposition. Methods: Cardiovascular risk factors were assessed in 2, 049 Europeans, 1, 517 South <b>Asians,</b> <b>and</b> 630 African Caribbeans from 1988 through 1991 (mean age: 52. 4 ± 6. 9 years). Fatal and nonfatal events were captured over a median 20. 5 -year follow-up. Subhazard ratios (SHR) were calculated using competing risks regression. Results: Baseline diabetes prevalence was more than 3 times greater in South <b>Asians</b> <b>and</b> African Caribbeans than in Europeans. South <b>Asians</b> were more <b>and</b> African Caribbeans were less centrally obese and dyslipidemic than Europeans. Compared with Europeans, coronary heart disease incidence was greater in South <b>Asians</b> <b>and</b> less in African Caribbeans.
