40|$|Tendinopathy is {{a common}} and {{significant}} clinical problem characterised by activity-related pain, focal tendon tenderness and intratendinous imaging changes. Recent histopathological studies have indicated the underlying pathology {{to be one of}} tendinosis (degeneration) as opposed to tendinitis (inflammation). Relatively little is known about tendinosis and its pathogenesis. Contributing to this is an absence of validated <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> of the pathology. <b>Animal</b> <b>models</b> of tendinosis represent potential efficient and effective means of furthering our understanding of human tendinopathy and its underlying pathology. By selecting an appropriate species and introducing known risk factors for tendinopathy in humans, it is possible to develop tendon changes in <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> that are consistent with the human condition. This paper overviews the role of <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> in tendinopathy research by discussing the benefits and development of <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> of tendinosis, highlighting potential outcome measures that may be used in animal tendon research, and reviewing current <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> of tendinosis.

40|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>models</b> of {{arthritis}} {{are widely used}} to de-convolute disease pathways and to identify novel drug targets and therapeutic approaches. However, the high attrition rates of drugs in Phase II/III rates means that {{a relatively small number}} of drugs reach the market, despite showing efficacy in pre-clinical models. There is also increasing awareness of the ethical issues surrounding the use of <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> of disease and it is timely, therefore, to review the relevance and translatability of <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> {{of arthritis}}. In this paper we review the most commonly used <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> in terms of their pathological similarities to human rheumatoid arthritis as well as their response to drug therapy. In general, the ability of <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> to predict efficacy of biologics in man has been good.
