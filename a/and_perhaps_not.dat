25|$|The general {{scholarly}} consensus {{since the}} time of Eoin MacNeill has been that the Ulaid were kin to the Érainn, or at least to their royal families, sometimes called the Clanna Dedad, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> their nebulous subject populations. T. F. O'Rahilly notably believed the Ulaid were an actual branch of the Érainn. Also claimed as being related to the Ulaid are the Dáirine, another name for the Érainn royalty, both of which may have been related or derived from the Darini of Ptolemy.|$|E
25|$|When {{elected by}} the legislature, Clay was below the constitutionally {{required}} age of thirty. His age {{did not appear to}} have been noticed by any other Senator, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> by Clay. His term ended before his thirtieth birthday. Such an age qualification issue has occurred with only two other U.S. Senators, Armistead Thomson Mason (aged 28 in 1816), and John Eaton (aged 28 in 1818). Such an occurrence, however, has not been repeated since. In 1934, Rush D. Holt, Sr. was elected to the Senate at the age of 29; he waited until he turned 30 (on the following June 19) to take the oath of office. In November 1972, Joe Biden was elected to the Senate at the age of 29, but he reached his 30th birthday before the swearing-in ceremony for incoming senators in January 1973.|$|E

25|$|In general The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a {{considerable}} achievement for a first-off author. The country-house-party murder is a stereotype in the detective-story genre, which Christie makes no great use of. Not her sort of occasion, at least later in life, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> really her class. The family party is much more in her line, {{and this is what}} we have here. This is one of the few Christies anchored in time and space: we are in Essex, during the First World War. The family is kept together under one roof by the exigencies of war and of a matriarch demanding rather than tyrannical – not one of her later splendid monsters, but a sympathetic and lightly shaded characterisation. If the lifestyle of the family still seems to us lavish, even wasteful, nevertheless we have the half sense that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the Edwardian summer, that the era of country-house living has entered its final phase. Christie takes advantage of this end-of-an-era feeling in several ways: while she uses the full range of servants and their testimony, a sense of decline, of break-up is evident; feudal attitudes exist, but they crack easily. The marriage of the matriarch with a mysterious nobody is the central out-of-joint event in an intricate web of subtle changes. The family is lightly but effectively characterised, and on the outskirts of the story are the villagers, the small businessmen, and the surrounding farmers – the nucleus of Mayhem Parva. It is, too, a very clever story, with clues and red herrings falling thick and fast. We are entering the age when plans of the house were an indispensable aid to the aspirant solver of detective stories, and when cleverness was more important than suspense. But here we come to a problem that Agatha Christie has not yet solved, for cleverness over the long length easily becomes exhausting, and too many clues tend to cancel each other out, as far as reader interest is concerned. These were problems which Conan Doyle never satisfactorily overcame, but which Christie would.".|$|E

2500|$|It is {{reliably}} {{estimated that}} pneumatic tourniquets {{are used in}} more than one million surgical procedures annually in North America. The potential for injury is significant, although the use of lower, personalized tourniquet pressure levels and shorter tourniquet times are reducing the number, nature and extent of reported injuries. Injuries resulting from pneumatic tourniquet use are most commonly pressure-related, resulting either from the use of an excessively high tourniquet pressure level or from the use of an insufficiently low tourniquet pressure level. [...] Ischemic injuries can also result from prolonged tourniquet time periods.

2500|$|Unlike its {{discipline}} regarding sacraments, the Catholic Church {{does not}} exclude from receiving sacramentals, {{such as the}} placing of ashes on the head, {{those who are not}} Catholics <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> even baptized.

[...] The Catholic Church does not limit distribution of blessed ashes to within church buildings and has suggested the holding of celebrations in shopping centres, nursing homes, and factories. Such celebrations presume preparation of an appropriate area and include readings from Scripture (at least one) and prayers, and are somewhat shorter if the ashes are already blessed.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the basis}} of circumstantial evidence, it is speculated that the Bridewell Governors may have decided as early as 1598 to allow public {{visitors}} as means of raising hospital income. The only other reference to visiting in the sixteenth-century is provided in a comment in Thomas More's 1522 treatise, The Four Last Things, where he observed that [...] "thou shalt in Bedleem see one laugh at the knocking of his head against a post". As More occupied a variety of official positions that might have occasioned his calling {{to the hospital and}} as he lived nearby, his visit provides no compelling evidence that public visitation was widespread during the sixteenth century. The first apparently definitive documentation of public visiting derives from a 1610 record which details Lord Percy's payment of 10 shillings for the privilege of rambling through the hospital to view its deranged denizens. It was also at this time, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> coincidentally, that Bedlam was first used as a stage setting with the publication of The Honest Whore, Part I, in 1604.|$|E
