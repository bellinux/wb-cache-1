40|$|Metal {{enhanced}} fluorescence assay-based sensitive {{detection of}} a neurotoxic organophosphates pesticide, Paraoxon, is reported. The experimental approach involves the bio-interfacing of organophosphorus hydrolase {{with a high}} quantum yield fluorophore, pyranine (8 -hydroxyl pyrene- 1, 3, 6 -trisulfonic <b>acid</b> <b>trisodium</b> salt), followed by the conjugation of the OPH-pyranine derivative with silica-coated silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). The above bio-nanoprobe {{was used for the}} analysis of the organophosphate pesticide, wherein the induced hydrolysis of the pesticide cause the decrease in pH in the vicinity. An excitation light of 460 nm wavelength was used to monitor the changes in the resulting emission (at 510 nm) with respect to the changing pesticide concentrations (1 – 100 ppb). The introduction of the silica-coated AgNPs into the nanoprobe system was observed to deliver metal enhanced effect, leading to almost 10 -fold intensification of the fluorescence signal. The enhanced fluorescence assay format offers linear detection of Paraoxon in the concentration range of 1 – 100 ng mL− 1 with the limit of detection 1 ng mL− 1 (1 ppb) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this study, we {{synthesized}} the {{new kinds}} of semiconducting polymeric gels having negative (n -type) and positive (p -type) counter ions as charge carriers. The polyacrylamide gel was doped with pyranine (8 -hydroxypyrene- 1, 3, 6 -trisulfonic <b>acid,</b> <b>trisodium</b> salt), having ions as side groups and Na + as counter ions, so-called p -type semiconducting gel. The doping process was performed during the polymerization where the pyranine binds to the polymer strands over OH group chemically via radical addition. In a similar way, N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) gel was doped with methacrylamidopropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (MAPTAC), having Cl &# 8722; as counter ions, so-called n -type semiconducting gel. Here MAPTAC was embedded by copolymerization within the polymer network (NIPA). These semiconducting gels can show different electrical properties by changing the concentration of the doping agents, swelling ratio etc. We {{have shown that the}} pn junction, formed by combining p -type and n -type gels together in close contact, rectifies the current similar to the conventional Si and Ge diodes. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a chronoamperometric method to determine tungsten in water using screen-printed carbon electrodes modified with gold nanoparticles and cross linked alkaline phosphatase immobilized {{in the working}} electrode. Enzymatic activity over 2 -phospho-l-ascorbic <b>acid</b> <b>trisodium</b> salt, used as substrate, was affected by tungsten ions, {{which resulted in a}} decrease of chronoamperometric current, when a potential of 200 mV was applied on 10 mM of substrate in a Tris HCl buffer pH 8. 00 and 0. 36 M of KCl. Calibration curves for the electrochemical method validation, give a reproducibility of 5. 2 % (n = 3), a repeatability of 9. 4 % (n = 3) and a detection limit of 0. 29 ± 0. 01 µM. Enriched tap water, purified laboratory water and bottled drinking water, with a certified tungsten reference solution traceable to NIST, gave a recovery of 97. 1 %, 99. 1 % and 99. 1 % respectively (n = 4 in each case) and a dynamic range from 0. 6 to 30 µM. This study was performed by means of a Lineweaver–Burk plot, showing a mixed kinetic inhibition...|$|R
