Chamunda <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> {{the foot of the}} lion-headed goddess Narasimhi. Here, Chamunda is {{considered}} a representation of the vice of tale-telling (pasunya). The Varaha Purana text clearly mentions two separate goddesses Chamunda and Kali, unlike Devi Mahatmya.|$|E

5|$|In the Varaha Purana, {{the story}} of Raktabija is retold, but here each of Matrikas <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> the body of another Matrika. Varahi appears seated on Shesha-nāga (the serpent on which the god Vishnu sleeps) from the {{posterior}} of Vaishnavi, the Shakti of Vishnu. Varahi is said to represent the vice of envy (asuya) in the same Purana.|$|E

5|$|The show {{depicts the}} adventures of a mysterious and {{eccentric}} Time Lord known as the Doctor, who travels through time and space in his time machine, the TARDIS, which normally <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> the exterior to be a blue 1950s British police box. With his companions, he explores time and space, faces a variety of foes and saves civilizations, helping people and righting wrongs.|$|E
5|$|The snake is nocturnal, {{and may be}} more {{defensive}} at night. It is, however, a timid and placid {{species of}} snake. In the daytime, it hides under stones or in holes. The snake <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> April and retreats into hibernation in November. It {{is considered to be}} more defensive than the Banded krait (Bungarus fasciatus), thrashing about as it is handled.|$|E
5|$|How {{great the}} glory of Origen was, <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> the fact that Firmilianus, bishop of Cæsarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought a visit from him, and entertained {{him for a long}} while. Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Cæsarea and was {{instructed}} at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also from the fact that he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a Christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant.|$|E

5|$|Phallus impudicus, known colloquially as {{the common}} stinkhorn, is a {{widespread}} fungus recognizable for its foul odor and its phallic shape when mature, the latter feature giving rise to several names in 17th-century England. It is a common mushroom in Europe and western North America, where it occurs in habitats rich in wood debris such as forests and mulched gardens. It <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> summer to late autumn. The fruiting structure is tall and white with a slimy, dark olive colored conical head. Known as the gleba, this material contains the spores, and is transported by insects which are attracted by the odor—described as resembling carrion. Despite its foul smell, it is not poisonous and immature mushrooms are consumed in parts of France and Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Adhyatma Ramayana, the Mahavira-charita, the Anargharaghava and the Ramacharitamanas do {{not discuss}} the counsel at all and credit Shabari or Shramana or Guha {{as the one who}} leads Rama to Sugriva. In the Adhyatma Ramayana, Kabandha <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> the pyre as a divine being and reveals his true {{identity}} as a cursed gandharva. He further extols Rama in a hymn stating that various worlds and deities are embedded in parts of his body and Rama is the Supreme being and then disappears.|$|E
5|$|After {{dreaming of}} {{spectacular}} horrors, Houdini awakens {{at the bottom}} of the pit and eventually manages to free himself from the ropes. Suspecting that he is somewhere in a temple under the Great Sphinx of Giza, he travels through the dark in an attempt to find an exit, following what he believes to be a draft from outdoors. Instead, he discovers that he has actually been heading further underground, eventually falling down a flight of stairs and landing in a large ceremonial cavern. There he witnesses an army of half-man, half-animal mummies, led by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs Khephren and Nitokris, leaving offerings to a hippopotamus-sized, five-headed, tentacled beast that <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> a hole deep in the hall. As he escapes, he realizes that this creature is merely the paw of a much larger deity in whose image the Sphinx was carved. Houdini dismisses the events as a hallucination or a dream consequent of the strains of his kidnapping ordeal, despite the resemblance he sees between Khephren and his guide, Drogman.|$|E

5|$|For {{at least}} 3,000 years from antiquity {{until the late}} 20thcentury mining of tin and copper played a {{significant}} part in the economy of Cornwall. Cornwall, {{the northern part of}} Iberia and the Ore Mountains (the modern border between the Czech Republic and Germany) are the only places in Europe in which major tin deposits are found near the surface. As tin is an essential ingredient of bronze, Cornwall was of great economic significance in Bronze Age Europe despite its relative isolation. Mining by the Roman Empire led to the Iberian mines becoming depleted by the 3rd centuryAD, leaving Cornwall and neighbouring Devon the most significant sources of tin in Europe. While it <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> surviving evidence that after the decline of the Bronze Age civilisations copper production ceased in Cornwall, it seems that the tin mines were in continuous operation throughout the Roman period and the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|However, {{conscription}} was not {{in practice}} universal. Firstly, a land-based levy meant recruits were exclusively the sons of peasants, as opposed to townspeople. Thus some 20% of the empire's population was excluded. In addition, as during the Principate, slaves were not admissible. Nor were freedmen and persons in certain occupations such as bakers and innkeepers. In addition, provincial officials and curiales (city council members) could not enlist. These rules were relaxed only in emergencies, as during the military crisis of 405–6 (Radagaisus' invasion of Italy and the great barbarian invasion of Gaul). Most importantly, the conscription requirement was often commuted into a cash levy, at a fixed rate per recruit due. This was done for certain provinces, in certain years, although the specific details are largely unknown. It <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> the very slim available evidence that conscription was not applied evenly across provinces but concentrated heavily in the army's traditional recruiting areas of Gaul (including the two Germaniae provinces along the Rhine) and the Danubian provinces, with other regions presumably often commuted. An analysis of the known origins of comitatenses in the period 350–476 shows that in the Western army, the Illyricum and Gaul dioceses together provided 52% of total recruits. Overall, the Danubian regions provided {{nearly half of the}} whole army's recruits, despite containing only three of the 12 dioceses. This picture is much in line with the 2nd-century position.|$|E
5|$|In {{the farming}} village Nakanogō, {{on the shore}} of Lake Biwa in Ōmi Province in the late 16th century, Genjurō, a potter, takes his wares to nearby Ōmizo. He is {{accompanied}} by Tōbei, who dreams of becoming a samurai. A respected sage tells Genjurō's wife Miyagi to warn her husband about seeking profit in times of upheaval, and to prepare for a probable attack on the village. Genjurō arrives with wide profits, but she asks him to stop. Genjurō nevertheless works long hours to finish his pottery. That night, Shibata Katsuie's army sweeps through Nakanogō, and Genjurō, Tōbei and their wives are uprooted. Genjurō collects his pottery from the kiln, and decides to take the pots to a different marketplace. As the two couples travel across a lake, a boat <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> thick fog. The sole passenger tells them he was attacked by pirates, warns them back to their homes, then dies. The two men decide to return their wives to the shore. Tōbei's wife Ohama refuses to go. Miyagi begs Genjurō not to leave her, but is left on the shore with their young son, Gen'ichi, clasped to her back. At market, Genjurō's pottery sells well. After taking his promised share of the profits, Tōbei runs off to buy samurai armor, and sneaks into the ranks of a clan of samurai. Lost from her companions, Ohama has wandered beyond Nagahama in her desperate search for Tōbei. She is raped by a group of soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} loop, Crusher again has {{a feeling of}} déjà vu during the poker game, but when Data deals the next hand, all the cards are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind. The number 3 begins appearing throughout {{other parts of the}} ship's operations while, again, they determine they are stuck in a time loop. When they reach the anomaly and the ship <b>appears</b> <b>from</b> it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, and executes Riker's option instead of his own. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew realize they have been trapped in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has been missing for over 90 years. Picard welcomes the Bozemans crew to the 24th century.|$|E
