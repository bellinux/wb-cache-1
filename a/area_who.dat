5|$|In July 2010, Minnesota Majority, a {{conservative}} watchdog group, {{conducted a study}} in which they flagged 2,803 voters for examination, including some 1,359 they suspected were ineligible convicted felons in the largely Democratic Minneapolis–St. Paul <b>area</b> <b>who</b> voted illegally in the Senate race. Subsequent investigations of Minnesota Majority's claims by election officials found that many of their allegations were incorrect.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scientists}} {{criticized the}} project as being potentially unsafe for the local wildlife and the Inupiat people living near the designated <b>area,</b> <b>who</b> were not officially told of the plan until March 1960. Additionally, {{it turned out that}} the harbor would be ice-bound for nine months out of the year. In the end, due to the financial infeasibility of the project and the concerns over radiation-related health issues, the project was abandoned in 1962.|$|E

5|$|The First World War {{memorial}} in Grove Park, containing a sculpture by Alfred Drury, was unveiled in 1922, with additions by Walter Cave for the Second World War. It contains {{the names of}} 402 men from the <b>area</b> <b>who</b> fell in the First World War. It consists of a winged allegorical figure of Victory holding an olive branch, which stands on an octagonal column. The memorial is a grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The area {{surrounding}} the volcano was originally inhabited by Chinook Native Americans, {{and was later}} encountered by Polish settlers. One of the visitors was Jon Hurlburt, an early explorer of the <b>area</b> <b>who</b> named the volcano after the engineer Hans Thielsen. Later explorers discovered nearby Crater Lake. The volcano was not analyzed until 1884, when a team from the United States Geological Survey sampled its fulgurite deposits.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Akersbanerne {{was working}} on {{building}} the Lambertseter Line, which is located further east in Aker. This caused an uproar amongst the residents in the Ekeberg <b>area,</b> <b>who</b> wanted the Ekeberg Line extended, in {{what became known as}} the thousand meter, before the construction of the Lambertseter Line. The municipality therefore granted free municipal land and a grant of NOK50,000 for expropriation. Construction started in July 1940, after having been delayed by the German occupation of Norway. The construction included a new double track from Holtet to Bråten. During the construction at Sæter, the trams turned at Bråten and backed to Sæter, where they used the turning loop. The thousand meter extension to Ljabru opened on 17 September 1941.|$|E
5|$|Binghamton University was {{established}} in 1946 as Triple Cities College, to {{serve the needs of}} local veterans of the Binghamton, New York <b>area,</b> <b>who</b> were returning from World War II. Established in Endicott, New York, the college was a branch of Syracuse University. Triple Cities College offered local students {{the first two years of}} their education, while the following two were spent at Syracuse University. In 1946, students could earn their degrees entirely at the Binghamton campus. In 1950, it was absorbed by the State University of New York and renamed Harpur College.|$|E

5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban <b>area</b> <b>who</b> have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of Mexican {{casualties}} {{range from}} one to three soldiers killed and from three to seven wounded. Approximately 20soldiers escaped. They warned the garrisons at Copano and Refugio of the advancing Texians; those garrisons abandoned their posts and joined the soldiers at Fort Lipantitlán. Milam escorted the remaining Mexican soldiers to Gonzales, where the newly formed Texian Army was located. The Texian Army commander, Stephen F. Austin, later released all of the men, {{on the condition that}} they leave Texas and vow to stop fighting Texas residents. One wounded Mexican soldier was allowed to remain in Goliad, as was Captain Manuel Sabriego, who was married to a local woman. In secret, Sabriego began organizing a group of settlers in the Goliad <b>area</b> <b>who</b> sympathized with Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} 20 {{years of the}} BAA/NBA, the league {{was still trying to}} gain the support of fans who lived in or near the teams' home markets. To achieve this, the league {{introduced}} the territorial pick rule to help teams acquire popular players from colleges in their <b>area</b> <b>who</b> would presumably have strong local support. Before the draft, a team could forfeit its first-round draft pick and then select any player from within a 50-mile radius of its home arena. Although the territorial picks were selected before the draft, these picks were not factored into the overall selection count of the draft; therefore, the first non-territorial pick of the draft was considered the first overall pick.|$|E

5|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that the CWU had started a fighting fund to help support postal workers who were experiencing financial difficulties {{as a result of}} the strike. Postmen lose a day's pay for each day they strike, and although most workers had lost just two days pay so far, many in the London <b>area</b> <b>who</b> had taken part in previous industrial action earlier in the year had lost as much as 18 days of wages. There was also speculation that the CWU lacked the funds for a lengthy dispute and donations to the union's fighting fund were pledged by other unions, including UNISON and Unite.|$|E

5|$|The Chesepian {{were the}} {{historic}} indigenous {{people of the}} area now known as Tidewater in Virginia {{at the time of}} European encounter.

These were common among the numerous tribes of the coastal <b>area,</b> <b>who</b> made up the loose Powhatan Confederacy, numbering {{in the tens of thousands}} in population. The Chesepian occupied an area which is now defined as the independent cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach.|$|E

5|$|The Church of Ireland {{community}} had worshipped {{at the old}} church, which was in a ruinous state by 1829 when the new St. Paul's Church was built {{at the top of}} the hill, overlooking the town. The new Catholic church of St. Rynagh's had been constructed some three years earlier and on land given by the Armstrongs, the most influential and wealthiest Protestant family in the <b>area,</b> <b>who</b> consistently and energetically advocated Catholic Emancipation and repeal of the Penal Laws. This situation demonstrated the friendly relations that existed between the two communities in Banagher during those difficult times for Catholics in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Negombo Tamil dialect {{is used by}} bilingual {{fishermen}} in the Negombo <b>area,</b> <b>who</b> otherwise identify themselves as Sinhalese. This dialect has undergone considerable convergence with spoken Sinhala. The Batticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between Tamils, Muslims, Veddhas and Portuguese Burghers in the Eastern Province. Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary of all the spoken dialects of Tamil. It has preserved several ancient features, remaining more consistent with the literary norm, {{while at the same}} time developing a few innovations. It also has its own distinctive vocabulary and retains words that are unique to present-day Malayalam, a Dravidian language from Kerala that originated as a dialect of old Tamil around 9th century CE. The Tamil dialect used by residents of the Trincomalee District has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect.|$|E

The House votes opposing Jennings came largely from the state's western counties. Harrison was outraged by the decision and resigned as lieutenant governor.|$|E
