25|$|Wastewater {{generated}} from agricultural and food operations has distinctive characteristics that set it <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>common</b> municipal wastewater managed by {{public or private}} sewage treatment plants throughout the world: it is biodegradable and non-toxic, but has high concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS). The constituents of food and agriculture wastewater are often complex to predict, due to the differences in BOD and pH in effluents from vegetable, fruit, and meat products and due to the seasonal nature of food processing and post-harvesting.|$|E
500|$|A {{microburst}} {{is a very}} localized {{column of}} sinking air known as a downburst, producing damaging divergent and straight-line winds at the surface {{that are similar to}} but distinguishable from tornadoes which generally have convergent damage. [...] The term was defined as affecting an area [...] in diameter or less, distinguishing them as a type of downburst and <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>common</b> wind shear which can encompass greater areas. They are normally associated with individual thunderstorms. Microburst soundings show the presence of mid-level dry air, which enhances evaporative cooling.|$|E

6000|$|The lovers listened, {{owned the}} truth of the old man's words, bewailed their fate, and yielded,--Laura for love of her father, Philip for love of her. He went away to build a firm {{foundation}} for his castle in the air, and Laura retired into an invisible convent, where she cast off the world, and regarded her sympathizing sisters through a grate of superior knowledge and unsharable grief. Like a devout nun, she worshipped [...] "St. Philip," [...] and firmly believed in his miraculous powers. She fancied that her woes set her <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>common</b> cares, and slowly fell into a dreamy state, professing no interest in any mundane matter, but the art that first attracted Philip. Crayons, bread-crusts, and gray paper became glorified in Laura's eyes; and her one pleasure was to sit pale and still before her easel, day after day, filling her portfolios with the faces he had once admired. Her sisters observed that every Bacchus, Piping Faun, or Dying Gladiator bore some likeness to a comely countenance that heathen god or hero never owned; and seeing this, they privately rejoiced that she had found such solace for her grief.|$|E

5000|$|In 1970s the historians, {{following}} the political order, focused on {{investigations of the}} interwar period; the Nazi governing was interpreted as absolution from sins of the First Republic and still {{within the boundaries of}} the [...] "victim theory". Authors of the standard [...] "History of Austria" [...] (1977) Gorlich and Romanik stated that the WWII belonged to the world history, it was not the Austrian war because Austria as the state has not participated in it. Along with it Austrian patriots have known that the path to Austrian statehood revival laid through the Hitler's defeat. Austrian own history was considered <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>common</b> German one; by 1980 the belief that a special, [...] "not German" [...] national identity of Austrians has existed became firmly established in science. Austrian lineage of Odilo Globocnik, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Adolf Eichmann and other Nazi criminals was suppressed: the historians called them German occupiers. The only existing (as of 2007) monograph about denazification in Austria (Dieter Stiefel, 1981) blamed it as an unfounded and incompetent intervention of the victors into home affairs. Left-wing historians, in their turn, criticised the Allies for supposed suppression of a spontaneous anti-fascist movement, which had no appreciable influence in the reality.|$|E
