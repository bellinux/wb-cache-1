40|$|Microalgae-based lipids are {{considered}} a good feedstock for various applications, including biodiesel and omega- 3 -rich oil production. However, developing new lipid extraction and recovery techniques are required to make microalgal oil a more economically competitive feedstock. To avoid the costly process of complete drying of algal biomass, extraction from wet slurry was improved. Potentially cost-effective and scalable processes were investigated and developed that enable total rupture of nutrient-starved microalgal cells to facilitate lipid recovery directly from wet <b>algal</b> <b>slurry,</b> including pretreatments (thermal treatment, UV-C light radiation and osmotic shock) {{and the use of}} a solvent mixture. Using hexane and ethanol on UV-C and thermally pre-treated algal slurries led to more than doubling of the total extractable lipids and total transesterifiable lipids, compared to biomass that was not pretreated and when hexane only was used as the solvent. Lipids (25 % w/dry weight), triacylglycerol (13 %) and fatty acid methyl esters (17 %) were recovered from UV-C pre-treated <b>algal</b> <b>slurry</b> (1000  mJ/cm UV-C). The residual defatted biomass was analysed for further applications and contained carbohydrates (≈  15 % w/dry weight) that may be suitable for bioethanol production through fermentation...|$|E
40|$|High {{moisture}} content in wet algal biomass hinders effective performance of current lipid extraction methods. An improved aqueous extraction method combing thermal and enzymatic lysis was proposed and performed in <b>algal</b> <b>slurry</b> of Nannochloropsis oceanica (96. 0 % moisture) in this study. In general, cell-wall of N. oceanica was disrupted via thermal lysis and enzymatic lysis and lipid {{extraction was performed}} using aqueous surfactant solution. At the optimal conditions, high extraction efficiencies for both lipid (88. 3 %) and protein (62. 4 %) were obtained, which {{were significantly higher than}} those of traditional hexane extraction and other methods for wet algal biomass. Furthermore, an excessive extraction of polar lipid was found for wet biomass compared with dry biomass. The advantage of this method is to efficiently extract lipids from high {{moisture content}} algal biomass and avoid using organic solvent, indicating immense potential for commercial microalgae-based biofuel production.

40|$|Lipids from {{algal biomass}} may provide {{renewable}} fuel and chemical feedstock in large quantities. The energy intensity of drying and milling of algae prior to extraction and of solvent recovery afterwards {{is a major}} obstacle. The objective is to use switchable solvents to extract oil directly from wet microalgae slurries {{without the need for}} drying and milling, and subsequently recover the extracted oil and solvent by simple phase splitting, using CO 2 as trigger. In this work secondary amine solvents were investigated for lipids extraction, polarity switching and phase splitting ability upon contacting with CO 2. For strain Desmodesmus sp. extraction yields from the wet <b>algal</b> <b>slurries,</b> with and without cell disruption, were comparable with Bligh & Dyer method yields. Oil and solvent recovery via phase separation was realized by CO 2 induced phase splitting, making secondary amines a candidate for further development of an energy efficient lipid extraction technology for non-broken microalga...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of an integrated biorefinery process capable of producing multiple products is crucial for commercialization of microalgal biofuel production. Dilute acid pretreatment has been demonstrated as an efficient approach to utilize algal biomass more fully, by hydrolyzing microalgal carbohydrates into fermentable sugars, while making the lipids more extractable, and a protein fraction available for other products. Previously, we have shown that sugar-rich liquor could be separated from solid residue by solid–liquid separation (SLS) to produce ethanol via fermentation. However, process modeling has revealed that approximately 37 % of the soluble sugars {{were lost in the}} solid cake after the SLS. Herein, a Combined Algal Processing (CAP) approach with a simplified configuration has been developed to improve the total energy yield. In CAP, whole <b>algal</b> <b>slurry</b> after acid pretreatment is directly used for ethanol fermentation. The ethanol and microalgal lipids can be sequentially recovered from the fermentation broth by thermal treatment and solvent extraction. Almost all the monomeric fermentable sugars can be utilized for ethanol production without compromising the lipid recovery. The techno-economic analysis (TEA) indicates that the CAP can reduce microalgal biofuel cost by $ 0. 95 per gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE), which is a 9 % reduction compared to the previous biorefinery scenario...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFractionation {{of plant}} and animal raw {{materials}} by pH-shift processing has been widely applied to purify proteins. The principle is to solubilize proteins at high or low pH, removing debris and precipitating the proteins near their isoelectric point. We here describe the pH-shift process on commercially available Nannochloropsis oculata. The partitioning of major nutrients into the various fractions of the process was studied. Proteins were found to exhibit maximal solubility between pH 7 and 10, with a minimal solubility below pH 4. Two process versions were investigated in this study, with solubilization at either pH 7 (native pH) or 10; both versions were precipitated at pH 3. Up to 85 % of both the protein and total fatty acids were recovered in the final product, compared to the initial <b>algal</b> <b>slurry.</b> Protein, total fatty acids and carbohydrates were concentrated in the final product, while the ash content was lower compared to the starting material. From a processing point of view, solubilization of Nannochloropsis at native pH was found to be preferable, since less chemicals were consumed compared to high-pH solubilization. Owing to its content of protein and (total) fatty acids (23 and 12 % of dry weight, respectively), the latter enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the product of the pH-shift process has potential as a functional food ingredient...|$|E
30|$|The species Chlorella pyrenoidosa strain NCIM 2738 is a {{freshwater}} green alga {{from the}} genus Chlorella. This strain {{was obtained from}} National Centre for Industrial Microorganisms (NCIM), Pune, India. Batch size of 40  L (20 flasks) was cultivated in 3 -L glass conical flasks containing 2  L modified Chlorella medium in each flask and sterilized in an autoclave at 120  °C, 15  bar pressure for 20  min. Modified chlorella medium, adjusted to pH 7.5, consisted of following components (g/l): KNO 3 (4), NaNO 3 (0.1), MgSO 4 · 7 H 20 (0.1), CaCl 2 ·H 2 O (0.05), H 3 BO 3 (0.00286), MnCl 2 · 4 H 2 O (0.00181), ZnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O (0.00022), NaMoO 4 · 2 H 2 O (0.0004), CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O (0.00008), FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O (0.00557), and Na 2 EDTA (0.00745). The flasks were maintained in a plant growth chamber where the illumination (800 – 1000  lux) was provided by cool white fluorescent lamps (Philips) and light intensity was measured with an LUX meter. The temperature was maintained at 25  ±  2  °C and flasks were agitated twice daily for 2  min at 60 revolutions per min. Ten-day-old cultures were inoculated in the media-containing flasks and incubated during 45  days. The biomass was harvested by sedimentation and further centrifuged (Backman J 2 -MC, USA) at 5000 ×g for 10  min to collect the thick <b>algal</b> <b>slurry.</b> The algae slurry was washed with distilled water to remove salts. This slurry was dried in an oven at 50  °C for 24  h. Dried biomass was ground and passed through 36 -mesh-size sieve to obtain uniform particle size then stored at − 20  °C in an air-tight seal container until used. Afterwards, cell disruption of dried biomass was performed using ultrasonication (Branson Ultrasonifier 450, USA) and disruption was confirmed by microscopic (Motic BA 310, with Moticam 480, China) observation at 40 ×.|$|E
40|$|Plant {{detritus}} is {{the primary}} source of energy in freshwater benthic food webs, and the flow of energy from detritus to consumers is largely a function of detritus quality. Theory suggests that invasions by nonnative plants can impact consumers by changing the quality of the detrital pool, but empirical evidence for this is limited. Larval anurans, an abundant constituent of wetlands, may be particularly responsive to shifts in litter quality, as they feed largely on detrital biofilms. I conducted two experiments to evaluate the impacts of nonnative plant litter on larval anurans. For each experiment, I hypothesized that litter quality, including C:N:P, tannin content and lignin content, would determine the number of tadpoles that completed metamorphosis, as well as the productivity, or aggregate mass, of those metamorphs. First, I conducted a field experiment involving four native and five nonnative plant species at five different wetland complexes in central New York. I installed field cages in sites dominated by a single species of each plant and added three tadpole species according to their natural phenology. I monitored cages regularly, collecting and weighing all metamorphosed individuals as they became available. I observed unique interactions between plant and amphibian species, largely driven by the response of larval anurans to plant traits (e. g. sensitivity to plant phenolics). Importantly, my data shows that tadpole performance did not differ in habitats dominated by native or nonnative plants, largely because there are no consistent differences in native and nonnative litter quality. However, my findings do show that plant traits, irrespective of plant origin, do affect tadpole performance. For my second experiment, I raised tadpoles in experimental mesocosms containing an <b>algal</b> <b>slurry</b> and litter from 15 populations of a single nonnative species, Phalaris arundinacea L. (reed canarygrass), that varies widely in litter quality. I observed significant differences in tadpole performance among P. arundinacea populations, and found that litter traits explain {{a significant portion of the}} observed variation in tadpole productivity. Increases in P. arundinacea C:P had a negative impact on tadpole performance, while increases in plant phenolics had a positive effect. Overall, my work shows that variation in litter quality, both between and within species, influences secondary productivity in these experimental communities. This suggests that functional traits, irrespective of species origin or identity, can have important consequences for ecosystem function...|$|E
40|$|Microalgae {{from the}} Coal Bed Methane (CBM) ponds of the Powder River Basin (PRB) in Southeastern Montana have the {{potential}} to be utilized as fertilizer for use on the economically important plants of Montana. Three very important economic field crops of Montana (winter wheat - Triticum aestivum, potato - Solanum tuberosum, and flax - Linum usitatissimum) were used for the fertilization experiments. Isolates of unicellular green algae - PW 95 (sequenced as Neospongiococcum sp.) from the CBM ponds, and blue-green microalgae – Cyanobacteria (Anabaena Cylindrica) were cultured in the laboratory and the cells were concentrated using gravity sedimentation. Nutrient analysis of the PW 95 cultures showed nitrogen as the most abundant component with a concentration of 1240 mg/L. Other components, such as potassium and phosphorus, 264 mg/L and 130 mg/L respectively, were also detected. Concentrated <b>algal</b> <b>slurry</b> was added to the seedlings after the determination of their nutrient composition and the wheat and potatoes were harvested after 120 and 100 days respectively. Overall, when compared to control wheat grown with only water, or with water and a commercially available fertilizer, the PW 95 -fertilized wheat had higher chlorophyll content, more tillers (side shoots), and higher ratio of inflorescences (groups of flowers) per stem. Data analysis showed a statistical difference in plant height of wheat fertilized by PW 95. In terms of harvest, the average total dry weight for PW 95 -fertilized wheat was 117 % and 47 % more than those of water and chemical fertilizer (Miracle-Gro - M. Gro) - treated wheats respectively. Measurements of the seed weights showed that PW 95 -treated plants are 123 % and 58 % higher than corresponding measurements for wheat treated with water and M. Gro respectively. The {{results of this study suggest}} that PW 95 from the CBM ponds may be a viable source of fertilizer for crops and other economically important plants of Montana and may contribute to the development of an economically important and locally obtainable product from the ponds. These results were not as pronounced in PW 95 -fertilized potatoes. A major bottleneck to effective implementation and deployment of microalgae as a fertilizing agent is the availability of biomass which originates from noticed deficiencies in biomass harvesting techniques. Experiments conducted using KOH as a flocculating agent for biomass harvesting showed that PW 95 cells agglomerate as the pH of the suspension increases. An optimal pH level was found to be 11. 5. Highest flocculation efficiencies of 28 % and 42 % were achieved at optimum pH 11. 5 over a settling time of 15 and 30 minutes respectively. However, efficiency at pH 12 (51. 82 %) was marginally higher (3. 4 %) than the efficiency at pH 11. 5 at 45 minutes. As widely stated in literature, the use of KOH as flocculant is intended to contaminate, with potassium, the biomass product and lower its quality. However, with potassium being an essential growth agent for most crops, the biomass product from the flocculation experiment could represent an innovative method of increasing the properties and performance of PW 95 as a biofertilizer...|$|E
