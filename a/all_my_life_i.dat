In <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>I</b> have never heard {{anything}} as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever {{be one of the}} best moments of my life, and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well.|$|E

500|$|Those {{close to}} him thought he was {{suffering}} from dementia, and in mid-1960 Mary placed him in a clinic near Merano when his weight dropped. He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. Pound attended a neo-Fascist May Day parade in 1962, but his health continued to decline. The following year he told an interviewer, Grazia Levi: [...] "I spoil everything I touch. I have always blundered... <b>All</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>I</b> believed I knew nothing, yes, knew nothing. And so words became devoid of meaning." ...|$|E

500|$|When Wilson asked Congress {{to declare}} war on Germany in April 1917, Taft was an {{enthusiastic}} supporter; Taft {{was chairman of the}} American Red Cross' executive committee, occupying much of the former president's time. He took leave from Yale to be co-chairman of the National War Labor Board, tasked with assuring industrial peace. In February 1918, the new RNC chairman, Will H. Hays, approached Taft seeking his reconciliation with Roosevelt. In May, Taft was in Chicago at the Blackstone Hotel, and when he heard that Roosevelt and his party were dining there, walked in on them. [...] The two men embraced to the applause of the room, but the renewed relationship did not progress past outward friendliness before Roosevelt's death in January 1919. Taft later wrote, [...] "Had he died in a hostile state of mind toward me, I would have mourned the fact <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>I</b> loved him always and cherish his memory." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the second}} half of 1814, {{following}} his long and almost continuous campaigns throughout Europe during the last ten years, the health of General Nansouty badly deteriorated. He was suffering from his wounds, some of which were very recent, but, above all from war fatigue. On his death bed, he is recorded to have said: [...] "I have carefully reflected upon all my action ever since I was born and in <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>I</b> have not done anyone wrong." [...] He is also said to have reasserted his Christian faith and to have asked that his son be recommended for the King's protection, as a favour for his services. Just before passing away, he told his son that his heritage would be to follow his example and live an honourable and blameless life. General Count Étienne-Marie-Antoine-Champion de Nansouty died on 12 February 1815 in Paris, leaving behind his wife and their only son. A pension of 6,000 Francs per year was granted to the General's widow by the King of France. His final resting place is at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, division 27. The engraving on his tombstone reads: ...|$|E

2500|$|Under the {{management}} of Abatino, Baker's stage and public persona, {{as well as her}} singing voice, were transformed. In 1934, she took the lead in a revival of Jacques Offenbach's opera La créole, which premiered in December of that year for a six-month run at the Théâtre Marigny on the Champs-Élysées of Paris. In preparation for her performances, she went through months of training with a vocal coach. In the words of Shirley Bassey, who has cited Baker as her primary influence, [...] "...she went from a 'petite danseuse sauvage' with a decent voice to 'la grande diva magnifique'...I swear in <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>I</b> have never seen, and probably never shall see again, such a spectacular singer and performer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Farmer and {{his wife}} Marlene sold their house in 1992 and ran a two-star Southway Auto Lodge motel in South Perth until 1998,. Farmer said the {{business}} failed due to the downturn in the Asian economy and a 40% drop in tourist numbers, and left him with no money or assets. He said, [...] "We have nothing {{and we are back}} to square one. But we didn’t borrow money to keep the business going. <b>All</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>I</b> have helped myself {{and there is no reason}} why I can’t still do that". Farmer and Marlene were given temporary accommodation in the caretaker’s flat in the Main Roads building. Two fundraising events were organised in Perth and Melbourne by John Watts, Bob Davis and Sam Newman, raising $120,000. A trust fund was established with the money and a small villa bought in Innaloo.|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{had their}} own files on Sukarno and the Japanese {{commander}} in Sumatra approached him with respect, wanting to use him to organise and pacify the Indonesians. Sukarno {{on the other hand}} wanted to use the Japanese to gain independence for Indonesia: [...] "The Lord be praised, God showed me the way; in that valley of the Ngarai I said: Yes, Independent Indonesia can only be achieved with Dai Nippon...For the first time in <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>I</b> saw myself in the mirror of Asia." [...] In July 1942, Sukarno was sent back to Jakarta, where he re-united with other nationalist leaders recently released by the Japanese, including Mohammad Hatta. There, he met the Japanese commander General Hitoshi Imamura, who asked Sukarno and other nationalists to galvanise support from Indonesian populace to aid Japanese war effort.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aftermath}} {{of his work}} on Smile and Song Cycle left Parks wanting to focus more behind-the-scenes and with lesser-known artists, such as Randy Newman and Ry Cooder, and expressed discontent with the aspect of being [...] "typecast" [...] by his songs. The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill was also life-altering for Parks and changed his [...] "very reason for being". Sometime after, he met the Esso Trinidad Steel Band, a Trinidadian calypso band who had been performing with Liberace in Las Vegas. According to Parks, [...] "I saw them as enslaved in their relationship to Liberace; I {{thought it was a}} vulgarity. I wanted to save them from their trivialization." [...] What had begun as Parks's desire to popularize calypso at that point became his focal point, and he would work with the steel band the next several years. Speaking about his life then, Parks stated, [...] "My favorite group was the Esso Trinidad Steel Band, whom I worked with. I loved calypso <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>I</b> knew every Trinidadian in Hermosa Beach back then, there were probably about 20 families. Now there's a huge population." ...|$|E

2500|$|While lauded {{for opening}} up the {{independent}} film market and making it financially viable, Weinstein has been criticized by some for the techniques he has allegedly applied in his business dealings. Peter Biskind's book Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film details criticism of Miramax's release history and editing of Asian films, such as Shaolin Soccer, Hero, and Princess Mononoke. There is a rumor that when Harvey Weinstein was charged with handling the U.S. release of Princess Mononoke, director Hayao Miyazaki sent him a samurai sword in the mail. Attached to the blade was a stark message: [...] "No cuts." [...] Miyazaki commented on the incident: [...] "Actually, my producer did that. Although I did go to New York to meet this man, this Harvey Weinstein, and I was bombarded with this aggressive attack, all these demands for cuts. I defeated him." [...] Weinstein has always insisted that such editing {{was done in the}} interest of creating the most financially viable film. [...] "I'm not cutting for fun," [...] Harvey Weinstein said in an interview. [...] "I'm cutting for the shit to work. <b>All</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>I</b> served one master: the film.
