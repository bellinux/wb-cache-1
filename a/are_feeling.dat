This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife. In 2009, after some incidents leading {{to the death of}} wildfowl, the park's dogs-on-leads policy was extended. Park users are said to believe that the deer <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using the park and Royal Parks advises against walking dogs in the park during the deer's birthing season.|$|E

25|$|In 1997 former Tikkun editors accused Lerner of {{publishing}} pseudonymous {{letters to the}} editor that he himself had written. While many of the letters were laudatory ("Your editorial stand on Iraq said publicly what many of us in the Israeli peace camp <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> privately but dare not say."), a few were critical ("Have you gone off your rocker?"). Lerner admitted that he had written the letters but said his only mistake was not informing readers that the authors' names were pseudonyms.|$|E
25|$|Some {{consider}} that singing {{is not a}} natural process but is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others {{consider that}} some ways of singing {{can be considered as}} natural. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> while they are singing.|$|E
25|$|Another {{view is that}} a stutter (stammer) is {{a complex}} tic. This view is held for the {{following}} reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they <b>are</b> <b>feeling,</b> the more they like this outlet for their tension – an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds {{he has a new}} baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more cortisol than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive {{emotions}} and states {{tend to be}} felt {{in the initial stages}} of infidelity whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive {{emotions and}} responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them (Miller, 2017). Jealousy may become cognitive whenever an individual begins to process what their partner is out doing or what they see in the person they are cheating with that they don’t see in them. Resentment and the feeling of incompetence take on the cognitive state in the initial stages when the individual begins to recognize and feel that nothing they do or say will be good enough or just enough to get the infidelity suspicious to cease. Anger takes on cognitive emotional traits whenever the accuser notices and realizes why they <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> so angry and the accused is confronted with it. Like previously stated, the initial stages of cheating are when it cannot be proven by the suspicious partner. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have not been set forth, the emotions of infidelity enter a cognitive state.|$|E

"that {{one must}} utter magic words {{to go from}} {{possessing}} {{only one of these}} rights (to remain silent while interrogation takes place) to possessing the other right (to avoid interrogation altogether). Thus, the law of Miranda sets a trap for the unwary — the very people who <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> unable to assert themselves—to be subjected to interrogation until they are worn down and respond to questions." ...|$|E
500|$|Doubling: The {{job of the}} “double” is to make {{conscious}} {{any thoughts}} or feelings that another person is unable to express whether {{it is because of}} shyness, guilt, inhibition, politeness, fear, anger, etc. In many cases the person is unaware of these thoughts or at least is unable to form the words to express how they <b>are</b> <b>feeling.</b> [...] Therefore, the “Double” attempts to make conscious and give form to the unconscious and/or under expressed material. [...] The person being doubled has the full right to disown any of the “Double’s” statements and to correct them as necessary. [...] In this way, doubling itself can never be wrong.|$|E

500|$|Speaking to The Times in 1958, Cartier {{explained}} that television was still developing as a medium, and {{that part of}} his work was to help create the next generation of those who would produce television drama. [...] "The BBC is producing producers as well as plays. They <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> their way towards what television drama will one day be, and we are trying to create a generation of writers who study the medium." [...] His 1994 obituary in the same newspaper judged that he had been successful in creating a lasting influence on later producers, describing his 1962 production of the opera Carmen as [...] "an example and inspiration to a younger generation of television producers".|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Susan became {{involved}} with Tom Scully (Andrew Larkins), a Priest. Susan and Tom caused a scandal when they began a relationship. Television critic Andrew Mercado said that 2004 went down as [...] "a watershed year for controversy" [...] after Susan had sex with Tom. Woodburne told Jackie Brygel from TV Week {{that it was a}} [...] "very hot affair". Tom left the priesthood for Susan and she confessed her love for him. However, the relationship soon ended. Woodburne commented [...] "It becomes apparent to both of them that it is just not meant to be. They both reach a period in their life when they <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> low and lonely and aren't feeling very good about themselves. They just realise that there is no future." [...] Tom returned in 2007 and he became Principal of Erinsborough High. He told Susan that he never stopped loving her and wanted her back. However, by then she was back with Karl.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{have noted}} a resurgent {{interest}} from citizens in renewing their BNO passports as they <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> insecure {{in having a}} Hong Kong passport. Legal experts have become increasingly concerned at the reach of Chinese law enforcement. Jerome A. Cohen, expert in Chinese law at New York University, said China's increasing assertiveness in the world represents [...] "not only the extending reach of Chinese law, but the extending reach of Chinese lawlessness." [...] Willy Lam, professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, warned: [...] "Not just the publishing and media circles, but the entire Hong Kong society, including people who do business in [...] China, and who might have commercial disputes with Chinese companies or {{different parts of the}} Chinese government, might fear for their safety because of such a very dangerous precedent". [...] "Freedom from fear is {{a thing of the past}} for Hong Kong and this applies to everyone: businessmen or student," [...] said a spokesman for the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.|$|E

500|$|Tintin in Tibet is well {{received}} by critics from the comics and literary fields. Farr calls it [...] "exceptional in many respects, standing {{out among the}} twenty-three completed Tintin adventures... an assertion of the incorruptible value of bonds of friendship." [...] Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier laud it as [...] "the ultimate Tintin book", reaching [...] "a degree of perfection, both in its story and in its stunning art, that has rarely been equaled, before or since" [...] and [...] "arguably the best book in the series". They detail the story's many emotional moments: Haddock's willingness to sacrifice his life for Tintin's, Tharkey's return, the tearful reunion of Tintin and his starving friend Chang, the reverence paid to Tintin by the Grand Abbot and the monks, and the Yeti's sadness while watching the departure of his only friend. [...] "For a comic book to handle such powerful emotions, convey them to the readers, and make them feel what the characters <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> is a rare and precious achievement." [...] Thompson calls it [...] "a book of overwhelming whiteness and purity", saying that the [...] "intensely personal nature of the story made this Hergé's favourite Tintin adventure", adding that if readers wonder whether [...] "the enormous weight [...] lifted from Hergé's shoulders, [...] {{can be seen in}} his next book, The Castafiore Emerald, a masterpiece of relaxation." [...] As Tintin in Tibet was translated into 32 languages, Donald Lopez, professor of Buddhist and Tibetan studies, calls it the [...] "largest selling book about Tibet." ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{opened with}} Beastie Boys {{performing}} six of their songs for 30 minutes. They {{were accompanied by}} their DJ, Rick Rubin, who scratched the music, with The Beastie Boys prancing around the stage, making lewd gestures towards the audience. As they finished their performance, the backdrops started displaying Madonna's images from her music videos. The band—consisting of guitarists, bassists, a drummer and three synthesizer players—came into focus, and the music started. Madonna's voice was heard, saying: [...] "Don't be afraid... it's gonna be alright." [...] Then, Madonna's silhouette appeared behind a white screen {{on top of the}} stairs as the first beats kicked in. The white screen lifted and she is finally seen, wearing a psychedelic housecoat, a blue see-through crop-top and her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. She posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing [...] "Dress You Up". After dancing to the last note of the music, Madonna and the two male back-up dancers went {{to the back of the}} stage, as the music of [...] "Holiday" [...] began. Taking a moment to ask the audience how they <b>are</b> <b>feeling,</b> Madonna declared, [...] "I was never elected homecoming queen, but I sure feel like one now", and started the performance of [...] "Into the Groove", playing a tambourine. A boombox was present on the stage during the performance, Madonna sitting and playing with it, and addressing it as her [...] "box". She continued with [...] "Everybody", while asking the audience to clap along with her. As she finished the vigorous performance of [...] "Everybody", the lights were dimmed and the introduction music of [...] "Angel" [...] started. Rotating lights fell on the stage. Madonna appeared sitting on top of the stairs and gradually descended. During the intermediate bridge, she and her dancers moved energetically around the whole stage, as white balloons fell on them from above. Madonna continued singing as the lights were dimmed again. She finished the performance and disappeared behind the wings for a costume change.|$|E
