5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that <b>all</b> <b>fields</b> of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{geographic}} position, Croatia {{represents a}} blend of four different cultural spheres. It has been a crossroad of influences of the western culture and the east—ever since division of the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire—as {{well as of the}} Mitteleuropa and the Mediterranean culture. The Illyrian movement was the most significant period of national cultural history, as the 19th-century period proved crucial in emancipation of the Croatian language and saw unprecedented developments in <b>all</b> <b>fields</b> of art and culture, giving rise to a number of historical figures.|$|E

5|$|The Finns faced a {{detrimental}} {{interaction of}} power struggle and breakdown of society during 1917. The collapse of Russia induced {{a chain reaction}} of disintegration, starting from the government, military power and economy, and spreading downwards to <b>all</b> <b>fields</b> of the society such as local administration and workplaces, and finally {{to the level of}} individual citizens as changes and questions of freedom, responsibility and morality. The Social Democrats wanted to retain the civil rights achieved and increase socialists' power over the society. The conservatives feared to lose the long-held socioeconomic might. Both factions, with groups aiming at major supremacy, collaborated with the corresponding political forces in Russia, deepening the split in the nation.|$|E

Different schools had specific honor and professional societies as well: Phi Delta Phi for the law department, Phi Rho Sigma for medicine, Kappa Delta Mu for chemistry, and many others. A chapter of Theta Tau, an engineering society, was founded in 1923, and Trigon Engineering Society was founded in 1924 as a local fraternity for engineering students. Trigon and Theta Tau dominated student government in the Engineering School during this time, often fielding competing candidates for student office. Likewise in the College, the University Party and the Cavalier Party were dominated by Lambda Pi and Skull & Keys, two Greek organizations.|$|E
5|$|In 1883 Gaudí was put {{in charge}} of the {{recently}} initiated project to build a Barcelona church called Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família (Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family, or Sagrada Família). Gaudí completely changed the initial design and imbued it with his own distinctive style. From 1915 until his death he devoted himself entirely to this project. Given the number of commissions he began receiving, he had to rely on his team to work on multiple projects simultaneously. His team consisted of professionals from <b>all</b> <b>fields</b> of construction. Several of the architects who worked under him became prominent in the field later on, such as Josep Maria Jujol, Joan Rubió, Cèsar Martinell, Francesc Folguera and Josep Francesc Ràfols. In 1885, Gaudí moved to rural Sant Feliu de Codines to escape the cholera epidemic that was ravaging Barcelona. He lived in Francesc Ullar's house, for whom he designed a dinner table as a sign of his gratitude.|$|E
