5|$|Arsenic {{compounds}} such as {{sodium arsenite}} or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood {{but have been}} less frequently used due to their toxicity. Antimony trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide {{has been used as}} a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic <b>and</b> <b>textile</b> flame retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types. These employ boron, antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.|$|E

US fears that Syria was approaching a communist takeover had prompted an attempted CIA-sponsored coup to replace the Quwatli government with former president Shishakli. However, the coup plot was foiled by the head of Syrian intelligence, Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj, on 12 August and Syria consequently expelled the US military attaché from Damascus. The US, which denied the coup plot, responded by expelling the Syrian ambassador from Washington and recalling its ambassador from Syria.|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{framework}} proposed by Battese and Coelli (1995), we estimated the stochastic frontier production function for four Chinese industries: building materials, chemicals, machinery <b>and</b> <b>textiles</b> during 1990 – 1994.

We {{found no evidence of}} technological change in the building materials, chemicals <b>and</b> <b>textiles</b> industries <b>and</b> a neutral technological progress in the machinery industry. There was significant reduction of technical efficiency in the chemicals, machinery <b>and</b> <b>textiles</b> industries. As the result, chemicals <b>and</b> <b>textiles</b> experienced a negative TFP growth, whereas building materials and machinery display negligible TFP change.

5|$|The English {{settlers}} {{were attracted}} to the Darby Creek watershed due to the proximity to trading routes and productive landscape. In 1777, British soldiers breached dikes and floodwalls that were constructed on the creek. The Pennsylvania legislature passed an act in 1788 that mandated a maintenance of the dikes and the mowing of plants such as elderberries and pokeweed three times a year. Early English colonists utilized Darby Creek {{as a source of}} water power. Lumber, grist, <b>and</b> <b>textile</b> mills were established {{along the banks of the}} creek. Most of these mills have been demolished, although some of the tenement structures are currently in use as housing. At the end of the 19th century, industrial advances such as engine-driven machinery had made these mills obsolete.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern art}} {{movement}} in the country officially emerged in the 1950s, culminating {{in the establishment of}} an art society. Expressionism and surrealism, as well as calligraphic art are the popular forms of art in the country. Abstract expressionism has gained popularity in recent decades. Pottery-making <b>and</b> <b>textile</b> weaving are also popular products that were widely made in Bahraini villages. Arabic calligraphy grew in popularity as the Bahraini government was an active patron in Islamic art, culminating in the establishment of an Islamic museum, Beit Al Quran. The Bahrain national museum houses a permanent contemporary art exhibition. The architecture of Bahrain {{is similar to that of}} its neighbours in the Persian Gulf. The wind tower, which generates natural ventilation in a house, is a common sight on old buildings, particularly in the old districts of Manama and Muharraq.|$|E
5|$|The second kingdom's {{economy was}} based on both {{agriculture}} and trade. The economy was centralized and directed through a communal organization, where grains were stored in communal granaries, and distributed amongst the population according to social statues. The organization also controlled the animal herds in the kingdom. Some people were directly connected to the palace instead of the communal organization, those included the metal <b>and</b> <b>textile</b> producers and the military officials. Ebla was an important trading partner and rival, Mari's position made it an important trading center as it controlled the road linking between the Levant and Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|The boomtown of Chadderton {{reached its}} {{industrial}} zenith in the 1910s, with over 50cotton mills within the town limits. A social {{consequence of this}} industrial growth was a densely populated metropolitan landscape, home to an extensive and enlarged working class community living in an urban sprawl of low quality terraced houses. However, Chadderton developed an abundance of civic institutions including public street lighting, Carnegie library, public swimming baths and council with its own town hall. The development of the town meant that the district council made initial steps to petition the Crown for honorific borough status for Chadderton in the 1930s. However, the Great Depression, and the First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns <b>and</b> <b>textile</b> goods increased during the mid-20th century, Chadderton's textile sector declined to a halt; cotton spinning reduced dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s and by 1997 only two mills were operational. In spite of efforts {{to increase the efficiency}} and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton was spun in the town in 1998. Many of the redundant mills have now been demolished. Non-textile based industries continued on throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, particularly in the form of aircraft and chemical manufacture at plants in south Chadderton and Foxdenton respectively.|$|E
