50|$|<b>A</b> {{continuing}} <b>objection</b> is <b>an</b> <b>objection</b> to <b>a</b> {{series of}} questions about a related point. <b>A</b> continuing <b>objection</b> may be made, in {{the discretion of the}} court, to preserve an issue for appeal without distracting the factfinder (whether jury or judge) with <b>an</b> <b>objection</b> to every question. <b>A</b> continuing <b>objection</b> is made where the objection itself is overruled, but the trial judge permits the continuing objection to that point to be made silently so that there are fewer interruptions. An example of an instance where this is done is when a lawyer could be held negligent for not objecting to a particular line of questioning, yet has had his previous objections overruled.|$|R
