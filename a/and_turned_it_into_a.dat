5|$|In 1972, Walter Fiers and {{his team}} at the University of Ghent {{were the first to}} {{determine}} the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein. The subsequent development of chain-termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger improved the efficiency of sequencing <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> routine laboratory tool. An automated version of the Sanger method was used in early phases of the Human Genome Project.|$|E
5|$|The first Halo {{game was}} {{announced}} on July 21, 1999, during the Macworld Conference & Expo. It was originally {{planned to be}} a real-time strategy game for the Mac and Windows operating systems, but later changed into a third-person action game. On June 19, 2000, Microsoft acquired Bungie Studios and Halo: Combat Evolved became a launch title for the Xbox video game console. After receiving Xbox development kits, Bungie Studios rewrote the game's engine, heavily altered its presentation, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> first-person shooter. Though the first Halo was meant to include an online multiplayer mode, it was excluded because Xbox Live was not yet available.|$|E

5|$|An ardent {{supporter}} of the Kuomintang, Lee was involved in secret meetings with Sun Yat-Sen at the Wan Qing Yuan, a two-storey villa at Tai Gin Road. He also helped the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia raise funds to support the Kuomintang in their struggles against the Empire of Japan and Communist Party of China. In 1937, Lee and five other Chinese community leaders bought the Wan Qing Yuan to preserve it as a historical site; it was later {{handed over to the}} Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI), which renovated it <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> national monument, the Sun Yat Sen Villa (now Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall).|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} his Bond books, Fleming used events or names from his life in his writing. In the 1930s, Fleming often visited Kitzbühel in Austria to ski; he once {{deliberately}} set off down a slope that had been closed because {{of the danger of}} an avalanche. The snow cracked behind him and an avalanche came down, catching him at its end: Fleming remembered the incident and it was used for Bond's escape from Piz Gloria. Fleming would occasionally stay at the sports club of Schloss Mittersill in the Austrian Alps; in 1940 the Nazis closed down the club <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> research establishment examining the Asiatic races. It was this pseudo-scientific research centre that inspired Blofeld's own centre of Piz Gloria.|$|E

25|$|Serb forces set up camps where rapes occurred, such {{as those}} at Keraterm, Vilina Vlas, Manjača, Omarska, Trnopolje, Uzamnica and Vojno. In May 1992, Serb villagers from Snagovo, Zvornik, {{surrounded}} and captured the village of Liplje <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> concentration camp. Four-hundred people were imprisoned in a few houses and those held there were subject to rape, torture and murder.|$|E

25|$|One {{of these}} {{companies}} was the Bendix Corporation, who found the Dashaveyor concept and decided {{it would make the}} basis for a competitive AGT system. Its main advantages in this role were its high speed and its ability to switch among a network of tracks. Most competing AGT systems operated at a fixed speed that was much lower than the Dashaveyor, and normally followed fixed routes. They purchased the company <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> subsidiary, developing the AGT versions in Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|E

Shortly, before the Byzantines took the area back, the Persians gave control to the Christian population, who tore down the partly built edifice, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> garbage dump, which is what it was when the Caliph Omar took the city in the 630s.|$|E
25|$|No {{matter how}} we view it, {{it remains a}} fact that we charged a non-English-speaking alien with {{criminal}} tax evasion on the first tax returns he filed in this country. It appears that we didn't give him a fair chance to understand our laws. We didn't seek a civil penalty as an initial means of redress. We didn't give {{him the benefit of}} any doubt. Rather, we took a novel theory of tax liability of less than $10,000 <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> guilty verdict and eighteen months in a federal prison.|$|E
25|$|Landschulheim Herrlingen was {{not officially}} closed, but was instead {{was turned over}} to Hugo Rosenthal (1887–1980). Although it was seized by the Nazis in 1934, it {{continued}} as a Jewish school and became a centre for Jewish life in southern Germany until 1939, when the Nazis closed it <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> home for Jewish seniors, whom they forced to relocate there from various places in Württemberg. In 1942, the home was closed and its residents sent to extermination camps. Between 1943 and 1945, two of the buildings were occupied by Erwin Rommel and his family. When Rommel was forced to commit suicide, he left from this home.|$|E

25|$|In 610, the Sassanid Empire {{drove the}} Byzantine Empire {{out of the}} Middle East, giving the Jews control of Jerusalem {{for the first time}} in centuries. The Jews in Palestine were allowed to set up a vassal state under the Sassanid Empire called the Sassanid Jewish Commonwealth which lasted for five years. Jewish rabbis ordered the restart of animal {{sacrifice}} for the first time since the time of Second Temple and started to reconstruct the Jewish Temple. Shortly before the Byzantines took the area back five years later in 615, the Persians gave control to the Christian population, who tore down the partially built Jewish Temple edifice <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> garbage dump, which is what it was when the Rashidun Caliph Umar took the city in 637.|$|E
25|$|The Abu Ghraib {{prison in}} the town of Abu Ghraib {{was one of the most}} notorious prisons in Iraq during the {{government}} of Saddam Hussein. The prison was used to hold approximately 50,000 men and women in poor conditions, and torture and execution were frequent. The prison was located on 280 acres of land 32 kilometers west of Baghdad. After the collapse of Saddam Hussein's government, the prison was looted and everything that was removable was carried away. Following the invasion, the U.S. army refurbished it <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> military prison. It was the largest of several detention centers in Iraq used by the U.S. military. In March 2004, during the time that the U.S. military was using the Abu Ghraib prison as a detention facility, it housed approximately 7,490 prisoners.|$|E
25|$|The {{top half}} of tRNA (consisting of the D arm and the {{acceptor}} stem with 5'-terminal phosphate group and 3'-terminal CCA group) and the bottom half (consisting of the T arm and the anticodon arm) are independent units in structure {{as well as in}} function. The top half may have evolved first including the 3'-terminal genomic tag which originally may have marked tRNA-like molecules for replication in early RNA world. The bottom half may have evolved later as an expansion, e. g. as protein synthesis started in RNA world <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> (ribonucleoprotein world (RNP world). This proposed scenario is called genomic tag hypothesis. In fact, tRNA and tRNA-like aggregates have an important catalytic influence (i. e. as ribozymes) on replication still today. These roles may be regarded as 'molecular (or chemical) fossiles' of RNA world.|$|E
