This study {{is divided into three}} parts. In the first part, some controlling parameters like, that were affecting size and shape of CeO 2 nanoparticles, were studied. It was found that size of CeO 2 nanoparticles increased when increasing both reaction time and temperature. <b>Alkali</b> <b>base</b> concentration promoted the particle growth. Also, particle morphology was more uniform rather than aggregated in presence of higher concentrated <b>alkali</b> <b>base.</b> When the <b>alkali</b> <b>base</b> type was changed, the use of NaOH produced larger cubic nanocrystals of CeO 2 than KOH and LiOH. Second part is related to determine the optical properties of CeO 2 nanoparticles. Based on the UV-Vis and Fluorescence Spectroscopy results, size, bandgap and defect level of CeO 2 nanoparticles can be easily determined. Nanoparticles in presence of NaOH <b>alkali</b> <b>base</b> were found to produce less defective CeO 2 nanoparticles as compared to KOH and LiOH. The last part of this work is to evaluate the shape effect on morphology, size and optical properties of CeO 2 nanoparticles.

40|$|THE {{potential}} role of inorganic and organometallic silicon {{compounds in}} the development of new chemical reagents, polymers, glasses and ceramics 1 is limited at present by the paucity of simple silicon-containing starting materials. Whereas industrial carbon-based chemistry can draw on the diversity of compounds produced from crude oil, coal or other natural sources, silicon chemistry 2 relies almost exclusively on the carbothermal reduction of SiO 2 to silicon. This is then transformed into feedstock chemicals by reaction with HCl, or by routes such as the 'direct process' for making methylchlorosilanes 2, in which silicon is reacted with methyl chloride at 200 - 350 -degrees-C over a copper/tin catalyst. Organosilicon compounds are in demand in fields ranging from organic synthesis to ceramics to the electronics industry. New synthetic routes to these materials are therefore highly desirable, especially if they rely on low-cost SiO 2 and on processing methods that avoid the energy-intensive and equipment-intensive carbothermal reduction step which currently precedes almost all silicon chemistry. Here we describe a direct process in which SiO 2 is reacted with ethylene glycol and an <b>alkali</b> <b>base</b> to produce highly reactive, pentacoordinate silicates which provide access {{to a wide variety of}} new silicon compounds...|$|E

The observed structure of the compact layer is almost independent {{of the size of}} the particles and the concentration of <b>alkali</b> <b>base</b> in the sol; it can be described by a two-layer model, that is, a 6 - 8 -Å-thick layer of directly adsorbed hydrated alkali ions with a surface concentration of 3 1018 m- 2, and a 13 -Å-thick layer with a surface concentration of sodium ions of 8 1018 m- 2. In cesium-enriched sols, Cs+ ions preferentially adsorb in the first layer replacing Na+; their density in the second layer does not depend on the presence of cesium in the sol.
