We begin by considering what is meant by the idea of a “paradigm” from Thomas Kuhn.

The new paradigm and three interconnected theoretical approaches are set out, before turning {{to assess the impact of}} the new paradigm upon emerging fields of social science by using various quantitative and qualitative measures. We examine the transformed ecology of this significant emergent field. Finally, the article explores the paradigm’s important relevance for applied research in urban transportation, climate change and energy transitions...|$|R

Second, non-defaulting firms with a weak bank did not have a lower return on assets during the financial crisis 2008 - 09 than comparable firms with a sound bank. Taken together, these results may indicate the presence of heterogeneous effects of having a weak bank with significant negative effects on the economic performance for some firms but insignificant effects for the broad mass of firms...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} {{the mirror of}} the Beauville manifold. The Beauville manifold is a Calabi-Yau manifold with non-abelian fundamental group. We use the conjecture of Batyrev and Borisov to find the previously misidentified mirror of its universal covering space, P 7 [2, 2, 2, 2]. The monomial-divisor mirror map is essential in identifying how the fundamental group of the Beauville manifold acts on the mirror of P 7 [2, 2, 2, 2]. Once we find the mirror of the Beauville manifold, we confirm {{the existence of the}} threshold bound state around the conifold point, which was originally conjectured in [1]. We also consider how the quantum symmetry group acts on the D-branes that become massless at the conifold point and show the action proposed in [2] is compatible with mirror symmetry. In the last one and <b>a</b> half <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> there has been great progress in understanding the non-perturbative aspects of string theory.

25|$|Also in 1969 {{computer}} scientist Alvy Ray Smith completed a Stanford PhD dissertation on Cellular Automata Theory, the first mathematical treatment of CA {{as a general}} class of computers. Many papers came from this dissertation: He showed the equivalence of neighborhoods of various shapes, how to reduce a Moore to a von Neumann neighborhood or how to reduce any neighborhood to a von Neumann neighborhood. He proved that two-dimensional CA are computation universal, introduced 1-dimensional CA, and showed that they too are computation universal, even with simple neighborhoods. He showed how to subsume the complex von Neumann proof of construction universality (and hence self-reproducing machines) into a consequence of computation universality in a 1-dimensional CA.

25|$|In {{various forms}} {{the game has}} been played since the early 20th Century in Canada as a {{recreational}} sport, especially in high school gymnasiums, as a playful variant of hockey, where the sticks got their form from the hockey game bandy. Most Canadian males born in the 1950s and before could attest to this. Similarly, during the 1950s and 1960s many public school systems within Michigan incorporated floorball into their primary and secondary school gym classes. Later, Americans claimed to have invented it, and held interstate tournaments in the 1960s. The game was formally organized as an international and more organised sport in the late 1970s in Gothenburg, Sweden. The sport began as something that was played for fun as a pastime in schools. After <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> floorball began showing up in Nordic countries where the former schoolyard pastime was becoming a developed sport. Formal rules soon were developed, and clubs began to form. After some time, several countries developed national associations, and the IFF was founded in 1986.|$|E

40|$|The climate record kept in ice and in {{sediment}} {{reveals that}} since the invention of agriculture some 8000 yr ago, climate has remained remarkably stable. By contrast, during the preceding 100, 000 yr, climate underwent frequent, very large, and often extremely abrupt shifts. Furthermore, these shifts occurred in lockstep across the globe. They seem to be telling us that Earth's climate system has several distinct and quite different modes of operation and that it can jump from one of these modes to another {{in a matter of}} <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> two. <b>So</b> far, we know of only one element of the climate system which has multiple modes of operation: the oceans' thermohaline circulation. Numerous model simulations reveal that this circulation is quite sensitive to the freshwater budget in the high-latitude regions where deep waters form. Perhaps the mode shifts revealed in the climate record were initiated in the sea. This discovery complicates predictions of the consequences of the ongoing buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If the major climate changes of glacial time came as the result of mode shifts, can we be certain that the warming will proceed smoothly? Or is it possible that about 100 years from now, when our descendants struggle to feed the 15 <b>or</b> <b>so</b> billion Earth inhabitants, climate will jump to a less hospitable state.

Dueling and the carrying of arms is a socially accepted way of maintaining civility in public; a man can wear distinctive clothing to show his unwillingness to duel, but this results in an inferior social status. The world has become an economic utopia; the [...] "economic dividend" [...] is so high that work has become optional.

5000|$|Among {{the first}} revolutionary organisations founded with an {{organised}} programme in Bengal was that led by Jatindranath Bannerjee and Aurobindo Ghosh. Ghosh was {{the grandson of}} leading Bengali reformer, Rajnarayan Bose. Schooled at St. Paul's {{and a graduate of}} King's College, Cambridge, Ghosh returned to India in 1893, undertaking a short career in political journalism in Bombay. He criticised the Congress's elitist politics which he argued was confined to the middle-class and effectively ignored the Indian masses of the lower classes. For Ghosh, the discussions engaged by the Congress members were frivolous, he argued for a radical and revolutionary movement for achieve political goals. Under pressure to tone down his criticisms, Ghosh withdrew from his writings altogether, which held for <b>a</b> good <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> In 1897, Aurobindo Ghosh took up the position of lecturer in French at Baroda College and was appointed acting Professor of English at the college in 1898. In 1899, Ghosh met Jatindranath Bannerjee. Both Bannerjee and Ghosh were members of a Bombay secret society that B.G. Tilak was associated with. Both Ghosh and Tilak shared thoughts on a program of revolution. Both envisioned an organised and disciplined uprising different from the terrorist tactics favoured by secret societies. Ghosh's thoughts were turned towards a military insurrection through Guerrilla warfare, aided by general revolt and popular resistance to which, if possible, the Indian Army was to be drawn in revolt. The grounding of such a program was to be [...] "revolutionary propaganda and recruiting" [...] and young Bengalees were to be trained in activities that would be helpful when the moment came. Ghosh emphasised activities riding, physical training, athletics of various kinds, drill and organized movement. He foresaw the program occupying up to thirty years before India was ready to rise. With the help of Tilak and some two others associates of the names Khasi Rao Jadav and Madhav Rao, Ghosh was, in September 1899, able to arrange for Jatindranath Bannerjee to enrol in the armed forces of the Princely State of Baroda with false papers. Tilak himself tried to arrange for Madhav Rao to obtain admission to a Russian military school, and ultimately was able to get him admitted to the Swiss Military Academy at Bern. Ghosh had worked close to the Gaekwar of Baroda, and in 1902, he establish contacts with men with similar views in Western India.|$|R

Tom Holland writes [...] "What added incomparably to his prestige, was that his earth-shaking qualities as a generalissimo were combined with the most distinctive cast of virtues. Rather than ape the manner of a Caesar, as the Ghassanid kings had done, he drew on the example of a quite different kind of Christian. Umar's threadbare robes, his diet of bread, salt and water, and his rejection of worldly riches would have reminded anyone from the desert reaches beyond Palestine of a very particular kind of person. Monks out in the Judaean desert had long been casting themselves as warriors of God. The achievement of Umar was to take such language to a literal and previously unimaginable extreme." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{around the}} start of the 19th century, ideas such as Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's concept of {{transmutation}} of species had gained supporters in Paris and Edinburgh, mostly amongst anatomists. The anonymous publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1844 aroused wide public interest with support from Quakers and Unitarians, but was strongly criticised by the religious establishment and the scientific community, which called for solidly backed science. In 1859, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species provided that evidence from an authoritative and respected source, and within <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> convinced scientists that evolution occurs.

2500|$|It is {{the only}} ancient Egyptian city which {{preserves}} great details of its internal plan, {{in large part because}} the city was abandoned after the death of Akhenaten, when Akhenaten's son, King Tutankhamun, decided to leave the city and return to his birthplace in Thebes (modern Luxor).

2500|$|Entrepreneurs set up {{shops and}} {{businesses}} {{to cater to}} the miners. World-famous were the houses of prostitution found in every mining camp worldwide. Prostitution was a growth industry attracting sex workers from around the globe, pulled in by the money, despite the harsh and dangerous working conditions and low prestige. Chinese women were frequently sold by their families and taken to the camps as prostitutes; they had to send their earnings back to the family in China. In Virginia City, Nevada, a prostitute, Julia Bulette, {{was one of the}} few who achieved [...] "respectable" [...] status. She nursed victims of an influenza epidemic; this gave her acceptance in the community and the support of the sheriff. The townspeople were shocked when she was murdered in 1867; they gave her a lavish funeral and speedily tried and hanged her assailant. Until the 1890s, madams predominately ran the businesses, after which male pimps took over, and the treatment of the women generally declined. It was not uncommon for bordellos in Western towns to operate openly, without the stigma of East Coast cities. Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns, and only later―as the female population increased, reformers moved in, and other civilizing influences arrived―did prostitution become less blatant and less common.

2500|$|The {{funding of}} {{renewable}} energy (RE) projects {{is dependent on the}} credibility of the institutions developing and implementing RE policy. [...] This places a particular burden on the energy regulators in Africa—whose professional staff may be few in number and who have track records of only <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> [...] Rules (micro policies) made by regulators are subsidiary to overall government RE policy and depend on some delegation of authority from the state. [...] Nevertheless, there are instances when the sector regulator can pro-active on behalf of customer and utility concerns—providing facts, reports, and public statements that build a case for care in the design of public policy towards RE. Clean and renewable energy is likely to be of concern to a number of organizations. Interaction between multiple authorities requires coordination to align policies, incentives, and administrative processes (including licensing and permitting). [...] Of course, the making of policy by regulators is incidental to and inherent in their duty to decide specific cases or disputes. This micro policy making role is derived from the fact that macro RE policy cannot reasonably be expected to anticipate all aspects of policy that will have to evolve for the regulatory process to be fully functional. This point is particularly important in the area {{of renewable energy}}, with its rapidly changing technologies and ever-changing public (and political) attitudes. [...] Gaps will have to be filled and it is the regulators, with their functional responsibilities, technical expertise, and hands-on experience that are best positioned to accomplish that task in developing countries.
