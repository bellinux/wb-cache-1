In its report The Intercept the author details the flawed methods which are used to locate targets for lethal drone strikes, resulting {{in the deaths of}} innocent people. According to the Washington Post NSA analysts and collectors i.e. NSA personnel who control electronic surveillance equipment use the NSA's sophisticated surveillance capabilities to track individual targets geographically and in real time, while drones and tactical units aimed their weaponry against those targets to take them out.|$|E
25|$|The {{determinants}} of job performance consist of factors {{having to do}} with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance, job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of what needs to be done <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen). The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.|$|E

To portray Sanchez, Davi researched the Colombian drug cartels <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a Colombian accent, and since he was method acting, he would stay in character off-set. After Davi read Casino Royale for preparation, he decided to turn Sanchez into a [...] "mirror image" [...] of James Bond, based on Ian Fleming's descriptions of Le Chiffre. The actor also learned scuba diving for the scene where Sanchez is rescued from the sunken armoured car.|$|E

500|$|While {{brainstorming}} {{for ideas}} to the game's plot, Sakamoto decided to create an original story instead of remaking a Metroid game because he [...] "always [...] to do something really unprecedented, something people have never played before". He continued, saying, [...] "Many of our designers and creators want to challenge something new rather than simply porting over an old title. That's something I hope we'll always do. If you can challenge something new, you {{can look forward to}} the public response, be it good or bad." [...] The game introduces gameplay mechanics that are new to the Metroid series. Metroid Fusion offers a more direct, almost mission-based structure that supports the player to explore areas. Objectives are also flexible in how they can be completed, acting [...] "more as a guide for what the player should do instead of giving a completely blank map and saying 'Here you go, {{figure out what to do}} <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.|$|E

2500|$|Leadership and {{communication}} are constantly growing together, being intertwined {{into one another}} to help develop an organization. To be an effective leader, communication has to be defined in the organization {{for it to be}} successful. Gary Yukl defines leadership as, [...] "the process of influencing others to understand and agree about {{what needs to be done}} <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, and the process of facilitating individual and collective efforts to accomplish shared objectives". To accomplish shared objectives, communication has to be a transactional process that allows for a constant cycle of information to be sent from source/receiver and vice versa. As leaders continue to send and receive information, building relationships with the followers allows for a bond to be made. Through the bond being made it allows for the followers to share their values, and thoughts for example; this gives them a sense of affiliation because the leader is being concerned about his/her employees. Once an organization is able to define leadership {{and communication}}, it can begin to advance to the structure of the organization.|$|E
