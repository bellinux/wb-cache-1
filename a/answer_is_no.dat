2500|$|Modern {{scholarship}} remains {{divided on}} Stuart's culpability. Edward G. Longacre argues that Lee deliberately gave Stuart wide discretion in his orders {{and had no}} complaints about Stuart's tardy arrival at Gettysburg because he established no date by which the cavalry was required to link up with Ewell. The 3½ brigades of cavalry left with the main army were adequate for Lee to negotiate enemy territory safely and that his choice not to use these brigades effectively cannot be blamed on Stuart. Edwin B. Coddington refers to the [...] "tragedy" [...] of Stuart in the Gettysburg Campaign and judges that when Fitzhugh Lee {{raised the question of}} [...] "whether Stuart exercised the discretion undoubtedly given to him, judiciously," [...] the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>no.</b> Nevertheless, replying to historians who maintain that Stuart's absence permitted Lee to be surprised at Gettysburg, Coddington points out that the Union commander, Maj. Gen. George Meade, was just as surprised, and the initial advantage lay with Lee. Eric J. Wittenberg and J. David Petruzzi have concluded that there was [...] "plenty of blame to go around" [...] and the fault should be divided between Stuart, the lack of specificity in Lee's orders, and Richard S. Ewell, who might have tried harder to link up with Stuart northeast of Gettysburg. Jeffry D. Wert acknowledges that Lee, his officers, and fighting by the Army of the Potomac bear the responsibility for the Confederate loss at Gettysburg, but states that [...] "Stuart failed Lee and the army in the reckoning at Gettysburg. ...

2500|$|Picasso in {{choosing}} his subject matter {{with the intention}} of creating a new visual language as addressed by Barr that [...] "The Demoiselles is a transitional picture, a laboratory or, better, a battlefield of trial and experience; {{but it is also a}} work of formidable, dynamic power unsurpassed in European art of its time" [...] Did the work have to be a representation of whores? Couldn’t the Proto-Cubist effects previously described have been accomplished just as easily with a cast of card players?” [...] According to various critical sources such as Steinberg, Chave, Mullins, Rubins and other critics of Les Demoiselles the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>no.</b> They had to be whores. If the viewer is able to fully understand the disquieting effect created by Picasso in their viewing of the work, this reshaping of power could only have been accomplished by the role of Woman or as labelled by Edwin Mullins; Man-Eaters. This is due to the entity of Woman existing as the symbolic embodiment of the natural world in its beauty and ferocity to exist in contrast and outside of the hegemonic structures created by man. As such, a picture of a dangerous woman is powerful because it is the icon of a man’s innermost terrors.” As, Woman is a creature which threatens to usurp the power and control of her male counterpart through the employment of her sex; described by Freud as Castration Anxiety. The anxiety present in Les Demoiselles presumes as virtually every critic who has addressed Les Demoiselles the picture's intended viewer is male and heterosexual. As conventionally, both the act of painting and that of viewing have been described as phallic acts, acts of penetration performed on that passive receptacle, the blank field of the canvas and the critic Jean Clair once pithily proclaimed, [...] "The gaze is the erection of the eye."' Such metaphors and the general conceit of penetration as a trope for knowing implicitly exclude the female artist and viewer, as such and from a masculinist vantage point, the work would be read as a horror story, but from a feminist one it could be, to the contrary, a fable or even a good omen of vengeance won against male tyranny.|$|E

Inside is a T-1001 and one of the crew members, a woman, points her gun at it. The T-1001 kills her and takes her form, then shakes its finger at the rest of the crew. Queeg kills a crewman after he beat on Jesse. Jesse does not trust Queeg so she relieves him of command. Queeg does not obey her orders so she terminates him and destroys the submarine in an attempt to kill the T-1001. On her way out, she encounters the T-1001 and it tells her, [...] "the answer is no." [...] In 2007, she is on a possibly self-imposed mission to find and stop Cameron from adversely influencing young John, by recruiting Riley Dawson in the future and bringing her back to frame Cameron for her murder. In the future from which Jesse comes, John has withdrawn from humans and speaks only with Cameron. It is unclear whether this mission is self-appointed, but comments by her and the fact she was able to access the time travel machinery with Riley suggests others in the Resistance leadership group may share her concerns about Cameron's influence on John. John Connor later figures out that Jesse killed Riley and informs Derek, but orders her life to be spared. Derek confronts Jesse. He tells her that they are from two different futures and that he doesn't know who she is. He tells her, [...] "John Connor wanted to let you go. I'm not John Connor."

[...] This could either mean that he obeyed John Connor's order or since he is not John Connor, he didn't want to let her go and he shot her. Later on in a flashback, Cameron is seen talking to Jesse. Cameron tells her that she is sorry for her loss. She says that the pressure from leaving the submarine killed her baby, she was pregnant with Derek's baby.
