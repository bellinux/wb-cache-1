40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} delay time {{estimation}} in biological systems is addressed with {{the focus on}} practical <b>applicability</b> <b>of</b> <b>methods.</b> Four delay time estimators are described: a cross correlation method and three increasingly sophisticated interpretations of the phase spectrum, ranging from a pointwise interpretation of the phase spectrum {{in terms of a}} delay to a Hilbert transform method. The four methods are compared through simulation studies showing that, in general, the Hilbert transform method performs best. The methods are then used to estimate delay times in three physiological systems: vestibular stimulation, cerebral autoregulation, and human orthostatic tremor. In all three cases, the Hilbert transform method yields the best results, leading in some cases to physiologically more sensible interpretations of experiments than the other methods...|$|E

40|$|Unexpected shocks on wind-tunnel-measured {{pressure}} signatures prompted {{questions about}} design methods, pressure signature measurement techniques, {{and the quality}} of measurements in the flow fields near lifting models. Some of these unexpected shocks were the result of component integration methods.

This report discusses the low-boom model wind-tunnel data where these unexpected shocks were initially observed, the physics of the lifting wing/body model's flow field, the wind-tunnel data used to evaluate the <b>applicability</b> <b>of</b> <b>methods</b> for calculating equivalent areas due to lift, the performance of lift prediction codes, and tip stall effects so that the cause of these shocks could be determined...|$|E
