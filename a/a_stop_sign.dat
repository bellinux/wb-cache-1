5|$|At {{the western}} end of the tunnel, Highway58 emerges as a divided highway in Thorold. It meets an {{interchange}} with Pine Street; the eastbound on-ramp from Pine Street features <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> and no merging lane prior to entering the Thorold Tunnel. West of Pine Street, the route passes beneath a Trillium Railway line and curves slightly southwest. It encounters an interchange with Collier Street, gradually curving to the northwest and passing beneath Richmond Street. Highway58 ends at a complicated interchange with both St. Davids Road as well as Highway406 {{on the edge of the}} Niagara Escarpment.|$|E
5|$|SR 11 {{continues}} {{north toward}} Ashtabula, meeting interchanges for SR 82 and an access {{road to the}} Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport. Urban areas transition back into rural areas here. It later intersects SR 305 and SR 5 at diamond interchanges near Cortland. The route then enters Ashtabula County, and travels in a straight line, passing through US 322, a rest area, US 6, and SR 307. Mostly forests and fields are between the highway. The route slowly bends northwest, and meets I-90 at a cloverleaf interchange. The route crosses over Ashtabula River, and bypasses Ashtabula. It ends at SR 531, part of the Lake Erie Circle Tour, at <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|E

5|$|Mulder goes {{to visit}} Madame Zirinka again, who {{tells him that}} the planets come into {{alignment}} like this only once every 84 years, and additional alignments will cause anyone born on January 12, 1979 (Margi and Terri's birthdate) {{to have all the}} energy in the cosmos focused on them. Margi goes to see Scott alone but an angry Terri arrives. The two argue with each other and end up accidentally killing Scott. Margi goes to Mulder, telling him that Terri is responsible for the murders, while Terri goes to see Scully and tells her the opposite. The agents call each other and bring both girls to the police station, where the place starts shaking and all the guns go off on their own. Mulder locks the girls in a room together and their power goes away once the clock ticks midnight. When the town mob and Detective White finally see Terri and Margi as the culprits, Spitz claims it was the work of Satan, oblivious to the cosmic alignment's energy. Mulder and Scully drive home, arguing again over directions; when Scully defiantly runs <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign,</b> Mulder notifies her but she tells him to shut up, which he does.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> is {{a traffic}} sign, usually erected at road {{junctions}} {{such as a}} four-way intersection, that instructs drivers to stop and then to proceed only if the way ahead is clear. The idea of placing stop signs at road junctions was first conceived in 1890 when William Phelps Eno of Saugatuck, Connecticut proposed and devised {{the first set of}} traffic laws in an article published in Rider and Driver. However, the first use of stop signs did not appear until 1915 when officials in Detroit, Michigan installed <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> with black letters on a white background. Throughout the years and with many alterations made to the stop sign, the current version with white block-lettering on a red background that is used in the United States as well as emulated in many other countries around the world today, did not come into use until the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted the design in 1975.|$|E

25|$|In August, 2015, San Francisco Supervisor John Avalos {{announced}} plans to introduce an ordinance that would set a “San Francisco Right-of-Way Policy” that would make citations for bicyclists who safely yield at stop signs the lowest law enforcement priority. Running <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> would still be illegal, but the police would be discouraged from enforcing it, making this a proxy for a stop-as-yield law. The bill was passed in an initial vote by the Board of Supervisors on December 16, 2015. However, on January 20, 2016, the Mayor vetoed the bill.|$|E
25|$|Laws and {{regulations}} regarding how drivers {{must comply with}} <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> vary by jurisdiction. In the United States and Canada, these rules are set and enforced at the state or provincial level. At a junction where two or more traffic directions are controlled by stop signs, generally the driver who arrives and stops first continues first. If two or three drivers in different directions stop simultaneously at a junction controlled by stop signs, generally the drivers on the left must yield the right-of-way to the driver on the far right.|$|E

25|$|About 5:38am EST, while {{operating}} the motorcoach southbound in a left-hand HOV lane of I-75 in the Atlanta metropolitan area, the driver accidentally entered a left exit ramp, which ended abruptly at an elevated T-junction marked by <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign.</b> When {{it reached the}} top of the ramp and the stop sign, the bus was traveling at highway speed. The driver lost control of the bus, which slid sideways into a concrete bridge wall and chain-link security fence, then fell 19 feet, landing on its left side across the interstate highway below. Twenty-nine passengers survived the crash, while seven occupants were killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Walden has noted, in its 2005 Comprehensive Plan, the {{difficulties}} {{created by the}} oblique intersection at {{the eastern end of}} the Route208 concurrency. Traffic on northbound 208 comes to <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> at the intersection, where 52 comes in from the right at a slightly lower grade and a sharp angle, with the view mostly blocked by a building. It is also just opposite one of two curb cuts for a busy ]. At rush hour, the traffic light at the nearby northern end often backs cars up along 52 for some distance, making the turn into the gas station difficult, especially when vehicles on 52 make the left turn into the curb cut.|$|E
25|$|In September 1991 {{construction}} {{began on}} a project to improve the circle. The project included an overpass that allows Route 202 to bypass the circle, and the inclusion of traffic signals. The project was completed in 1994. In {{the year after the}} overpass opened the circle saw 302 traffic accidents. In an attempt to lower the accident rate the New Jersey Department of Transportation installed yield ahead signs for approaching vehicles in February 1995. The signs made little difference and the accident rate remained high. Another attempt to make the circle safer came in November when the Transportation Department painted lane lines and arrows on the roads and replaced a yield sign with <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign.</b> The new changes resulted in fewer accidents.|$|E

25|$|Nest {{structure}} can {{consist of}} numerous cells, with some nests containing {{as many as}} 500 cells. These nests are constructed from a mix of oral secretions and plant fibers to make a paper pulp. Bigger nests are more commonly found in southern regions. For example, a study of two wasp nests in Cambridge, Massachusetts, found a nest constructed inside <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> pole that was 8cm high and 5cm wide and consisted of 134 cells. A second nest, that contained 153 cells within the same nest dimensions, was found suspended from a pipe. The nests of P. gallicus tend to be smaller than those of comparative Polistes. Nest size also depends on the location, with nests in more sheltered areas tending to be larger.|$|E

500|$|On December 31, 2008, Barkley {{was pulled}} over in Scottsdale, Arizona, for {{initially}} running <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign.</b> Officer smelled alcohol on Barkley's breath {{and proceeded to}} administer field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested on drunk driving charges and had his vehicle impounded. Barkley refused to submit a breath test and was given a blood test. He was then cited and released. Gilbert police noted Barkley was cooperative and respectful during the entire incident, adding that he was treated no differently than anyone arrested on DUI charges. The police report of the incident stated that Barkley told police {{he was in a}} hurry to receive oral sex from his female passenger when he ran through <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> early Wednesday. Test results released by police showed that Barkley had a blood-alcohol level at [...]149, nearly twice the legal limit of [...]08 in Arizona. Two months after his arrest, Barkley pleaded guilty to two DUI-related counts and one count of running a red light. He was sentenced to ten days in jail and fined $2,000.
