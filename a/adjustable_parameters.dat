25|$|Thirty {{years ago}} there was neither real {{predictability}} nor qualitative understanding of the dominant mechanisms in emulsion polymerisation. Mechanisms had been ‘proved’ by comparing model predictions with experimental data. The data field was limited and the models had many <b>adjustable</b> <b>parameters,</b> or else fitting parameters had values that were subject to wide uncertainty: {{it was possible to}} choose values that could suit any model. It was not uncommon to find two papers claiming that quite different mechanisms were dominant in the same system, a result {{of not being able to}} isolate the individual steps. As a result of Gilbert’s work, all individual processes in emulsion polymerisation, one of the commonest ways of making everyday products, are now qualitatively and quantitatively understood. It is now possible to polymerise simple systems and to predict the molecular architecture that will be formed under chosen conditions, while for more complex conditions, trends can be semiquantitatively predicted and understood. The international scientific and technical community in this field now uses the mechanistic knowledge that he obtained as the key to understanding current processes and creating new processes and products. His work has put this industrially important field on a rigorous scientific footing.|$|E
25|$|Early {{tests of}} general {{relativity}} were hampered {{by the lack of}} viable competitors to the theory: it was not clear what sorts of tests would distinguish it from its competitors. General relativity was the only known relativistic theory of gravity compatible with special relativity and observations. Moreover, it is an extremely simple and elegant theory. This changed with the introduction of Brans–Dicke theory in 1960. This theory is arguably simpler, as it contains no dimensionful constants, and is compatible with a version of Mach's principle and Dirac's large numbers hypothesis, two philosophical ideas which have been influential in the history of relativity. Ultimately, this {{led to the development of}} the parametrized post-Newtonian formalism by Nordtvedt and Will, which parametrizes, in terms of ten <b>adjustable</b> <b>parameters,</b> all the possible departures from Newton's law of universal gravitation to first order in the velocity of moving objects (i.e. to first order in , where v is the velocity of an object and c is the speed of light). This approximation allows the possible deviations from general relativity, for slowly moving objects in weak gravitational fields, to be systematically analyzed. Much effort has been put into constraining the post-Newtonian parameters, and deviations from general relativity are at present severely limited.|$|E

2500|$|The precise {{formulation}} of the idea is made difficult {{by the fact that}} physicists do not yet know how many independent physical constants there are. The current standard model of particle physics has 25 freely <b>adjustable</b> <b>parameters</b> with an additional parameter, the cosmological constant, for gravitation. However, because the standard model is not mathematically self-consistent under certain conditions (e.g., at very high energies, at which both quantum mechanics and general relativity are relevant), physicists believe that it is underlaid by some other theory, such as a grand unified theory, string theory, or loop quantum gravity. In some candidate theories, the actual number of independent physical constants may be as small as one. For example, the cosmological constant may be a fundamental constant, but attempts have also been made to calculate it from other constants, and according to the author of one such calculation, [...] "the small value of the cosmological constant is telling us that a remarkably precise and totally unexpected relation exists among all the parameters of the Standard Model of particle physics, the bare cosmological constant and unknown physics." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{analytical}} proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers, the tuning {{of which}} depends on simple formulas with one <b>adjustable</b> <b>parameter,</b> {{have been developed}} for processes with time delay. In this paper, using a simple method called dual-locus diagram, the solutions to the problems of stabilizing stable, integrating and unstable processes with time delay using analytical PID controllers are presented, respectively. For the stable and integrating process, the stabilizing range of the <b>adjustable</b> <b>parameter</b> is only related to the delay of the plant, while, for the unstable process, it depends on both the time constant of the plant and the ratio of the delay to the time constant. With the available stabilizing solution, the time-consuming stability check can be avoided in the controller application. Copyright © 2005 IFA...|$|R
