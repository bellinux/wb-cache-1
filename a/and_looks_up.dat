5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> at it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body {{and pulls out a}} sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} {{tiger shark}} can {{typically}} range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly. The advantage {{of this is that}} when it is hunting for its prey, when prey looks at the shark from above, the shark will be camouflaged since the water below is darker. And when prey is below the shark <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up,</b> of course because of the sun, it is lighter so that the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark. This is known as countershading. Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which makes it easy to turn quickly to one side. They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to hunt. Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides. The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water. These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey.|$|E

25|$|Most modern Chinese {{dictionaries}} and Chinese dictionaries sold to English speakers use {{the traditional}} radical-based character index {{in a section}} at the front, while {{the main body of}} the dictionary arranges the main character entries alphabetically according to their pinyin spelling. To find a character with unknown sound using one of these dictionaries, the reader finds the radical and stroke number of the character, as before, and locates the character in the radical index. The character's entry will have the character's pronunciation in pinyin written down; the reader then turns to the main dictionary section <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> the pinyin spelling alphabetically.|$|E
500|$|While the eponymous song [...] "Remember You" [...] {{is being}} sung, the episode flashes back almost a {{thousand}} years before {{the events of the}} episode. A young Marceline is seen crying in the wreckage of a city, presumably after the cataclysmic Mushroom War. Simon Petrikov sees her from a distance and runs over. In an attempt to comfort her, he gives her Hambo, a teddy bear, that he finds in the ruins of a toy store.

500|$|Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), {{recovering}} from his Borg assimilation, visits his family's vineyard in La Barre, France, which {{is run by}} his elder brother Robert (Jeremy Kemp) {{along with his wife}} Marie (Samantha Eggar) and son René (David Birkin). Jean-Luc is considering a position on earth with an underwater research project called Atlantis. Robert has always been jealous of his brother's success and is concerned that Jean-Luc's presence will drive René to also join Starfleet. The two have a bitter argument and end up wrestling each other in a mud puddle, eventually culminating in an emotional reunion, with Jean-Luc admitting his sense of powerlessness and guilt at the things he did while {{under the influence of the}} Borg. Robert states that Jean-Luc will have to learn to live with what he did, regardless of where he goes. [...] Jean-Luc decides to go back to the Enterprise. The two spend the night getting drunk as they resolve their differences. After Jean-Luc leaves, Robert decides to let René follow his dream to join Starfleet as René sits under a tree <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> at space.|$|E
500|$|As {{the final}} verse {{of the song}} begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a {{stalking}} cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it {{over her shoulder and}} it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> at both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, [...] "Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind".|$|E
500|$|Esther has {{a romantic}} {{interest}} in Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), who she idealises <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> to. Despite her feelings, Rex {{does not appear}} to notice or reciprocate, actress Alexa Havins conjectures that [...] "he's so blind to her feelings" [...] due to him having [...] "this wall built up around him that it's hard to break through." [...] Phifer commented that Rex sees Esther as a sister and conjectures that Esther's interests in him are partly a result of her sensationalising his work. Despite her highly romanticised idea of field work, Esther is not as skilled in the field as more experienced agents Rex, Jack (John Barrowman) [...] and Gwen. However, being part of a new Torchwood team means that Esther is [...] "ripped away from her desk and thrust into the world of Torchwood on the run." [...] During the later parts of the series the character has to fight physically against the team's enemies. Havins did not receive any training for these sequences, she felt that having been trained in fight sequences would have made Esther [...] "too slick, too trained, too perfect, too in sync {{with the rest of the}} Torchwood crew." [...] Instead of being able to take out her attackers easily, when Esther has to fight for her life it is [...] "raw and brutal" [...] and [...] "almost like a bar-brawl meets a chick-fight". Espenson notes that by the final episode Esther has earned a degree of admiration from Rex through her work for the Torchwood team, which she feels to be because [...] "he just can't fail to see how smart and brave she is." [...] In regards to being killed off Havins states that she knew it was a possibility from the moment she accepted the role due to the danger present in the series and its precedence for killing characters. io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the character's death helps serve to illustrate [...] "how hard it is to consign others to death, for the greater good." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News {{on the set of}} the video shoot, Drake said, [...] "I've shot a lot of videos before, but this is my first attempt to establish myself as Drake the artist." [...] Confronting the criticism of his past videos, notably the one for [...] "Best I Ever Had", Drake said, [...] "I really don't care what other people think about them, they were great experiences for me. I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E
500|$|A promotional {{music video}} was {{produced}} {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Fire in My Heart" [...] as a single. The video was directed by Jake & Jim, who also directed the video for the group's subsequent single [...] "Do or Die", and shows the Super Furry Animals waiting to leave Mars having played a concert on the planet. The video begins with Gruff Rhys standing alone on the Martian soil, singing along to the song. A silver, computer generated, spaceship is seen landing behind Rhys. Around one minute into the track the camera pans back to reveal {{the rest of the}} Super Furry Animals sitting down to the left of Rhys. Guitarist Huw Bunford is sat on the floor playing an acoustic guitar {{while the rest of the}} group are sat on three metal seats which are connected together. Two aliens are seen walking from the spacecraft towards the band while drummer Dafydd Ieuan pours some of the Martian sand through his hands. When the aliens arrive, one of them, with a bald head, sunglasses and pointy ears, places his left hand on Rhys's right shoulder. Rhys turns around and looks at the other alien who has one eye in the centre of a large round face and is wearing a blue hoodie. The alien smiles at Rhys who then turns around <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> to see the Earth in the sky above. Ieuan and keyboardist Cian Ciaran are also shown looking at the Earth before the camera moves behind them to reveal hundreds of aliens stood in front of several minaret-like towers, waving at the group. The band are shown picking up a suitcase and guitar before walking towards the spaceship as the song finishes. The aliens were designed by regular Super Furry Animals collaborator Pete Fowler, who acted as [...] "creative advisor" [...] for the video. According to Rhys the aliens were animated by the same special effects team that worked on [...] Rhys has stated that he considers his performance in the video to be [...] "wooden" [...] as he was forced to take painkillers during the shoot due to a [...] "stiff neck".|$|E

He reveres Yuna and her legendary guardians <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> to her. Unlike the outspoken Chuami, Kurgum is more introverted but determined. On orders from Baralai, Kurgum and Chuami travel to Besaid to meet with Yuna. Upon returning to Bevelle with Yuna and Wakka, they find out Sin has returned. As he and Chuami eavesdrop on a conversation between Yuna and Tidus, Kurgum suddenly claims to be in love with Yuna. It's implied that Kurgum is lying and has feelings for Chuami but she doesn't understand as Kurgum says it's something only summoners understand. They part ways with Chuami returning to Besaid with Tidus while Kurgum stays in Bevelle with Wakka and Yuna as she resolves to fight Sin once more.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the verses}} in Ezekiel and its {{attendant}} commentaries, his vision consists of a chariot made of many heavenly beings driven by the [...] "Likeness of a Man." [...] The base structure of the chariot is composed of four beings. These beings are called the [...] "living creatures" [...] (Hebrew: חיות hayyot or khayyot). The bodies of the creatures are [...] "like that of a human being", but each of them has four faces, corresponding to the four directions the chariot can go (East, South, North and West). The faces are that of a man, a lion, an ox (later changed to a cherub in Ezekiel [...] ) and an eagle. Since there are four angels and each has four faces, there are a total of sixteen faces. Each [...] "Hayyot" [...] angel also has four wings. Two of these wings spread across {{the length of the}} chariot and connect with the wings of the angel on the other side. This creates a sort of 'box' of wings that forms the perimeter of the chariot. With the remaining two wings, each angel covers its own body. Below, but not attached to, the feet of the [...] "Hayyot" [...] angels are other angels that are shaped like wheels. These wheel angels, which are described as [...] "a wheel inside of a wheel", are called [...] "Ophanim" [...] אופנים (lit. wheels, cycles or ways). These wheels are not directly under the chariot but are nearby and along its perimeter. The angel with the face of the man is always on the east side <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> at the [...] "Likeness of a Man" [...] that drives the chariot. The [...] "Likeness of a Man" [...] sits on a throne made of sapphire.|$|E
