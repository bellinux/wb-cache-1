The analysis of the relationship between ecological integrity and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impacts</b> is necessary to elucidate the thresholds at which ecological condition is able to sustain key ecological process, such as long-term predator-prey interactions. The goal is to establish a conceptual framework to associate measurable structural attributes, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, to biodiversity loss. With this spatial framework, several geo-indicators are derived (e.g., loss of ecosystem capacity to reorganize and sustain key ecological processes) such as <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impacts</b> on predator-prey interactions can be observed.|$|R

5000|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} or <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impact</b> on the environment includes impacts on biophysical environments, biodiversity, and other resources. The term anthropogenic designates an effect or object resulting from human activity. The term was first used in the technical sense by Russian geologist Alexey Pavlov, and was first used in English by British ecologist Arthur Tansley in reference to human influences on climax plant communities. The atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen introduced the term [...] "Anthropocene" [...] in the mid-1970s. The term is sometimes used in the context of pollution emissions that are produced as a result of human activities but applies broadly to all major human impacts on the environment.|$|E
50|$|The <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impact</b> on the {{environment}} - due to pollution, climate change and ultimately human population growth - is generating increasingly serious problems, the solution of which will depend on {{a better understanding of}} the biosphere than we already have. To provide conditions in which such an understanding can be developed, it is essential to preserve as far as possible intact examples of natural ecosystems, and the zapovedniks are the only large system of protected areas created primarily for this purpose. In the case of soil erosion, for example, it is only by comparing soil formation and loss rates from intact steppe or prairie and from the same kind of land under intensive agriculture that we can appreciate how destructive of natural capital the latter often is.|$|E

However, {{if we are to}} understand the absolute and long-term effects of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impacts</b> on tropical forests, we should also consider the interactions between species, how those species are organized in networks, and the function that those species perform. I discuss our current knowledge of network structure and ecosystem functioning, highlighting empirical examples of their response to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impacts.</b> I consider the future prospects for tropical forest biodiversity, focusing on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in secondary forest.

50|$|The rate of {{a number}} of geochemical changes taking place during the last decades in the {{biosphere}} has become catastrophically high. Such changes are often connected with human activities. To study these changes and to make better informed decisions on diminishing their adverse impact on living organisms, and especially on people, it is necessary to estimate the contemporary abundances of chemical elements in geochemical systems susceptible to the highest <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impact</b> and having a significant effect on the development and existence of living organisms. One of such systems is the soil of urban landscapes. Settlements occupy less than 10% of the land area, but virtually the entire population of the planet lives within them. The main deposing medium in cities is soil, which ecological and geochemical conditions largely determine the life safety of citizens. So that, one of the priority tasks of the environmental geochemistry is to establish the average contents (abundances) of chemical elements in the soils of settlements.|$|E

30|$|The {{ecological}} {{effects of}} losing ecosystem integrity {{have a strong}} influence on the ecological viability and long-term persistence of apex predators. The evolutionary capacity of predators is modified through human impacts by reducing {{the extent of the}} natural habitat that sustains viable populations. In addition, indirect impacts also disrupt animal mobility and their ecological roles as trophic links. It is imperative to analyze the magnitude of direct and indirect <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impacts</b> associated with ecological degradation, particularly those related to the remnant habitat of top predators within their remaining distribution areas, in order to abate possible human-wildlife conflicts (such as livestock predation) and set conservation priorities, as natural landscape continues to be transformed. Understanding direct and indirect <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impacts</b> is important for preventing species extinction and facilitating species recovery.|$|R

30|$|The {{relationship}} between ecological integrity loss {{and the level}} of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impact</b> is clear for all apex predators. As several impacts accumulate in the landscape, the less ecological integrity is observed in remaining areas. A critical point was identified for defining an ecological threshold, where ecosystem properties can be severely impacted due to human activities, and where the landscape that sustains ecological suitable habitat and population viability is drastically threatened (Fig. 8). In all cases, the ecological integrity loss is consistently around EI[*]=[*] 0.4 for all apex predators, and defines the threshold when anthropogenic impacts become high. When this tipping point is reached, the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impact</b> becomes high to highly severe. Noticeably, EI values ranged considerably for intact and semi-intact areas, indicating a possible level of ecological degradation for the remaining habitat of apex predators. Nevertheless, the definition of an ecological integrity threshold for <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impact</b> may be used for consistent evaluations of environmental impact assessments, and to guide decision making for avoiding unwanted accumulated impacts.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and measure <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impacts</b> on ribeirão Mestre d’Armas sub-basin, Federal District, Central Brazil, and to propose its environmental zoning. This study was performed using two methods based on rapid environmental assessment: a rapid river assessment protocol, to evaluate in an integrated form the features of a lotic system section according to the conservation or degradation condition of the fluvial environment; and the Leopold matrix, to identify and evaluate the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impacts.</b> The environmental zoning of this sub-basin detected three areas: preserved, transition and urban areas. The environmental assessment revealed, the preserved area had lotic stretches with natural features under low magnitude of impacts, except on burned areas. In the transition area, there was a predominance of lotic stretches with altered features, due to agriculture and livestock activities of intermediate level of impacts. Finally, the urban area had altered and impacted lotic stretches of higher magnitude due to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impacts.</b> Thus, this study revealed large differences among the areas detected by environmental zoning, according to the methods used.

40|$|<b>Anthropogenic</b> <b>impacts</b> {{have led}} to {{widespread}} extinctions of species on oceanic islands but the nature {{of many of these}} extinctions remains poorly known. Here we investigate extinction selectivities of terrestrial gastropods from the Ogasawara archipelago in the northwest Pacific, where anthropogenic threats have changed over time, shifting primarily from the effects of habitat loss to predation by a variety of different predators. Across all of the islands, extinct species had significantly smaller geographic ranges compared with species that are still alive, but among the surviving species, ranges of those that are currently declining due to human impacts do not differ significantly from those that are not threatened. Extinctions were selective with respect to spire index (SI) of shells, a trait of potential functional importance, but the relationship between body size and extinction vulnerability varied among extinction agents, some of which were strongly size selective, whereas others were not. Overall, whereas <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impacts</b> have resulted in nonrandom losses of phenotypic diversity, the patterns of selectivity are complex, vary among islands, and with the type of threat. As extinction agents have changed historically, so has the pattern of loss. Because of the changing nature of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>impacts,</b> resiliency to one type of threat does not guarantee long-term survival of species and future patterns of biodiversity loss on these islands are likely to be different from those in the past...|$|R
