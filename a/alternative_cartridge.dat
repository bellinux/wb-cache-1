5000|$|In July 2012, the Army {{solicited}} {{a request}} for vendors to supply <b>alternative</b> <b>cartridge</b> cases to reduce the weight of an M855A1 5.56 mm round by at least 10 percent, {{as well as for}} the 7.62 NATO and [...]50 BMG rounds. The cartridge cases must maintain all performance requirements when fully assembled, be able to be used by the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant, must be manufactured in quantities totaling approximately 45 million per year. Polymer-cased ammunition is expected as a likely lightweight case technology. A hybrid polymer/metal version of a conventional cartridge case would be thicker than regular cases and reduce the amount of space for the propellant, although certain polymers could be thermodynamically more efficient and not lose energy to the case or chamber when fired.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, many {{consumers}} {{have begun to}} challenge the business practices of printer manufacturers, such as charging up to US$8,000 per gallon (US$2,100 per liter) for printer ink. Alternatives for consumers are cheaper copies of cartridges, produced by third parties, and the refilling of cartridges, using refill kits. Due to the large differences in price caused by OEM markups, there are many companies selling third-party ink cartridges. Most printer manufacturers discourage refilling disposable cartridges or using aftermarket copy cartridges, and say that use of incorrect inks may cause poor image quality {{due to differences in}} viscosity, which can affect the amount of ink ejected in a drop, and color consistency, and can damage the printhead. Nonetheless, the use of <b>alternative</b> <b>cartridges</b> and inks has been gaining in popularity, threatening the business model of printer manufacturers. Printer companies such as HP, Lexmark, and Epson have used patents and the DMCA to launch lawsuits against third-party vendors. An anti-trust class-action lawsuit was launched in the US against HP and office supply chain Staples Inc, alleging that HP paid Staples $100 million to keep inexpensive third-party ink cartridges off the shelves.|$|R
5000|$|An {{advantage}} that the [...]458 Lott offers over voluminous cartridge {{such as the}} [...]450 Rigby, [...]460 Weatherby or the [...]505 Gibbs {{is that it can}} be easily adopted in rifles actions which are regularly manufactured with little or no modification of the bolt face. For this reason, it is a much more economical <b>alternative</b> to <b>cartridges</b> which need larger actions types and larger bolt faces. The cartridge’s popularity is {{due in large part to}} the affordable rifles and the number of readily available rifles which are chamber for the cartridge.|$|R
5000|$|The 6.5-08 {{cartridge}} {{was created}} simply by necking down the [...]308 Winchester. Handloaders and wildcatters can easily form [...]260 cases by necking down the 7mm-08 Remington or necking up the [...]243 Winchester (both {{based on the}} same [...]308 case). Since the parent cartridges were readily available for low cost, the 6.5-08 was often an economical <b>alternative</b> to <b>cartridges</b> such as the 6.5×55mm. What the 6.5-08 provided over the [...]243 Winchester, [...]308 Winchester, and to a lesser degree the 7mm-08 Remington was bullets with excellent ballistic coefficients and sectional densities relative to their weights.|$|R
500|$|In 1968, the Army Small Arms Program {{developed}} {{plans for}} a new 5.56mm caliber LMG, though no funds were allocated (5.56mm ammunition was viewed as underpowered by many in the armed forces). Studies of improved 5.56mm ammunition, with better performance characteristics, began. The earliest reference to studies of other caliber cartridges for the LMG did not appear until 1969. In July 1970, the U.S. Army finally approved development of an LMG, with no specified caliber. At this time, the nomenclature [...] "Squad Automatic Weapon" [...] (SAW) was introduced. Actual design of <b>alternative</b> <b>cartridges</b> for the LMG did not begin until July 1971. A month later, Frankford Arsenal decided on two cartridge designs for the new LMG: a 6mm cartridge and a new 5.56mm cartridge with a much larger case. Neither design was finalized by March 1972, when the Army published the specifications document for the planned SAW. The 6mm cartridge design was eventually approved in May that year. Prior to July 1972, SAW development contracts were awarded to Maremont, Philco Ford, and the Rodman Laboratory at Rock Island Arsenal. These companies produced designs with Army designations XM233, XM234 and XM235 respectively—X denoting [...] "experimental". Designs were required to have a weight of less than 9.07kg (20lb) including 200 rounds of ammunition, and a range of at least 800meters (2,600ft).|$|R

5000|$|If the 5.56 mm bullet {{is moving}} too slowly to {{reliably}} yaw, expand, or fragment on impact, the wound size and potential to incapacitate {{a person is}} greatly reduced. There have been numerous attempts to create an intermediate cartridge that addresses the complaints of 5.56 NATO's lack of stopping power along with lack of controllability seen in rifles firing 7.62 NATO in full auto. Some <b>alternative</b> <b>cartridges</b> like the [...]270 caliber 6.8mm Remington SPC (6.8×43mm) focused on superior short-range performance by sacrificing long-distance performance due to the relatively short engagement distances typically observed in urban warfare. Others, like the 6.5mm Grendel (6.5×39mm), are attempts at engineering an all purpose cartridge that could replace both the 5.56 and 7.62 NATO rounds. The 300 AAC Blackout (7.62×35mm) round was designed to have {{the power of the}} 7.62×39mm for use in an M4 using standard M4 magazines, and to easily interchange between subsonic ammunition for suppressed firing and supersonic rounds. All these cartridges have certain advantages over the 5.56×45mm NATO, but they have their own individual tradeoffs to include lower muzzle velocity and less range. Additionally, when using a round not based on the case of the 5.56 there can be decreased magazine capacity, and different internal parts. None of these cartridges have gained any significant traction beyond sport shooting communities.|$|R
50|$|As a free <b>alternative</b> to FastLoad <b>cartridges,</b> {{numerous}} pure software turbo-loader {{programs were}} also created that were loaded to RAM each {{time after the}} computer was reset. The best of these turbo-loaders were able to accelerate the time required for loading a program from the floppy drive {{by a factor of}} 20x, demonstrating the default bus implementation's inadequacy. As turbo-loader programs were relatively small, it was common to place one on almost each floppy disk so that it could be quickly loaded to RAM after restart.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT:The aim {{to achieve}} {{in this study is}} to recover the Cr(III) and process waters used in the wastewaters of chrome tanning {{operation}} by membrane process during leather production. In the treatment <b>alternative</b> contains, <b>cartridge</b> filter, nanofiltration (NF(NP 10)), nanofiltration NF(XN 45) and reverse osmosis RO(ACM 2) membranes. The raw chrome wastewater from the cartridge filter was given to NF(NP 10) membranes with 3 different pressures (12 bar, 16 bar, 18 bar). In this alternative, the most appropriate pressure is determined as 20 bar and the COD, Cr(III) and SS values were detected as, in order, 65 %, 49 % and 87 % for the removal efficiency. 2, 7 times more concentration for Cr(III) was achieved in the NF (XN 45) membrane, which was used after NF(NP 10) membrane and COD, SS, SO 4 - 2, Na+ and conductivity parameters showed removal efficiencies as, 75 %, 89 %, 95 %, 38 % and 16 %. The permeate from RO(ACM 2) membrane was decreased to the discharge criteria’s; (Cr(III) : 2 mg/L, COD: 200 mg/L). As a result, the investment and the process cost of these membranes are more feasible...|$|R
40|$|A Phase 2 SBIR Program {{funded by}} the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center to develop a Nonazeotropic Heat Pump is described.

40|$|Individual {{cartridge}} case identification {{is an essential}} component of historic battlefield archeology. With individual {{cartridge case}} identification archeologists are able to track the movement of the combatants as they move across the battlefield, giving a highly detailed view of the past. While useful, current methods of individual cartridge case identification require expensive equipment and extensive training and time to conduct. In this thesis two <b>alternative</b> methods of <b>cartridge</b> case identification are evaluated in order to determine if recent developments in the areas of 3 D scanning and statistical analysis can be utilized to develop new methods of individual cartridge case method. The first method tested is the evaluation of three 3 D scanners, which have the potential to replace the expensive microscopes currently required for cartridge case identification. The second method tested uses a digital caliper to obtain four differen...|$|R
50|$|A caliber {{conversion}} sleeve or {{adapter sleeve}} is a device {{which can be}} used to non-permanently alter a firearm to allow it to fire a different cartridge than the one it was originally designed to fire. The different cartridge must be smaller in some dimensions than the original design <b>cartridge.</b> <b>Alternative</b> names sometimes imply the type of dimensional difference. A chamber insert may be used for a shorter cartridge of similar base diameter. A supplemental chamber or cartridge adapter is typically used for a shorter cartridge of reduced diameter. A cartridge conversion sleeve may include a short barrel of reduced bore diameter. Shotgun conversion sleeves may be called subgauge inserts, subgauge tubes, or gauge reducers. Sleeves intended for rifle or handgun cartridges may have rifled barrels. Additional variations may allow centerfire weapons to fire rimfire ammunition and/or retain autoloading function with the smaller cartridge.|$|R
5000|$|Double-edge (DE) safety razors {{remain a}} popular <b>alternative</b> to {{proprietary}} <b>cartridge</b> razors, and usually offer significantly lower {{total cost of}} ownership since they are not marketed under the [...] "razor and blades business model". DE razors are still designed and produced in many countries. Better known manufacturers include Edwin Jagger, Feather, iKon, Lord, Merkur, Mühle, Parker, Rockwell, ShaveCraft, Van der Hagen, Weishi and Wilkinson Sword, with several of them producing razors that are marketed under other brands. Often different models of razors within a brand share the same razor-head designs, differing primarily in the color, length, texture, material(s), and weight of the handles. Three-piece razors generally have interchangeable handles, and some companies specialize in manufacturing custom or high-end replacement handles. Variations in razor head designs include straight safety bar (SB), open comb (OC)(toothed) bar, adjustable razors, and slant bar razors. The slant bar was a common design in Germany in which the blade is slightly angled and curved along its length to make for a slicing action and a more rigid cutting edge.|$|R
40|$|Full-column {{anchored}} resin bolts {{were first}} used in underground mines in 1972. These bolts appear to improve support in many roof bolt applications, {{as indicated by}} the use of about 30 million resin bolts in 1980. In the mid- 1970 's, Bureau of Mines in-vestigators began looking for a substitute for resin because of its short supply and rapidly increasing price. The investigators selected accelerated gypsum plaster (CaSO. 271 / 2 H 20), which becomes gypsum (CaSO. 27 2 H 20) when mixed with water. Gypsum makes an effective alternate grout material because it hardens quickly, is readily available, and is inexpensive in comparison with other cementitious materials. The Bureau received a patent (U. s. patent 4, 096, 944) for a system combining water capsules (wax-encapsulated water) with plaster into cartridges resembling resin cartridges. This report presents the results of tests conducted by the Bureau on the plaster, the water capsules, and their combined use in cartridges. The tests were designed to determine how the gypsum-plaster water capsule bolting system performs and what happens in the hole while the bolt is being inserted through the cartridge. The test results indicate that water capsule plaster cartridges are a workable <b>alternative</b> to resin <b>cartridges</b> under normal or dry conditions...|$|R
