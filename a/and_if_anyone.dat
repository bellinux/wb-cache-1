25|$|In the anime, a Mr. Mime {{lives with}} Delia Ketchum. He does {{housework}} {{for her in}} exchange for room and board. Ash dressed as a Mr. Mime to inspire a real Mr. Mime who worked for a circus. Delia knew about this, so when a wild Mr. Mime came to her door and wanted lunch, {{she thought it was}} Ash in costume, and provided it with food. When the real Ash showed up, still in costume, she was quite puzzled, but wound up keeping Mimey as her live-in maid. It will only listen to Delia, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> else, even Ash, gives it orders, or asks it to do something, it will normally ignore them. It is unknown if Delia has actually captured Mimey, as she is never shown with its Poké Ball. When Ash and his friends returned to Pallet Town following the Orange Islands saga, it was revealed that Brock and Mimey had become rather competitive regarding household tasks while {{the two of them were}} sharing the house with Delia.|$|E

She further compared the performance with the dream sequence from the 1945 film Spellbound but noted that it was [...] "slightly weirder" [...] Jim Farber of the Daily News commented that [...] "her take on a song by her clear role model, Beyoncé, showed too much similarity in their timbres and phrasing, making Sanchez's voice seem redundant...despite the fact she switched up {{the arrangement of the}} bootylicious song she chose, 'Sweet Dreams.'" [...] Laura Schreffler of the Daily Mail described Sanchez' performance as [...] "pared-down, show-stopping...a floaty, dreamy, confection that wows the judges." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Sanchez gave yet another perfectly calibrated performance with Beyoncé's 'Sweet Dreams,' balancing restraint and power. Everything from her voice to her dress to the red door she walked through seemed polished and tour-ready." [...] The Arizona Republics Randy Cordova praised the performance, saying that the slow-tempo version allowed Sanchez [...] "to really delve into the song's emotional core". The Hollywood Reporters Erin Carlson praised the tonned-down theatrical stage during the performance and Sanchez's vibrato voice, further describing the performance as a [...] "near-perfection".|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics have}} commended the {{development}} of Cheryl, as well as Greer's portrayal of the character. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall declared that Cheryl was his favorite character on the show. In his review for [...] "El Secuestro", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club felt that Greer's vocals were {{the highlight of the}} episode, and affirmed that she effectively portrayed the unstable characteristics of Cheryl. [...] "Greer is mostly just asked to say crazy things as Cheryl, and that’s fun, but she steps it up here, playing both Cheryl’s insanity and the part of her that’s a spoiled trust-fund kid who’s found a day job and has to ride the subway with a dwarf that freaks her out." [...] Likewise, Ian MacDonald of TV Overmind proclaimed that the writers [...] "found a great way to expand on ISIS' most emotionally unstable employees"; [...] "Cheryl, whose crazy has been escalated to an almost extreme," [...] MacDonald stated, [...] "seems almost justified in her maladjusted-ness. She's a billionaire heiress who owns an ocelot and drinks glue [...] Humor involving insane rich people just no getting it is usually pretty funny, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> can pull it off, it's Adam Reed and [...] Greer." [...] Alongside fellow cast members Jessica Walter and H. Jon Benjamin, Greer was a candidate for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in a Television Production—the award was given to Jeff Bennett for his work in the Nickelodeon television series The Penguins of Madagascar.|$|E

500|$|Tens of {{millions}} of Flying Eagle cents had been issued {{in exchange for the}} old American coppers and small Spanish silver. The Spanish silver was still flowing into the Mint in early 1859 and, at Snowden's urging, Congress on March 3 of that year extended the redemption of these foreign coins, legal tender in the US until 1857, for another two years. [...] Neil Carothers, in his work on small-denomination currency, challenged this decision as unnecessary—deprived of legal tender status, the remaining Spanish silver would have been eliminated through sales to banks for their bullion. Those who brought the old coins to the Mint received cents for them, at first Flying Eagle, and then Indian Head. In the year following the renewal, some forty million Indian Head cents were issued, meaning nearly a hundred million copper-nickel cents had entered commerce since 1857. [...] As the coin did not circulate in the South and West due to prejudice against base-metal money, they choked commerce. [...] No one had to take them; no law made them legal tender. At Snowden's urging Congress in June 1860 ended the exchange. [...] Nevertheless, as Snowden admitted in his annual report that year, there were too many cents in circulation. In October 1860, The Bankers' Magazine and Statistical Register reported that there were ten million cents in commerce in New York City above what was needed, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> wished to order in bulk, they could be purchased at a discount.|$|E

Dayananda, stated Reverend John Robson, was an iconoclast and willing to join with Christians to destroy all idols in India. According to Robson, Dayanand believed [...] "there was no errors in the Vedas (including the Rigveda), <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> showed him an error, he would maintain {{that it was a}} corruption added later".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout history {{many have}} {{understood}} Jesus of Nazareth {{to have been}} a pacifist, drawing on his Sermon on the Mount. In the sermon Jesus stated that one should [...] "not resist an evildoer" [...] and promoted his turn the other cheek philosophy. [...] "If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well... Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you."

[...] While {{in an interview with}} Justin Longshore from Through the Eyes of the Dead about the deathcore label, he said [...] "You know, I really hate that term.

2500|$|After the {{formation}} of the Bulgarian state the ruling elite harboured deep distrust towards the Byzantines against whose perfidy and sudden attacks they had to maintain constant vigilance. The Byzantine Empire never relinquished its claim over all lands to the south of the Danube and made several attempts to enforce that claim. Throughout the existence of the First Empire Bulgaria could expect Byzantine onslaughts aimed at its destruction. The steppes to the north-east were home to numerous peoples whose unpredictable pillaging raids were also of concern. Therefore, military preparedness was a top priority. All borders of the country were under vigilance. Guards always stood on the alert <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> was to flee during a watch, the responsible guards are killed without hesitation. Before battle, a [...] "most faithful and prudent man" [...] was sent to inspect all the arms, horses, and materiel and being ill-prepared or readied in a useless fashion was punishable by death. Capital punishment was also prescribed for riding war horses in peace time.|$|E
