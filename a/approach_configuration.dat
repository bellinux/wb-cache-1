Because of high terrain in the area, the approach uses {{a series of}} three step-downs from the initial approach fix of 7500 feet MSL. The crew began a continuous descent from about 7600 ft MSL at about 11 NM from the airport, rather than following the prescribed step-down procedure, which led to the accident site. The aircraft's descent profile was well below the published step-down course for the entire approach. The aircraft impacted a mountain known as Cerro de Hula at the 4800 ft MSL elevation, approximately 800 ft below the summit, 4.8 NM from the Tegucigalpa runway 01 threshold. At impact, the aircraft was in <b>approach</b> <b>configuration.</b>|$|E

Comparisons were also made between the panel method, the Euler method, and flight data for two high-lift configurations, one representing a take-off configuration and the other an <b>approach</b> <b>configuration.</b> For the take-off configuration, both codes agreed reasonably well with experimental data, but both codes were found to overpredict the flap upper-surface pressures for the <b>approach</b> <b>configuration...</b>|$|E

Tests were performed in both the reverse thrust and <b>approach</b> <b>configurations.</b> The thrust reverser noise created by jet turbulence mixing and the OTW approach noise were both low frequency and broadband. When scaled to a 45, 400 -kg (100, 000 -lb) aircraft, the thrust reverser and <b>approach</b> <b>configurations</b> produced peak 152 -m (500 -ft) sideline perceived noise levels of 110 and 105 PNdB, respectively.

The free-to-roll technique identified uncommanded lateral motions at the same angle-of-attack range as experienced in flight tests. The cause of the uncommanded lateral motions was unsteady asymmetric wing stall. The paper also shows that free-to-roll data or static force and moment data alone are not enough to accurately capture the potential for an aircraft to experience uncommanded lateral motion...|$|E

This analysis was conducted at the Forrestal Airport, Princeton, New Jersey by graduate students of the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Sciences of Princeton University. The "Heli-Porter" was tested at 8, 000 feet in the cruise and <b>approach</b> <b>configurations</b> both for power-on and power-off conditions to determine its stick fixed and stick free static stability characteristics. The maneuvering stability and stick forces per "g" gradient of the aircraft were evaluated for the power-on cruise condition; while its lateral performance was determined for the power-on cruise and <b>approach</b> <b>configurations.</b> From these evaluations, the "Heli-Porter" {{was found to have}} adequate stick fixed and stick free stability in the cruise and <b>approach</b> <b>configurations</b> both for the power-on and the power-off conditions. The aircraft also has excellent roll performance and a high level of maneuvering stability. However, its stick force per "g" and control forces in general are considered to be excessive if prolonged periods of maneuvering flight are anticipated. It was found that the c. g. limits set by the manufacturer were well forward of any neutral and maneuver points determined during this test.
