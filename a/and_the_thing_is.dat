25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

Oh said her character was [...] "a pert little blonde <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the woman who runs the show, Shonda Rhimes, is a black woman, which makes a big [...] difference." [...] In 2009, when asked why Oh signed on for Grey's Anatomy, Oh said: ...|$|E

And I think what I wanted to portray was the process {{about how a}} performer arrives at their work. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> what she had talked about as well, is that before a concert, what she finds very interesting is the rehearsals and the straining and maybe {{she would like to}} injure. [...] And she said that the process of making the concert became more intriguing than the final result." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for USA Today, D'Angelo said of the album's title and its meaning, [...] "the myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung–in religious [...] ceremonies." [...] In {{an interview}} for Jet magazine, he stated that his intentions for recording the album were to express the power of music and artistic respect for it. The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. Voodoos press release discussed D'Angelo's concept, stating [...] "Lyrically, D'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, as he puts it, Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was just to go farther. To get to that next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I'm hearing ... <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> I'm just looking at Voodoo as just the beginning. I'm still developing and growing and still listening to that sound I hear inside my head ... So {{this is the first}} step".|$|E

6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] {{she said}} {{with an air of}} decision. [...] "I'd better begin at once, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> serious. What have you done to clear yourself, since I last saw you?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... “He <b>is</b> {{distinct}} from <b>things</b> because He overpowers them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> {{distinct from}} Him {{because of their}} subjection to Him.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{shall be}} more than comfortable," [...] said Lady Milborough. After that there <b>was</b> an embrace, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> settled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very simple," [...] said Sir James, [...] "and very ingenious. Just a {{few words}} to alter, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> done. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> one {{important}} clue they overlooked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said she, [...] "I {{have always}} thought {{that some people are}} born to become acquainted, and when they meet they {{instantly}} perceive the fact, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> accomplished. They can then proceed." ...|$|E
60|$|The stage sailor {{places his}} right hand behind him and his left in front, leaps up into the air, kicks out his leg behind in a gay and bird-like way, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> done.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} trying to persuade her to, but she won't. She just pretends she doesn't mind. She has a nervous, {{sensitive}} temperament, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> slowly crushing her. Don't talk to me of Harold." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were off}} at once, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> done before Helen {{had time to}} feel {{anything}} but the relief which the protection of his presence afforded her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your French maid's then?" [...] said Ethel. [...] "I {{dare say}} she dresses quite as well; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> too really pretty and simple for an English maid's taste." ...|$|R
60|$|The words <b>were</b> out <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> {{done before}} Asad had {{realized}} the corsair's intent. A gasp of dismay escaped him; then his visage grew inflamed, his eyes blazed.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is easy," [...] Sir Richard declared. [...] "You {{have only}} to keep your nerve, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> done. No one will see him inside the car, in that {{motoring}} coat and glasses. You can drive somewhere out into the country and leave him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pansy Glucose?" [...] moans the author. [...] "The ingenue?" [...] "Yes," [...] {{says the}} manager. [...] "It won't take long. Just turn your Milwaukee pickle {{manufacturer}} into a debutante, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> done. Get {{to work as}} soon as you can. I want this rushed." ...|$|E
60|$|This event, {{as you may}} suppose, made a {{considerable}} sensation in <b>the</b> neighbourhood; travellers <b>and</b> carriers conveyed <b>the</b> news of it along the road from village to village; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> thoroughly canvassed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> impostors duly condemned.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was blowing}} fresh on Saturday, but we {{anchored}} under Nepean Island, and by hard work cleared the vessel by 5 P.M.; all worked hard, <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> landed safely. Palmer, with <b>the</b> cart <b>and</b> boys, was on <b>the</b> pier, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> carted <b>and</b> carried into <b>the</b> store as they arrived. I came on shore about 5, found all well <b>and</b> hearty, <b>the</b> people very friendly, nothing in their manner to indicate any change of feeling.|$|R
6000|$|His uncle {{shook his}} 'ead agin. [...] "She didn't want no asking," [...] he ses, {{speaking}} very slow and mournful. [...] "I just 'appened {{to put my}} arm round her waist by accident one day <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's very simple," [...] urged Hodgson. [...] "Provide Atherton {{plenty of}} comic business; {{you ought to}} be able to do that all right.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] resumed Wisbech, seeing {{he did not}} answer, [...] "if {{you care}} {{to go back and}} take up your {{profession}} in England again, I think I can contrive to give you a fair start. You needn't be diffident. I can afford it, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> more or less my duty." ...|$|E
60|$|The adventuress {{herself is}} {{another person who}} dies with {{remarkable}} ease. We suppose in her case it is being so used to it that makes her so quick and clever at it. There is no lingering illness and doctors' bills and upsetting of the whole household arrangements about her method. One walk round the stage <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> done.|$|E
60|$|He {{had only}} to finish <b>the</b> sentence, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> done. But <b>the</b> tender passion perversely delights in raising {{obstacles}} to itself. A sudden timidity seized on Arnold exactly at the wrong moment. He stopped short, in the most awkward manner possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} that I should do just what the wise people told me. I asked papa, {{and he said that}} it would be better. So the lawyers were driven out of their minds, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> milliners out of their bodies, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{scarcely}} a reasonable excuse {{for refusing to}} let it," [...] Rochester answered. [...] "I did not suggest that he should take it. I merely referred him to my agents.

6000|$|... "Speak, Lodbrog, speak!" [...] she commanded. [...] "You {{are strong}} and unafraid. You are all man. I know you despise the vermin who would destroy Him. You, you alone can save Him.

6000|$|I {{gave him}} the whole secret before I saw where it would take me. [...] "Buy sheet lead," [...] I said, [...] "stamp it into discs. Sew 'em all over your underclothes until you have enough. Have lead-soled boots, carry a bag of solid lead, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> done! Instead of being a {{prisoner}} here you may go abroad again, Pyecraft; you may travel----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Desmond {{could have}} laughed. He fancied {{that it would}} have been almost warranted, but he laid a {{restraint}} upon himself. [...] "Then," [...] he said, [...] "if you have both made up your minds <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> settled what in the name of wonder are you wandering about Africa for? The fact that you like it doesn't count. Why don't you go back--now--to her? It would be considerably wiser." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At a registrar's? Nothing simpler. You {{should have}} seen Reggie Byng's wedding. It was over before one {{realized}} it had started. A snuffy little man in a black coat with a cold in his head asked a few questions, wrote a few words, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> done." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rather a large {{aircraft}} shall we say, for a single-engine fighter. Terrific power. Quite something to control.

6000|$|... "I do. He's {{engaged to}} Nelly Bryant. Nelly {{told me all}} about it when she got home last night. It seems that Freddie said to her 'What ho!' and she said 'You bet!' and Freddie said 'Pip pip!' <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> settled." [...] Jill bubbled. [...] "Freddie wants to go into {{vaudeville}} with her!" ...|$|R
