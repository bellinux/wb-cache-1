50|$|Agile retail is a direct-to-consumer retail {{model that}} uses big data {{to try to}} predict trends, manage {{efficient}} production cycles, and faster turnaround on emerging styles. Agile retail applies concepts from Agile and Lean in the retail business, and aims to respond faster to customer needs. This retail model is used by Amazon. The concept turns e-commerce retailers into on-demand platforms that identify stock and deliver desired products directly to the consumer, thereby reducing costs. The main focus of Agile retail is to identify trends that are popular with consumers at a given moment and deliver those products using <b>Agile</b> <b>production</b> concepts.|$|E

The key difference between the two is like between a thin and an athletic person, agile being the latter. One can be neither, one or both.

A multi_agent and distributed rule based approach is proposed for production scheduling in agile manufacturing systems in this paper. First,a function_based decomposition method was suggested to make a hierarchical multi_agent system,which was populated by three classes of agents,namely Resource Agents,Part Agents and Management Agents,and the basic structure and definitions of these agents were presented. Then,based on distributed rule methods,the coordination or cooperation strategies and the scheduling mechanism for agents were presented for the purposes of <b>agile</b> <b>production</b> scheduling.

Digital Virtual Manufacturing is a technology that facilitates effective product developments and <b>agile</b> <b>productions</b> by digital environments representing the physical and logical schema and the behaviour of real manufacturing system including manufacturing resources, processes and products. For applying digital virtual manufacturing to die shop, engineering information managements of products, manufacturing process and resources are vital.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{a research}} objective associated with human performance in <b>agile</b> <b>production</b> systems, with specific attention towards {{the hypothesis that}} system outcomes are the causal result of worker human cognition and quality of work life attributes experienced in an <b>agile</b> <b>production</b> system. The development and adoption of world class <b>agile</b> <b>production</b> systems has been an immediate economic answer to the world-wide competitive call for more efficient, more cost-effective, and more quality laden production processes, but has the human element of these processes been fully understood and optimized? Outstanding current literature suggests that the recent movements toward higher standards in systems outcomes (i. e. increased quality, decreased costs, improved delivery schedules, etc) has not been truly evaluated. The human-machine interaction has not been fully comprehended, not to mention quantified; the role of human cognition is still under evaluation; and the coupling of the entire production system {{with respect to the}} human quality of life has yielded conflicting messages. The dissertation research conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate the interrelationships occurring between system outcomes, applicable elements of human cognition, and the quality of work life issues associated with the human performance in <b>agile</b> <b>production</b> systems. A structural equation modeling analysis aided the evaluation of the hypotheses of the dissertation by synthesizing the three specific instruments measuring the appropriate latent variables: 1. system outcomes – empirical data, 2. human cognition – cognitive task analysis, and 3. quality of work life – questionnaires into a single hypothesized model. These instruments were administered in four (4) waves during the eight month longitudinal study. The study latent variables of system outcomes, human cognition, and quality of work life were shown to be quantifiable and causal in nature. System outcomes were indicated to be a causal result of the combined, yet uncorrelated, effect of human cognition and quality of work life attributes experienced by workers in <b>agile</b> <b>production</b> systems. In addition, this latent variable relationship is situational, varying in regards to the context of, but not necessarily the time exposed to, the particular task the worker is involved with. An implication {{of this study is that}} the quality of work life attributes are long-term determinants of human performance, whereas human cognition attributes are immediate, activity based determinants of human performance in <b>agile</b> <b>production</b> systems...|$|E

This reflects the findings of Lycett et al. [33] that management of large and mature organisations sees big risks in the big-bang adoption of agility. Several industrial experiences (e.g., [2, 24, 63, 64]) indicate that a small group of experts in a research project or an exploration phase before <b>agile</b> <b>production</b> is often needed to prepare key requirement and architecture issues to ensure that a project is in a situation where agile methods are feasible. This is in line with the results from early agile pilot projects in the case organisation. Therefore, the {{results of this}} study emphasise release concept planning before <b>agile</b> <b>production.</b> Tyree and Akerman [34] believe that architecture decisions are the missing link between traditional and agile architecture documentation in the context of large financial IT systems. This is in line with the {{results of this study}} that emphasise rationale for decisions on successful release development projects.|$|E

Notions of ‘customer focus’, which have spread through some industrial and retail sectors have largely passed the housebuilding industry by. In its current guise, the industry is unlikely to be able to tackle the demographic and social demands which will be placed on it in the early 21 st century. Its challenge is to lower the initial and lifecycle cost of housing, {{but at the same time}} improve its quality and functionality. Notions of ‘agile production ’ hold lessons for housebuilders. Essentially, the industry needs to adopt concepts of ‘mass customisation’, where highly customised products are delivered at costs comparable with mass production.

A lesson is that interpreting agile approaches in the specific organisational context of a large financial enterprise remains challenging [10].

Management of large and mature banking-sector organisations sees big risks in the big-bang adoption of agility.
