According to my theory, {{an element}} or a {{substance}} not decomposable {{under the circumstances}} of the experiment, (as for instance, a dilute acid or alkali,) should not be transferred, or pass from pole to pole, unless it be in chemical relation to some other element or substance tending to pass in the opposite direction, for the effect is considered as essentially due to the mutual relation of such particles. But the theories attributing the determination of the elements to the attractions and repulsions of the poles require no such condition, i.e. there is no reason apparent why the attraction of the positive pole, and the repulsion of the negative pole, upon a particle of free acid, placed in water between them, should not (with equal currents of electricity) be as strong as if that particle were previously combined with alkali; but, on the contrary, as they have not a powerful chemical affinity to overcome, {{there is every reason to}} suppose they would be stronger, and would sooner bring the acid to rest at the positive pole[A]. Yet such is not the case, as has been shown by the experiments on free and combined <b>acid</b> (<b>526.</b> 528.).|$|E

The relative reduction of large plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers and the absent VWF triplet structure {{was consistent with}} type 2 A (phenotype IIC) VWD. Surprisingly, platelet VWF was completely deficient of multimers beyond the VWF protomer, suggesting defective α-granular storage of larger multimers. Patients were nearly unresponsive to desmopressin acetate, consistent {{with a lack of}} regulated VWF release from endothelial cell Weibel-Palade bodies, suggesting defective storage also in endothelial cells. We identified an N 528 S homozygous mutation in the VWF propeptide D 2 domain, predicting the introduction of an additional N-glycosylation site at amino <b>acid</b> <b>526</b> in close vicinity to a “CGLC” disulphide isomerase consensus sequence. Expression studies in mammalian cells demonstrated that N 528 S-VWF was neither normally multimerized nor trafficked to storage granules. However, propeptide containing the N 528 S mutation trafficked normally to storage granules. Our data indicate that the patients' phenotype is the result of defective multimerization, storage, and secretion. In addition, we have identified a potentially novel pathogenic mechanism of VWD, namely a transportation and storage defect of mature VWF due to defective interaction with its transporter, the mutant propeptide...|$|E

Dengue non-structural protein 3 (NS 3) is an essential, multifunctional, viral enzyme with two distinct domains; a protease domain required for processing of the viral polyprotein, and a helicase domain required for replication of the viral genome. In this study ten unique human antibody fragments (Fab) that specifically bind dengue NS 3 were isolated from a diverse library of Fab clones using phage display technology. The binding site {{of one of these}} antibodies, Fab 3 F 8, has been precisely mapped to the third α-helix within subdomain III of the helicase domain (amino <b>acids</b> <b>526</b> – 531).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify the 58 -kDa inner ear protein against which the sera of some patients with idiopathic, progressive sensorineural hearing loss or Ménière's disease strongly react. BACKGROUND: We and other groups have previously demonstrated that a 58 -kDa protein extracted from guinea pig or bovine inner ear tissue is a target of antibodies in serum samples from some patients with autoimmune inner ear diseases. METHODS: After separation of inner ear proteins by 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the bands corresponding to 58 kDa were localized and excised from the gel. The concentrated protein was then digested with trypsin, and the peptide fragments were separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Three fractions were subjected to amino acid sequencing by the classic Edman degradation. RESULTS: The sequence of a stretch of 14 amino acids of the first fragment was identical to that of amino <b>acids</b> <b>526</b> to 539 of the COCH 5 B 2 protein. The sequences of 11 and 10 amino acids of the second and third fragments, respectively, also were identical to residues 417 to 427 and 396 to 405 of the COCH 5 B 2 protein. These data, together with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot experiments, confirmed that the 58 -kDa inner ear protein is the COCH 5 B 2 protein. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that the 58 -kDa target protein of antibodies in serum samples of patients with autoimmune inner ear diseases is the COCH 5 B 2 protein, a molecule that is highly and specifically expressed in the cochlea and vestibule...|$|R

Adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV- 2) nonstructural protein Rep 78 inhibits members of the cAMP signal transduction pathway, the protein kinases PKA and PRKX. We mapped the kinase binding and inhibition domain of Rep 78 for PRKX to amino <b>acids</b> (aa) <b>526</b> to 561 and that for PKA to aa 526 to 621. These polypeptides were as potent as full-length Rep 78 in kinase inhibition, {{which suggests that the}} kinase-inhibitory domain is entirely contained in these Rep peptides. Steady-state kinetic analysis of Rep 78 -mediated inhibition of PKA and PRKX showed that Rep 78 appears to increase the Km value of the peptide kinase substrate, while the maximal velocity of the reaction was unaffected. This indicates that Rep 78 acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the peptide kinase substrate. We detected homology between a cellular pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKA, the protein kinase inhibitor PKI, and the PRKX and PKA inhibition domains of Rep 78. Due to this homology and the competitive inhibition mechanism of Rep 78, we propose that Rep 78 inhibits PKA and PRKX kinase activity by pseudosubstrate inhibition...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} no universally accepted numbering convention for the antiviral drug-related resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase (rt) {{domain of the}} human hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase. The published inconsistencies have resulted from different HBV genotypes. A standardized numbering system for HBV polymerase is proposed. The new system is based on functional observations of HBV surface gene proteins (preS 1, preS 2, and HBsAg) and on the current convention used for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) polymerase proteins (protease, rt, and integrase), in which the amino acid numbering restarts at the first codon position of each domain. The HBV polymerase protein {{can be divided into}} 4 domains (terminal protein, spacer, rt, ribonuclease H) and each of these can be numbered separately. In this proposal, the HBV rt domain starts with the highly conserved EDWGPCDEHG motif, contains 344 amino acids, and the lamivudine-related resistance mutations are found at amino acid rtL 180 M (previously amino <b>acid</b> 528, <b>526,</b> 515, or 525) and rtM 204 V/I (previously 552, 550, 539, or 549).

Deletions of amino acids 15 to 149, 15 to 169, or 149 to 169 attenuated but did not abolish transforming activity, as assayed by focus formation and anchorage-independent growth. These deletions also had only slight effects on the tyrosine kinase activity of the mutant src protein. Deletion of amino acids 169 to 264 or 15 to 264 completely abolished transforming activity, and src kinase activity was reduced at least 10 -fold. However, these mutant viruses generated low levels of transforming virus by recombination with the cellular src gene.

Until now, these amino <b>acids</b> (Mr = <b>526)</b> were found to occur in urine only as higher molecular weight (Mr = 1, 000 – 1, 500) peptides. Thus, the previously used analytical methods required, as the first step, acid hydrolysis of the urine at elevated temperature to liberate D and I from their peptides. The analytical method described here uses HPLC followed by electrospray ionization MS for the detection and quantitation of free D and I in unhydrolyzed urine. Identities of both D and I were established by their retention times on LC and by their mass ion at 526 atomic mass units, characteristic of each compound. The sensitivity of the method is 0. 10 ng.

40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} {{among new}} cases of tuberculosis (TB) is increasingly becoming a significant problem in countries with a high prevalence of TB and with inadequate therapies for TB. Rifampin resistance is widely used as a marker for multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB; therefore, {{a new approach to}} the retrospective measurement of rifampin resistance without the need of a viable culture has been introduced. In many developing countries culture is unavailable and diagnosis relies on clinical manifestations and the results of Ziehl-Neelsen staining of sputum smears. We determined rifampin resistance directly with DNA extracts from Ziehl-Neelsen-stained slides by identification of mutations in the rpoB gene using reverse line blot hybridization and DNA sequencing. Analysis of the rpoB gene revealed that samples containing rifampin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis carried altered codons representing amino <b>acid</b> positions 516, <b>526,</b> and 531 of the RNA polymerase. Although the sensitivities of both methods were equal (84 %), sequencing of the rpoB gene was more accurate in identifying mutations in the core region of the rpoB gene. Sequence analysis of the rpoB gene in extracts from Ziehl-Neelsen-stained slides may be used to quantify more precisely the magnitude of MDR TB and, more importantly, provide information on trends in the development of resistance on a global scale. The nature of rifampin resistance and the genotype can be determined by analysis of Ziehl-Neelsen-stained slides in a laboratory equipped for sequencing and spoligotyping without the need to ship biohazardous materials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mutations in rpoB, {{the gene}} {{encoding}} the β subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, {{are associated with}} rifampin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Several {{studies have been conducted}} where minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, which is defined as the minimum concentration of the antibiotic in a given culture medium below which bacterial growth is not inhibited) of rifampin has been measured and partial DNA sequences have been determined for rpoB in different isolates of M. tuberculosis. However, no model has been constructed to predict rifampin resistance based on sequence information alone. Such a model might provide the basis for quantifying rifampin resistance status based exclusively on DNA sequence data and thus eliminate the requirements for time consuming culturing and antibiotic testing of clinical isolates. Results Sequence data for amino acid positions 511 – 533 of rpoB and associated MIC of rifampin for different isolates of M. tuberculosis were taken from studies examining rifampin resistance in clinical samples from New York City and throughout Japan. We used tree-based statistical methods and random forests to generate models of the relationships between rpoB amino acid sequence and rifampin resistance. The proportion of variance explained by a relatively simple tree-based cross-validated regression model involving two amino <b>acid</b> positions (<b>526</b> and 531) is 0. 679. The first partition in the data, based on position 531, results in groups that differ one hundredfold in mean MIC (1. 596 μg/ml and 159. 676 μg/ml). The subsequent partition based on position 526, the most variable in this region, results in a > 354 -fold difference in MIC. When considered as a classification problem (susceptible or resistant), a cross-validated tree-based model correctly classified most (0. 884) of the observations and was very similar to the regression model. Random forest analysis of the MIC data as a continuous variable, a regression problem, produced a model that explained 0. 861 of the variance. The random forest analysis of the MIC data as discrete classes produced a model that correctly classified 0. 942 of the observations with sensitivity of 0. 958 and specificity of 0. 885. Conclusions Highly accurate regression and classification models of rifampin resistance can be made based on this short sequence region. Models may be better with improved (and consistent) measurements of MIC and more sequence data. </p...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Rhodococcus equi (R. equi) is an {{important}} cause of bronchopneumonia in foals. Antimicrobial susceptibility data for equine R. equi isolates are still scarce. The goal of the current research {{was to determine the}} antimicrobial susceptibility of recent equine R. equi isolates. MAIN CONCLUSION: Acquired antimicrobial resistance towards macrolides in R. equi isolates from Belgian foals is not very prevalent. The presence of low level acquired resistance towards rifampicin might be clinically relevant and can be attributed to point mutations in the rpoB gene. APPROACH: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on twenty-three R. equi isolates with the agar dilution assay. using Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5 % sheep blood (rifampicin, the macrolides and tetracycline) or 5 % lysed horse blood (sulfisoxazole and trimethoprim). Plates were incubated at 35 °C for 20 - 24 hours in an aerobic atmosphere. Since no clinical breakpoints or wild type cut-off values are available for R. equi, acquired resistance was assumed when MIC values showed a bimodal or multimodal distribution or tailing. The two isolates showing acquired resistance towards rifampicin and three at random selected wild type isolates were used for PCR amplification and sequencing of the rpoB gene. RESULTS: The ranges of MIC values were similar to MIC ranges described earlier. The distribution of the MIC values for the macrolides, tetracycline, sulfisoxazole and trimethoprim showed a unimodal distribution. The distribution of the MIC values for rifampicin showed a trimodal distribution with two isolates (8. 7 %) showing low level acquired resistance. One isolate had an MIC value of 1 µg/ml and one isolate showed an MIC value of 8 µg/ml, while the MIC range of the wild type population was 0. 06 – 0. 25 µg/ml. The three wild type isolates showed identical rpoB sequences. The isolates showing acquired resistance contained point mutations in the rpoB gene when compared to the wild type isolates at the amino <b>acids</b> His <b>526</b> and Ser 531, respectively. The isolate with MIC 1 µg/ml showed a His 526 Asn mutation. The isolate with MIC 8 µg/ml showed a Ser 531 Leu mutation. INTERPRETATION: There was no acquired resistance towards the tested antimicrobial agents according to the microbiological criterion, except for rifampicin. Considering that there are no veterinary clinical breakpoints for R. equi and that the therapeutic result is also strongly dependent on the stage of infection, the lack of acquired resistance does not guarantee a successful therapy. On the other hand, the presence of acquired resistance can indeed hamper the in vivo efficiency of the antimicrobial agent. Even though the current collection of isolates is relatively small, these results suggest that acquired antimicrobial resistance against macrolides is not very common in recent equine isolates obtained in Belgium. The presence of rifampicin resistance in more than 8 % of the isolates emphasizes the importance of the combination therapy (rifampicin + macrolide). Even though the clinical importance of low and high level resistance is currently not described, there are serious indications that at least high level resistance is clinically relevant. SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: The current results acknowledge that the combination therapy (rifampicin + macrolide) remains first choice antimicrobial therapy for treating rhodococcosis in horses in Belgium...|$|R
