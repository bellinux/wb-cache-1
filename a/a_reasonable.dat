5|$|Much of Alvarado's trial {{focused on}} whether Alvarado was in custody or not during his police interview. According to Thompson v.

50|$|This type of warrant is {{required}} when the search {{proposed by the}} enforcement agency may result in an invasion of <b>a</b> person's <b>reasonable</b> expectation of privacy.

5|$|The {{rational}} nexus test {{does not}} apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner. Instead, a modified rational nexus test is used, which requires a court to consider whether there is <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> nexus between the state action taken and {{the object of the}} law. Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency, unless this occurs on a very substantial scale. In addition, inequalities arising from <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1).|$|E

50|$|The {{subjective}} standard and objective standard are legal standards for knowledge or beliefs of {{a defendant in}} a criminal law case. An objective standard of reasonableness requires the finder of fact to view the circumstances {{from the standpoint of}} <b>a</b> hypothetical <b>reasonable</b> person, absent the unique particular physical and psychological characteristics of the defendant. A {{subjective standard}} of reasonableness asks whether the circumstances would produce <b>an</b> honest and <b>reasonable</b> belief in <b>a</b> person having the particular mental and physical characteristics of the defendant, such as their personal knowledge and personal history, when the same circumstances might not produce the same in <b>a</b> general <b>reasonable</b> person.|$|R

5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful decompression {{is that the}} depth and ascent rate of the diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> tolerance for variation in depth and rate of ascent, but unless the decompression is being monitored in real time by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control depth and ascent rate, or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at the surface.|$|E

5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then {{we have no reason}} for assuming that they are also the consequent of <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E
5|$|Brady v. Maryland (1963) {{is another}} significant, {{specific}} criminal procedural right {{guaranteed by the}} due process clauses. Brady requires a criminal conviction to be reversed if the government withholds exculpatory (or impeachment) material, within the government's possession, from the defendant, and there is <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> probability that, if such material had been disclosed, {{the result of the}} proceeding would have been different ("materiality"). Brady is a holistic, rather than piece-by-piece, inquiry.|$|E
