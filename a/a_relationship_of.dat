5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{debate whether}} the Ming dynasty had sovereignty over Tibet. Some {{believe it was}} <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court. Others argue that the significant religious {{nature of the relationship}} with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. Others note the Ming need for Central Asian horses and the need to maintain the tea-horse trade.|$|E
5|$|Eager to win Lexie back, Mark {{recruits}} his protégé Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) to try {{to bring}} him back into Lexie's favour, but his plan backfires when Jackson and Lexie develop romantic feelings for each other, resulting in them starting <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> their own. Mark is furious and tries to win Lexie back, but shortly after Callie is involved in a car accident and Lexie consoles Mark. The next episode, Lexie explains that she will go back to Mark if he continues to pursue her, but she believes they ultimately aren't suited and will be unhappy. Mark agrees to let her go, giving her and Jackson his blessing.|$|E
5|$|His 1555 {{election}} for Marlborough was similar, but {{more dependent on}} influential connections. Pleydell's father had once leased the lands of Thomas Seymour in the nearby parish of Eastrop (and possibly Preshute), establishing <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> trust between the families. After Seymour's brother Edward was executed in 1552, his widow Anne inherited the responsibility of maintaining the vast estates. The Duchess appointed Pleydell as chief ranger of Savernake Forest (then under her ownership) before 1554 and as her receiver general that year. His position as ranger probably led to the acquisition of property in Chippenham and Preshute, and {{his status as a}} Preshute landholder assisted him in becoming Member for Marlborough. Pleydell, serving with Sir Andrew Baynton, replaced Peter Taylor alias Perce and John Broke of the 1554 session; they were succeeded by William Daniell and William Fleetwood in 1558 after a parliamentary hiatus following the death of Queen Mary.|$|E

5|$|Taking up his {{part-time}} professorship at the Institute of Archaeology, {{he began}} to lecture to students almost every day. There, he found that he developed <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> mutual respect with the director, Childe, despite their strong personal and professional differences. In April 1949, after the retirement of Cyril Fox, Wheeler was nominated for the Presidency of the Society of Antiquaries, but lost to James Mann; many archaeologists, including Childe and O. G. S. Crawford, resigned from the Society in protest, deeming Wheeler {{to have been a}} far more appropriate candidate for the position. Wheeler was nevertheless elected director of the Society. In 1950 he was awarded the Petrie Medal, and in 1952 was knighted. That same year he was invited to give the Norton lectures for the Archaeological Institute of America, and while in the United States was also awarded the Lucy Wharton Drexel medal at Pennsylvania. He nevertheless disliked the country, and in later life exhibited anti-Americanism.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after their}} accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by {{granting}} him the Earldom of Marlborough and Prince George was made Duke of Cumberland. Anne requested {{the use of}} Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance. William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused {{tension between the two}} sisters. Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow Prince George to serve in the military in an active capacity. The new king and queen feared that Anne's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to organise a rival political faction. From around this time, at Anne's request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, began to call each other the pet names Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman respectively, to facilitate <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> greater equality between the two when they were alone. In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James's followers, the Jacobites, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices. In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace, and refused her sister's request to dismiss Sarah from her household. Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the Lord Chamberlain, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House, the home of the Duke of Somerset. Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her. In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes. Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again. Later that year, Anne moved to Berkeley House in Piccadilly, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693.|$|E

25|$|Friendship is <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> mutual affection between people. Friendship is a {{stronger}} form of interpersonal bond than an association. Friendship {{has been studied}} in academic fields such as communication, sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles.|$|E
25|$|Undue {{influence}} is an equitable doctrine that involves one person {{taking advantage of}} a position of power over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client. As an equitable doctrine, the court has discretion.

25|$|This {{raises the}} {{question}} why does an employer ever do {{more than it is}} legally obliged to do ? One theory seeking to explain this behaviour is that employment {{is an example of a}} relational contract, based upon <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> trust between the parties. The explicit terms of the contract are just an outline as there are implicit terms and understandings which determine the behaviour of the parties. The High Court has long held there is a distinction between the employment relationship and the contract of employment.|$|E

Also, more experienced surfers can handle longer section lengths, increased velocities, and higher wave heights. Different locations offer different types of surfing conditions for each skill level.|$|E
