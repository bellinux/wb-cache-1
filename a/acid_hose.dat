Sulfuric acid {{is derived from}} hydrogen sulfide-rich waters that rise up into carbonate strata and become oxidized: 1) through abiotic reactions from mixing of waters having different concentrations of hydrogen sulfide or mixing reduced and oxygen-rich waters (Palmer, 1995), as well as 2) from biological oxidation reactions (Altas & Bartha, 1998). One of the major problems interpreting caves formed by sulfuric acid speleogenesis is recognizing the mechanisms of sulfuric acid formation. However, in modern caves containing sulfidic waters, {{there is a wide}} range of microorganisms in these systems. A vast majority of them are sulfur-oxidizing bacteria that live within cave springs and streams, as well as growing on cave-wall surfaces (Table 1). Some of these bacteria are reportedly acidophilic due to the production of sulfuric <b>acid</b> (<b>Hose</b> & Piscarowicz, 1999; Vl«ésceanu et al., in press). Therefore, sulfur-oxidizing bacterial populations can be examined as a means of understanding sulfuric acid speleogenesis. Additionally, studying the microbial communities in sulfidic caves can provide a better appreciation of other sulfidic habitats, relative microbial abundance and viability in the subsurface, and potential biogeochemical interactions pertinent to global sulfur cycling. Unfortunately, although sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms have been identified, few studies have addressed the possible geomicrobiological impacts that the microbial communities may have on the cave environment. For these reasons, this work examined sulfur-oxidizing bacterial populations from four sulfidic cave systems and tested whether their metabolic activity can enhance cave formation and modification...|$|E
