5|$|In 1776 Bewick {{became a}} partner in Beilby's workshop. The joint {{business}} prospered, becoming Newcastle's leading engraving service with <b>an</b> <b>enviable</b> reputation for high quality work and good service. In September 1776 he went to London for eight months, finding the city rude, deceitful and cruel, and much disliking the unfairness of extreme wealth and poverty side by side. He returned to his beloved Newcastle {{as soon as he}} could, but his time in the capital gave him a wider reputation, business experience, and an awareness of new movements in art.|$|E
5|$|After the 1973 {{season the}} team fired Webster, who later {{admitted}} {{his heart was}} never in head coaching, and said he more enjoyed life as an assistant. They hired retired star defensive end Andy Robustelli to run their football operations, and he picked Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger as the team's head coach. Arnsparger had built <b>an</b> <b>enviable</b> reputation as {{the architect of the}} Dolphins defense which helped the team to two Super Bowl championships. Robustelli traded their 1975 first round draft choice to the Cowboys (who used it to select Hall of Fame defensive lineman Randy White) for quarterback Craig Morton {{in the middle of the}} 1974 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1672 Churchill {{was posted}} to sea again, and on 28 May {{fought against the}} Dutch navy in the Battle of Solebay (Southwold Bay), on the Suffolk coast. He was {{possibly}} aboard the Duke of York's flagship, the Prince, which was crippled in the action. Shortly thereafter, Churchill was promoted (above the resentful head of his lieutenant) to a captaincy in the Duke of York's Admiralty Regiment. The following year Churchill gained a commendation at the Siege of Maastricht when the young captain distinguished himself {{as part of the}} 30-man forlorn hope, successfully capturing and defending part of the fortress. During this incident Churchill is credited with saving the Duke of Monmouth's life, receiving a slight wound in the process but gaining further praise from a grateful House of Stuart, as well as recognition from the House of Bourbon. King LouisXIV in person commended the deed, from which time forward bore Churchill <b>an</b> <b>enviable</b> reputation for physical courage, as well as earning the high regard of the common soldier.|$|E

25|$|UMWA's {{negotiating}} position was not <b>an</b> <b>enviable</b> one. Power utilities and {{iron and steel}} manufacturers had built up stockpiles of coal, the number of coal mines controlled by UMWA had fallen, and the 1973 oil crisis had ended (lowering the demand for coal).|$|E

25|$|Durham CCC {{was founded}} as an {{official}} entity on 23 May 1882, and the nascent club played its first competitive match on 12 June of that year, beating Northumberland by 4 wickets at the Ashbrooke Ground, Sunderland. The club established <b>an</b> <b>enviable</b> record as a minor county: becoming the first minor county to beat a first-class county in the Gillette Cup (defeating Yorkshire in round one in 1973, and then in 1985 beating Derbyshire at the same stage); winning the Minor Counties Championship a record-equalling seven times between 1901 and 1984; and putting together a record of 65 matches without defeat between 1976 and 1982 that remains unbroken to the present day.|$|E
25|$|Until 1881, the India and China {{coastal and}} river {{services}} were operated by several companies. In that year, however, these were merged into the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd, {{a public company}} under the management of Jardine's. The Jardine company pushed inland up the Yangtsze River on which a specially designed fleet was built to meet all requirements of the river trade. For many years, this fleet gave unequalled service. Jardine's established <b>an</b> <b>enviable</b> reputation for the efficient handling of shipping. As a result, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company invited the firm {{to attend to the}} Agency of their Shire Line which operated in the Far East. Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were all destroyed on December 12, 1937 when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.|$|E
25|$|The Ducks traded Joffrey Lupul, Ladislav Smid and {{a first-round}} draft pick to the Edmonton Oilers in {{exchange}} for star defenseman Chris Pronger. With this trade, solid scoring lines, a shut-down line featuring Rob Niedermayer, Samuel Pahlsson and Travis Moen and <b>an</b> <b>enviable</b> defense, the Ducks were {{considered by many to}} be a Stanley Cup favorite. On November 9, 2006, the Ducks defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6–0 at General Motors Place in Vancouver to improve their season record to 12–0–4. The win set an NHL open era record by remaining undefeated in regulation for the first 16 games of the season, eclipsing the previous mark set by the 1983–84 Edmonton Oilers (the record has since been broken by the Chicago Blackhawks' 21–0–3 start during the 2012–13 season). Anaheim were subsequently shut out by the Flames the following game, 3–0, ending their streak. On January 16, 2007, the Ducks played in their franchise's 1,000th regular season game, and on March 11, the Ducks recorded their franchise's 1,000th point with a 4–2 win over the Canucks, which improved their franchise all-time record to 423–444–155, with 1,001 points. On April 7, the Ducks won their first division title in franchise history when the Canucks defeated the second-place San Jose Sharks in the final game of the season. The Ducks ended the regular season with a 48–20–14 record and 110 points—both franchise records. Although they had three fewer wins than the Nashville Predators, the Ducks won the second seed in the West by virtue of winning the Pacific Division title as well as the Predators finishing second in the Central Division behind the Detroit Red Wings (the top seed in the West).|$|E
50|$|In the 1980, the Redcoats began a new {{decade in}} <b>a</b> very <b>enviable</b> spot: as the marching {{band of the}} {{national}} champions of football.

Then, {{there is a risk}} that the insurance market will be not available or at least sufficient. Consequently, the establishment of a special system concerning exceptionally serious accidents and a common fund are necessary...|$|R

2500|$|According to Italian {{historian}} Petacco, [...] "Garibaldi {{was ready}} to accept Lincoln's 1862 offer but on one condition: that the war's objective be declared as the abolition of slavery.

[...] Although the aging Garibaldi respectfully declined Lincoln's offer, Washington D.C. recruited many of Garibaldi's former officers.

500|$|On {{election}} day, Cleveland triumphed, {{carrying the}} entire South and many Northern states. Weaver’s performance {{was better than}} that of any third party candidate since the Civil War, as he won over a million votes—8.5 {{percent of the total}} cast nationwide. In four states, he won a plurality, giving the Populists the electoral votes of Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, and Nevada along with two more votes from North Dakota and Oregon: twenty-two in total. Weaver believed the performance [...] "a surprising success", and thought it portended good results in future elections. [...] "Unaided by money," [...] he said afterward, [...] "our grand young party has made <b>an</b> <b>enviable</b> record and achieved a surprising success at the polls." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{director}} {{disclosed that}} it was [...] "a modern day rags to riches story" [...] where the protagonist rises from humble origins to <b>an</b> <b>enviable</b> position. The venture was to be funded by A. Purnachandra Rao of Lakshmi Productions. The film would mark the director's third collaboration with Ajith Kumar in the lead after the success of Kaadhal Mannan (1998) and Amarkalam (1999). Laila Mehdin and Richa Pallod, who played the heroine in Saran's Parthen Rasithen (2000) and Alli Arjuna respectively, were to play the female lead roles. While the recording for the film's audio reportedly began on 16 March 2001, the filming was to start in mid-June and continue until August that year, followed by post-production work in September. It was planned to release the film on 14 November 2001 coinciding with Diwali. However, after finding a more engaging script in Red (2002), Ajith lost interest; he left the project after a week's shoot and the production was shelved. Following this incident, Saran stated {{that he would never}} do another film with Ajith. The pair would, however, reconcile their differences later, and collaborate on Attahasam (2004) and Aasal (2010).|$|E
500|$|The biographer Richard D. E. Burton {{comments}} that, in {{the late}} 1920s, Poulenc might have {{seemed to be in}} <b>an</b> <b>enviable</b> position: professionally successful and independently well-off, having inherited a substantial fortune from his father. He bought a large country house, Le Grande Coteau, at Noizay, Indre-et-Loire, [...] south-west of Paris, where he retreated to compose in peaceful surroundings. Yet he was troubled, struggling {{to come to terms with}} his sexuality, which was predominantly homosexual. His first serious affair was with the painter Richard Chanlaire, to whom he sent a copy of the Concert champêtre score inscribed, [...] "You have changed my life, you are the sunshine of my thirty years, a reason for living and working". Nevertheless, while this affair was in progress Poulenc proposed marriage to his friend Raymonde Linossier. As she was not only well aware of his homosexuality but was also romantically attached elsewhere, she refused him, and their relationship became strained. He suffered the first of many periods of depression, which affected his ability to compose, and he was devastated in January 1930 when Linossier died suddenly at the age of 32. On her death he wrote, [...] "All my youth departs with her, all that part of my life that belonged only to her. I sob... I am now twenty years older". His affair with Chanlaire petered out in 1931, though they remained lifelong friends.|$|E
