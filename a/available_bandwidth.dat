40|$|Abstract — In this work, {{we examine}} the {{downstream}} impediments of centralized Ethernet passive optical networks supporting LAN emulation [inter-Optical Network Units communication(ONU) ]. The <b>available</b> downstream <b>bandwidth</b> in the centralized scheme is reduced due to LAN emulation and upstream bandwidth allocation functions. The reduction in <b>available</b> downstream <b>bandwidth</b> results in degraded downstream performance. To address this problem, we implement a LAN capable distributed ring architecture, where Optical Line Terminal is relieved from the burden of upstream bandwidth allocation and inter-ONU communication. Consequently, this increases the <b>available</b> downstream <b>bandwidth</b> and thereby enhancing downstream performance in terms of queuing delay, utilization, and packet loss ratio...|$|R

25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war era the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was inundated with requests {{to set up}} new television stations. Worrying about congestion of {{the limited number of}} channels available, the FCC put a moratorium on all new licenses in 1948 while considering the problem. A solution was immediately forthcoming; rapid development of radio receiver electronics during the war had opened a wide band of higher frequencies to practical use, and the FCC set aside a large section of these new UHF bands for television broadcast. At the time, black and white television broadcasting was still in its infancy in the U.S., and the FCC started to look at ways of using this newly <b>available</b> <b>bandwidth</b> for color broadcasts. Since no existing television would be able to tune in these stations, they were free to pick an incompatible system and allow the older VHF channels to die off over time.|$|E
25|$|Fortunately, Galileo possessed an {{additional}} low-gain antenna that {{was capable of}} transmitting information back to Earth, although since it transmitted a signal isotropically, the low-gain antenna's bandwidth was significantly less than what the high-gain antenna's would have been; the high-gain antenna was to have transmitted at 134kilobits per second, whereas the low-gain antenna was only intended to transmit at about 8 to 16bits per second. Galileo low-gain antenna transmitted with a power of about 15 to 20watts, which, {{by the time it}} reached Earth and had been collected by one of the large aperture (70 m) NASA Deep Space Network antennas, had a total power of about −170dBm or 10zeptowatts (watts). Through the implementation of sophisticated technologies, the arraying of several Deep Space Network antennas and sensitivity upgrades to the receivers used to listen to Galileo signal, data throughput was increased to a maximum of 160bits per second. By further using data compression, the effective data rate could be raised to 1,000bits per second. The data collected on Jupiter and its moons was stored in the spacecraft's onboard tape recorder, and transmitted back to Earth during the long apoapsis portion of the probe's orbit using the low-gain antenna. At the same time, measurements were made of Jupiter's magnetosphere and transmitted back to Earth. The reduction in <b>available</b> <b>bandwidth</b> reduced the total amount of data transmitted throughout the mission, although 70% of Galileo science goals could still be met.|$|E
