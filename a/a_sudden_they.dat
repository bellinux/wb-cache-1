In an interview, shortly after the film's release, Paré said, [...] "Everyone liked it, and then all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>they</b> didn't like it. I was already worried about whether I should do the sequel or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the doubts}} about Lanier's {{portrayal}} as Chrissy, Silverman put {{the show on}} the network lineup, to air in March 1977, yet ordered {{a search for a}} new Chrissy. In an interview with The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation, Silverman said that Suzanne Somers barely made it {{as a member of the}} cast. [...] "I was very involved in the casting of Suzanne Somers. We did three pilots", he recalls, [...] "and the Chrissy character still wasn't right. We got to the day before we're starting the production of the series and we didn't have a Chrissy. I was so desperate, I took all the audition tapes and just kind of fast forwarded them. All of <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>they</b> went by Suzanne Somers who I hadn't seen, but I recognized her from her appearance on The Tonight Show, I said 'back that up' and she was great. She's been passed on! And I said 'I don't understand. This girl could play that part, why was she been passed on?' and I couldn't get a straight answer. Anyway, we got her in that day and she was on the set tomorrow and she was terrific in that part. And that was an accident because she never should have gotten the part.". With Somers set in the role the third pilot hastily went into production in January 1977. NRW had initially thought about recasting Ritter at the last minute before the pilot taped. Although liked by test audiences, the producers felt Ritter's foolish and clumsy portrayal of Jack made his character seem somewhat effeminate; Barry Van Dyke, and future television director Michael Lembeck, who had originally auditioned for the now renamed Jack Tripper, were initially considered to take the role. Nonetheless Silverman championed for Ritter to stay on the show. The third pilot was accepted by ABC, and [...] was followed by five additional episodes for the show's spring tryout.|$|E

60|$|The {{shouting}} and swearing went reeling away towards the water's edge, and then, all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>they</b> {{culminated in a}} fearful yell--after which came silence.|$|E
60|$|The {{four young}} hunters gazed anxiously. Then of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>they</b> saw the snake again. It came {{up through the}} tree roots almost at their feet, hissing more viciously than ever.|$|E
60|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> exclamation: <b>they</b> {{all three}} sprang {{up and looked}} at him, but alas! it was still by feeling that he came forward, though his countenance was cheerful, and there was a smile upon his lips.|$|R
50|$|When the car {{returns to}} the station and riders {{disembark}} (after <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> stop), <b>they</b> pass <b>a</b> steel door from behind which something begins to suddenly bang very loudly.

60|$|As they spied {{me there}} was a concerted rush by those nearest the {{entrance}} where we stood, but a line of radium bulbs inset along the threshold of their chamber brought them to <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> halt--evidently <b>they</b> dared not cross that line of light.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] Scott said to Hendricks. [...] "It's sure strange they {{suddenly}} came around. We've {{been using the}} claws for almost a year. Now all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>they</b> start to fold." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{trail of}} the deer led around the rocky elevation, and the three young hunters were moving through some low {{brushwood}} when of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>they</b> heard a noise ahead of them.|$|E
60|$|But {{just then}} began the {{crowning}} glory of that dawn--the opening and lighting of the buttercups. Not one did I actually see unclose, yet, of <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>they</b> were awake, and the fields once more {{a blaze of}} gold.|$|E
50|$|The {{sentence}} is carried out, and all concerned feel <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> relief as <b>they</b> leave {{the scene where}} the dead man still hangs.|$|R
50|$|Mudflows can {{be caused}} by unusually heavy rains or <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> thaw. <b>They</b> consist mainly of mud and water plus {{fragments}} of rock and other debris, so they often behave like floods.

2500|$|Cuvier’s {{theory on}} {{extinction}} has met opposition from other notable natural scientists like Darwin and Charles Lyell. [...] Unlike Cuvier, they didn’t believe that extinction was <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> process; <b>they</b> believed that like the Earth, animals collectively undergo gradual {{change as a}} species. [...] This differed widely from Cuvier’s theory, which seemed to propose that animal extinction was catastrophic.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are horse thieves everywhere," [...] said Paul. [...] "Every one {{living for}} a hundred miles around has {{suffered}} during the past ten years. Sometimes we think them wiped out, and then, all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>they</b> start up again." ...|$|E
60|$|On they walked, {{down the}} sand-strewn paths for {{a mile or}} more, {{accompanied}} by Masouda and the guard.

60|$|Let any {{one who is}} {{acquainted with}} what multitudes of people get their daily bread in this city by their labour, whether artificers or mere workmen--I say, let any man {{consider}} what must be the miserable condition of this town if, on <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>they</b> should be all turned out of employment, that labour should cease, and wages for work be no more.|$|E
60|$|The butler {{announced}} dinner. Tallente {{offered his}} arm and they passed through the homely little hall {{into the dining room}} beyond. Stella came to <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> standstill as <b>they</b> crossed the threshold.|$|R
50|$|These are {{powerful}} birds with large spear-like bills, long necks and long legs, which hunt by waiting motionless or stalking their prey {{in shallow water}} before seizing it with <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> lunge. <b>They</b> have <b>a</b> slow steady flight, with the neck retracted as is characteristic of herons and bitterns; this distinguishes them from storks, cranes, flamingos and spoonbills, which extend their necks.|$|R

6000|$|They {{had left}} him for an instant and {{were sitting in the}} front room, where Norah was {{preparing}} tea, when of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>they</b> heard a shout that rang through the house.

60|$|Here the {{inventory}} abruptly ended, {{and these two}} people found themselves staring at each other, as if of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>they</b> had heard something dreadful. I {{do not know how}} long they stood thus, motionless and horrified. I cannot tell even which stirred first. All I know is that almost simultaneously they turned from each other and hurried out of the wood in opposite directions.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{said the}} Professor with <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> {{inspiration}} as <b>they</b> {{passed through the}} garden, [...] "I think I shall explain to Mrs. Muldoon that you have just come straight from a fancy-dress ball." ...|$|R

60|$|There was a pause. His {{beautiful}} eyes flamed with <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> {{light as}} <b>they</b> rested on me. Then the lids drooped demurely, and {{he drew a}} deep breath. But when he spoke there was scorn in his voice.|$|R
60|$|Now a rumour of {{the slaying}} had got abroad among the women, {{who had heard}} cries and seen the {{flashing}} of spears above the fence, and from the women {{it had come to}} the regiment of the Bees, who advanced to the gates of the kraal singing.

60|$|Then of {{a sudden}} in the fury of that remembrance of his own dishonor, {{it was as though}} the {{strength}} of ten descended upon Sir Ewaine.

60|$|Then {{they both}} {{witnessed}} {{what they had}} never before seen in Jocelyn Thew. They saw his eyes blaze with <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> concentrated fury. <b>They</b> saw his lips part and something that was almost a snarl transform and disfigure his mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} Mr. Birdsell?" [...] she asked, {{presenting}} a powerful {{young man with}} a singularly handsome face. He had clear brown eyes and a big, graceful mustache.
