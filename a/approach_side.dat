40|$|The {{frequently}} observed lopsidedness of {{the distribution}} of stars and gas in disc galaxies is still considered as a major problem in galaxy dynamics. It is even discussed as an imprint of the formation history of discs and the evolution of baryons in dark matter haloes. Here, we analyse a selected sample of 70 galaxies from the Westerbork H i Survey of Spiral and Irregular Galaxies. The H i data allow us to follow the morphology and the kinematics out to very large radii. In the present paper, we present the rotation curves and study the kinematic asymmetry. We extract the rotation curves of receding and <b>approaching</b> <b>sides</b> separately and show that the kinematic behaviour of disc galaxies can be classified by five different types: symmetric velocity fields where the rotation curves of receding and <b>approaching</b> <b>sides</b> are almost identical; global distortions where the rotation velocities of receding and <b>approaching</b> <b>side</b> have an offset which is constant with radius; local distortions which lead to large deviations in the inner and negligible deviations in the outer parts (and vice versa); and distortions which split the galaxies into two kinematic systems, visible in the different behaviour of the rotation curves of receding and <b>approaching</b> <b>sides,</b> which leads to a crossing and a change in side. The kinematic lopsidedness is measured from the maximum rotation velocities, averaged over the plateau of the rotation curves. This gives a good estimate of global lopsidedness in the outer parts of the sample galaxies. We find that the mean value of the perturbation parameter denoting the lopsided potential as obtained from the kinematic data is 0. 056. 36 % of all sample galaxies are globally lopsided, which can be interprete...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEntry {{capacity}} {{is one of}} the most important indices for performance evaluation of roundabout. In addition to circulating vehicles, pedestrian flow is another key conflicting stream which has significant impact on entry capacity. The pedestrian impact is considered by an adjustment factor in the existing method (Brilon et al., 1993) which was developed based on the roundabouts under the design with physical splitter island, crosswalk and distance of one-vehicle length between crosswalk and yield line. Some of them such as the physical splitter island and the distance between crosswalk and yield line cannot be always satisfied due to space limitation in some places, which are considered to have significant impact on entry capacity. Moreover, it is supposed that several other influencing factors also strongly affect entry capacity, e. g., pedestrian <b>approaching</b> <b>side</b> and queuing vehicles in circulating roadway due to pedestrians across downstream exits. Therefore, a theoretical model was developed in this study to estimate roundabout entry capacity considering pedestrian impact and these influencing factors, i. e., physical splitter island, pedestrian <b>approaching</b> <b>side,</b> distance between crosswalk and yield line and queuing vehicles in circulating roadway. Through conducting sensitivity analyses it was found that the impacts of the influencing factors on entry capacity can be expressed by the proposed model. Parameters in the proposed model which is used to reflect influencing factors should be calibrated and modified by empirical data in future...|$|R

40|$|During {{anterior}} scoliosis instrumentation with a dual-rod system, the vertebrae are dissected anterolaterally. After surgery, {{some patients}} report {{a change in}} temperature perception and perspiration in the lower extremities. Sympathetic lesions might be an explanation for this. The aim of this clinical {{study was to investigate}} sympathetic function after anterior scoliosis instrumentation. A total of 24 female patients with idiopathic scoliosis (mean age at follow-up, 23. 8  years) who had undergone anterior instrumentation on average 6. 6  years earlier were included. Due to the suspected relevance of the sympathetic L 2 ganglion, two groups were created: a T 12 group, in which instrumentation down to T 12 was carried out (n =  12), and an L 3 group, in which instrumentation down to L 3 was done (n =  12). Sympathetic function was assessed by measuring skin temperature {{at the back of the}} foot, a plantar ninhydrin sweat test and sympathetic skin responses (SSRs) following electrical stimulation. The side on which the surgical approach was carried out was compared with the contralateral, control side. Health-related quality of life was investigated using the Scoliosis Research Society SRS- 22 patient questionnaire. In the T 12 group, mean temperatures of 29. 6 °C on the side of the approach versus 29. 5 °C on the control side were measured (P >  0. 05); in the L 3 group, the mean temperatures were 33. 2 °C on the <b>approach</b> <b>side</b> versus 30. 5 °C on the control side (P =  0. 001). A significant difference between the T 12 group and the L 3 group (P <  0. 001) was observed on the <b>approach</b> <b>side,</b> but not on the control side (P =  0. 15). The ninhydrin sweat test showed reduced perspiration in 11 of 12 patients in the L 3 group on the <b>approach</b> <b>side</b> in comparison with the control side (P =  0. 002). In the T 12 group, no significant differences were noted between the left and right feet. SSRs differed significantly between the two groups (P =  0. 005). They were detected in all nine analyzable patients in the T 12 group on both sides. In the L 3 group, they were found on the <b>approach</b> <b>side</b> only in 4 of 11 analyzable patients versus 11 patients on the control side. The results of the SRS- 22 questionnaire did not show any significant differences between the two groups. In conclusion, anterior scoliosis instrumentation with a dual-rod system including vertebrae down to L 3 regularly leads to lesions in the sympathetic trunk. These are detectable with an increase in temperature, reduced perspiration and reduced SSRs. The caudal level of instrumentation (T 12 vs. L 3) has an impact on the extent of impairment, supporting the suspected importance of the L 2 ganglion. The clinical outcome does not seem to be significantly limited by sympathetic trunk lesions...|$|E

40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} (MI) lumbar decompression {{became a}} common approach to treat lumbar stenosis. This approach may potentially mitigate postoperative increases in segmental motion. The {{goal of this}} study was to evaluate modifications to segmental motion in the lumbar spine following a MI unilateral approach as compared to traditional facet-sparing and non-facet sparing decompressions. Six human lumbar cadaveric specimens were used. Each specimen was tested in flexion-extension 0 N and 400 N of follower preload), axial rotation, and lateral bending. Each testing condition was evaluated following three separate interventions at L 4 -L 5 : 1) Minimally invasive decompression, 2) Facet-sparing, bilateral decompression, and 3) Bilateral decompression with a wide facetectomy. Range of motion following each testing condition was compared to intact specimens. Both MI and traditional decompression procedures create significant increases in ROM in all modes of loading. However, when compared to the MI approach, traditional decompression produces significantly larger increase in ROM in flexion-extension (p< 0. 005) and axial rotation (p< 0. 05). It additionally creates increased ROM with lateral bending on the <b>approach</b> <b>side</b> (p< 0. 05). Lateral bending on the non-approach side is not significantly changed. Lastly, wide medial facet removal (40 % to 50 %) causes significant hypermobility, especially in axial rotation. While both MI and traditional lumbar decompressions may increase post-operative ROM in all conditions, a MI approach causes significantly smaller increase in ROM. With an MI approach, increased movement with lateral bending is only toward the <b>approach</b> <b>side.</b> Further, non-facet sparing decompression is further destabilizing in all loading modes...|$|E
