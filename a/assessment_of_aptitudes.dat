ObjectivesA meta-analysis was conducted to investigate whether aptitude assessment can be used to predict variability in the acquisition and performance of laparoscopic skills. MethodsPubMed, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched to November 2014 for published and unpublished studies reporting the measurement of a form <b>of</b> <b>aptitude</b> for laparoscopic skills. The quality of studies was assessed with QUADAS- 2. Summary correlations were calculated using a random-effects model. ResultsThirty-four studies were found to be eligible for inclusion; six of these studies used an operating room performance measurement. Laparoscopic skills correlated significantly with visual-spatial ability (r= 0. 32, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 25 - 0. 39; p ConclusionsIn general, aptitude assessments are associated with laparoscopic skill level.

The Situational Judgement Test is a multiple-choice <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>aptitude</b> for employment and professional attributes as they relate to medicine.

Along with the UK Foundation Programme Office, the Medical Schools Council continues to administer the Situational Judgement Test through MSC Assessment.

Aim: To investigate reliability and acceptability of five-station multiple mini-interview (MMI) model for resident selection into an internal medicine residency program in the United States. Setting: One independent academic medical center. Participants: Two hundred and thirty-seven applicants and 17 faculty interviewers. Program description: Five, 10 -min MMI stations with five different interviewers blinded to the candidate’s records and one traditional 20 -min interview with the program director. Candidates were rated on two items: interpersonal and communication skills, and overall performance. Program evaluation: Generalizability data showed that the reliability of our process was high (0. 9). The results of anonymous surveys demonstrated that both applicants and interviewers consider the MMI as a fair and more effective tool to evaluate non-cognitive traits, and prefer the MMI to standard interviews.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Concerns {{continue}} about recruitment {{levels of}} junior doctors into psychiatry in the UK. AIMS: To report career choices for and career progression in psychiatry. METHOD: Postal questionnaire surveys of qualifiers from all UK medical schools in eight qualification years since 1974. RESULTS: Totals of 75 % (21, 845 out of 28, 980) and 74 % (17, 741 out of 24, 044) of doctors responded at {{one and three}} years after qualification. One and three years after qualification, 4 - 5 % of doctors chose psychiatry. This has changed very little between 1974 and 2000.

40|$|AbstractAims: In this work, a {{population}} of 88 descendants derived from three wine strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was tested for the enological trait 'wine colour adsorption' (WCA) to evaluate its inheritability. Methods and Results: The WCA phenotype was tested on plate agar medium specifically formulated for the purpose. After 10 days of anaerobic incubation at 28 °C, a computer-assisted <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> WCA <b>aptitude</b> <b>of</b> the yeasts was carried out. The biomass colour – ranging from white to dark brown – reflects the adsorption of grape pigments: white and dark brown biomass colour corresponds to low and high adsorption, respectively. In order to confirm biomass colour results, microvinification trials using red must were performed, and the obtained wines were analysed. Conclusions: The analysis of the progeny demonstrated that the enological trait WCA is inheritable and polygenic. Significance and Impact of the Study: A way to describe the polygenic effect of the WCA trait has been found, also showing that this trait is inheritable. The impact of the work revolves more around the large-scale screening method, which could then assist in breeding wine yeast, and {{can also be used}} as a scientific tool to investigate WCA trait...|$|R

A 37 -item questionnaire adapted from the 'Almost Perfect Scale-Revised' (APS-R) (Slaney, Rice, Mobley, Trippi, & Ashby, 2001) and the 'Self-Description Questionnaire I' (SDQ) (Marsh, Relich, & Smith, 1983) was administered in a classroom setting. Dependent upon their APS-R scores, participants were sorted into three comparison groups: (i) adaptive perfectionists (ii) maladaptive perfectionists and (iii) non-perfectionists. Pearson correlation, univariate analysis, hierarchical regression analysis and independent-samples t-tests were employed to assess the links among the variables. Results showed perfectionism was directly and indirectly correlated to academic achievement, with academic self-concept as a significant mediator. High achievers were associated with adaptive perfectionism and high academic self-concept.

We test whether these factors {{have an effect on}} the predation rates of three plant-inhabiting predators that are used as biological control agents, Dicyphus tamaninii Wagner, Macrolophus caliginosus Wagner, and Orius majusculus (Reuter), at high and low densities of pupae of Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood. Continuous behavioral observations of the three species were done on a non-enclosed plant, thus allowing predators to visit different plant locations and to leave the plant at their will. We compared the current results with the ones obtained in a previous functional response experiment. We found that predators' plant-departure tendency at low prey density was the main reason for differences found in attack rates between experiments. The predators' preference for laying eggs in the stem, thus spending time in prey-free areas, explained the differences found in attack rates at high prey density. Our results provide more realistic information on predators' performance to better assess their suitability as biological control agents. Predator behavioral differences depending on prey densities allow for a complementary use of these predators for biological control...|$|R

This share is 6. 5 % for Italy.

Given the widespread forests in Italy, {{it is very important}} to have an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>aptitude</b> <b>of</b> this sector to act as a carbon sink. In this study we analysed the variation of forestland cover in a mountain area of the Veneto Region (NE Italy). The analysis was done by comparing aerial photos taken in 1991 with orthophotos reported to 2003, by photointerpretation of points with casual distribution on sample areas, according to a stratified sampling. We estimated a statistically relevant increment of about 0. 095 % of forest land only up to 1500 m compared to the estimated forest cover for 1990 (about 42 ha), underlining how this low increase is mainly due to forest management. The second step was to estimate the fixed carbon in the areas where forests increased. This was achieved by collecting biometrical data in the field, and then using allometric functions. The annual carbon sink was estimated as 0. 69 Mg ha- 1 year- 1. Comparing these results with previous studies done in the pre-alpine region we estimate the annual increment of the forest area in the whole Veneto region to be about 409. 94 ha and that the total carbon sink is about 282. 86 Mg C year- 1. A method for estimating carbon sink in afforestation/reforestation areas is proposed that could also be applied to other sites in Italy...|$|R

Material and methods : An anonymous questionnaire study was carried out among the patients of the Institute of Rheumatology in Warsaw in the fourth quarter of 2012. Five hundred questionnaires were distributed, and 397 questionnaires were collected and accepted for further analysis (response rate = 79 %). Results: Overweight or obesity was present in more than half (53 %) of the patients (overweight in 30. 5 % of respondents, obesity in 22. 6 %). Among obese subjects, 43 % of men and 37 % of women in the study think that their diet is correct. Sixty-eight percent of respondents declared that they do not follow any special diet and only 18 % declared that they follow a diet with a reduced quantity of monosaccharides (no sweets). A milk-free diet was followed by 7 % of respondents, a meat-free diet by 6 %, and a fruit-and-vegetable diet by 5 %. Dietary supplements were regularly used by 26. 7 % of respondents, whereas 33. 8 % did not use them at all. The average <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> physical <b>aptitude</b> (Health <b>Assessment</b> Questionnaire – HAQ) in the group of respondents was 0. 71.
