5|$|The {{content is}} divided into five parts. The first part, Ancient Balances, {{considers}} psychological and historical aspects of debt. Atwood calls debt an imaginative human construct derived from <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of need or greed and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of fairness in reciprocity and equivalent values. She cites a study by Frans de Waal that suggests <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of fairness may be a genetic trait shared with other primates, and a study by Robert Axelrod which illustrates, given a level playing field, that the tit-for-tat strategy (or 'Do unto others as they have done onto you' strategy) was the most superior strategy in game theory. Debt and borrowing mechanisms from ancient and biblical societies are compared, including provisions from the Code of Hammurabi, Ancient Egyptians, and the Greco-Roman mythologies.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the different ethnic groups of the Dutch East Indies– modern day Indonesia– began to feel <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of national unity, as eventually formulated in the 1928 Youth Pledge. These native groups founded political parties to further their goals and represent their political ideologies, including the Indonesian Communist Party and Indonesian National Party.|$|E

5|$|Emma Thompson (born 15 April 1959) is a British {{actress and}} screenwriter.

Another novel, Cermin Buah Keroyalan (Mirror of the Fruit of Royalty), and stage play, Kromo Bergerak (Kromo is Moving), were published not long after.|$|E

The god of the seas, according to Chinese folklore, was a large whale with human limbs.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{penultimate}} novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories. In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in The Times, Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, , gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920, while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Kraków, Poland, {{over the course of}} 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it as a documentary.

5|$|Ruisdael's {{work from}} c. 1646 {{to the early}} 1650s, when {{he was living in}} Haarlem, is characterised by simple motifs and careful and {{laborious}} study of nature: dunes, woods, and atmospheric effects. By applying heavier paint than his predecessors, Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality, conveying <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of sap flowing through branches and leaves. His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented at the time: the genera of his trees are the first to be unequivocally recognisable by modern-day botanists. His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work: <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of spaciousness and luminosity, and an airy atmosphere achieved through pointillist-like touches of chalk. Most of his thirty black chalk sketches that survive date from this period.|$|E
