5|$|For {{many years}} Quélet's name and {{description}} {{were treated as}} valid because Bulliard's name antedated Persoon's. However, in 1950, {{a change in the}} International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (termed the Stockholm Code, after the city where the International Botanical Congress was being held) caused only names on fungi published after 1801 or 1821 (depending on their type) to be valid. This meant that suddenly Bulliard's name was no longer a valid name, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Persoon's name that had priority. Nonetheless it was a well-known name, and the already chaotic situation caused by a change to a famous Latin name was further complicated by another of Quélet's suggestions. He had in 1886 proposed a new, broader genus that included all pink-gilled fungi with adnate or sinuate gills and angular spores: Rhodophyllus. These two approach to genus placement, using either Rhodophyllus or Entoloma, coexisted for many decades, with mycologists and guidebooks following either; Henri Romagnesi, who studied the genus for over forty years, favoured Rhodophyllus, as initially did Rolf Singer. However, most other authorities have tended to favour Entoloma, and Singer conceded the name was far more widely used and adopted it for his Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy text in 1986.|$|E

The Corporation of Newcastle used the opportunity of the necessary Parliamentary Bill for the amalgamation to insist on construction of the abandoned porte-cochère, and this was designed by Thomas Prosser and completed in 1863.|$|E

25|$|Portugal {{had been}} the first European power to {{establish}} a colony in Africa when it captured Ceuta in 1415 <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of the last to leave. The departure of the Portuguese from Angola and Mozambique increased the isolation of Rhodesia, where white minority rule ended in 1980 when the territory gained international recognition as the Republic of Zimbabwe with Robert Mugabe as the head of government. The former Portuguese territories in Africa became sovereign states with Agostinho Neto (followed in 1979 by José Eduardo dos Santos) in Angola, Samora Machel (followed in 1986 by Joaquim Chissano) in Mozambique and Luís Cabral (followed in 1980 by Nino Vieira) in Guinea-Bissau, as heads of state.|$|E
25|$|On 16 April 1979, BBC2 {{adopted the}} world's first computer-generated ident, with the logo being drawn live {{every time it}} was played. This version of the 2 had orange double lines either side and the 2 itself was cream double lined. This stripy 2 had been used on {{promotions}} and holding slides for years prior to its launch, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{part of a bigger}} branding package. For {{the first few years of}} the ident, it would be accompanied by a fanfare as it scrolled onto the screen. There were versions of the ident where the ident scrolled on, scrolled off and remained static. The clock used alongside this high tec 3D ident, was anything but. The old clock filmed from the NODD room survived, with a new 2D logo and sporting black and orange colours. However, in 1980, BBC2 got its own electronic clock including 3D legend and centre dot.|$|E
500|$|Moffat's plan [...] "from the outset", to tie {{the episode}} into the {{overarching}} story arc of the series, was that Rory not just die but be erased from history in {{the crack in the}} universe. Moffat would later bring Rory back in [...] "The Pandorica Opens", though the episode reveals his consciousness was placed in a Roman centurion Auton as part of a trap for the Doctor to save the universe from the cracks. Moffat also thought it was appropriate as the trio had had fun, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time for a casualty. Rory's death is also connected with Chibnall's theme of making mistakes; it was the Doctor's fault as he stopped to look at the crack. Gillan called the scene [...] "incredibly challenging" [...] for her to perform and tried to make it [...] "truthful and believable".|$|E

500|$|While many of Rubber Souls {{prominent}} {{songs were}} {{the product of}} Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting, it also featured distinct compositions from each, though they continued to share official credit. The song [...] "In My Life", of which each later claimed lead authorship, is considered a highlight of the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue. Harrison called Rubber Soul his [...] "favourite album" [...] and Starr {{referred to it as}} [...] "the departure record". McCartney has said, [...] "We'd had our cute period, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to expand." [...] However, recording engineer Norman Smith later stated that the studio sessions revealed signs of growing conflict within the group – [...] "the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious", he wrote, and [...] "as far as Paul was concerned, George could do no right". In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Rubber Soul fifth among [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time", and AllMusic's Richie Unterberger describes it as [...] "one of the classic folk-rock records".|$|E
500|$|In August 1965, the Beatles {{released}} the McCartney composition [...] "Yesterday", featuring a string quartet. Included on the Help! LP, {{the song was}} the group's first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member. [...] "Yesterday" [...] {{became one of the}} most covered songs in popular music history. Later that year, during recording sessions for the album Rubber Soul, McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band. Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote, [...] "from ... would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and de facto musical director of the Beatles." [...] Critics described Rubber Soul as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band's music and lyrics. Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney said they had written the music for the song [...] "In My Life". McCartney said of the album, [...] "we'd had our cute period, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to expand." [...] Recording engineer Norman Smith stated that the Rubber Soul sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: [...] "the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious... as far as Paul was concerned, George [...] could do no right—Paul was absolutely finicky." ...|$|E
500|$|Parsons and Moore {{devised a}} method of communication; one knock for yes, two knocks for no. [...] Using this system, the ghost {{appeared}} to claim that Fanny had been murdered. [...] It was conjectured that the mysterious figure in white which so terrified James Franzen, presumed to be the ghost of Elizabeth, had appeared there to warn her sister of her impending death. [...] As the first ghost had seemingly vanished, this charge against Kent—that he murdered Elizabeth—was never acted on, but through repeated questioning of Fanny's ghost it was divined that she had died not {{from the effects of}} smallpox, but rather from arsenic poisoning. [...] The deadly toxin had apparently been administered by Kent about two hours before Fanny died <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> supposed, her spirit wanted justice. [...] Moore had heard from Parsons how Kent had pursued the debt he was owed, and he had also heard from Ann Lynes, who had complained that as Fanny's coffin lid was screwed down she {{had not been able to}} see her sister's corpse. [...] Moore thought that Fanny's body might not show any visible signs of smallpox and that if she had been poisoned, the lack of scarring would have been something Kent would rather keep hidden. [...] As a clergyman with inclinations toward Methodism he was inclined to trust the ghost, but for added support he enlisted the aid of Thomas Broughton, an early Methodist. [...] Broughton visited Cock Lane on 5January and left convinced the ghost was real. [...] The story spread through London, The Public Ledger began to publish detailed accounts of the phenomenon, and Kent fell under public suspicion as a murderer.|$|E

In 1962, over the strong objections of Frankfurter, the Court agreed that questions regarding malapportionment in state legislatures were not political issues, and thus were not outside the Court's purview.
