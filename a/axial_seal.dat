Many of these applications do not incorporate an effective filtration system for removing rust particles from the secondary air systems thereby resulting in rust deposits.

40|$|Turbomachinery sealing is a {{challenging}} problem {{due to the}} varying clearances caused by thermal transients, vibrations, bearing lift-off etc. Leakage reduction has significant benefits in improving engine efficiency and reducing emissions. Conven-tional labyrinth seals have to be assembled with large clearances to avoid rubbing during large rotor transients. This results in large leakage and lower efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel Progressive Clearance Labyrinth Seal {{that is capable of}} providing passive fluidic feedback forces that balance at a small tip-clearance. A modified packing ring is supported on flexures and employs progressively tighter teeth from the upstream to the downstream direction. When the tip-clearance reduces below the equilibrium clearance, fluidic feedback forces cause the packing ring to open. Conversely, when the tip-clearance increases above the equilibrium clearance, the fluidic feedback forces cause the packing ring to close. Due to this self-correcting behavior, the seal provides high differential pressure capability, low leakage and non-contact operation even in the presence of large rotor transients. Theoretical models for the feedback phenomenon have been developed and validated by experimental results.

As the rotor and vanes turn, each vane is first pushed radially inward followed by a maximum radial extension and that happens twice per revolution.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{is presented to}} predict the oil film thickness in an <b>axial</b> <b>sealing</b> contact based on grease properties and operating conditions. It is assumed that {{a small amount of}} grease will form an oil reservoir on the rotating part and slowly supply oil to the sealing contact. The oil bleed model from a previous study is implemented and oil loss due to centrifugal forces and the seal pumping action are taken into account. The results show that, depending on the operating conditions, an oil film is present in the sealing contact for a certain period of time. The oil film thickness decreases in time due to the decreasing oil supply from the grease reservoir and oil loss from the contact due to centrifugal forces. Seal pumping has only a small effect and the seal material and geometry are therefore not important for the predicted time until the mixed lubrication regime is reached. This time depends on the oil viscosity, rotational speed, and seal contact radius and scales with the η /(n 2 ·ds) parameter.

40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} contain seals to keep lubricant {{inside and}} contaminants outside the bearing system. These systems are often lubricated with grease; the grease {{acts as a}} lubricant for the bearing and seal and improves the sealing efficiency. In this thesis, the influence of lubricating grease on bearing seal performance is studied. Rheological properties of the grease, i. e. shear stress and normal stress difference, are evaluated and related to the lubricating and sealing performance of the sealing system. This includes the seal, grease and counterface. The grease velocity profile in the seal pocket in-between two sealing lips {{is dependent on the}} rheological properties of the grease. The velocity profile in a wide pocket is evaluated using a 1 -dimensional model based on the Herschel-Bulkley model. The velocity profile in a narrow pocket, where the influence of the side walls on the velocity profile is significant, is measured using micro particle image velocimetry. Subsequently, the radial migration of contaminants into the seal pocket is modelled and related to the sealing function of the grease. Additionally, also migration in the axial direction is found {{in the vicinity of the}} sealing contact. Experimental results show that contaminant particles in different greases consistently migrate either away from the sealing contact or towards the sealing contact, also when the pumping rate of the seal can be neglected. Lubrication of the seal lip contact is dependent on several grease properties. A lubricant film in the sealing contact may be built up as in oil lubricated seals but normal stress differences in the grease within the vicinity of the contact may result in an additional lift force. The grease, which is being sheared in the vicinity of the contact, will also contribute to the frictional torque. It is important to maintain a lubricant film in the sealing contact to minimize friction and wear. Here the replenishment of oil separated from the grease, also referred to as oil bleed, is of crucial importance. A model is presented to predict this oil bleed based on oil flow through the porous grease thickener microstructure. The model is applied to an <b>axial</b> <b>sealing</b> contact and a prediction of the film thickness as a function of time is made. The work presented in the thesis gives a significant contribution to a better understanding of the influence of lubricating grease on the sealing system performance and seal lubrication conditions.

40|$|Ingress {{occurs when}} hot {{mainstream}} {{gas from the}} turbine an-nulus is ingested through a rim seal into the wheel-space between a rotating turbine disc (the rotor) and an adjacent stationary casing (the stator). The stationary vanes and rotating blades in the annulus create circumferential variations of pressure that drive hot gas inwards into the wheel-space in regions of high external pressure. This is called externally-induced ingress. (The rotating flow in the wheel-space creates a radial pressure gradient that separately promotes radially inward flow into the wheel-space. This is known as rotationally-induced ingress). The high temperature of the ingested mainstream gas in an engine can lead to fatigue and damage to important components. This paper describes simplified computational studies of externally-induced ingress into a rotor-stator system with an <b>axial</b> clearance rim <b>seal.</b> Axisymmetric steady-state computations are carried out using the commercial computational fluid dynamics code CFX. The SST model of turbulence is used. The model geometry and boundary conditions are based on an experimental rig designed and built at the University of Bath to study fundamental features of ingestion and rim seal effectiveness, in a related project having substantial industrial involvement. It is known that simplified steady flow models can significantly underestimate ingestion from the mainstream annulus into the wheel-space. In the present work, ingestion is prescribed in the steady model {{through the use of}} boundary conditions at the <b>axial</b> clearance <b>seal.</b> The computation of the flow and heat transfer in the wheel-space is validated by comparison with previously-published experimental measurements for a simple rotor-stator system without ingestion. The computations are carried out for values of rotational Reynolds number up to around 1. 25 × 10 6 as typically used in experimental studies, and using sealing air flow-rates corresponding to non-dimensional values relevant to engine applications. The computed results show that the flow structure and heat transfer in the wheel-space at high sealing flow rates agree well with measured values for rotor-stator systems, the effects of differences between geometries being mostly small. Due to the recirculating secondary flow in the wheel-space, ingested fluid is drawn toward the surface of the stator. At lower sealing flow rates, the higher swirl of the ingested mainstream flow causes changes in the flow structure in the wheel-space. The ingested mainstream flow can come into contact with the rotor, and this could have serious consequences in practice...|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional {{unsteady}} computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) {{is applied to the}} ingestion of fluid from a non-uniform mainstream annulus flow via a rim-seal into a rotor-stator wheel-space. The results provide understanding of the complex flow and information for the development of more efficient computational models and analytical 'orifice models'. The commercial CFD code CFX has been used to carry out unsteady RANS computations with an SST turbulence model. A scalar equation is employed to represent the seeded tracer gas {{that can be used in}} experiments to determine sealing effectiveness, and the variation of effectiveness with sealing flow rate is determined for a simple <b>axial</b> clearance <b>seal</b> and one combination of axial and rotational Reynolds numbers. The computational domain comprises one pitch in a row of stator vanes and rotor blades The rotating blade is accounted for by a sliding interface between the stationary and rotating sections of the model, located downstream of the seal clearance. The unsteady computations confirm that the magnitude of the peak-to-trough pressure difference in the annulus is the principal driving mechanism for ingestion (or ingress) into the wheel-space. This pressure difference is used in orifice models to predict sealing effectiveness; its magnitude however depends on the locations in the annulus and the wheel-space that are chosen for its evaluation as well as the sealing flow rate. The CFD is used to investigate the appropriateness of the locations that are often used to determine the pressure difference. It is shown that maximum ingestion occurs when the static pressure peak produced by the vane combines with that produced by the blade, and that highly swirled ingrested flow could contact both the stator and rotor disk when little sealing flow is provided. The relationships between the unsteady simulations and simplified, more computationally efficient steady computations are also investigated. For the system considered here, ingress is found to be dictated principally by the pressure distribution caused by the vane. The effect of the rotating blade on the pressure distribution in the annulus is investigated by comparing the unsteady results with those for steady models that do not involve a blade. It is found that the presence of the blade increases the pressure asymmetry in the annulus. Although the pressure asymmetry predicted by unsteady and steady models have a similar magnitude, the sealing effectiveness is over-predicted considerably for the corresponding steady model. If a "thin seal" geometric approximation is used in the steady model, however, similar effectiveness results compared with the unsteady model may be obtained much more economically...|$|R
40|$|Improvements upon current {{gas turbine}} sealing {{technology}} performance {{are essential for}} decreasing specific fuel consumption to meet stringent future efficiency targets. The clearances between rotating and static components of a gas turbine, which need to be sealed, vary over a flight cycle. Hence, a seal which can passively maintain an optimum clearance, whilst preventing contact between itself and the rotor, is extremely desirable. Various configurations of a Rolls Royce (RR) seal concept, the Large <b>Axial</b> Movement Face <b>Seal</b> (LAMFS), use static pressure forces to locate face seals. Prototypes were tested experimentally at the Osney Thermofluids Laboratory, Oxford. Firstly a proof-of concept rig (simulating a 2 -D seal cross-section) manufactured by RR was re-commissioned. The simplest configuration using parallel seal faces induced an unstable seal housing behaviour. The author used this result, CFD, and analytical methods to improve the design and provide a self-centring ability. A fully annular test rig of this new seal concept was then manufactured to simulate a 3 D engine representative seal. The full annulus eliminated leakage paths unavoidable in the simpler rig. A parametric program of experiments was designed to identify geometries and conditions which favoured best-practice design. The new seal design {{is in the process}} of being patented by Rolls Royce. A 'fluidic' seal was also investigated, showing very promising results. A test rig was manufactured so that a row of jets could be directed across a leakage cross-flow. An experimental program identified parameters which could achieve a combined lower leakage mass flow rate compared with the original leakage. Influence of jet spanwise spacing, injection angle, jet to mainstream pressure ratio, mainstream pressure difference and channel height were analysed.

The solution procedure of 1 CV model by Childs and Scharrer which assumes frequency independent force coefficients is modified to allow for calculating frequency dependent force coefficients. A comparative study of the impact of using frequency-dependent model and the original frequency-independent model on stability analysis is made. The results indicate that frequency dependency of force coefficients should be accounted for in stability analysis as rotor surface velocity approaches a significant fraction of Mach number. The bulk flow rotordynamic analysis model by Childs and Scharrer is modified to investigate the impact of leakage-flow models on predictions. A number of leakage models are incorporated in the one-control volume model, and a comparative study is made. Kinetic energy carryover factor of a leakage equation is one of the dominant factors in seal cross-force generation. A leakage equation based on a model proposed by Gamal which uses Hodkinson?s kinetic energy carryover factor is found to improve predictions of direct damping and cross-coupled stiffness. A test case is implemented to study the impact of variation of <b>seal</b> <b>axial</b> radial clearance on stability characteristics.

40|$|LecturePg. 17 - 28 The two subject blowers {{operate in}} {{parallel}} to circulate wet chlorine gas. Both units had large synchronous vibrations {{that led to}} multiple bearing failures. After simple rotordynamic studies failed to identify the problem, a comprehensive model that accounted for both the motor and blower was successful at identifying the problem as high sensitivity to unbalance loads due to an extremely lightly-loaded (less than one pound) condition at the blower?s inboard bearing (refer to Gutzwiller and Corbo, 2011). Based {{on the results of}} the rotordynamic analysis, two changes were made to both units. The couplings were changed from disk to gear couplings, and the blower?s bearings were changed from plain cylindrical to tilting-pad designs. After implementing these changes, unit ?A? ran smoothly for a period of six weeks, in accordance with the predictions of the rotordynamic analysis, and it appeared to all that the problem was completely solved. However, when the ?B? blower was then started up the two machines then commenced a three month period of operation in which each suffered from intermittent periods of high synchronous vibrations. During this time, the following behavior traits, which {{can only be described as}} bizarre, were observed: 1. 	After a smooth startup, vibration increased to a high level after about one week. 2. 	The transition from low vibrations to high vibrations was almost instantaneous. Additionally, this transition was always accompanied by an axial motion of the blower rotor away from the active thrust bearing. 3. 	The units appeared to be more likely to suffer high vibrations when both were running simultaneously. 4. 	Starting one machine might result in increased vibrations on the other, and shutting down a machine might lower vibrations on the other. 5. 	Someone observed that during a rainstorm the vibration levels decreased. (Note: the blowers are located outside.) Spraying water on the bearings sometimes (but not always) had a similar effect. A task force of experts was then commissioned and an extensive troubleshooting effort commenced. Some of the potential root causes that were hypothesized included blower surging, starvation of the tilting-pad bearings, thermally-induced misalignment, insufficient blower thrust, acoustic resonance, <b>axial</b> vibration, <b>seal</b> rubbing, and Morton effects. After an extensive troubleshooting effort that included more rotordynamic analysis, bearing flow analysis, blower thrust analysis, and extensive studying of orbit plots, spectrum plots, and vibration and temperature histories, the task force concluded that the most likely cause was rubbing at the blower?s carbon ring seal. Accordingly, the seal was disassembled and its locating pins were found to have come loose and generated a rub. Design changes were then implemented to provide better retention for the pins. The units were then restarted and it was verified that the modifications had finally eliminated the vibration problems.

The two-way coupling between temperatures of seal components and seal closures, through the frictional heat generated at the leaf–rotor interface when in contact, represents an important challenge for leaf seal analysis and design. This coupling can lead to leaf wear and loss, rotor overheating, and possibly to unstable sealing system behavior (thermal runaway). In this paper, we use computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite element (FE) thermal analysis, and experimental data to characterize the thermal behavior of leaf seals. This sets the basis for a study of the coupled thermomechanical behavior. CFD is used to understand the fluid-mechanics of a leaf pack. The leaf seal tested at the Oxford Osney Laboratory is used for the study. Simulations for four <b>seal</b> <b>axial</b> Reynolds number are conducted; for each value of the Reynolds number, leaf tip-rotor contact, and clearance are considered. Distribution of mass flow within the leaf pack, distribution of heat transfer coefficient (HTC) at the leaf surface, and swirl velocity pick-up across the pack predicted using CFD are discussed. The experimental data obtained from the Oxford rig is used to develop a set of thermal boundary conditions for the leaf pack. An FE thermal model of the rig is devised, informed by the aforementioned CFD study. Four experiments are simulated; thermal boundary conditions are calibrated to match the predicted metal temperatures to those measured on the rig. A sensitivity analysis of the rotor temperature predictions to the heat transfer assumptions is carried out. The calibrated set of thermal boundary conditions is shown to accurately predict the measured rotor temperatures. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} work {{undertaken}} {{to understand the}} effects, due to wear, {{on the performance of}} abradable honeycomb labyrinth seals. The phenomena studied are aerodynamic in nature and include compressible flow, turbulent flow, recirculation and separation at a range of pressure ratios from 1. 20 up to 3. 50. Four primary methods of investigation were used: experimental, numerical using CFD, numerical using theoretical derivations and numerical using established labyrinth seal specific computer codes. Effects of seal clearance, pressure ratio and tooth to groove location have been investigated with overall performance and inter-seal pressure distribution recorded experimentally and numerically for comparison. Worn experimental results, when compared to their unworn equivalent, recorded large increases in mass flow of up to 50 % when the labyrinth teeth are located centrally in the groove. Significant performance enhancements were achieved through offsetting the teeth with respect to the groove, particularly in an upstream sense. There was a marked deterioration with the labyrinth teeth located at the groove exit. Inter-seal pressure distributions showed that the first and final teeth did most of the work achieving significantly larger pressure drops which goes against current seal understanding of increasing pressure drop through the seal. Numerical work was undertaken to further investigate these effects. However, due to the complex 3 -D geometry of an abradable honeycomb labyrinth seal a 2 -D simplification technique was developed to speed up the investigative process. Using this technique CFD was found capable of replicating the experimental data regarding overall seal performance and inter-seal pressure distributions. The pressure on the final tooth proved to be the hardest experimental data to recreate using CFD, particularly at high pressure ratios when shocks are likely to form. Further numerical work was undertaken using computer codes and theoretical derivations. This work proved that the understanding of the seal loss coefficients used by both methods was not adequate for the current study with the experimental data recreated least successfully. Suggestions are given for enhancement of <b>seal</b> design, including <b>axial</b> location and <b>seal</b> computational routines, which will limit the impact of a 1. 5 % increase in operational cost that is likely to accrue from seal deterioration.

40|$|The use of {{ultrasonic}} reflectometry is {{a proven}} method of condition monitoring machine systems. The working principles are simple. A burst of ultrasonic signal {{is sent to}} the interface of interest where reflection of the signal takes place. The manner in which reflection takes place depends on the properties of the interface. As such, the reflected signal carries information regarding the interface that can be extracted with proper techniques. However, the use of ultrasonic reflectometry in condition monitoring is not without its limitations. Conventional ultrasound techniques make use of ultrasonic bulk waves that travel through the body of a given material. Problems arise when the medium through which the wave travels is attenuative. This prevents any passage of ultrasonic signals as most of the energy will be absorbed by the material. In addition, most components have complex designs, requiring that the signal pass through multiple interfaces before reaching the interface of interest. Reflections occur at these intermediate interfaces, reducing the overall energy content of the signal. In order to overcome these issues, the use of Rayleigh wave as an alternative is researched in the work carried out here. Instead of having to travel through the bulk of the material, Rayleigh waves function by propagating along the free surface of the said material, thereby circumventing the existing issues with the use of conventional bulk waves. The research here was carried out to seek an understanding of how Rayleigh waves interact with a contact interface. This was performed on three separate fronts. First, a novel analytical model was developed by modelling the contact interface as a series of springs. It is discovered that the stiffness of the springs are directly proportional to the reflection coefficient of the Rayleigh wave incident upon the interface. The implication of this finding is that rough interfaces will have a lesser reflection coefficient (due to decreased stiffness), with a perfectly smooth interface giving the maximum reflection coefficient obtainable from a particular interface. This was then followed by studies performed using both finite element simulations as well as experimental work. Data from all three studies (analytical model, finite element simulations and experimental work) were compared against each other and it was shown that a good agreement exists between all three methods. Exploratory work on lip seals were performed in order to research the potential of using Rayleigh wave as a condition monitoring tool. By measuring the delay in the time of arrival of a Rayleigh wave pulse reflected from the sealing zone, it is possible to measure the extent of misalignment that is present in a lip <b>seal.</b> <b>Axial</b> misalignments of the lip between 6 mm to 8 mm were successfully measured. Additional work in measuring the degradation of a lubricating film via evaporation was qualitative in nature, with the amplitude of the reflected pulse slowly decreasing as the layer of fluid at the sealing zone diminishes via evaporation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates, both {{theoretically}} and experimentally, {{the phenomenon}} of ingress through gas turbine rim seals. The work presented focuses on modelling and measuring the required sealing flow levels to purge the wheelspace against combined ingress {{and the effect of}} externally-induced ingress on the surface temperature and heat transfer to the rotor. Combined ingress is driven by a pressure difference between the mainstream annulus and wheelspace cavity resulting from the combination of the asymmetric external pressure profile in the annulus and the rotation of fluid in the rotor-stator wheelspace cavity. Ingress can be prevented by pressurising the wheelspace through the supply of sealant flow. The Owen (2011 b) combined ingress orifice model was solved to predict the required levels of sealant flow to prevent ingress into the wheelspace. The model was validated using prepublished data and data collected experimentally over the course of this research. Gas concentration measurements were made on the stator of the Bath single-stage gas turbine test rig to determine the variation of sealing effectiveness with sealant flow rate for an <b>axial</b> clearance <b>seal</b> geometry at design and off-design operational conditions. The measured variation of the required sealant flow rate with the ratio of the external and rotational Reynolds numbers, ReW / Reϕ, was consistent with the findings of other workers: at low values of ReW / Reϕ, ingress levels were influenced by the combined effects of the disc rotation and the annulus pressure profile and were therefore considered to fall into the combined ingress region; the influence of rotation diminished as ReW / Reϕ increased and the ingress levels were dominated by the annulus pressure field (externally-induced ingress). The orifice model was in good agreement with the experimental measurements and the prepublished experimental data. Thermochromic liquid crystal (TLC) was used to determine effect of ingress on the heat transfer coefficient, h, and adiabatic wall temperature, Tad, on the rotor of the Bath gas turbine rig. Concurrent gas concentration measurements were made on the stator to compare the effects of ingress on the two discs. Data was collected at the design condition, where ReW / Reϕ = 0. 538 and at an overspeed off-design condition, where ReW / Reϕ = 0. 326. The comparison between a newly defined adiabatic effectiveness, εad, on the rotor and the concentration effectiveness, εc, on the stator, showed that the rotor was protected against the effects of ingress relative to the stator. The sealing air, which is drawn into the rotor boundary layer from the source region, thermally buffers the rotor against the ingested fluid in the core. A thermal buffer ratio, η, was defined as the ratio of the minimum sealant flow required to purge the stator against ingress to the minimum sealant flow required to purge the rotor against ingress. The thermal buffer is dependent upon the flow structure in the wheelspace, which itself is governed the turbulent flow parameter, λT. A hypothesis relating η to λT was developed and shown to be in good agreement with the experimental data. The local Nusselt numbers, Nur, on the rotor were shown to be fairly constant with radius and increased as λT was increased. The latter finding {{can be explained by the}} flow structure in the wheelspace: as λT is raised, the swirl in the fluid core reduces, which results in an increase in the moment coefficient and Nur on the rotor. Difficulties in measuring Tad during the experiments suggested a new technique from which to solve for h and Tad using TLC surface temperature measurements. The solution Fourier’s equation for a step-change in the temperature of a fluid flowing over a solid of semi-infinite thickness (the ‘semi-infinite solution’) is limited to relatively low Fourier numbers if Tad is to be calculated accurately. A two-layer composite substrate made from, for example, polycarbonate and Rohacell, could be used to achieve accurate estimates of h and Tad over a larger range of Biot numbers than for a single material substrate. TLC could be used to measure the surface temperature history of the composite substrate during an experiment; this would allow h and Tad to be solved from the numerical solution of Fourier’s equation or from a combination of the semi-infinite and steady-state solutions. The work presented in this thesis has uncovered some interesting findings in areas where research was limited. The measurements of the minimum sealant flow required to purge the wheelspace at off-design operation for a rotor-stator system with blades and vanes and the measurements of the adiabatic effectiveness on a rotating disc affected by ingress are unique and provide a platform for further experimental studies and validation of CFD models.
