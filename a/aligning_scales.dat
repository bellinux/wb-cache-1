Environmental {{assessments}} and authorisations surrounding project level developments are often made in isolation, without {{consideration of the}} regional or strategic context within which individual developments are done. This research investigates the quality of Environmental Management Frameworks (EMF) as strategic environmental instrument. EMF is a unique South African instrument that was first conceptualised in 1989, enacted in 2006 and updated in 2010. EMFs were developed to map environmental sensitivity to aid the screening out of undesired developments in sensitive environments and to minimise unnecessary project level assessments in preferred development areas. EMFs form an important link between environmental assessment (EA) processes and planning strategies such as Spatial Development Frameworks (SDFs) and Integrated Development Plans (IDPs), due to their spatial output of environmental sensitivity maps {{and their ability to}} feed strategic assessment processes required by SDFs. They have a legal mandate which ensures their assimilation and use. This research uses a multiple case study approach to review seven EMF documents for their quality. The quality aspects identified are the process, methodology and documentation components, using the printed EMF documentation as primary information source. Quality review criteria were subsequently developed to investigate these inputs, using the legal mandate of EMF as basis. Each case was rated for compliance with the quality criteria using a six–level rating schedule. Further analyses were made by comparing the performance of cases against one another. Public participation emerged as the weakest component of EMF practice, while aspects of sensitivity analysis also performed weaker than other aspects. More focus is required on <b>aligning</b> <b>scales</b> and resolutions of map inputs, mapping methods and general integration of spatial data, especially those of adjoining districts. The need to substantiate a rationale for buffer determination also requires further refinement. The practice of conducting EMF is well established and it can be valuable in sustainable development planning and decisionmaking. Recommendations to enhance the sustainability outcomes and hence effectiveness of this instrument are made, as well as future research objectives for increasing its utility. Master...|$|E

30|$|Understanding and {{reasoning}} about phenomena at scales outside human perception (for example, geologic time) is critical across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Thus, devising strong methods to support acquisition of reasoning at such scales {{is an important}} goal in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. In two experiments, we examine the use of analogical principles in learning about geologic time. Across both experiments we find that using a spatial analogy (for example, a time line) to make multiple alignments, and keeping all unrelated components of the analogy held constant (for example, keep the time line the same length), leads to {{better understanding of the}} magnitude of geologic time. Effective approaches also include hierarchically and progressively <b>aligning</b> <b>scale</b> information (Experiment 1) and active prediction in making alignments paired with immediate feedback (Experiments 1 and 2).|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{develop a}} {{methodology}} for generating templates {{that represent the}} normal human patellofemoral joint (PFJ) topography and cartilage thickness, based on a statistical average of healthy joints. Also, to determine the cartilage thickness in the PFJs of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and develop a methodology for comparing an individual patient's thickness maps to the normal templates {{in order to identify}} regions that are most likely to represent loss of cartilage thickness. Design: The patella and femur surfaces of 14 non-arthritic human knee joints were quantified using either stereophotogrammetry or magnetic resonance imaging. The surfaces were <b>aligned,</b> <b>scaled,</b> and averaged to create articular topography templates. Cartilage thicknesses were measured across the surfaces and averaged to create maps of normal cartilage thickness distribution. In vivo thickness maps of articular layers from 33 joints with OA were also generated, and difference maps were created depicting discrepancies between the patients' cartilage thickness maps and the normative template. Results: In the normative template, the surface-wide mean±SD (maximum) of the cartilage thickness was 2. 2 ± 0. 4 mm (3. 7 mm) and 3. 3 ± 0. 6 mm (4. 6 mm) for the femur and patella, respectively. It was demonstrated that difference maps could be used to identify regions of thinner-than-normal cartilage in patients with OA. Patients were shown to have statistically greater regions of thin cartilage over their articular layers than the normal joints. On average, patients showed deficits in cartilage thickness in the lateral facet of the patella, in the anterior medial and lateral condyles, and in the lateral trochlea of the femur. Conclusions: This technique can be useful for in vivo clinical evaluation of cartilage thinning in the osteoarthritic patellofemoral joint...|$|R

To this end we estimate a joint align-ment of all training images using a set of pairwise regis-trations and ensure that these pairwise registrations are only calculated between similar images. This is achieved by defining a graph on the image set whose edge weights correspond to registration errors and computing a bounded diameter minimum spanning tree (BDMST). Dense op-tical flow is used to compute pairwise registration and a flow refinement method to <b>align</b> small <b>scale</b> texture is introduced. Further, given the registration of train-ing images, vertices {{are added to the}} AAM to minimise the error between the observed flow fields and the flow fields interpolated between the AAM mesh points.

40|$|SLAM is a {{very popular}} {{research}} stream in computer vision and robotics nowadays. For more effective SLAM implementation {{it is necessary to}} have reliable informa- tion about the environment, also the data should be <b>aligned</b> and <b>scaled</b> according to the real world coordinate system. Monocular SLAM research is an attractive sub-stream, because of the low equipment cost, size and weight. In this paper we present a way to build a conversion from LSD-SLAM coordinate space to the real world coordinates using a true metric scale with IMU sensor data implementation. The causes of differences between the real and calculated spaces are explained and the possibility of conversions between the spaces is proved. Additionally, a closed-form solution for inter space trans- formation calculation is presented. The synthetic method of generating high level accurate and well controlled input data for the LSD-SLAM algorithm is presented.

30|$|The {{first task}} on the visual {{front-end}} {{is to identify}} and extract a normalized region of interest (ROI), which is usually a rectangle centered on {{the mouth of the}} speaker [1, 21, 22]. The normalization of the ROI requires a robust method to detect the face and extract centered, <b>aligned,</b> and <b>scaled</b> images of the mouth for each sequence to makes recognition invariant to small movements of the speaker [19]. This preprocessing step {{is not part of the}} lipreading system and it is usually included in the face detection block because the position of the mouth, its size and alignment are determined in relation to other face features (the eyes, the tip of the nose). However, an accurate extraction of the mouth ROI is critical in lipreading systems and induced the term front-end effect to refer to the effects of the ROI extraction in the performance of the speech recognition system. In that sense, the use of markers or special lipstick on the speaker avoids the use of more complicated mouth tracking techniques [19] to alleviate the front-end effect.|$|R
40|$|When a shear-sensitive {{liquid crystal}} coating is {{illuminated}} {{from the normal}} direction by white light and observed from an oblique above-plane view angle, its color-change response to shear depends on both shear stress vector magnitude and {{the direction of the}} applied shear vector relative to the observer's in-plane line of sight. At any point, the maximum color change is always seen or measured when the local shear vector is aligned with, and directed away from, the observer; the magnitude of the color change at this vector/observer <b>aligned</b> orientation <b>scales</b> directly with shear stress magnitude. Conversely, any point exposed to a shear vector with a component directed toward the observer exhibits a noncolor-change response, always characterized by a rusty red or brown color, independent of both shear magnitude and direction.

30|$|A {{review of}} analogical {{reasoning}} literature offers three techniques {{that may be}} useful in the development of effective analogies for phenomena at extreme scales. First, the base concept and target concept should be structurally aligned; that is, as similar as possible with just one “alignable difference” (Goldstone, 1994; Markman & Gentner, 1993 a, 1993 b; Medin, Goldstone, & Gentner, 1993). An alignable difference is a common relation shared by the base concept and target concept which differs along one dimension. In the case of <b>aligning</b> an extreme <b>scale</b> with a human scale, both scales should be constructed in the same format (for example, a linear number line), with the only difference being magnitude.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel feature extraction method for myoelectric pattern recognition using a multivariate extension of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), namely multivariate EMD (MEMD). The method processes multiple surface electromyogram (EMG) channels simultaneously {{rather than in}} a channel-by-channel manner. From mode-aligned intrinsic mode functions (IMFs, representing signal components over multiple scales) derived from the MEMD analysis, normalized amplitude distributions of the same-mode/scale IMFs across different channels were calculated as features, which serve to reveal the underlying relationship in the <b>aligned</b> intrinsic <b>scales</b> across multiple muscles. The proposed method was assessed for identification of 18 different functional movement patterns via 27 -channel surface EMG signals recorded from the paretic forearm muscles of 12 subjects with hemiparetic stroke. With a linear discriminant classifier, the proposed MEMD based feature set resulted in an average error rate of 4. 61 ± 4. 70 % for classification of all the different movements, significantly lower than that of the conventional time-domain feature set (7. 14 ± 6. 15 %, p < 0. 05).

30|$|AC for {{flexible}} hardware components, such as flexible RF surface coils, MR-safe pneumatic headphones, and positioning aids, is {{more challenging}} [23 – 25, 27 – 29, 33 – 35]. In contrast to stationary components, flexible hardware components differ, in general, in their spatial position {{and in their}} shape between scans. Thus, attenuation maps of flexible hardware components need to be scan-specific. To obtain such scan-specific attenuation maps, registration-based methods have been proposed, suggesting to incorporate pre-acquired attenuation templates of the corresponding hardware components into the vendor-provided attenuation maps. These methods require performing a transmission scan (CT or rotating rod sources) of the corresponding hardware and scaling to 511 keV. Non-rigid registration is then employed to accurately <b>align</b> the <b>scaled</b> attenuation template using either bi-modal fiducial markers [22, 25, 27, 28, 33] or dedicated MR sequences (e.g., UTE), which are capable of retrieving some signal of the given hardware component [25, 29, 35, 39]. In current clinical practice, however, attenuation of flexible hardware components is neglected. This results in an underestimation of regional activity values of up to 18 % for torso RF surface coils [23 – 25, 27, 38], and up to 16 % for MR-safe pneumatic headphones [22, 33, 34].|$|R
40|$|Ecological regions {{aggregate}} habitats {{with similar}} biophysical characteristics within well-defined boundaries, providing spatially consistent platforms for monitoring, managing and forecasting {{the health of}} interrelated ecosystems. A major obstacle {{to the implementation of}} this approach is imprecise and inconsistent boundary placement. For globally important mountain regions such as the Eastern Arc (Tanzania and Kenya), where qualitative definitions of biophysical affinity are well established, rule-based methods for landform classification provide a straightforward solution to ambiguities in region extent. The method presented in this paper encompasses the majority of both contemporary and estimated preclearance forest cover within strict topographical limits. Many of the species here tentatively considered 'near-endemic' could be reclassified as strictly endemic according to the derived boundaries. LandScan and census data show population density inside the ecoregion to be higher than in rural lowlands, and lowland settlement to be most probable within 30 km. This definition should help to <b>align</b> landscape <b>scale</b> conservation strategies in the Eastern Arc and promote new research in areas of predicted, but as yet undocumented, biological importance.
