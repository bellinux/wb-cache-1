For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> batter performs best against.

5|$|The game {{takes place}} across {{multiple}} worlds based on Pinocchio, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, , Fantasia and , each having two different plots from {{the perspectives of}} Sora and Riku. These worlds need to be completed by both Sora and Riku in order to unlock new worlds and progress through the game. Upon visiting each world for the first time, each character must go through a Dive section, in which characters freefall down a tube and must clear <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> objective, such as obtaining <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> amount of points, defeating <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> amount of enemies in a time limit, or defeating a boss character. In this mode, Sora and Riku can attack opponents, slow down their descent, or dodge attacks. They can also pick up magic spells which give them a limited supply of magical attacks to use against enemies.|$|E
50|$|It {{is common}} for many players to think they know where pairs are and {{to turn over the}} one they are sure of first, then be stumped finding its mate.

50|$|Oblique intent: {{a person}} has oblique intent when the event is a natural {{consequence}} of a voluntary act and they foresee it as such. The 'natural consequence' definition was replaced in R v Woollin with the 'virtually certain' test. A person is now held to intend a consequence (obliquely) when that consequence is <b>a</b> virtually <b>certain</b> consequence of their action, and they knew it to be <b>a</b> virtually <b>certain</b> consequence. The first leg of this test has been condemned as unnecessary: a person should be held as intending a consequence if (s)he believed it to be <b>a</b> virtually <b>certain</b> consequence, {{regardless of whether it}} was in fact virtually certain.|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{missions}} {{in which the}} player controls a motor vehicle. Though the game engine {{is the same as}} the third-person mode, these missions are based on being in a vehicle. They usually involve getting to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> location in <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> time period, often while avoiding pursuers while heading to the end point. Weapons can not be used while in a vehicle. While the PDA is not available in these mission types, a map of the city is. Cell phone calls are also sometimes received in these missions.|$|E
5|$|Venom that is toxic only to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> taxon, or {{strongly}} toxic only to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> taxon, {{has been found}} in a number of snakes, suggesting that these venoms have evolved via natural selection to subdue preferred prey species. Examples of this phenomenon have been found in the Mangrove snake Boiga dendrophila, which has a venom specifically toxic to birds, {{as well as in the}} genera Echis and Sistrurus, and in sea snakes. However, while several snakes possess venom that is highly toxic to their preferred prey species, the reverse correlation is not necessarily true: the venoms of several snakes are toxic to taxa that they do not consume in high proportions. Most snake venom, for instance, is highly toxic to lizards, although the proportion of lizard prey varies among snake species. This has led researchers to suggest that toxicity to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> taxon is nearly independent of toxicity to another distantly related taxon.|$|E
