30|$|The UV-Vis {{transmission}} {{spectra of}} the films of polycarbonate and polycarbonate with monomer inclusions show a steep fundamental absorption edge which is slightly shifted to a longer wavelength compared to the fundamental absorption edge of the glass substrate (Fig.  2). A slight tendency towards the structuring of the absorption edge {{and the appearance of}} two absorption steps situated around 300 - 350  nm and over 380  nm (Fig.  2) were evidenced in some composite films. This structure of the absorption edge {{can be explained by the}} presence in the amidic monomer structure of the carbonyl groups (Fig.  1) that contain lone electron pairs of O atoms, designed non-bonding electrons. Such an electron could be promoted to an unoccupied π orbital giving the (n, π*) excited state instead of the (π, π*) state [44]. The carbonyl groups of different monomer molecules forming the inclusion phase could be situated close one to another showing strong interaction between their electrons and favouring the splitting of the carbonyl (n, π*) level into two bands causing the appearance of the two absorption steps [44]. The same effect could appear in monomers based on a nitrous <b>aromatic</b> <b>derivative</b> because the nitrous group (Fig.  1) also has lone electron pairs of O atoms and its behaviour is similar to that of the carbonyl group. At ~ 330  nm, the lone electron pairs transition is overlapped with the π-π* transition of the benzene rings in the polymeric matrix and monomeric inclusion.|$|E

The phototoxicity was tested in human keratinocytes cell lines NCTC- 2544, and the results proved that under the same conditions, all three compounds exhibited phototoxic effects in the model tested. The reduction in cell viability was found to be both concentration- and UVA dose-dependent. A point of note is that both the photoproducts produced a dramatic decrease in cell viability with GI 50 values one order of magnitude lower compared to the parent compound. In particular, the fully <b>aromatic</b> <b>derivative</b> (PP 4) showed the highest antiproliferative activity. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that pitavastatin and the photoproduct PP 4 principally induced necrosis, as revealed by the large appearance of propidium iodide-positive cells and also confirmed by the rapid drop in cellular ATP levels. Further studies committed to better understanding of photoinduced cell death mechanism(s) revealed that neither pitavastatin nor PP 4 induced mitochondrial depolarization or lysosomal damage, but, interestingly, extensive cell lipid membrane peroxidation along with a significant oxidation of model proteins occurred, suggesting that pitavastatin and PP 4 exert their phototoxic effect mainly in the cellular membranes. The present results suggest that the phototoxicity of pitavastatin may be mediated by the formation of benzophenanthridine-like photoproducts that appear to have high potential as photosensitizers...|$|E

Ground-state depletion spectroscopy (hole burning) has shown that, while only one structure was detected for the 1 -phenylethanol/butan- 2 -ol homochiral complex, the heterochiral complex is trapped in the jet under two different conformations. Two isomers have also been shown for each diastereoisomeric pair of the 2 -naphthyl- 1 -ethanol/butan- 2 -ol complexes. Using a semiempirical potential model, these isomeric forms were related to calculated structures which exhibit a folded or extended geometry depending on the solvent conformation (anti or gauche). The relative binding energy of the complexes involving R- 1 -phenylethanol and R- or S-butan- 2 -ol were obtained from fragmentation threshold measurements following two-color photoionization. Comparison of the diastereoisomers exhibiting a similar spectral signature shows that the homochiral pair is more stable than the heterochiral one by about 0. 7 kcal/mol.

40|$|Pollen tube {{growth is}} a rapid process {{restricted}} to the only tip region. Many factors cooperate to allow this apical growth, creating an intricate signalling network. The continuous rebuilding of the cell wall and apical migration of the cytoplasm sustained by cytoskeleton re-organisation {{are the most important}} driving forces needed for growth (1), but many other factors are involved in this process, among which polyamines (PAs), that are essential during pollen tube emergence (2) and ROS, that support the apical growth, at physiological concentration (3). We investigated the effect of the natural PA Spermine (Spm) and BD 23, a synthetic <b>aromatic</b> <b>derivative</b> of Spm on the apical growth of Pyrus communis pollen tube and observed that both Spm inhibited the growth from 10 M onwards. Thanks to a FITC-labelled Spm we were able to observe, that PAs enter through the pollen tube tip, then diffuse in the sub-apical region. The same region underwent drastic morphological changes, showing loss of polarity and enlarged tip when Spm and BD 23 were supplied at 100 M or higher. The effects of PAs were related, at least in part to their ability to act as ROS scavengers of both O 2 and H 2 O 2 in the apical zone, probably altering the Ca 2 + signalling network or disrupting the balance between ROS species that affect cell-wall relaxation or stiffening. Interestingly, the actin cytoskeleton was not affected by the treatment with 100 M of both the PAs and, instead, seemed to follow the swelling of the apex. Intriguing the cell wall was enriched in both callose and cellulose exactly in the region where the swelling of the tip begins, probably to contrast the excess of ductility of the cell wall after treatment with PAs 100 M. The viability of pollen was slightly affected by 100 M treatment, and the degradation of nuclear DNA, as shown by DAPI labelling of pollen tube, was completely inhibited when pollen had been pre-treated with the caspase- 3 inhibitor I peptide, Ac-DEVD-CHO (DEVD). Different was the scenario when the PAs were supplemented at 500 M, concentration that is far away from the physiological concentration. In this case, the effects on the pollen were more drastic, with a rapid drop of cell viability, actin depolimerisation, stimulation of DNA-laddering after 30 minutes incubation and the complete degradation of both vegetative and generative nuclei; these degradative effects were only in part inhibited by the pre-treatment with DEVD. Thus the present data may open new research avenues to understand how the diameter of the pollen tube is regulated and which role PAs could play in the puzzling process of apical growth...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Pharmaceutical Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Malaria {{has since}} antiquity been a {{leading cause of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality throughout the world having serious health, sociological and financial implications. Today, the parasite kills an approximate 655 000 people annually, with most deaths being amongst pregnant women and {{children under the age of}} 5 in Africa. Plasmodium falciparum is the species that accounts for 91 % of all case fatalities and predominates in Africa and Asia. The parasite is aggressive in its means of acquiring resistance, nullifying the majority of drugs used against it. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone with a peroxide bridge, was discovered in 1971 and was found to possess remarkable antimalarial activity. Together with its semi synthetic derivatives, artemisinin not only lack cross-resistance with other antimalarials but also has the remarkable ability to induce a 10 000 fold reduction in parasitemia. The artemisinin class of compounds is currently the basis of treatment favoured by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Regrettably, resistance has started to emerge even against this class of compounds, characterised by a significantly longer in vivo parasite clearance time. The global impact of this disease and its ability to circumvent most efforts to counter it justifies the search for new treatment methods and drugs. The aim of this study was to synthesise three series of artemisinin-amine derivatives, to evaluate their antimalarial activity against both sensitive and resistant strains of P. falciparum and to determine their toxicity against mammalian cells. This may lead to new compounds with favourable properties and increased activity which can be used in the fight against malaria. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis of eleven 10 -aminoethylether derivatives of artemisinin, confirmation of their structures by physical means and the determination of their in vitro antimalarial activity against the chloroquine sensitive (D 10) and resistant (Dd 2) strains of P. falciparum as well as their toxicity against Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells. All derivatives were active against both strains of the parasite, with no mentionable toxicity. The highest activity was displayed by compound 8, a short chain <b>aromatic</b> <b>derivative</b> containing only one nitrogen atom, which was found to have comparable activity to artesunate (AS). Long chain polyamine derivatives had the lowest activity against both strains. An interesting correlation between the IC 50, pKa values and resistance index (RI) was found. Chapter 4 compares the same 10 -aminoethylether derivatives of artemisinin discussed in chapter 3 with eight 10 -n-alkyl/aryl/aroyl ester derivatives previously synthesised in our group. The in vitro antimalarial activity of these nineteen compounds was determined against both the chloroquine sensitive (3 D 7) and resistant (K 1) strains of P. falciparum, whilst their cytotoxicity was determined against both human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep G 2). Both series of compounds showed activity versus the 3 D 7 and K 1 strains, with the majority of compounds possessing potency either comparable with or higher than that of AS. None of the synthesised derivatives had any mentionable toxicity against the mammalian cells. The 10 -n-propyl and 10 -benzyl ester derivatives, 11 and 18 respectively, were the most active compounds against both strains, whilst the other ester derivatives also showed a slightly higher degree of activity than the aminoethers. Compound 29, featuring an isobutylamine substituent, was the most active of all aminoethers. Chapter 5 entails the synthesis of seven artemisinin-triazine hybrids, confirmation of their structures and the determination of their in vitro antimalarial activity against the 3 D 7 and K 1 strains of P. falciparum, whilst their cytotoxicity was determined against HEK 293, Hep G 2, B-lymphocyte cells (Raji) and human fibroblast cells (BJ). The synthesised hybrids all showed activity against both strains and were found to be non-toxic to all mammalian cells. Compound 17, featuring p-anisidine and 2 -(diisopropylamino) ethylamine substituents on the triazine ring, was the most active of all synthesised compounds and had comparable activity to that of AS and artemether (AM), while being significantly more potent than chloroquine (CQ). Chapter 6 describes the synthesis and structure determination of six dimeric artemisinin triazine hybrids and the determination of their antimalarial activity and toxicity against the same strains of P. falciparum and mammalian cells as in chapter 5. All dimers showed activity against both strains and no noticeable toxicity towards any of the mammalian cell lines used. All synthesised compounds showed higher activity than CQ, irrespective of the P. falciparum strain considered. Compound 15, featuring aniline and morpholine substituents on the triazine ring, was not only meaningfully more potent than CQ but was also found to possess activity comparable to those of AS and AM against both malaria strains. Compounds 10, 11, 12 and 13 all had corresponding monomer equivalents as have been reported in chapter 5. Against both strains of P. falciparum, most dimer compounds were slightly more active than their monomer counterparts. This study delivered a number of compounds that exhibited activity comparable to that of potent antimalarial drugs currently on the market, and showed that there is ample scope for developments in the chemotherapy of malaria. These compounds stand as good candidates for in vivo and pharmacokinetic studies and may serve as leads for further investigations. Doctora...|$|E
