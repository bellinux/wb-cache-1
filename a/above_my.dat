25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms <b>above</b> <b>my</b> head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E

O'Hara stated that her favorite scene in the film took place outside the church after her character gets married, remarking, [...] "I make my way down the steps to the carriage waiting below, the wind catches my veil and fans it out in a perfect circle all the way around my face. Then it floats straight up <b>above</b> <b>my</b> head and points to the heavens. It's breathtaking." ...|$|E

500|$|Her splits with party {{leadership}} contributed to her re-election defeat in 1955. As the Democrats swept {{to victory in}} the mayoral race {{and in the other}} nine councilmanic districts, Dallas lost to Republican Wilbur H. Hamilton (the brother of her 1951 opponent) by 457 votes, with 520 votes going to a third-party candidate, J. Warren Keel. Speaking later of her electoral defeat, Dallas said [...] "I said I couldn't put my organization <b>above</b> <b>my</b> constituents. Now that makes me sound pious and goody-goody, but I couldn't—so I got defeated." [...] She did not run for elected office again.|$|E

"Heirloom" [...] alters [...] "between {{what sounds}} like a samba preset on a vintage Wurlitzer organ and skittering breakbeats, and is {{decorated}} with inverted synthtones and analog keyboards".

Film director Harmony Korine wrote [...] "Harm of Will"'s lyrics. The Slate album review noted the minimalist nature of the track, pointing out a lack of hook, beat and melody. [...] It is a slow song, as is the closing track, [...] "Unison". The latter [...] " [...] a refrain directly inspired by [...] experience in Dancer in the Dark and a healthy dollop of self-effacing humor evoked to counter the balance". It [...] "brings beats and strings together in a final crescendo that also manages to incorporate a little jungle".|$|E
500|$|The verse {{may be one}} of few English nursery rhymes to have ancient origins. The Babylonian prayer [...] "Shamash before me, {{behind me}} Sin, Nergal at my right, Ninib at my left", is echoed by the medieval Jewish prayer: [...] "In the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, may Michael be at my right hand; Gabriel at my left; Uriel before me; Raphael behind me and the Shekhinah of God be <b>above</b> <b>my</b> head" [...] which is used as a prayer before sleep. A Christian version has been found for Germany {{at the end of the}} Medieval period. However, the first known record of the lyrics in English is from Thomas Ady's {{witchcraft}} treatise A Candle in the Dark, or, a treatise concerning the nature of witches and witchcraft (1656), which tells of a woman in Essex who claimed to have lived in the reign of Mary I (r. 1553-8) and who was alive in his time and blessed herself every night with the [...] "popish charm": ...|$|E

2500|$|During its history, {{the statue}} faced many hazards. It {{miraculously}} survived undamaged the bombardment of Brussels of 1695 by the French army, but the pipes having been affected, {{it could not}} deliver its water for a certain time. A pamphlet published the same year recounts this episode. This text is the oldest attesting that Manneken Pis had become [...] "an object of glory appreciated by all and renowned throughout the world". It is also {{the first time that}} it served as a symbol for the people of Brussels. It is also traditionally said that after the bombardment, it was triumphantly placed again on its pedestal. On that occasion, the following passage from the Bible was inscribed above its head : In petra exaltavit me, et nunc exaltavi caput meum super inimicos meos ("The Lord placed me on a stone base, and now I raise my head <b>above</b> <b>my</b> enemies"). As shown by an engraving by Jacques Harrewijn, dating from 1697, the fountain was no longer located on the street, but in a recess {{at the corner of the}} Rue du Chêne and de l'Étuve.|$|E
2500|$|... "After a night {{spent in}} fever and sleeplessness, I {{forced myself to}} take a long tramp the next day through the hilly country, which was covered with pine woods. It all looked dreary and desolate, and I could not think what I should do there. Returning in the afternoon, I {{stretched}} myself, dead tired, on a hard couch, awaiting the long-desired hour of sleep. It did not come; but I fell into a kind of somnolent state, in which I suddenly felt as though I were sinking in swiftly flowing water. The rushing sound formed itself in my brain into a musical sound, the chord of E flat; major, which continually re-echoed in broken forms; these broken chords seemed to be melodic passages of increasing motion, yet the pure triad of E flat; major never changed, but seemed by its continuance to impart infinite significance to the element in which I was sinking. I awoke in sudden terror from my doze, feeling as though the waves were rushing high <b>above</b> <b>my</b> head. I at once recognised that the orchestral overture to the Rheingold, which must long have lain latent within me, though it had been unable to find definite form, had at last been revealed to me."

2500|$|Glassjaw started {{crafting}} {{new songs}} after reforming {{with a new}} lineup, and by July 2005 they had three songs written; {{the only one of}} which that had a title at this point was [...] "Natural Born Farmer." [...] By their 2006 tour with Deftones, the other two songs became titled [...] "You Think You're (John Fucking Lennon)" [...] and [...] "Jesus Glue." [...] Also written around this time was a new version of [...] "Star <b>Above</b> <b>My</b> Bed (Call of the Tiger Woman)," [...] originally released on the 1997 EP Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, titled [...] "Stars." [...] Primary songwriter Justin Beck admitted that he enjoyed writing new material with no working deadline and that he was selfishly writing new songs [...] "with no one in mind." [...] By the end of 2007, Glassjaw had two rough batches of songs recorded: one that was described as being [...] "far more aggressive" [...] than previous Glassjaw albums, and another grouping of instrumental songs that had a [...] "Spanish and Latin" [...] vibe to them. The more aggressive songs became the tracks for the Our Color Green (The Singles) EP, while the rest are expected to be released as an eventual full-length release.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1964, while Stewart {{was waiting}} at Twickenham railway station after having seen Long John Baldry and the All Stars at Eel Pie Island, Baldry heard him playing [...] "Smokestack Lightnin'" [...] on his harmonica, and invited him to sit in with the group (which passed into his hands and was renamed the Hoochie Coochie Men when Cyril Davies died of {{endocarditis}} on 7 January); when Baldry discovered Stewart was a singer as well, he offered him a job for £35 a week, after securing the approval of Stewart's mother. Quitting his day job at age nineteen, Stewart gradually overcame his shyness and nerves and became a visible enough part of the act that he was sometimes added to the billing as [...] "Rod the Mod" [...] Stewart, the nickname coming from his dandyish style of grooming and dress. Baldry touted Stewart's abilities to Melody Maker magazine and the group enjoyed a weekly residence at London's fabled Marquee Club. In June 1964, Stewart made his recording début (without label credit) on [...] "Up <b>Above</b> <b>My</b> Head", the B-side to a Baldry and Hoochie Coochie Men single. While still with Baldry, Stewart embarked on a simultaneous solo career. He made some demo recordings, was scouted by Decca Records at the Marquee Club, and signed to a solo contract in August 1964. He appeared on several regional television shows {{around the country and}} recorded his first single in September 1964.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story was}} nearly {{finished}} on the whiteboards when Chibnall began writing the script. After about two weeks, Chibnall had {{a draft of}} the first few episodes. Ellie Miller was a lesbian in the first draft of the script, and there was no Joe Miller. But this didn't work well narratively, so Chibnall changed the character to a married heterosexual. But he had not yet settled on a killer. [...] "Often as a writer, you get your first draft out, and then you look and think, 'Now, what have I got here'," [...] Chibnall {{said in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly. [...] "You're really just throwing mud at the wall and then going, 'Oh, there's a pattern there.' [...] " [...] Chibnall knew, however, that the killer had to be someone close to Ellie. About two weeks later, Chibnall woke one morning and realised the murderer should be Joe Miller, DS Ellie Miller's husband. [...] "t was the lightbulb moment <b>above</b> <b>my</b> head—which you never get as a writer, frankly. I've never had it before, probably won't ever have it again. I was, like, 'Ohmygod, it's Joe. It can't be anyone else.' [...] " [...] By making Joe the killer, Chibnall focused the series more closely on Ellie Miller, and improved the narrative structure so that it became about two families (the Millers and the Latimers). He then redrafted the first script and re-plotted and re-outlined the series. The killer's identity was [...] "embedded" [...] (as Chibnall described it) into the script before he brought the project to ITV. However, Chibnall kept the script loose enough that he could choose another character as the murderer, in case his preferred solution leaked to the press during shooting.|$|E
