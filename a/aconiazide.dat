The toxicity of <b>aconiazide</b> was assessed by treating male and female Fischer 344 (F 344) rats daily by gavage for 6 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg body wt. For comparison, the toxicity of isoniazid was determined following treatment in an identical manner at equimolar doses. <b>Aconiazide</b> resulted in only one death during the 6 -month experiment, whereas isoniazid caused a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. Each drug induced significant dose-related decreases in body weight in both sexes, and isoniazid caused a significant decrease in liver weight in male rats. Isoniazid also induced centrilobular hepatic necrosis in male rats, a lesion not observed upon <b>aconiazide</b> treatment. Plasma drug levels were>lO-fold greater in rats administered isoniazid as compared to <b>aconiazide.</b> The higher levels of free drug observed with isoniazid may contribute to greater toxicity of isoniazid compared to <b>aconiazide.</b> Key Words: Tuberculosis-Aconiazide-Isoniazid-Liver toxicity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Aconiazide,</b> a {{hydrazone}} {{derivative of}} isoniazid, {{has been proposed}} {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis. As a first step toward assessing the safety of this drug, the effects of a daily oral 14 -day treatment on weight gain, pathology, and several hematologic and clinical chemistry parameters were determined in Fischer 344 (F 344) rats. Dosage-related changes in body weight were observed and these became significant a t dosages of 500 mg aconiazide/kg body weight. Pathologic lesions involved the sciatic nerve, liver, and bone marrow, with the incidence typically becoming significantly elevated at dosages of 500 mg aconiazide/kg body weight. <b>Aconiazide</b> treatment caused statistically significant changes in certain clinical chemistry and hematologic parameters; however, the values of these were still within the normal range reported for rats of a comparable age. The plasma concentrations of <b>aconiazide</b> were dosage-related, tended to be higher in females, and did not increase with repeated dosing...|$|E
