50|$|Some of {{the early}} CVCC engines {{had a problem with}} the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>valves</b> {{retaining}} collars vibrating loose. Once unscrewed, engine oil would leak from the valvetrain into the pre-combustion chamber, causing a sudden loss of power and massive amounts of smoke to emanate from the exhaust pipe. The condition simulated a blown engine, even though the needed repair was quite simple. Honda eventually came up with a fix involving metal retaining rings that slipped over the collars and prevented them from backing out of their threads.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} transmission had a 27-spline input shaft (shared with the THM200C and 2004R) which was a common failure point. In 1984, the 700R4 designed for use behind Chevrolet small block V8s received a 30-spline input shaft {{similar to those found}} on TH400 transmissions and which also used a different torque converter than its 2.8 V6 and 2.2 L4 engines. Between 1984-1987, internal components, from the ring gear to the oil pump housing, were updated, ending with the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>valve</b> body for 700s manufactured after October 1986.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyze the energy {{dissipation}} related to the hydraulic circuit which controls the remote auxiliary utilities of an agricultural tractor. This circuit is a typical hydraulic load sensing multi actuators system. This kind of system provides a good control strategy but it is characterized by quite high energy dissipation, especially when several actuators are working together under different variable loads. In this paper, the traditional load sensing system is modelled using a lumped parameter approach, and theenergy dissipations are evaluated with reference to an actual duty measured on an agricultural tractor. Then, an alternative and more energy saving circuit architecture is introduced, based on an independent metering concept: in this architecture the single spool <b>auxiliary</b> <b>valve</b> is substituted with two electronically controlled proportional valves. The system has been also equipped with an electronically controlled variable pump; twostrategies to control both the pump and the proportional valves are introduced. The energetic analysis is performed also for the alternative architecture using the same duty cycle, with the aim to identify the advantages, disadvantages and the critical features of this system {{with respect to the}} original one. Significant energy saving percentage characterizes the independent metering architecture, which seems to be a promising alternative to the standard hydraulic load sensing system...|$|E
40|$|For voltage {{adaptation}} and galvanic isolation in High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) converter stations, standard transformers operating at grid frequency are currently used. These devices {{tend to be}} very large and heavy, which is undesirable in many applications. Transformers where the magnetic parts operate at a frequency considerably higher than the grid frequency could offer many advantages. Smaller and lighter transformers and lower losses are among them. In this thesis, a future-oriented HVDC converter station using a medium frequency MF transformer is studied with special focus on the converter circuits. The converter size used in this work is 78 MW (± 75 kVDC/ 11 kVAC) and the main application is power transmission to and from offshore installations. The converter consists of a snubbered Voltage-Source Converter VSC and 2 -phase by 3 -phase cycloconverter connected by a MF transformer. The VSC is implemented using a single phase leg and the cycloconverter is implemented using fast thyristors. It is expected that the semiconductor losses of the power conversion system will be significantly reduced by the use of the proposed converter topology which permits soft switching of all semiconductor valves in all operating points without any <b>auxiliary</b> <b>valve.</b> The thesis evaluates the commercial potential of the proposed HVDC system. A general circuit design based on available preconditions is made first for the studied converter station, and then a comparison with an existing two-level HVDC-Light station with regard to semiconductor requirements and losses is performed for the same operating point. The total space occupied by the valve installations for both systems is also estimated. The comparison shows that the proposed system promises a considerable {{reduction in the number of}} semiconductor devices and, as a result, the total volume of the converter valves. However, the semiconductor losses increase slightly...|$|E
40|$|In all {{internal}} combustion engines {{working on a}} cycle in which a combustible mixture is compressed prior to the ignition and expansion strokes, the efficiency {{is limited to the}} efficiency at which the maximum compression temperature is equal to the ignition temperature of the fuel used. For the {{internal combustion}} engines, such as are used in the automotive and airplane field, the fuel is gasoline. This has a flash point at about 600 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on the gravity of the fuel. Compression temperatures higher than this, cause preignition. In fact compression temperatures approaching this limit are difficult of realization because of detonation or knocking. It is evident on analysis that the higher is the expansion ratio the higher will be the efficiency of any engine; for the larger is this ratio, the more will the heat of combustion be utilized in doing useful work. Due to mechanical reasons it is customary in engine work to keep the expansion ratio practically equal to the compression ratio, so that the efficiency is limited to that determined by the compression ratio, which is in turn limited by the final temperature of compression. It has been the purpose of the investigation to develop a method which has been proposed for lowering the maximum compression temperature so that an increase in the expansion ratio could be realized. In this method cooling of the charge during the compression stroke is obtained by connecting the cylinder with an auxiliary chamber through a valve during a portion of the compression stroke. The pressure in the auxiliary chamber builds up until the flow from the chamber when the connecting valve is first opened is equal to that forced back into the chamber during the time the valve is open. The auxiliary chamber is fitted with cooling tubes so that cooling in the cylinder is affected by means of these gases and the lower compression ratio during that portion of the stroke when the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>valve</b> is open...|$|E
40|$|The {{switching}} losses of power conversion {{systems can be}} significantly reduced by use of the proposed mutually commutated converter topologies which equipped with IGBT-based cycloconverters and permit soft switching of all semiconductor valves in all operating points without any <b>auxiliary</b> <b>valves.</b> However, due to the inherent properties, thyristors are more suitable and attractive for such naturally commutated converters. A simplified three phase power conversion system is studied in this thesis where the load side is represented by counter-emf. The aim of the thesis {{is to find a}} feasible way which allows the thyristor-based cycloconverter to be commutated at any instant of each modulation interval. With this purpose, the method should be able to overcome the inherit limitation of the thyristor, which is the lack of turn-off capability. A proposed modulation method named “current clamping control strategy” for wind farms is studied and analyzed using in different operating points in this thesis. Furthermore, the cascaded topology is discussed to show the superiority with respect to the total harmonic distortion...|$|R
50|$|Honda CVCC engines have normal inlet and exhaust valves, plus a small <b>auxiliary</b> inlet <b>valve</b> which {{provides}} a relatively rich air-fuel mixture to a volume near the spark plug. The remaining air-fuel charge, drawn into the cylinder through the main inlet valve, is leaner than normal. The volume near the spark plug is contained by a small perforated metal plate. Upon ignition flame fronts emerge from the perforations and ignite {{the remainder of the}} air-fuel charge. The remaining engine cycle is as per a standard four-stroke engine.|$|R
30|$|We further {{illustrate}} ConSerts with {{an example}} from the agricultural domain, which has previously been presented in [4]. The agricultural domain today pioneers innovative applications involving systems of systems and dynamic integration. One of these applications is the so-calledTractor Implement Management (TIM). The TIM functionality enables agricultural implements to control typical tractor functions such as velocity, steering angle, power take off, or <b>auxiliary</b> <b>valves.</b> It is possible to fully automate implement-specific work procedures and to optimize them with respect to parameters such as performance, efficiency, or wear and tear. TIM utilizes a standardized bus system for communication between the participating devices and machines. During TIM operation, control is typically assumed by the implement. It uses the TIM functions of the tractor (e.g., controlling velocity, steering angle, power take-off, hydraulic <b>valves)</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> devices, such as sensors for the respective automation purpose, displays data to the operator, and executes operator inputs. Between different tractors, implements, and auxiliary devices such as virtual terminals (providing the operator UI) or GPS systems of different manufacturers, a huge space of configurations arises, which makes it unfeasible to analyze each potential configuration a priori at development time. For this reason, those TIM applications already available {{on the market today}} only work for predetermined concrete pairs of tractors and implements whose integration has been thoroughly analyzed at development time by the involved manufacturers.|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{investigation}} is to integrate an electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brake model with efficient longitudinal train force algorithms based on the trajectory coordinate formulations. The ECP brake model, developed in this investigation consists of the train line (cable), locomotive automatic brake valve, air brake pipe, and ECP manifold. The train line, which covers {{the entire length of}} the train, allows the brake commands to be received by the car simultaneously. While pneumatic pressure is used to generate the braking forces, the brake pipe is no longer used to provide the brake level commands. Instead, the brake pipes are used to provide a continuous supply of compressed air stored in a reservoir mounted on each railcar. Using the ECP system to apply the brakes uniformly and instantaneously gives better train control, shortens the stopping distances, and leads to a lower risk of derailment. In this investigation, the fluid continuity and momentum equations are used to develop the governing air pressure flow equations. These partial differential equations are converted to a set of ordinary differential equations using the finite element method leading to an air brake force model that accounts for the effect of the air flow in long train pipes as well as the effect of leakage and branch pipe flows. The car brake forces are applied to the wheels using the ECP manifold located in each car. The ECP manifold used in this investigation has four valves: cut-off valve, vent valve, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>valve,</b> and emergency valve. The ECP manifold is connected to three main pneumatic components: the auxiliary reservoir, the emergency reservoir, and the brake cylinder. The reservoirs serve as the main storage of the pressurized air, while the brake cylinder and other mechanical components such as the rigging and the brake shoes transmit the brake force to the wheels. In this investigation, a mathematical model of the ECP manifold and its components is developed. The relationship between the main components of the ECP brake system and the train dynamics is discussed, and the final set of differential equations that integrates the ECP brake and train dynamics is presented. Different simulation scenarios are considered in this study in order to investigate the effect of the brake forces on the train longitudinal dynamics in the case of different braking scenarios. The performance of the developed ECP brake system is compared with the Association of American Railroads safety and operation standards, and with experimental results published in the literature...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—Deltaplax new genus, Deltaplax burdicki {{new species}}, and Deltaplax dellangeloi new species (Mollusca, Polyplacophora, Neoloricata, Multiplacophora) from the Mississippian Lower Buffalo Wallow Group (Chesterian) of Indiana, USA are described. The new genus is {{established}} by one partially articulated and one associated specimen with marginal fringes of {{two types of}} large spines, bilaterally symmetrical head and tail valves, and fifteen medial valves arranged in three longitudinal columns similar to those described previously for other multiplacophorans. The two spec-imens represent separate species differentiated by morphologies of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>valves,</b> one type of spine, and subtrap-ezoidal versus triangular tail valves. The tail valve of the articulated specimen also had sutural laminae that projected under the preceding intermediate valve. The presence of sutural laminae allows for placement of multiplacophorans in Subclass Neoloricata of Class Polyplacophora. The head, intermediate, and tail valves are mucronate with comarginal growth lines and ridged insertion plates that probably inserted into soft tissue comparable to the girdle of modern polyplacophorans. The new specimens also indicate one left-handed, one auxiliary, and one right-handed valve in mul-tiplacophorans was equivalent to a single bilaterally-symmetrical intermediate valve of extant polyplacophorans. However, multiplacophoran head valves have plates that project from the lower layer at the lateral margins and articulate with the first intermediate valves that overlap the head and second intermediate valves. These features have not been observed in more typical neoloricates, fossil or modern. Pending systematic revision of the class, Multiplacophora thus is retained as a separate order distinguished by the unique shared characters...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedA single-stage transonic research compressor and test rig {{are to be}} used to obtain data on the effect of inlet flow distortion on compressor (and therefore engine) stall. Auxiliary injection was examined as a technique for generating distortion in inlet stagnation pressure, or temperature, or to simulate the more complex effects of engine steam ingestion from a catapult launch. Engineering analyses were developed and programmed in EES to relate inlet conditions to the compressor characteristics, for both pressure and temperature distortion. An injection duct area of 8 % was selected to limit the required heater power. A CFD analysis was carried out to predict the compressor inlet flow field and hence position the injection duct exit. It was found that a broad range of distortion parameters could be generated by simply ducting (and heating) atmospheric air (or steam) through an <b>auxiliary</b> inlet throttle <b>valve...</b>|$|R

The airspring is connected with several other pneumatic components such as <b>auxiliary</b> tanks, pipes, <b>valves,</b> etc. Such a system can be analysed in a multidisciplinary approach by coupling a multibody model of the train with a detailed pneumatic model of the suspension. This paper presents and compares various modelling approach for the pneumatic suspension, focusing on the bellowpipe-tank subsystem. The pipe is described in more details distinguishing models with algebraic or differential equations and models that take compressible effects into acount or not. The various approaches are compared on a simple excitation test and confronted to a reference solution obtained with the commercial FLUENT software. It is shown that the compressible effect can not always be neglected. The influence of the pipe length is also presented...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{the most}} {{important}} activity in heat exchanger network synthesis is the retrofitting, rather than grass-root design, of networks. There is a vast potential for energy improvement in many processes by increasing the level of internal heat exchange. Other common reasons for heat exchanger network retrofits is that modifications are made within a process whitch affect the structure of its existing network. These changes can be connected {{with the need for}} an increased thoughtput, the exploation of electricity production by gas turbines, and integration of heat pumps. Regardless of why the network is modified, {{it is important that the}} retrofitted network is based on the best possible design in terms of energy. The aim of this project has been to develop a user-driven metod for optimal retrofitting of heat exchanger networks, with whitch all aspects relevant in a retrofit design situation can be taken into account. No such metod exists today. The following parameters have been considered: heat exchanger area, the types of heat exchangers, material requirements, physical distance between streams, annual pressure drop costs, <b>auxiliary</b> equipment (<b>valves),</b> space requirements, and annual maintenance costs (cleaning). This approach, termed the matrix method for network retrofits, uses pinch thechnology to identify whitch heat exchangers waste energy. Rearrangement of all heat exchangers that waste energy usually results in a retrofitted network with an excessive number of new and extended units. Therefore, an approach has been developed to identify which parts of the existing network to rearrange. It is also possible to find designs whith the fewest necessary modifications to the existing network at a certain level of the recovery. Apart from the above mentioned parameters, optimum design routines have been included. With these the optimum heat transfer area and preassure drop of the heat exchangers, and optimum diameter and drop of the piping, can be found. Various analytical expressions for calculating the optimum design of a single heat exchanger have been derived for different design situations, based on both restricted and unrestricted pressure drops, and taking free available pressure drops into consideration...|$|R
