5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> doubt this idea {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|Digging deeper {{is usually}} done for finding magma, which as a fuel source, removes the player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger magma seas are found while digging into warm rock. Near magma seas, raw adamantine strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass {{down through the}} entire magma sea. These columns are hollow and can be broken, revealing an entire shaft leading deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and can bring entire fortresses to ruin.|$|E
25|$|Ease {{of access}} to the city {{provided}} by the close proximity of I-5 and I-80 as well as the Sierra Northern Railway and the California Northern Railroad are most likely why businesses have done so well in Woodland. Woodland's proximity to the Sacramento and San Francisco metro areas also provide businesses <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> set up shop in town.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> is <b>to</b> {{reduce the}} ever-present {{risk of the}} debtor abusing the {{sequestration}} procedure and resorting to sequestration when it holds little or no real benefit for creditors and simply gives the debtor a means of escaping his liabilities.|$|R
50|$|Inertia is <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> used <b>to</b> {{explain a}} bias towards the status quo. Another {{explanation}} is fear of regret {{in making a}} wrong decision, i.e. If we choose a partner, when we think there could be someone better out there.|$|R
50|$|The purported {{disruption}} of a combat unit's morale is cited as <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> for women <b>to</b> {{be banned from}} front-line combat situations.|$|R
25|$|Often, {{through-hole}} and surface-mount construction must {{be combined}} {{in a single}} assembly because some required components are available only in surface-mount packages, while others are available only in through-hole packages. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> use both methods is that through-hole mounting can provide needed strength for components likely to endure physical stress, while components {{that are expected to}} go untouched will take up less space using surface-mount techniques.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 Van Eeghen {{renamed the}} {{painting}} to De familie van burgemeester Gillis Valckenier, and dated it in 1657. This was mainly based on the bird in the painting, which van Eeghen imagined to be a falcon. Irene Groeneweg reasons that the bird, held by the boy, is a Cuban amazon parrot. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> doubt the classification is that, according to the Amsterdam City Archives, burgomaster Gillis Valckenier had six children {{at the time of}} the painting's creation.|$|E
25|$|When {{they arrive}} in Ping, the capital, they win the {{friendship}} {{of a tiny}} great-grandchild named Ping Pong, who tells them the Emperor is in mourning. His daughter, Li Si, has been kidnapped and {{is being held in}} the Dragon City. Luke and Jim offer their help, and while investigating the circumstances of Li Si's disappearance, they stumble upon several names which are directly connected to Jim's mysterious arrival on Morrowland: Mrs. Grindtooth (Frau Mahlzahn), the Wild 13, and Sorrowland (Kummerland). Now Jim and Luke have <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> go to the Dragon City, located in Sorrowland, and confront Mrs. Grindtooth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Under favour, sir," [...] {{replied the}} yeoman, [...] "I have <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> for refraining <b>to</b> shoot, besides the fearing discomfiture and disgrace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You argue well," [...] I answered; [...] "also <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> comes <b>to</b> my mind. Those Arab brutes may {{get behind}} the slaves, of whom we should butcher a lot without hurting them. Stephen, I think we had better see the thing through here." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> {{that contributed}} <b>to</b> {{codification}} {{was that the}} notion of the nation-state required the recording of the law that would be applicable to that state.|$|R
25|$|One {{complication}} was {{the tidal}} {{flow in the}} English Channel, where high water moves from west to east, with high water at Lyme Regis occurring around six hours before it reaches Dover. If all the landings were to be made at high water across a broad front, {{they would have to}} be made at different times along different parts of the coast, with the landings in Dover being made six hours after any landings in Dorset and thus losing the element of surprise. If the landings were to be made at the same time, methods would have to be devised to disembark men, vehicles and supplies at all states of the tide. That was <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> favour landing craft.|$|E
25|$|Pat disowned his {{entertainer}} father, Simon Reynolds, {{when the}} latter {{came out as}} a homosexual. Simon has made efforts to reconcile with his son, which Pat has disgustedly repulsed. The entire topic of his father is off limits to Pat, suggesting repression issues. The comic has hinted at this complexity of his character for some time. In 2006, his own latent homosexuality was forced {{out into the open}} by the magical Mexican realism camera. Apparently both Pat and his father magically became homosexual due to the curse of Gladdington castle, wherein an ancestor of theirs was cursed such that all of his sons and their sons thereafter would become homosexual at the age of 26. Pat has since become much more comfortable about his homosexuality, using perceived persecution as just <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be angry at the world, and has been dating Rod Huggins, a gay porn star.|$|E
25|$|Legenden om Ljusets rike or Sagnet om Lysets rike in some Scandinavian {{language}} (in English The Legend of the Realm of Light; {{this novel}} {{has not been}} translated into English) {{is a set of}} fantasy novels by Norwegian-Swedish writer Margit Sandemo. It includes twenty titles. This set of novels can be read in Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic and Polish. Margit Sandemo says that she wrote this series of novels because she wanted, like many other fiction writers, to portray her own view about an idealized world. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> write Legenden om Ljusets rike was for the character called Marco who Sandemo created in the end of The Legend of the Ice People. She was so fond of him that she wanted to write more about Marco in the following series of novels. Those ideas took shape in her mind when she had written around half of Häxmästaren.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Another</b> common <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> commit an infraction is as {{last resort}} when an {{opposing}} player has a scoring opportunity, when a penalty kill is the preferable {{alternative to the}} scoring opportunity. [...] These are referred to on most broadcasts as [...] "Good Penalties".|$|R
5000|$|... "N. N." [...] is {{commonly}} used in the scoring of chess games, not only when one participant's name is genuinely unknown but when an untitled player faces a master, as in a simultaneous exhibition. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> is <b>to</b> protect a known player from the insult of a painful defeat.|$|R
25|$|The luthiers {{also worked}} {{with the idea of}} modifying the {{mandolin}} to meet local musical styles, making experimental changes to the necks of violins, guitars and mandolins to suit them to Cai luong opera music. In the mid-1930s, they made concave frets, scooping out extra wood between the frets, making the space between them deep and to allow the musicians to bend the notes, and stringing them with four single strings. Musicians Hai Nén and Hai Nhành were associated with the instruments, possibly being the first to use them. The sunken-fret mandolin (mandolin phím lõm) did not meet the musical needs as well as the sunken-fret guitar, because the mandolin's rigidity made it painful to get the same effects from the strings. Also the mandolin's narrow fretboard made it difficult to hit the notes. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> move to a bigger instrument was the pitch range of the mandolin, high pitched and not as useful to accompany singing as the instruments that replaced it in the opera.|$|E
500|$|In 1925, Gandhi gave <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> why he got {{involved}} in the Khilafat movement and the Middle East affairs between Britain and the Ottoman Empire. Gandhi explained to his co-religionists (Hindu) that he sympathised and campaigned for the Islamic cause, not because he cared for the Sultan, but because [...] "I wanted to enlist the Mussalman's sympathy {{in the matter of}} cow protection". According to the historian M. Naeem Qureshi, like the then Indian Muslim leaders who had combined religion and politics, Gandhi too imported his religion into his political strategy during the Khilafat movement.|$|E
500|$|Their small {{budget was}} <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> use the ship {{for much of}} the storytelling. When the {{characters}} did go off the ship, the worlds all had Earth atmosphere and coloring because they could not afford to design alien worlds. [...] "I didn't want to go to Yucca Flats every other episode and transform it into Bizarro World by making the sky orange", recalled Whedon. As Meyer recalled: [...] "I think in the end the feel was that we wound up using a lot of places or exteriors that just felt too Western and we didn't necessarily want to go that way; but at some point, it just became the lesser of two evils—what could we actually create in three days?" ...|$|E
50|$|The name ‘Pasar Malam Besar’ {{is derived}} from the Indonesian/Malay {{language}} and literally means ‘Great Night Market’. The new name was chosen to emphasise its link with the 'Tong Tong Foundation' and its cultural mission. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> was <b>to</b> distinguish oneself from the many other fairs under the name pasar malam.|$|R
5000|$|... "I had {{an angel}} on my shoulder", she said later. [...] "The studio {{respected}} my Australian credits and {{treated me like}} a star, but they cast me as 'Ann Richards', saying 'Shirley Ann, sounded too much like a Southern belle'". (<b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> was <b>to</b> avoid confusion with the actress Anne Shirley.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> has <b>to</b> do {{with the}} {{complexities}} of trade, in particular trade in services and international trade. Not only can it be difficult to correctly identify, survey and allocate particular financial incomes and expenditures, but also revaluations of assets occur, creating problems of how to value goods and services as such.|$|R
500|$|He chose shamanism as the {{principal}} topic of the series {{because he wanted to}} choose a subject that had never been approached in manga before. He said he incorporated his own personality and beliefs in Shaman King. He has an interest in the topic, and [...] "choosing shamanism as the subject of this story seemed like a natural extension of that." [...] For the title, he said he used [...] "shaman", an English word, {{due to the fact that}} [...] "the nuance is really great" [...] and because he could not find a Japanese word with the accurate meaning of the word [...] "shaman". <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> have shamanism as the main subject was because he could explore elements from different cultures and their relationship with the dead and the spirits.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{visual effects}} were {{produced}} by Rainmaker Digital Effects. Gero wrote the scene involving the minute long sequence where the Horizon weapon fires from the Apollo to the Asuran homeworld. He {{made contact with}} Mark Savela {{to see if it}} could be done; Savela was up to the challenge. The sequence was costly, since the visual effects team had to make a 3D world that would last a minute long to ensure that the sequence followed Gero's script. The sequences where Atlantis takes off {{from the bottom of the}} ocean were stock footage from [...] "Rising", with the shield and beam added on. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> keep the scenes was because the writers liked the scene to be reused. Another visual effect was used to switch Keller's flag patch from Canadian to American, since the decision to have Keller an American character was made after filming.|$|E
500|$|Since 1992 Alejandro Fernandez {{established}} his musical {{career as a}} ranchera singer, parallel to that of his father the King of Ranchera music, Vicente Fernandez. His previous albums, Alejandro Fernández (1992), Piel De Niña (1993), Grandes Éxitos a la Manera de Alejandro Fernández (1994), Que Seas Muy Feliz (1995), and Muy Dentro de Mi Corazón (1996), helped solidify {{his reputation as a}} ranchera singer. Although his last album, Muy Dentro de Mi Corazón, was a success, Fernández did not want to simply record another ranchera album. [...] "If I had released another album of just rancheras, people would have just expected the same thing, and then they would have begun to judge me by that one [...] theme", Fernández explained. He also noted bolero's popularity on radio stations, and cited his waning radio airplay as <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> change. After listening to Mi Tierra (1993) by Gloria Estefan, Fernández sought out her husband Emilio to ask him to produce his next album. After hearing Fernández's proposal, Emilio Estefan agreed to produce the album.|$|E

Several online databases were explored to provide ample listing of doctoral theses and journa...|$|R
50|$|The walk-up windows {{generally}} provide similar {{customer experience}} with the drive-throughs by allowing customers to receive services from {{the exterior of the}} facilities through a window. There are many reasons for the owners to provide such services. An example is when McDonald's entered a new market in Russia where the majority of families didn't own cars, the owners developed the walk-up windows as an alternative. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> is <b>to</b> have a drive-through experience in the locations that are not feasible to construct a drive-through lane such as in city centers. Some establishments may want to use walk-up windows to attract certain customer demographics such as younger customers who need quick services during late night. Also <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> is <b>to</b> offer extended service hours and maintain a safe environment for employees such as a bulletproof walk-up window of convenience stores in high-crime areas.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> is <b>to</b> {{intentionally}} reduce power and/or {{torque to}} improve traction in sub-optimal road conditions. For example, applying full engine {{power to the}} drive-wheels on wet or icy roads may cause the wheels to slip. Likewise, short shifting can help maintain vehicle stability through bends by avoiding an unsettling shift in balance mid-corner.|$|R
500|$|Horses {{normally}} require {{free access}} to all the fresh, clean water they want, and to avoid dehydration, should not be kept from water longer than four hours at any one time. However, water may need to be temporarily limited in quantity when a horse is very hot after a heavy workout. As long as a hot horse continues to work, it can drink its fill at periodic intervals, provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources. [...] But when the workout is over, a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30–90 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time. However, dehydration is also a concern, so some water needs to be offered during the cooling off process. [...] A hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked. [...] Sometimes the thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout, which is <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period.|$|E
500|$|Kristin Booker of {{the fashion}} website Refinery29 {{described}} the scent as a [...] "voluptuous, sexy floral". Kathleen Hou writing for New York opined that the perfume's best part {{was that it was}} inspired by a poem by Angelou. Hou also noted feminist influences in the scent with usual additions of orchid and masculine notes of autumn woods, cashmere, musk, and vetiver extract. She concluded her review by stating [...] "Maya Angelou-reading perfume sounds (and will surely smell) pretty good". With a similar opinion, Treye Green of the International Business Times noted more masculine notes with the addition of woods, cashmere, musk. She hailed Rise as a [...] "sweet treat" [...] for her fans along her self-titled album's surprise release a week earlier and noted, [...] "Beyoncé's definition of feminism has stirred quite the debate following her new album's release. But maybe her perfume version of it will be more openly embraced – plus who can deny the genius of a Maya Angelou-inspired scent." [...] Madison Lafayette in an article for VIBE Vixen praised Beyoncé's decision to release Rise [...] "capitaliz off" [...] her success and [...] "giving us <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> talk about her".|$|E
500|$|Producer Jim Stewart had {{the idea}} to produce a duet album with Otis Redding and Carla Thomas, as {{he thought it would}} help their musical careers' progress, and that [...] " [...] rawness and [...] sophistication would work" [...] well together. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> combine the two artists was in the hopes of {{achieving}} a success similar to that which Motown singer Marvin Gaye had with both Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston. Carla Thomas was already successful in the R business; she had already had many singles appear in both the Hot 100 and Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles charts, most recently her 1966 song [...] "B-A-B-Y". Redding agreed to record with Thomas, simply stating, [...] "Well, hey, you from Memphis, you from Tennessee, you can hang". At the time the album was recorded in January 1967, Thomas was studying at Howard University in Washington D.C. for an M.A. in English. Recorded in about six days (another source states only three days), the album features eleven songs: ten covers of soul classics, and an eleventh song, [...] "Ooh Carla, Ooh Otis", that Redding co-wrote with Al Bell. It features house band Booker T. & the M.G.'s, pianist Isaac Hayes, and the brass section The Memphis Horns. Six out of eleven songs were cut during their session; the rest were overdubbed by Redding in the following days owing to their concert obligations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> relates <b>to</b> the {{hydraulic}} control line. Hydraulic pressure {{is required to}} keep the valve open {{as part of the}} failsafe design. However, if the valve is too far down the well, then the weight of {{the hydraulic}} fluid alone may apply sufficient pressure to keep the valve open, even with the loss of surface pressurisation.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Jong-hoon, Min-hwan, and Jae-jin {{formed a}} {{sub-group}} called F.T. Triple. Some {{of the reasons}} behind this lineup were to showcase more of the members' skills and to prevent main singer, Lee Hong-gi, from overstraining his voice again. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> was <b>to</b> continue promoting F.T. Island while Hong-gi was filming You're Beautiful while Seung-hyun was having a break.|$|R
30|$|It {{is noted}} that for sample C the EEF value is 0.34, and the AFE value times the EEF value equals 0.40, {{which is much}} smaller than the {{observed}} PEF value of 1.55.
