Consequently, Baudrillard was accused of lazy amoralism, cynical scepticism, and Berkelian idealism. Sympathetic commentators such as William Merrin (in his book Baudrillard and the Media) have argued that Baudrillard was {{more concerned with the}} West's technological and political dominance and the globalization of its commercial interests, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> for the present possibility of war.

2500|$|Continuing on {{the idea}} from the {{previous}} Marvel Netflix series that New York City is a [...] "fifth Defender", Loeb said the series would examine the high-end financial world of New York City, examining [...] "the One Percent of the One Percent and how that affects our world on a day-to-day basis... high-level corporation, Big Pharma, things like that". Jones added the series examined [...] "corporate corruption and corporate responsibility in the modern world, and... ow much do corporations have impact on society? And what we actually look at in the show is the heroin epidemic of the city, and how corporations maybe actually fund the heroin epidemic, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> to society". In terms of Rand donning a comic-based costume in the season, Buck stated, [...] "There was no good reason we could imagine to put Danny Rand in a costume. Because Danny Rand is still discovering who he is as a hero and where {{he is going to}} be, so he’s not yet ready to put on a mask or a costume. t the same time he is someone who is rather well known as a billionaire, so he can’t necessarily go out in public and do the things he does without being recognized. It does become an issue for the character." ...|$|E

While certain band members have left to pursue what was perceived to be a more lucrative rock music career, Donnie Walsh has a different perspective: [...] "Just around when I started here were all these guys in blues bands and of course they were impatient and they wanted to make some more money so they became rock bands. I played the blues then and I play the blues now. That's what I love. ... It's a living thing, it's living music.

Much of my work is about connection. I want to create work that reminds us that we share a common environment and that our similarities are greater than our differences. As a choreographer, I am an observer. I try to look honestly at how dancers connect to movement and to the complex web of relationships.

50|$|Early 2003 saw {{the release}} of Number Three which further {{reflected}} the growth of ST in both ideas and format.

Thematically {{this would be the}} establishment of what ST has been known for: the primary source for critical and analytical anarcho-primitivist critique and praxis.
