The regime alleged these officers and others (including Mobutu's civil secrétaire particulier) had plotted the assassination of Mobutu, high treason, and disclosure of military secrets, among other offences. The alleged coup was investigated by a revolutionary commission headed by Boyenge Mosambay Singa, at that time head of the Gendarmerie. Writing in 1988, Michael Schatzberg said the full details of the coup had yet to emerge.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's {{novels and}} early screen adaptations {{presented}} minimal {{equipment such as}} the booby-trapped <b>attaché</b> case in From Russia with Love, although this situation changed dramatically with the films. However, {{the effects of the}} two Eon-produced Bond films Dr. No and From Russia with Love had an effect on the novel The Man with the Golden Gun, through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, Mashbir held a {{position}} teaching military science and tactics at Syracuse University, where he first considered studying the Japanese language and culture. In August 1919, {{he asked the}} War Department if he could embark on this course of study, stating {{that it was his}} intention to apply for a posting to Japan for the purpose of learning the language if the War Department saw fit. Ranked captain, Mashbir was assigned as one of four US Army Language Officers in Japan on 7 July 1920. He relocated to Tokyo the following month to begin his four-year tour. When he arrived he reported for duty to Lieutenant Colonel Charles Burnett, the military <b>attaché.</b> Having few Army colleagues, while in Tokyo Mashbir sought the company of other intelligence professionals in the navy, one of whom was an assistant naval <b>attaché,</b> Lieutenant-Commander Ellis M. Zacharias, with whom Mashbir began a lifelong friendship and collaboration. In July 1922, at Zacharias' request, Mashbir secretly worked day and night to produce a secret plan to gather intelligence and get information out of Japan in case of war; it become known as M-Plan, named after Mashbir. His undisclosed activities working for the naval <b>attaché</b> did not sit well with his superiors, however.|$|E
5|$|On July 7, 1941, Hansell went to London, England, as {{a special}} {{observer}} attached to the military <b>attaché,</b> where he was privy to {{the inner workings of}} RAF intelligence and their target folders on the German industrial infrastructure. In his memoir, Hansell stated that in the exchange of information, the AAF received nearly a ton of material, shipped back to the United States in a bomber.|$|E
5|$|Smeli was {{launched}} on 1 December 1928, and Osvetnik on 14 January 1929. They {{arrived in the}} Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast on 9 December 1929. In 1932, the British naval <b>attaché</b> reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.|$|E

5|$|The {{most senior}} {{military}} officer in-country was the AIRA, the ambassador's air <b>attaché,</b> an Air Force colonel. The air <b>attaché</b> office originally consisted of that officer {{and six other}} personnel. The burgeoning air programs in Laos however, dictated the dispatch of 117 more Air Force personnel during 1966. The Air Force conducted its operations {{under the aegis of}} Project 404, whose mission was to support the Royal Laotian military, the clandestine Hmong army, and to support project personnel, who coordinated the operational end of covert activities in Laos. Eventually, five air operations centers were created in Laos – at Vientiane, Pakse, Savannakhet, Long Tieng, and Luang Prabang. These centers supported the ambassador with intelligence, administrative services, and communications as well as the actual air operations under a program called Palace Dog.|$|E
5|$|Upon his return, Averescu {{steadily}} climbed {{through the}} ranks. He {{was head of}} the Bucharest Military Academy (1894–1895), and, in 1895-1898, Romania's military <b>attaché</b> in the German Empire; a colonel in 1901, he was advanced to the rank of Brigadier General and became head of the Tecuci regional Army Command Center in 1906.|$|E

5|$|Ali Abu Nuwar (surname also spelled Abu Nuwwar, Abu Nawar or Abu Nowar; 1925 – 15 August 1991) was a Jordanian army officer, {{serving as}} chief of staff in May 1956 – April 1957. He participated in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War as an {{artillery}} officer in the Jordanian army's predecessor, the Arab Legion, but his vocal opposition to British influence in Jordan led to his virtual exile to Paris as military <b>attaché</b> in 1952. There, he forged close ties with Jordanian crown prince Hussein, who promoted Abu Nuwar after his accession to the throne.|$|E
5|$|By Order 1191 of , Romania's Minister of War, Vintilă Brătianu, {{created the}} Volunteer Corps {{as a special}} {{formation}} of the national army. On the same day, in Darnytsia, Pietraru was tasked by Chief of Staff Constantin Prezan with equipping the new recruits and organizing them into units. The honorary command was assigned to Constantin Coandă, who was already the military <b>attaché</b> with Russia's Stavka (General Headquarters). Over the next month, in Mogilev, Coandă again negotiated the Corps' recognition by Stavka. Coandă received the permission, {{but the number of}} recruits was no longer clearly specified.|$|E
5|$|Denning became {{best known}} {{as a result of his}} report into the Profumo Affair. John Profumo was the Secretary of State for War with the British government. At a party in 1961 Profumo was {{introduced}} to Christine Keeler, a showgirl, and began having an affair with her. At the same time she was in a relationship with Yevgeni Ivanov, a naval <b>attaché</b> at the embassy of the Soviet Union. On 26 January 1963 Keeler was contacted by police on an unrelated matter and voluntarily gave them information about her relationship with Profumo.|$|E
5|$|During the Phoney War the Netherlands officially {{adhered to}} {{a policy of}} strict neutrality. In secret, the Dutch {{military}} command, partly acting on its own accord, negotiated with both Belgium and France via the Dutch military <b>attaché</b> in Paris, Lieutenant-Colonel David van Voorst Evekink to coordinate a common defence to a German invasion. This failed because of insurmountable differences of opinion {{about the question of}} which strategy to follow.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Stanković {{assured the}} British naval <b>attaché</b> that Yugoslav naval policy {{was focused on}} the defence of her coastline, but he also opined that this task would require {{significant}} expansion of the navy, including the acquisition of six cruisers and five more flotilla leaders similar to Dubrovnik. In the same year, Dubrovnik sailed to the Black Sea then visited several ports in the Mediterranean with King Alexander and Queen Marie aboard. During 1932, the Maritime Air Force had bases at Divulje and Đenovići, with two bomber squadrons and one reconnaissance squadron at each base, each squadron consisting of 12 aircraft. In 1934, the British naval <b>attaché</b> reported that the French had significant influence on Yugoslav naval policy. In the same year, the KJRM comprised 517 officers and 6,461 men, and Stanković retired and was replaced by Rear-Admiral M.L. Polić. In October, Hrabri and Smeli conducted visits to various Mediterranean ports. Despite the fact that a half-flotilla of large destroyers {{was not going to be}} built, the idea that Dubrovnik might operate with a number of smaller destroyers persisted. In 1934, the KJRM decided to acquire three such destroyers to operate in a division led by Dubrovnik. In August 1935, Dubrovnik visited Corfu and Bizerte, the seaplane carrier Zmaj along with three Galeb-class mine tenders also visited Corfu, and Hrabri and Osvetnik visited Malta.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 he {{returned}} to Germany {{as a member of}} the International Force supervising the Saarland plebiscite. Afterwards, he joined the German Intelligence Section at the War Office. In 1937 he became Assistant Military <b>attaché</b> in Berlin to Noel Mason-Macfarlane. As such, Strong got to know many senior German military officers personally, including Wilhelm Keitel. Like Mason-Macfarlane, he became convinced that war with Germany was imminent and inevitable.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Mashbir {{returned}} to Japan after an 11-year absence {{in a second}} attempt to launch the M-Plan {{on behalf of the}} Office of Naval Intelligence and his friend, naval <b>attaché</b> Zacharias. At that time, there was still hope that war between Japan and America might still be prevented. This mission aroused suspicions among ill-informed military attachés in Tokyo and an investigation was started into Mashbir. In a misunderstanding that would come close to damaging his career irreparably once more, Mashbir was investigated in Hawaii and, influenced by the military <b>attaché</b> suspicions, a prejudicial report based upon erroneous assumptions was delivered on 24 June 1937. Colonel Mashbir was advised on 25 February 1939 that he was disenrolled from the Military Intelligence Division G2 Reserves for failure to report on the specified day for physical examination. However, it appeared that the actual cause of the disenrollment was due to suspicions aroused by failure to communicate to uninformed individuals the nature and the extent of the work on which he was actually engaged. Mashbir's dismissal and the failure to implement an intelligence network such as that suggested in Mashbir's M-Plan {{has been described as a}} key factor in the United States' failure to have more information on Japan before the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.|$|E
5|$|In June and July 1930, Hrabri, Nebojša and {{the fleet}} {{auxiliary}} Sitnica again cruised the Mediterranean, visiting Alexandria and Beirut. In 1932, the British naval <b>attaché</b> reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets. In September 1933, Nebojša and the submarine Osvetnik cruised {{the southern part}} of the central Mediterranean. In August 1936, Nebojša and Osvetnik visited the Greek island of Corfu.|$|E
5|$|Johan Randulf Bull Hambro (24 October 1915 – 27 February 1993) was a Norwegian journalist, {{translator}} and biographer. He was {{the fourth}} son of Norwegian politician C. J. Hambro, whose biography he wrote in 1984. He lived in the United States from 1939 to 1982, where he studied {{and worked as a}} foreign-affairs journalist, press <b>attaché</b> and consulate-general. He was secretary general of the Norse Federation for 27 years, from 1955 to 1982. He was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{among the}} German {{members of the}} {{delegation}} were Niedermayer and von Hentig. Von Hentig was a Prussian military officer who had served as the military <b>attaché</b> to Beijing in 1910 and Constantinople in 1912. Fluent in Persian, he was appointed secretary of the German legation to Tehran in 1913. Von Hentig was serving on the Eastern front as a lieutenant with the Prussian 3rd Cuirassiers when he was recalled to Berlin for the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The Condor Legion, upon establishment, {{consisted}} of the Kampfgruppe 88, with three squadrons of Ju 52 bombers and the Jagdgruppe 88 with three squadrons of Heinkel He 51 fighters, the reconnaissance Aufklärungsgruppe 88 (supplemented by the Aufklärungsgruppe See 88), an anti-aircraft group, the Flakbteilung 88, and a signals group, the Nachrichtenabteilung 88.

Returning from Germany, Kork became commander of the Moscow Military District. In 1935 he became head of the Frunze Military Academy with the rank of Komandarm 2nd rank. At this time he was the highest-ranking Estonian Red Army officer. During the Great Purge, Kork was arrested and shot as part of the Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization. He was acquitted twenty years later.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} Army General Staff gave Matsui an {{assignment}} in France, but in 1907 {{he got his}} wish to go to China, where he worked as an aide to the military <b>attaché</b> and did intelligence work. Matsui worked in China between 1907 and 1911, and then again as resident officer in Shanghai between 1915 and 1919. In 1921 Matsui was posted to Siberia as a staff officer, but returned in 1922 to China where he served until 1924 as an advisor to Zhang Zuolin in the Manchurian city of Harbin and did intelligence work for Japan's Kwantung Army.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{travels to}} Turkey and meets with Ali Kerim Bey, the MI6 officer in Turkey. Between them, they obtain the Lektor, {{and the three}} escape with the device on the Orient Express. However, they are {{followed}} by Grant, who kills Kerim Bey and a Soviet security officer. Grant pretends to be another British agent and meets Bond. Over dinner Grant drugs Romanova, then overcomes Bond. Bond tricks Grant into opening Bond's <b>attaché</b> case in the manner that detonates its tear gas booby trap, allowing Bond to attack and kill him. Bond and Romanova escape with the Lektor to Venice. Rosa Klebb, disguised as a hotel maid, attempts to steal the Lektor and kill Bond, but ends up being shot by Romanova.|$|E
5|$|Croatia and Hungary {{established}} {{diplomatic relations}} on 16 and 18 January 1992, after Hungary recognised {{the independence of}} Croatia on 15 January 1992. As of December 2011 Croatia maintains an embassy in Budapest (headed by ambassador Ivan Bandić), a consulate general in Pécs and a consulate in Nagykanizsa. The Nagykanizsa consulate is led by an honorary consul. Hungary maintains an embassy in Zagreb and consulates in Rijeka and Split. The embassy is headed by ambassador Gábor Iván; the offices also include an army and air <b>attaché</b> office in the Republic of Croatia (headed by László Hajas) and the Office for Economic Affairs of the Embassy of the Republic of Hungary in the Republic of Croatia (headed by András Péter Závoczky, Counsellor for Economy and Trade).|$|E
5|$|Despite this support, the {{economic}} {{resources of the}} Ottoman Empire were depleted by {{the cost of the}} Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 and the French, British and Germans had offered financial aid. A pro-German faction influenced by Enver Pasha, the former Ottoman military <b>attaché</b> in Berlin, opposed the pro-British majority in the Ottoman cabinet and tried to secure closer relations with Germany. In December 1913, the Germans sent a military mission to Constantinople, headed by General Otto Liman von Sanders. The geographical position of the Ottoman Empire meant that Russia and her allies France and Britain had a significant interest in Turkish neutrality in the event of war in Europe.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, while {{posted in}} Paris as Peruvian air <b>attaché,</b> Bielovucic {{actively}} {{cooperated with the}} French Resistance. At the age of 57, he parachuted from the Eiffel Tower. Bielovucic died in Paris on 14 January 1949 and was buried at the Cimetiere nouveau de Neuilly in the Nanterre commune of Paris. His biography was written by Lieutenant General José Zlatar Stambuk of the Peruvian Air Force and published in 1990. In Croatia, he {{is regarded as the}} first Croatian aviator because of his paternal ethnic origin. He is known as Ivan Bjelovučić there, while most sources refer to him as Jean Bielovucic or Juan Bielovucic Cavalié.|$|E
5|$|HMS Swordfish was {{developed}} to meet a requirement of Royal Navy's Submarine Committee for a large submarine capable of operating with the fleet at a surfaced speed of 20 knots. Most of the earlier British submarines had been single-hulled vessels built by Vickers, and the Navy was interested in evaluating other designs. Captain Roger Keyes, Inspecting Captain of Submarines, had previously served as naval <b>attaché</b> in Italy and had kept abreast of Italian submarine developments, which notably included double-hulled submarines designed by Cesare Laurenti of Fiat-San Giorgio. Three boats of the S class were ordered first and Laurenti was invited to submit a design to meet the RN requirement.|$|E
5|$|He {{grew up in}} the Uranienborg {{neighbourhood}} in the West End of Oslo, {{and enrolled}} at the Royal Frederick University in 1933. Following law studies, he graduated in 1939 with a cand.jur. degree, and travelled to the United States to study at Columbia University in New York. From 1940 to 1945, during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, he was employed at the Norwegian general consulate in New York City. He worked as a foreign affairs journalist for the conservative newspaper Aftenposten from 1946 to 1948 and for the Norwegian News Agency from 1949 to 1953. He was a press <b>attaché</b> for the Norwegian United Nations delegation in 1953 and 1954. After that, he was stationed in New York as a foreign correspondent and radio chronicler for Norway.|$|E
5|$|Hitler later {{blamed the}} failure of his {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, {{which had to be}} delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece. The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military <b>attaché</b> in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.|$|E
5|$|Hrabri was {{launched}} in 1927 as the first submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which later became the Royal Yugoslav Navy. Along with Nebojša, she left the Tyne in late January 1928. In company with the Yugoslav submarine tender , the two submarines arrived in the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast on 8 April 1928. In May and June 1929, Hrabri, Nebojša, Hvar and six torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser Dalmacija on a cruise to Malta, the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea, and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. According to the British naval <b>attaché,</b> the ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} armistice, Enns was crewed by sailors of the KSCS in 1918–19. Under {{the terms of}} the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye {{concluded}} in September 1919, Enns was transferred to the KSCS along with a range of other vessels, including three other river monitors, and was officially handed over to the KSCS navy and renamed Drava in 1920. Her sister ship Inn was transferred to Romania and renamed Besarabia. In 1925–26, Drava was refitted, but by the following year only two of the four river monitors of the KSCS Navy were being retained in full commission at any time. In 1932, the British naval <b>attaché</b> reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in little gunnery training, and few exercises or manoeuvres, due to reduced budgets.|$|E
