2500|$|Gompers and his AFL unions vigorously {{fought the}} IWW in the U.S. and in Latin America, as a {{disruptive}} dual union that tried harder to destroy capitalism than to help workers. He cooperated with widespread government arrests of union leaders for the IWW's militant {{opposition to the}} World War. He said, [...] "the IWW's...are exactly what the Bolsheviki are in Russia, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> what the IWW Bolsheviki in Russia have done for the working people." [...] The IWW was practically defunct by 1920.|$|E

6000|$|For the Life was {{manifested}}, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it, {{and bear}} witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which {{was with the}} Father and was manifested unto us! ...|$|E
60|$|When morning dawned {{the train}} was running through Canada, and excitedly calling upon Franklin to rouse, I peered from the window, expecting to see a land entirely {{different}} from Wisconsin <b>and</b> Illinois. <b>We</b> were both somewhat disappointed to find nothing distinctive in either the land or its inhabitants. However, it was a foreign soil <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it. So much of our exploration was accomplished.|$|R
30|$|For the {{weighted}} means T_λ <b>and</b> M_λ <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> that T_λ=SB(A_λ,Q_λ) <b>and</b> M_λ=SB(Q_λ,A_λ). Analogous relation for P_λ {{seems to be}} not obvious. We then put the following as open problem.|$|R
60|$|MISS SUSAN. I was not {{thinking}} of that. I was thinking that he is {{to be at the}} ball to-night; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not <b>seen</b> him for ten years.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{doubt if}} we shall ever get there," [...] Hallett said. [...] "I am feeling as hungry as a rat, already; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> nothing to put between our lips since we started out, {{yesterday}} morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We fear no enemies but the red men, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> none of {{them since}} we reached this river. What {{is the name of}} the enemy you so dread, and where is he to be found?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes,' said Felix, {{with a sort}} of half {{contempt}} in his tone; 'but {{these boys}} of ours are a different sort of stuff, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> that it will never answer to pin them down to plod.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> thus <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> {{what kind}} of ideas <b>we</b> <b>have</b> of SUBSTANCES OF ALL KINDS, wherein they consist, <b>and</b> how <b>we</b> came by them. From whence, I think, it is very evident, ...|$|R
60|$|Quick as the {{lightning}} flash his gun flew to his shoulder. Dechamp was a first-rate shot. He fired, <b>and,</b> as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> the wolf stretched himself in death upon the plain.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will have}} some {{difficulty}} in finding such a person," [...] said the duke. [...] "If, indeed, the blundering affair of 1834 had not occurred, and things had taken their legitimate course, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a man like Lord Stanley for instance {{at the head of}} affairs, or leading a great party, why then indeed your friends the conservatives,--for every sensible man must be a conservative, in the right sense of the word,--would have stood in a very different position; but now--," [...] and his grace shook his head.|$|R
60|$|Section 43. We {{have now}} {{considered}} our types, {{both from the}} standpoint of adult anatomy and from embryological data; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> through the vertebrate series a common structure underlying wide diversity in external appearance and detailed anatomy. We have seen a certain intermediateness of structure in the frog, as compared with the rabbit and dog-fish, notably in the skull and skeleton, in the circulation, in the ear, and in the reduced myomeres; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> that the rabbit passes in these respects, and in others, through dog-fish- and frog-like stages in its development, and this alone would be quite sufficient to suggest that the similarities of structure are due to other causes than a primordial adaptation to certain conditions of life.|$|E
6000|$|... "We welcome Your Majesty," [...] said one. [...] "We {{have known}} you many years ago, before {{you went to}} live at the Emerald City, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> you fight the terrible Kalidahs and conquer them, so we know you are the King of all Beasts." ...|$|E
6000|$|Poor Lord Carlisle; he, no doubt, trusted in his affectionate {{ward and}} kinsman, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> how the affectionate ward and kinsman acknowledged, like Macbeth, [...] "the double trust" [...] only to abuse it. We shall now show how much another Noble Peer, Lord Holland, has to trust to from his ingenuous dedicator.|$|E
30|$|Thus, from (7.6), (7.9), (7.10), <b>and</b> (7.12), <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> that x 0 is a {{solution}} of (7), which contradicts the fact that x∗ is {{a solution}} of (7). Hence, x∗ is pareto optimal.|$|R
60|$|Besides being long-limbed, Nikel Sling was nimble. He distanced his pursuers easily, <b>and,</b> as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> swam off <b>and</b> {{reached his}} ship {{almost as soon}} as they gained the end of the wharf.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{the last}} two I can say less, Your Majesty, for we took no part in, having Prince Rupert's orders, given as he came up, {{that we should not}} {{adventure}} into the fight. Therefore, we were but spectators, though we kept {{on the edge of the}} fight and, if opportunity <b>had</b> offered, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> one of our ships too hard pressed, and threatened by fire-ships, <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> ventured so far to transgress orders as to bear in <b>and</b> do what <b>we</b> could on her behalf; but indeed, the smoke was so great that we could see but little.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea, my Lord," [...] {{said the}} smith, {{looking up from}} the horse's foot; [...] "'tis the trade of yonder {{philosophers}} to gainsay whatever honest folk believed before them. They'll deny next that hens lay eggs, or blight rots wheat. My good wife speaks but plain truth, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it o'er and o'er again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes I think," [...] she said, [...] "that our {{wealth is}} our misfortune. Now you understand, don't you? Prince Ughtred was {{very kind to}} us at Cairo and on the voyage back, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> quite a little of him in London. I should like to give him {{something}} really useful. Please suggest something." ...|$|E
6000|$|Life is not void or {{stuff for}} scorners: [...] We have laughed loud and kept our love, [...] We have heard singers in tavern corners [...] And not {{forgotten}} the birds above: [...] We have known smiters and sons of thunder [...] And not unworthily walked with them, [...] We have grown wiser and lost not wonder; [...] <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> Jerusalem.|$|E
30|$|Setting α=l= 1 in (2.12) <b>and</b> (2.13), respectively, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> (<b>see</b> [13], p. 2786, Theorem  8) the following.|$|R
6000|$|His lordship, as the {{principal}} personage in social rank, shall be reported first. He said: [...] "More than a week <b>has</b> passed, Romayne, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> neither <b>seen</b> you nor heard from you. Why have you neglected us?" ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{concepts}} of s-closed sub-spaces, locally s-closed spaces have been introduced <b>and</b> characterized. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> that local s-closedness is a semi-regular property; the concept of s-ÃŽÂ¸-closed mapping has been introduced here and the following important properties are established:...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} among our islands, Sir Gervaise? But indeed, I need not ask that, since I know that you and Sir Ralph were knighted {{together}} for your valour in that affair with the ships of Hassan Ali. We come from Lesbos. It is now eighty years since my family settled in Rhodes, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it grow from a small place to a great fortress." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{test this}} doctrine, let us first suppose an {{argument}} consisting only {{of a single}} step, which would be represented by one syllogism. This argument does rest on an assumption, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in the preceding chapters what the assumption is. It is, that whatever has a mark, has what it is a mark of. The evidence of this axiom I shall not consider at present;(92) let us suppose it (with Mr. Spencer) to be the inconceivableness of its reverse.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, no, good Mother Ceres," [...] {{said the}} {{innocent}} sea nymphs, tossing back their green ringlets, and looking {{her in the}} face. [...] "We never should dream of such a thing. Proserpina has been at play with us, it is true; but she left us a long while ago, meaning only to run a little way upon the dry land, and gather some flowers for a wreath. This was early in the day, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> nothing of her since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We only arrived this morning," [...] Percy said, quietly, [...] "so {{that you}} could hardly have heard of us, unless {{some of the people}} of your place {{happened}} to pass, when we were at work; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not <b>seen</b> anyone, all day." ...|$|R
40|$|Owing {{to recent}} {{developments}} in molecular biology <b>and</b> biotechnology, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> rapid growth {{in the development of}} industrial processes to produce valuable substances by microbial means. The idea is not new to the fermentation technologist because they are the means for producing beverages, antibiotics, and many othe...|$|R
50|$|René Descartes {{believed}} the body could exist through mechanical means alone. This included digestion, blood circulation, muscle movement and some brain function. He felt {{we all know}} what the human body is like because animals <b>have</b> similar bodies <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> all <b>seen</b> them opened up.|$|R
60|$|If the Arrowpoints {{had such}} ruminations, {{it is the}} less {{surprising}} that they were stimulated in Mr. Gascoigne, who for being a clergyman was not the less subject to the anxieties of a parent and guardian; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> how both he and Mrs. Gascoigne might by this time have come to feel that he was overcharged with the management of young creatures who were hardly {{to be held in}} with bit or bridle, or any sort of metaphor that would stand for judicious advice.|$|E
6000|$|Then an idea flashed across Rupert. [...] "Well, sir, {{a rather}} curious thing has {{happened}} in the last few days. There has been a woman about here, and it appears she asked one of the boys which were the Clintons; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> her every time we have been out, and we both noticed that she has stared at us in a very strange way. I don't know that that can possibly {{have anything to do with}} it. She may have spoken to Edgar yesterday. Of course I cannot say." ...|$|E
60|$|So it proved. It {{was evident}} {{they were all}} out merely to do their spring shopping, or {{something}} that serves with them the same purpose that spring shopping does with us; and where they went afterwards we do not know. People speak of snakes' holes, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> them disappearing into such subterranean chambers; but we never opened one to see what sort of underground housekeeping went on there. After {{the first few days}} of spring, a snake was a rare visitor, though now and then one appeared.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, {{when asked}} if the members of Idlewild remain friends with Fairfoull, Rod Jones stated that [...] "there are no bad {{feelings}} between any of us <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> all <b>seen</b> Bob a few times {{over the last few years}} and remain on good terms." ...|$|R

50|$|This region {{then passed}} into the hands Memlukluların see them, then the people are Timur.
