5|$|Suzanne Jones sees a {{substantive}} difference between active listening as originated by Gordon and empathic listening {{as recommended by}} Rosenberg, insofar as active listening involves a specific step of reflecting what a speaker said {{to let them know}} you <b>are</b> <b>listening,</b> whereas empathic listening involves an ongoing process of listening with both heart and mind and being fully present to the other's experience, with an aim of comprehending and empathizing with the needs of the other, the meaning of the experience for that person.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong concluded: The {{responsibility}} for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E
5|$|Years go by as Scar squanders the kingdom's {{resources}} and allows his army of hyenas to wreak havoc upon the Pride Lands, which turn barren. Meanwhile, an alive and adult Simba is visited by Mufasa's ghost, who encourages {{him to return}} to the Pride Lands and take his rightful place as king. Aided by his friends Nala, Timon and Pumbaa, Simba arrives at Pride Rock and witnesses Scar striking his mother Sarabi and confronts Scar, who demands that Simba admit to the pride that he killed Mufasa. As he prepares to throw Simba off Pride Rock and have him meet a similar fate to that of his father, Scar whispers that {{he was the one who}} killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba tackles Scar and forces his uncle to admit the truth to the pride, initiating a ferocious battle between the pride, Timon, Pumbaa, Zazu, Rafiki and Scar's hyenas. Scar tries to escape, but is cornered by Simba on the top of Pride Rock; Scar begs for mercy and even attempts to blame his crimes on the hyenas, unaware that they <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> nearby. Simba ignores Scar and gives him one last chance to run away and never return. When Simba's back is turned, Scar attacks him and they fight. Simba bests Scar in combat and throws him over the cliff edge and into a pit. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the vengeful hyenas.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the great}} variety of {{different}} speakers and different conditions, listeners perceive vowels and consonants as constant categories. It has been proposed that this is achieved {{by means of the}} perceptual normalization process in which listeners filter out the noise (i.e. variation) to arrive at the underlying category. Vocal-tract-size differences result in formant-frequency variation across speakers; therefore a listener has to adjust his/her perceptual system to the acoustic characteristics of a particular speaker. This may be accomplished by considering the ratios of formants rather than their absolute values. This process has been called vocal tract normalization (see Figure 3 for an example). Similarly, listeners are believed to adjust the perception of duration to the current tempo of the speech they <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> to – this has been referred to as speech rate normalization.|$|E

25|$|Graham {{is seated}} {{to the right}} of the picture, on the left of the table that divides the picture. He is seen in full length, facing {{forwards}} though looking to the side, while smoking a long pipe. Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the table cloth, a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. Ronald Paulson identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain. The music the men <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> or singing along to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a pipe and tabor. A steward stands opposite him on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, but looks out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy drips from the plate down the back of the chaplain's coat. The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. The other, sat on his haunches on a chair on the right of the painting, is Hogarth's own pug, Trump. Trump, his tongue lolling out and wearing Graham's wig, holds a scroll and appears to read from his own sheet of music, balanced against a wine glass in front of him.|$|E

500|$|In January 2005, it was {{revealed}} Elliott {{had been working on}} a new album. Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so if we go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. I think both of us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, [...] "I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're going in the wrong direction. You trippin'.' I had to go back in the studio and come up with new records. , he was like, 'This is the Missy people <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> to.'" ...|$|E
500|$|She {{described}} the music as [...] "dirty south hip-hop" [...] and combining the genres of hip-hop and country, which she felt was a [...] "good hybrid". To achieve this sound, Cyrus worked with various hip hop producers including Mike Will Made It, Mac Miller, Pharrell Williams, and Tyler, the Creator in cities including Atlanta, Georgia. They {{helped her to}} incorporate hip hop music elements into the project, which Cyrus acknowledged resulted in a [...] "really different sound". Cyrus further commented that her project would [...] "shut everyone up", and later compared the record to Bad (1987) by Michael Jackson, in that [...] "people still <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> to [...] because it's so fucking dope" [...] and [...] " [...] people to listen to [...] album like that." [...] She also expressed her desire to [...] "set a new standard for pop music". Producer Sean Garrett called the record [...] "fun [...] exciting", and stated that a collaboration that Cyrus recorded with Britney Spears would appear on the final track listing. Mike Will Made It explained that the title for the album was decided upon after realizing that [...] "whole album was bangers".|$|E

It debuted on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart {{for the issue}} dated August 25, 2012, at number 15, representing the 25 songs charting under the Billboard Hot 100. During the week dated August 11, 2012, the single debuted at number three on the South Korea Gaon International Chart, with 35,870 digital download sales. [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] entered the UK Singles Chart issue dated at number 144 on August 15, 2012, and at number 29 on the UK R Chart. Similarly, it charted at number 135 during its debut week on the French Singles Chart. In Spain, the song debuted at number 36 on August 12, 2012. Critics have attributed the song's initial weak charting to its urban sound, describing it as having little Mainstream Top 40 or crossover appeal.

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Adam Mazmanian from Library Journal recommended Spin Alternative Record Guide to [...] "both public and academic libraries" [...] {{and said that}} while The Rolling Stone Album Guide (1992) also offers complete discographies of artists ranging from Jonathan Richman to Throbbing Gristle, this book's reviews are superior in [...] "length and scope". Mazmanian argued that [...] "this guide fills {{a gap in the}} literature of modern music" [...] at a time when [...] "alternative" [...] has developed a ubiquitous presence in the marketing of popular music. In New York magazine, Kim France called it [...] "a well-edited, unpretentious, and comprehensive look at all the crazy stuff the kids <b>are</b> <b>listening</b> to these days". In a less enthusiastic review, Booklist critic Gordon Flagg was impressed by the accuracy of the artist entries {{and the quality of the}} contributors' reviews, but found Weisbard's idea of alternative ill-defined and recommended The Trouser Press Record Guide (1991) as a more comprehensive alternative. Billboard magazine's Beth Renaud was more critical of the book, calling much of the writing biased and the organization unencyclopedic. She said Weisbard's [...] "obligatory" [...] essay is outdated and vague in defining alternative rock and that the contributors [...] "gush" [...] over artists usually covered by Spin, with many relevant artists omitted in place of more perplexing additions.|$|E

[...] Academy secretary Danius commented: [...] "The speech is extraordinary and, as one might expect, eloquent. Now that the lecture has been delivered, the Dylan adventure is coming to a close." [...] In his essay, Dylan writes about the impact that three important books made on him: Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front and Homer's The Odyssey. He concludes: [...] "Our songs are alive {{in the land of the}} living. But songs are unlike literature. They’re meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare’s plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page.
