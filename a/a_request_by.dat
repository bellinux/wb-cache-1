P√©ron's questionnaire remained unpublished until 1899, and very little was therefore known about the bird in life until then.|$|E

The trials were held under the Royal Warrant of 18 June 1945, thus under British Military Law. The decision put the trials on a shaky legal basis, as foreign nationals were being tried for crimes against foreigners in a foreign country. The first trial, held in Rome, was of Mackensen and M√§lzer for their part in the Ardeatine massacre. Both were sentenced to death on 30 November 1946.|$|E
