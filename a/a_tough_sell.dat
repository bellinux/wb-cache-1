2500|$|Upon its release, the Kinect {{garnered}} positive opinions from reviewers and critics. IGN {{gave the}} device 7.5 out of 10, saying that [...] "Kinect {{can be a}} tremendous amount of fun for casual players, and the creative, controller-free concept is undeniably appealing", though adding that for [...] "$149.99, a motion-tracking camera add-on for Xbox 360 is <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>sell,</b> especially considering that the entry level variation of Xbox 360 itself is only $199.99". Game Informer rated Kinect 8 out of 10, praising the technology but noting that the experience takes a while to get used to and that the spatial requirement may pose a barrier. Computer and Video Games called the device a technological gem and applauded the gesture and voice controls, while criticizing the launch lineup and Kinect Hub.|$|E
2500|$|Alastair Duncan, Anthony De Longis, [...] Alexis Denisof, Geraint Wyn Davies, Gary Daniels, and James Horan {{were all}} in the running for the lead role. Marc Singer who was {{originally}} offered the role of Connor MacLeod in the original movie was also a front runner for the lead before Adrian Paul was cast. [...] Dutch actor Derek de Lint was eventually cast as Conner Macleod. But for unknown reasons he left the project before production began. Adrian Paul beat out 400 hopefuls from the U.S, Canada and Europe for the lead role. Originally, the actor was <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>sell</b> to the investors because he was an unknown (though he played Russian ballet dancer Kolya in The Colbys), however the producers felt that he would appeal to both men and women fans of the franchise. Paul reminded them of a young Sean Connery. Adrian {{said in an interview that}} he was drawn to the series because it had so many layers: history, romance, adventure, spirituality. In an interview he said that he was the very first person to audition for the role in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|Acclaimed {{during his}} lifetime, Madetoja is today seldom heard outside the Nordic {{countries}} (the Elegia perhaps excepted). A few commentators, however, have described such neglect as unfortunate and undeserved, as Madetoja {{is one of}} the most important post-Sibelian Finnish symphonists. Part of this neglect is not unique to Madetoja: the titanic legacy of Sibelius has made it difficult for Finnish composers (especially his contemporaries), as a group, to gain much attention, and each has had to labor under his [...] "dominating shadow". However, with respect to the neglect of Madetoja in particular, something else might also be at play: Madetoja's eschewal of Romantic excess in favor of restraint, perhaps, has made him <b>a</b> <b>tougher</b> <b>sell</b> to audiences.

Among professional historians, it faces <b>a</b> <b>tougher</b> <b>sell.</b> Period specialists will resist the idea that their period is akin to several others. Sweeping theories of history are long out of fashion {{in the halls of}} ivy, and the authors' lack of academic standing won't help their cause. Their generational quartet is [...] "just too wooden" [...] and [...] "just too neat," [...] says one Yale historian. [...] "Prediction is for prophets," [...] scoffed William McLoughlin (a former history professor at Brown), who said it is wrong to think that [...] "if you put enough data together and have enough charts and graphs, you've made history into a science."

5000|$|According to Variety, {{films in}} 3D {{accumulated}} $1.3 billion in 2009, [...] "a threefold increase over 2008 {{and more than}} 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross". The increased ticket price - an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets - helped the film. Likewise, Entertainment Weekly attributed the film's success to 3D glasses, but also to its [...] "astronomic word-of-mouth". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but [...] "the buzz" [...] created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings. Gray said Avatar having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. [...] "The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes," [...] he said, [...] "but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: Titanic (historical events), the Star Wars movies (an established film franchise), or The Lord of the Rings (literature).

2500|$|Morton starred as {{a mother}} in the First World War context in Cider with Rosie, a made-for-television {{adaptation}} of the book with the same name by Laurie Lee. The film, described by The Telegraph as a [...] "lyrical, languid and poetic" [...] production, aired on BBC One in September 2015. In the same year, she took on {{a leading role in}} the European limited television series The Last Panthers. The six-part crime drama, inspired by the notorious Balkan jewel thieves the Pink Panthers, saw her play an insurance investigator charged with recovering stolen diamonds whatever the cost. Morton found her character to be a [...] "very truthful, [...] strong woman" [...] and described her as a [...] "female Bond". The show was broadcast on Sky Atlantic in the UK, and on SundanceTV in the US, to generally favourable reviews and moderate attention from viewers. Genevieve Valentine for The AV Club wrote: [...] "Morton might at first seem <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>sell</b> as someone so hard-boiled, but the taciturn, untouchable edifice she presents is leaking just enough poison at the edges that we look forward to watching her strike—the sort of character a six-hour miniseries was made for".|$|E

Altomare believed that new projects such as the nearby Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas would help to improve the area. Ivana Trump believed that the project's location was the best in Las Vegas because of flight patterns from McCarran International Airport, which prevented buildings taller than 40 floors from being erected on either side of Ivana Las Vegas.

UCI President Brian Cookson had criticised the subsidiary body during his election campaign, and the Tour of Beijing was not seen as being well-liked by cyclists. According to Cycling Weekly, [...] "Dull routes and an absence of roadside spectators meant the race failed to exhibit much of an atmosphere, and its position {{at the very end}} of the calendar made it even less appealing - a long flight eastwards after a whole season’s racing is <b>a</b> very <b>tough</b> <b>sell</b> to exhausted cyclists dreaming of the winter off." ...|$|R

However, GMT was <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> product to <b>sell</b> to most executives {{because it was}} a very technical sale. Top management in many prospective companies usually did not have the technical knowledge to understand the requirements of a teleprocessing monitor. Consequently, CIM needed to find prospective sites with technically knowledgeable data processing (DP) managers or sites that gave significant executive power to their lead technicians.|$|R

50|$|Horror games had {{traditionally}} been <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>sell</b> in the RPG industry, but Vampire included elements {{that made it}} a dark superhero game rather than purely a horror game. An extensive list of broad supernatural powers, called disciplines, which included superior strength, speed and toughness, {{as well as other}} powers such as mystic senses, mind control and blood magic, gave the player characters a more super-human rather than horror feel. The 13 clans added late in the development process provided a much needed character-class-like system based on vampiric archetypes which proved very popular with players.|$|E

While Tressel is still revered in the area (a new athletic training complex bearing his name, the Watson and Tressel Training Site, opened on campus in 2011), Tressel's highest level of education is a master's degree; a Doctorate is virtually a prerequisite for any university president position in the United States. Combined with the show-cause penalty that is in effect for Tressel until 2016, on paper it would have been <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>sell</b> for YSU to bring back Tressel.

5000|$|Although {{official}} capacity was stated to be 43,662 for baseball, seats were sometimes sold in Mount Davis as well, pushing [...] "real" [...] capacity {{to the area}} of 60,000. The ready availability of tickets on game day made season tickets <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>sell,</b> while crowds as high as 30,000 often seemed sparse in such a venue. On December 21, 2005, the Athletics announced that seats in the Coliseum's third deck would not be sold for the 2006 season, but would instead be covered with a tarp, and that tickets would no longer be sold in Mount Davis under any circumstances. That effectively reduced capacity to 34,077, making the Coliseum the smallest stadium in Major League Baseball. As of 2008, sections 316-318 are the only open third-deck sections for A's games, bringing the total capacity to 35,067.

[...] He also cited creative differences with Amazon's executives saying: [...] "With [...] "The After" [...] I wanted to do Dante, I {{wanted to do the}} [...] "Inferno" [...] and it's not a genre piece and so what's scary to people is if it's something they don't recognize.
