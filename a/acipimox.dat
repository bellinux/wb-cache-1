50|$|Taken as such, {{increases}} in leptin levels (in response to caloric intake) {{function as an}} acute pro-inflammatory response mechanism to prevent excessive cellular stress induced by overeating. When high caloric intake overtaxes the ability of fat cells to grow larger or increase in number in step with caloric intake, the ensuing stress response leads to inflammation at the cellular level and ectopic fat storage, i.e., the unhealthy storage of body fat within internal organs, arteries, and/or muscle. The insulin increase {{in response to the}} caloric load provokes a dose-dependent rise in leptin, an effect potentiated by high cortisol levels. (This insulin-leptin relationship is notably similar to insulin's effect on the increase of IL-6 gene expression and secretion from preadipocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner.) Furthermore, plasma leptin concentrations have been observed to gradually increase when <b>acipimox</b> is administered to prevent lipolysis, concurrent hypocaloric dieting and weight loss notwithstanding. Such findings appear to demonstrate high caloric loads in excess of storage rate capacities of fat cells lead to stress responses that induce an increase in leptin, which then operates as an adipose-derived inflammation stopgap signaling for the cessation of food intake so as to prevent adipose-derived inflammation from reaching elevated levels. This response may then protect against the harmful process of ectopic fat storage, which perhaps explains the connection between chronically elevated leptin levels and ectopic fat storage in obese individuals.|$|E

Plasma lipids, apolipoprotein AI, phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activity, pre-beta high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in incubated plasma and efflux of radiolabelled cholesterol from Fu 5 AH rat hepatoma cells to plasma were measured at each time point. Results <b>Acipimox</b> lowered plasma triglycerides in diabetic patients (P = 0. 001) and healthy subjects (P = 0. 002), whereas plasma non-esterified fatty acids were decreased in diabetic patients (P = 0. 001) compared with the averaged values at baseline and recovery. <b>Acipimox</b> decreased HDL cholesterol in healthy subjects (P = 0. 007) and plasma apolipoprotein AI in both groups (P = 0. 001 for diabetic patients; P = 0. 008 for healthy subjects).

In {{this study we}} assessed the lipolytic effect of GH in previously untreated patients and examined whether the negative effect of enhanced lipolysis on glucose metabolism could be counteracted by acute antilipolysis achieved with <b>acipimox.</b> Methods: Ten GH-deficient (GHD) adults participated in four experiments each, during which they received in a double-blind manner: placebo (A); GH (0. 88 ^ 0. 13 mg) (B); GH þ <b>acipimox</b> 250 mg b. i. d. (C); and <b>acipimox</b> b. i. d. (no GH) (D), where GH was given the night before a 2 h euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp combined with infusion of [3 - 3 H]glucose and indirect calorimetry. Results: GH increased basal free fatty acid (FFA) levels by 74 % (P 0. 0051) and insulin levels by 93 % (P 0. 0051). This resulted in a non-significant decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptakes (16. 61 ^ 8. 03 vs 12. 74 ^ 5. 50 mmol/kg per min (S. D.), P 0. 07 for A vs B).

40|$|Summary Increased use of glucose through {{glycolysis}} {{is characteristic}} for neoplastic growth while {{the significance of}} serum-free fatty acids for regulation of energy metabolism in cancer is poorly understood. We studied whether serum-free fatty acids (FFA) interfere with glycolytic metabolism of lymphoproliferative neoplasms as assessed with 2 -F 18 -fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose ([F 18]FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET). Twelve patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n = 9) or Hodgkin’s disease (n = 3) {{participated in this study}} before start of oncologic treatment. Each patient underwent two [F 18]FDG PET studies within 1 week after overnight fast: once during high fasting serum FFA concentrations and once after reduction of serum FFA by administration of <b>acipimox.</b> <b>Acipimox</b> is a nicotinic acid derivative that inhibits lipolysis in peripheral tissues and induces a striking reduction in circulating FFA concentration. In all cases, dynamic PET imaging over the tumour area was performed for 60 min after injection of [F 18]FDG. Both graphical analysis (rMR FDG) and single scan approach (SUV) were used to compare tumour uptake of [F 18]FDG under high fasting FFA concentrations and after pharmacologically decreased FFA concentrations. Serum FFA concentrations were reduced significantly from 0. 92 ± 0. 42 mmol l – 1 at baseline to 0. 26 ± 0. 31 mmol l – 1 after <b>acipimox</b> administration (P = 0. 0003).

40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} {{may result}} from decreased muscle blood flow, impaired cellular glucose transport, or intracellular deficits of glucose metabolism. The mechanisms responsible for dexamethasone-induced insulin resistance were investigated in healthy human subjects. During a 2 -h hyperinsulinemic clamp, dexamethasone decreased glucose uptake, oxidation, and nonoxidative glucose disposal during the first hour. During the second hour, glucose uptake was normalized by means of hyperglycemia; glucose oxidation, however, remained suppressed by dexamethasone. Dexamethasone also abolished the insulin-mediated increase in calf blood flow. When <b>acipimox</b> was administered during the clamps to correct glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of glucose oxidation, dexamethasone decreased whole body glucose uptake and nonoxidative glucose disposal in the same proportion as when no <b>acipimox</b> was administered. However, glucose oxidation and insulin-mediated calf blood flow were normalized after <b>acipimox.</b> During the second hour, exogenous glucose infusion was matched to that used in the control clamp and normalized whole body glucose uptake. However, hyperglycemia developed, indicating insulin resistance. It is concluded that dexamethasone 1) decreases glucose oxidation independently of glucose transport; this inhibition is reversed by acipimox; and 2) decreases whole body glucose uptake independently of increased lipolysis, decreased glucose oxidation, or an altered muscle blood flow.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that intrahepatic availability of fatty acid could modify the rate of suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP), <b>acipimox</b> or placebo was administered before and during a test meal. We used a modified isotopic methodology to measure EGP in 11 healthy subjects, and 1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopic measurement of hepatic triglyceride stores was also undertaken. <b>Acipimox</b> suppressed plasma free fatty acids markedly before the meal (0. 05 ± 0. 01 mmol/l at – 10 min, P = 0) and throughout the postprandial period (0. 03 ± 0. 01 mmol/l at 150 min). Mean peak plasma glucose was significantly lower after the meal on <b>acipimox</b> days (8. 9 ± 0. 4 vs. 10. 1 ± 0. 5 mmol/l, P < 0. 01), as was mean peak serum insulin (653. 1 ± 99. 9 vs. 909 ± 118 pmol/l, P < 0. 01). Fasting EGP was similar (11. 15 ± 0. 58 µmol·kg– 1 ·min– 1 placebo vs. 11. 17 ± 0. 89 mg·kg– 1 ·min– 1 <b>acipimox).</b> The rate of suppression of EGP after the meal was almost identical on the 2 test days (4. 36 ± 1. 52 vs. 3. 69 ± 1. 21 µmol·kg– 1 ·min– 1 at 40 min). There was a significant negative correlation between the acipimox-induced decrease in peak plasma glucose and liver triglyceride content (r = – 0. 827, P = 0. 002), suggesting that, when levels of liver fat were low, inhibition of lipolysis was able to affect glucose homeostasis.

The area under the curve (AUC) of the GH response after GHRP- 2 alone was 4. 8 times higher compared with GHRH alone (1834 +/- 255 vs. 382 +/- 78 mug/L 60 min, P < 0. 001). <b>Acipimox,</b> which reduced FFAs from 607 mol/L to 180 mu mol/L, increased the GH AUC to 1087 after GHRH and to 2956 mug/L. 60 min after GHRP- 2 (P < 0. 01). The AUC after acipimox/GHRP- 2 were positively correlated with the AUC after GHRP- 2 alone (r = 0. 93, P < 0. 01); this was also observed between acipimox/GHRR and GHRH alone (r = 0. 73, P = 0. 03). Significant negative correlations were observed between basal FFAs and AUC after GHRH or GHRP- 2 after combining the data with and without <b>acipimox</b> (r = 0. 58, P = 0. 01 and r = 0. 48, P = 0. 04, respectively), and between basal FFAs and GH at t = 0 (r = - 0. 44, P = 0. 001).
