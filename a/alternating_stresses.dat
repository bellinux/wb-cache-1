A method for predicting the reliability of components subjected to such loads is proposed, given their distributional <b>alternating</b> <b>stress</b> versus cycles-to-failure (S-N) diagram.

The high specific impulse requirements {{in conjunction with a}} 55 -mission lifetime, plus volume and weight constraints, produced unique structural design, manufacturing, and verification requirements. Operations from Earth to orbit produce severe dynamic environments, which couple with the extreme pressure and thermal environments associated with the high performance, creating large low cycle loads and high <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses</b> above endurance limit which result in high sensitivity to <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses.</b> Combining all of these effects resulted in the requirements for exotic materials, which are more susceptible to manufacturing problems, and the use of an all-welded structure. The challenge of integrating environments, dynamics, structures, and materials into a verified SSME structure is discussed. The verification program and developmental flight results are included. The first six shuttle flights had engine performance as predicted with no failures. The engine system has met the basic design challenges...|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to study the fatigue behavior of a SAE 1045 steel both uncoated and coated with a Colmonoy 88 alloy (NiCrBSiW) of approximately 410 μm thick, deposited by HVOF thermal spraying. Previously to deposition the samples were grit-blasted with alumina particles of approximately 1 mm in equivalent diameter. Tensile and fatigue tests were carried out with the uncoated and coated specimens. Fatigue tests were conducted under rotating bending conditions (R = − 1) at a frequency of 50 Hz. The samples tested were in three different surface conditions, including polished, grit-blasted and coated. The fatigue limit was determined {{by means of the}} staircase method employing a stress step of 5 MPa. The results indicate that the presence of the coating gives rise to a reduction in the fatigue life of the coated samples tested in air in comparison with the uncoated specimens. On the contrary, when the coated samples were tested in a NaCl solution at <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses</b> less than 350 MPa, these showed an increase in fatigue life in comparison with the polished uncoated samples. The analysis of the fracture surfaces of the specimens tested in air revealed that alumina particles present {{on the surface of the}} grit-blasted samples acted as stress concentrators, inducing the nucleation of fatigue cracks at the substrate–coating interface, which explains the reduction in fatigue life. However, under corrosive conditions and low <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses,</b> the presence of the coating provides an effective protection against corrosion-fatigue failures, giving rise to an improvement of the corrosion-fatigue performance of the coated system. On the contrary, at elevated <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses,</b> the coating was observed to delaminate from the substrate, leading to an impairment of the corrosion-fatigue behavior of the coated samples...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue life {{estimation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important design considerations in mechanical parts which are subjected to alternating loads. When loads act along several axes, multiaxial fatigue approach should be used to obtain more accurate results than uniaxial fatigue method. In this paper stress analysis of the steel shaft of a high speed microgenerator rotor with 47750 rpm and 100 kW is carried out using analytical stress formulation. Mean and alternative components of stresses have been distinguished. Because <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses</b> act on shaft, fatigue may occur and regarding to existence of alternating torsional and bending stresses in the same time, multiaxial fatigue analysis is essential. Also the range of <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses</b> is small compared to fatigue endurance limit. So the multiaxial fatigue criteria based on stress have been chosen. Then multiaxial fatigue damage and critical plane orientations of Findley and McDiarmid criteria have been identified using an analytical formulation in a MATLAB code. Finally, fatigue life of each critical point of shaft has been calculated using maximum damage in respective critical plane. In this way, effect of frequency difference between torsional and bending stresses has been considered...|$|E
40|$|Cavitation erosion {{under static}} applied <b>stress</b> and/or <b>alternating</b> <b>stress</b> was studied using steel {{specimens}} which {{were set in}} close proximity to an oscillating horn in ion-exchanged water. For increasing static applied tensile or compressive stress, weight loss and its rate do not vary in a monotonic fashion but first decrease, then increase through a peak, and then decrease again. Tensile stress except for given stress regimes, and compressive stress at all stress levels, decreases erosion damage compared with zero-stress values. Under <b>alternating</b> <b>stress,</b> the weight loss rate varies with trends similar to those under static applied stress. However, the weight loss rate is larger than for the same static stress, so that the erosion damage is more affected by <b>alternating</b> <b>stress</b> than by static stress. The behaviors under applied stress are discussed through the effect of stress on the erosion particles...|$|R

40|$|A {{previous}} {{study showed that}} microporous, compliant and (bio) degradable vascular prostheses prepared from a polyurethane/poly(-lactic acid) mixture can function as a temporary scaffold for the regeneration of small-calibre arteries. In this study the mechanism of fragmentation of vascular prostheses made of polyurethane, copolyesterether and blends of either polyurethane or copolyesterether with polymers differing in biodegradability, crystallinity and glass transition temperature is investigated. Animal studies revealed that after 6 wk of implantation only the prostheses made of blends containing a second polymer which was nonelastic at 37 °C were fragmented extensively, whether the second polymer was (bio) degradable or not. It is concluded that fragmentation of the prostheses is mainly caused by <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses</b> induced by the arterial pulsations and that (bio) degradation plays a minor role...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe present {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out in order to study the fatigue behavior of a SAE 1045 steel substrate coated with a WC– 10 Co– 4 Cr cermet, of approximately 200 μm thick, deposited by HVOF thermal spraying. Particular emphasis {{has been paid to the}} influence of the substrate roughness prior to HVOF deposition, as a mean of improving the mechanical bonding of the coating, on the fatigue life of the coated system. Fatigue tests were conducted under rotating bending conditions (R = − 1), employing samples with different surface roughness, including as-polished, fine-grinding with abrasive paper grit 400 and coated and grit blasted with alumina particles of two different sizes (< 1 and < 3 mm, respectively) and coated. For comparative purposes, tests were also carried out on as-grit blasted specimens employing alumina particles of 3 mm in size. Fatigue tests were carried out at maximum <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses</b> in the range of 358 – 588 MPa, depending on the condition of the material, in order that the number of cycles to fracture varied in the range of 105 to 106. Selected samples tested at different applied stresses were analyzed after fracture by SEM techniques, which allowed the determination of the crack nucleation and propagation sequence. The results indicate that the presence of the cermet coating gives rise to a delay in the initiation of fatigue cracks at deep notches and alumina particles embedded at the steel substrate after grit blasting, leading to an insignificant fatigue strength debit of the coated specimens, in comparison with the as-polished ones. Fine-grinding, on the other hand, impairs the mechanical bonding of the coating, giving rise to its delamination from the substrate at elevated maximum <b>alternating</b> <b>stresses...</b>|$|E
