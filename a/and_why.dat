5|$|In 1936, SR85 was established, {{but it only}} {{extended}} as {{far north}} as Gila Bend and as far south as Ajo. By 1938, SR85 had been paved as well as the portion between Ajo <b>and</b> <b>Why</b> that would eventually become part of SR85. The portion between Why and the border with Mexico began showing up on maps at this time as a gravel road. In 1943, the portion of the highway between Ajo <b>and</b> <b>Why</b> was added to the state highway system, but as SR86, when it was extended west from Tucson to Ajo. In 1955, the highway was extended to Lukeville at the United States-Mexico border with an overlap with SR86 between Ajo <b>and</b> <b>Why</b> when a county road was added to SR85.|$|E

5|$|Around 03:00, Hatanaka was {{informed}} by Lieutenant Colonel Masataka Ida that the Eastern District Army {{was on its}} way to the palace to stop him, and that he should give up.

5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed {{a model in}} which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only {{do so in a}} finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) <b>and</b> <b>why</b> elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.|$|E
