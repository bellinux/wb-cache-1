[...] Then he put his pen down and sat for a while {{thinking}} what should be his last paragraph. Should he put an end to all his doubts and straightway make his offer, or should he dally a little longer and still keep the power in his own hands? At last he said to himself that even if he wrote it his letter would not go till to-morrow morning, and he would have the night to think about it. This consideration got the better of his prudence and he did write it, simply beginning a new sentence on the page.

On the other hand, you have not a shadow of evidence to adduce against Gilliat's claim; there is simply her assertion against that of two or three other people, and if he sues you, as, of course, he will if you do not pay, it seems to me certain that a jury would give the verdict against you--unless, of course, we can put this other woman and Truscott into the dock. Should such a verdict be given, although some might have their doubts as to this extraordinary story, the public in general would conclude that Miss Hawtrey was a thief and a liar.

40|$|A new {{technique}} based on computer {{multivariate analysis of}} natural language applied to two corpuses of free associations about "eating", one from an analogic dictionnary, the other from a sample of 2000 French adults who answered <b>an</b> open <b>question</b> (<b>For</b> <b>you,</b> what is "eating well"?) Results show the various dimensions of the representation of "eating". The dictionnary corpus yields a nodal structure of the social representation that {{can be considered as}} commonsense knowledge modelling. Results, coherent with the sociological literature, also show affective connotations related to a primitive oral state as described by psychoanalysis. The human corpus yields representational scripts that are weighted within the population and show gender and age effects.

40|$|Regarding {{the second}} question, {{this is another}} key point. You are right, in the {{analysis}} of our data, three out of four female patients with recurrence had endometriosis, and in two of these, we were able to detect intraoperatively by inspection of the diaphragm the typical brown fenestration. These two patients underwent hormonal therapy. Unfortunately, just in one case we were able to show pathologically that this was a site of endometriosis. The other case was just necrotic tissue, probably because we were in the menstrual period of the patient. In conclusion, it’s very important to focus on a correct inspection of the dia-phragm before performing VATS surgery for pneumothorax in young women. Dr G. Cardillo (Rome, Italy) : I have <b>a</b> short <b>question</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> All of us know that the key point for recurrence prevention is the pleurodesis, not the bullect-omy. Recurrence rate showed 6 %. In my opinion that is too high, so try to re-consider the partial pleurectomy, which seems not enough for recurrence prevention in light of your 6 % recurrence rate. Can you comment on that...|$|R

Need a clue? How about if I added that it’s when we’re asked to talk about it in public that we become a little reticent? Well, Paul Foster is calling for us to stand up for what we believe in. His article ‘On animal research ’ (page 21) argues that, in addition to fulfilling our obligation to report back to the ultimate funders of our work, the scientific community needs to be more open about the use of animals in research if it’s to remain an option in the UK. Paul has canvassed the opinions of Society members on the need for greater transparency and how this could be achieved – one possibility might be participation in public events such as science festivals...|$|E
40|$|Dear Young Friends,... Just as we {{know the}} word AMERICA goes back to someone’s name, so we know our “American Language,” as Noah Webster called it, goes back to earlier sources. The most recent of these is of course British English. But we also go back to Old English (before 1066) and even to {{so-called}} primitive Germanic, as represented by a translation of the Lord’s Prayer from the original Greek into fourth century Gothic. As a snapshot of our linguistic past, this Gothic translation is quite short (10 lines). But since many students, including me, have over the years learned these 10 lines by heart, I feel a brief look at this early text may stimulate your curiosity, enough so to encourage memorization of, say, the first five lines (only 20 words). Our Gothic text {{will be followed by}} a word-by-word treatment that includes phonetic transcriptions of its Gothic pronunciation, its English translation, and some information about its linguistic history. Then we’ll finish with some encouraging words about textual memorization, along with raising <b>a</b> key <b>question</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> and your friends to ponder, namely, is Gothic truly a “primitive language”...|$|R

These blood-men,' quoth they, 'border upon our country; but, poor men! as we hear, they were every one taken by Emmanuel's forces.' 'Ten thousand!' quoth the old gentleman; 'I will promise you, that is a round company. But how came it to pass, since you were so mighty a number, that you fainted, and durst not fight your foes?' 'Our general,' said they, 'was the first man that did run for it.' 'Pray,' quoth their landlord, 'who was that, your cowardly general?' 'He was once the Lord Mayor of Mansoul,' said they: 'but pray call him not a cowardly general; for whether any from the east to the west has done more service for our prince Diabolus, than has my Lord Incredulity, will be <b>a</b> hard <b>question</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to answer.

Then said the old gentleman, 'I would that all the ten thousand doubters were now well armed in Mansoul, and myself at the head of them; I would see what I could do.' 'Ay,' said they, 'that would be well if we could see that; but wishes, alas! what are they?' and these words were spoken aloud. 'Well,' said old Evil-Questioning, 'take heed that you talk not too loud; you must be quat and close, and must take care of yourselves while you are here, or, I will assure you, you will be snapped.' 'Why?' quoth the doubters. 'Why!' quoth the old gentleman; 'why! because both the Prince and Lord Secretary, and their captains and soldiers, are all at present in town; yea, the town is as full of them as ever it can hold. And besides, there is one whose name is Willbewill, a most cruel enemy of ours, and him the Prince has made keeper of the gates, and has commanded him that, with all the diligence he can, he should look for, search out, and destroy all, and all manner of Diabolonians.

I bet these guy’s were using taxpayer money to buy those M&M’s! Boy, that’s right up there with that tequila fish study!” “Hold on a minute Diane. It also says here that this study has implications for materials science and other important things. ” “I’ll bet. ” said Diane. “Well anyway ” muttered Jack, “I think it’s kind of neat. Actually, look at this, it says here that they not only used real M&M’s, but also did computer simulations of M&M packing. ” “Huh, I wonder how they did that. ” said Diane, “I remember reading that Shrek used a lot of computer graphics and a lot of math. I wonder if that’s related. ” “Could be. ” said Jack, “In my Calc class we’ve been drawing these neat pictures with this thing called Maple. I’ll bet I could use that to draw an M&M. ” “Yea, that’s neat. ” replied Diane, “But, I bet they had to do more than that. I mean, how did they get the size right? How would you make your picture the same as a real M&M?” “Good question. They give some other references here [2, 3], I bet I could use the information in these articles to make my picture accurate. ” “Maybe. ” said Diane, “But I think you’d still need to measure a real M&M. But, if you got it right, that would be cool! You could figure out the volume of an M&M and then use that info to figure out how many M&M’s this jar could hold. ” “Hey, then we could win one of those bean-guessing contests! ” said Jack. “There’s <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> I wonder if jelly-beans pack better?” “Or Reese’s Pieces. ” said Diane. “Aren’t they the same shape as M&M’s? ” asked Jack. “Oh yeah. ” replied Diane. “Here’s another crazy idea.

[...] They stood in the centre of the immense room, and Maggie could feel that the scene of life her imagination had made of it twenty minutes before was by this time sufficiently peopled. These few straight words filled it to its uttermost reaches, and nothing was now absent from her consciousness, either, of the part she was called upon to play in it. Charlotte had marched straight in, dragging her rich train; she rose there beautiful and free, with her whole aspect and action attuned to the firmness of her speech. Maggie had kept the shawl she had taken out with her, and, clutching it tight in her nervousness, drew it round her as if huddling in it for shelter, covering herself with it for humility. She looked out as from under an improvised hood--the sole headgear of some poor woman at somebody's proud door; she waited even like the poor woman; she met her friend's eyes with recognitions she couldn't suppress. She might sound it as she could--"What question then?"--everything in her, from head to foot, crowded it upon Charlotte that she knew. She knew too well--that she was showing; so that successful vagueness, to save some scrap of her dignity from the imminence of her defeat, was already a lost cause, and the one thing left was if possible, at any cost, even that of stupid inconsequence, to try to look as if she weren't afraid. If she could but appear at all not afraid she might appear a little not ashamed--that is not ashamed to be afraid, which was the kind of shame that could be fastened on her, it being fear all the while that moved her. Her challenge, at any rate, her wonder, her terror--the blank, blurred surface, whatever it was that she presented became a mixture that ceased to signify; for to the accumulated advantage by which Charlotte was at present sustained her next words themselves had little to add.|$|R
