5|$|Behind {{the granite}} barrier the {{corridor}} branches eastward to a T-shaped magazine chamber which probably contained Userkaf's funerary equipment. The presence {{of such a}} magazine chamber, located under the base of <b>a</b> <b>pyramid,</b> is unique of all the 5th and 6th dynasty pyramids.|$|E
5|$|Plaza 8 is an {{enclosed}} plaza {{to the southwest}} of the ballcourt. Structure 2, <b>a</b> <b>pyramid,</b> closes the northwest side and Structure 3 closes the southeast side.|$|E
5|$|Structure 1 (also {{known as}} Temple 1) is <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> temple facing onto Plaza B. It {{is the only}} temple at Iximche to have been {{completely}} restored.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> right <b>pyramid</b> has its apex {{directly}} above the centroid of its base. Nonright pyramids are called oblique <b>pyramids.</b> <b>A</b> regular <b>pyramid</b> has <b>a</b> regular polygon base {{and is usually}} implied to be <b>a</b> right <b>pyramid.</b>|$|R
50|$|In architecture, <b>an</b> {{inverted}} <b>pyramid</b> is <b>a</b> {{structure in}} the shape of <b>an</b> upside-down <b>pyramid.</b>|$|R
50|$|The complex {{includes}} the main <b>pyramid,</b> <b>a</b> satellite <b>pyramid</b> and <b>an</b> associated <b>pyramid</b> {{which is probably}} that of his unnamed consort, and is hence known as The Pyramid of the Unknown Queen.|$|R
5|$|Structure 2 is <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> on the {{northwest}} side of the sunken Plaza 8. It is largely unrestored. Structure 3 lies across the plaza to the southeast. It is a platform with a twin stairway facing northwest onto the plaza.|$|E
5|$|Structure 34 is <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> in the North Acropolis {{that was}} built by Siyaj Chan K'awiil II over the tomb of his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin I. The pyramid was topped by a three {{chambered}} shrine, the rooms situated one behind the other.|$|E
5|$|Carbon was {{discovered}} in prehistory and was known in the forms of soot and charcoal to the earliest human civilizations. Diamonds were known probably as early as 2500BCE in China, while carbon {{in the form of}} charcoal was made around Roman times by the same chemistry as it is today, by heating wood in <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> covered with clay to exclude air.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> 4-dimensional <b>pyramid</b> {{is called}} <b>a</b> {{polyhedral}} <b>pyramid,</b> constructed by <b>a</b> polyhedron in a 3-space hyperplane of 4-space with another point off that hyperplane.|$|R

50|$|The complex {{consists}} of the main <b>pyramid,</b> <b>a</b> Ka <b>pyramid,</b> three queen's <b>pyramids,</b> <b>a</b> valley temple and a mortuary temple, linked by a four hundred metre long covered causeway, running through the desert from the Nile to the pyramid.|$|R
5|$|Menkauhor Kaiu built <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> in North-Saqqara, thereby {{abandoning the}} royal {{necropolis}} of Abusir, where kings of the Fifth Dynasty {{had been buried}} since the reign of Sahure, some 80 years earlier. The reason for this choice {{may be that the}} Abusir plateau had become overcrowded by the beginning of Menkauhor's reign.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 2004, Liberty Property Trust {{signed a}} 15½-year lease with Comcast and a {{construction}} contract with L.F. Driscoll Co. Liberty Property Trust also unveiled another redesign {{of the building}} and its new name, the Comcast Center. The now , 58-story Comcast Center would no longer have <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> top and would have a complete glass facade. The architectural model was created by Richard Tenguerian.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} using a single, diagonally mounted four-way joystick. The player {{controls}} Q*bert, who starts each game {{at the top of}} <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> made of 28 cubes, and moves by hopping diagonally from cube to cube. Landing on a cube causes it to change color, and changing every cube to the target color allows the player to progress to the next stage.|$|E
2500|$|The Shimizu Mega-City <b>Pyramid,</b> <b>a</b> [...] {{proposed}} {{project for}} construction of <b>a</b> massive <b>pyramid</b> over Tokyo Bay in Japan.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{rectangular}} right <b>pyramid,</b> {{written as}} ( [...] )∨}×{ }, and <b>a</b> rhombic <b>pyramid,</b> as ( [...] )∨}+{ }, both have symmetry C2v.|$|R
50|$|The square-pyramidal pyramid can be {{distorted}} into <b>a</b> rectangular-pyramidal <b>pyramid,</b> { } ∨ } × { } or <b>a</b> rhombic-pyramidal <b>pyramid,</b> { } ∨ } + { }, {{or other}} lower symmetry forms.|$|R
5|$|Unas had <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> {{built for}} himself in North Saqqara, between the pyramid of Sekhemkhet and the southwestern corner of the pyramid complex of Djoser, in {{symmetry}} with the pyramid of Userkaf located at the northeastern corner. In the process, workers leveled and covered older tombs located in the area, most notably {{the tomb of the}} Second Dynasty pharaoh Hotepsekhemwy (c. 2890 BC).|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} work {{had already begun}} on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it {{differed}} in form and in its beam steering system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, a {{satellite}} detects a mysterious heat bloom beneath Bouvetøya, an island about one thousand {{miles off the}} coast of Antarctica. Wealthy industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) discovers through thermal imaging that there is <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> buried 2000 feet beneath the ice. He attempts to claim it for his multinational communications company, Weyland Industries, a subsidiary of the Weyland Corporation, and assembles a team of experts to investigate. The team includes archaeologists, linguistic experts, drillers, mercenaries, and a guide named Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan).|$|E
5000|$|In geometry, <b>a</b> {{hexagonal}} <b>pyramid</b> is <b>a</b> [...] <b>pyramid</b> with <b>a</b> hexagonal base {{upon which}} are erected six triangular faces that {{meet at a}} point (the apex). Like any pyramid, it is self-dual.|$|R
25|$|The Summum <b>Pyramid,</b> <b>a</b> 3-story <b>pyramid</b> in Salt Lake City, {{used for}} {{instruction}} in the Summum philosophy and conducting rites associated with Modern Mummification.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> transdeletion <b>pyramid</b> (also called <b>a</b> transaddition <b>pyramid</b> or word pyramid when inverted) is a logological {{term for}} the {{triangular}} representation of a list of words in which each one is a scrambled form of the above word without one letter.|$|R
5|$|Janmashtami is {{the main}} festival that is celebrated during August and September with great fervor and piety {{as it was in}} the prehistoric times the abode of Krishna. The festival is marked by several night long {{celebrations}} to mark the birth of Krishna. Bhajans and sermons are part of the festivities. At midnight there is reenactment of Krishna's childhood in the form of Garba and Raas dances. On this occasion, the local boys create <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> and a young boy in the costume of Krishna climbs up this pyramid to strike a pot holding butter, an act which Krishna had mischievously performed with the gopis.|$|E
5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield Elementary {{students}} are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build <b>a</b> <b>pyramid.</b> Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in <b>a</b> <b>Pyramid</b> prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if {{it is going to be}} smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, one the Cochinos 4,000-pound {{batteries}} caught fire, emitting {{hydrogen gas}} and smoke. Unable to receive {{any help from}} the Tusk, Commander Benitez directed the firefighting. He ordered the Cochino to surface and had the crew members lash themselves to the deck rails with ropes while others fought the blaze. Benitez tried to save his ship {{and at the same}} time save his men from the toxic gases. He realized that the winds were about to tear the ropes and ordered his men to form <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> on the ship's open bridge, which was designed to hold seven men.|$|E
50|$|The tetrakis {{hexahedron}} is the Kleetope of the cube, {{formed by}} adding <b>a</b> square <b>pyramid</b> {{to each of}} its faces, and the pentakis dodecahedron is the Kleetope of the dodecahedron, formed by adding <b>a</b> pentagonal <b>pyramid</b> to each face of the dodecahedron.|$|R
50|$|An {{icosahedron}} {{can also}} be called a gyroelongated pentagonal bipyramid. It can be decomposed into <b>a</b> gyroelongated pentagonal <b>pyramid</b> and <b>a</b> pentagonal <b>pyramid</b> or into <b>a</b> pentagonal antiprism and two equal pentagonal pyramids.|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> wartime <b>pyramid</b> was {{constructed}} by Italian engineers {{at the site}} of Marseille's fall but over time it decayed. On 22 October 1989, Eduard Neumann and other JG 27 survivors in co-operation with the Egyptian government, erected <b>a</b> new <b>pyramid</b> that stands there to this day.|$|R
5|$|The E-Group {{consists}} {{of a number of}} structures around a small plaza. These include <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> at the west side, a long structure on the east side supporting an upper platform and two smaller structures on the north and south sides. The E-Group was first built in the Late Preclassic Period, it was lightly occupied during the Early Classic and was then expanded with the addition of two structures in the Late Classic. By this time major activity at El Chal had been transferred to the area around the acropolis, leaving the once central E-Group on the periphery.|$|E
5|$|The cold opening {{features}} Michael {{trying to}} get {{various members of the}} office involved in <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> scheme, which is a non-sustainable business model that involves promising participants payment or services, primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme, rather than supplying any real investment or sale of products or services to the public. The scheme is generally considered one of various internet scams. Michael later reveals having also fallen for a Nigerian 419 scam.|$|E
5|$|The {{premise of}} the episode was based on three major ideas: <b>a</b> <b>pyramid</b> scheme {{involving}} body parts, a lottery in a small town, and the corporate beings assembling the destitute in Chinatown. The episode's writer, Vlaming, developed the latter two ideas and series creator Chris Carter merged all three ideas in the finalized script. The episode contained several elaborate special effects shots, most notably the scene wherein a frog bursts out of a victim's chest, which was created by using molds to create a fake human torso that was then placed over an actor.|$|E
50|$|A {{latitude-longitude}} rectangle {{should not}} be confused with the solid angle of <b>a</b> rectangular <b>pyramid.</b> All four sides of <b>a</b> rectangular <b>pyramid</b> intersect the sphere's surface in great circle arcs. With a latitude-longitude rectangle, only lines of longitude are great circle arcs; lines of latitude are not.|$|R
50|$|The gyroelongated square <b>pyramid</b> is <b>a</b> Johnson solid (specifically, J10) {{constructed}} by augmenting one <b>a</b> square <b>pyramid.</b> Similarly, the gyroelongated square bipyramid (J17) is a deltahedron (a polyhedron whose faces are all equilateral triangles) {{constructed by}} replacing both squares of a square antiprism with <b>a</b> square <b>pyramid.</b>|$|R
