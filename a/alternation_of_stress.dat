5000|$|English meter {{is said to}} be stress timed: {{the regular}} <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stressed</b> and {{unstressed}} syllables produces an [...] "accentual rhythm." [...] Classical Greek meter {{is said to be}} mora timed: the <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> long and short syllables produces a [...] "quantitative rhythm." [...] Classical Latin meter obeyed rules of syllable length, like the Greek, even though Latin has a strong word accent like English. Modern scholars have had differing opinions about how these different influences affect the way Latin verse was sounded out. Accentual rhythm in Latin has been observed in pre-classical verse (in Saturnian meter) and in some medieval verse, but otherwise the rhythm of Latin verse appears ambivalent and complex.|$|R
5000|$|In {{unstressed}} syllables {{length is}} not contrastive, {{and there are}} only five vowel qualities, to wit [...] Word stress is not fixed to a certain position of a root; this leads to <b>alternations</b> <b>of</b> <b>stressed</b> mid vowels with unstressed high vowels.

Two detailed corpus studies are used to reveal the set of parameters underlying the variation between "worse" and "worser", which include system congruity, semantics, and standardization effects. However, the focus here is on the tendency to maintain an <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stressed</b> and unstressed syllables, known as the Principle <b>of</b> Rhythmic <b>Alternation.</b> This prosodic principle (which has been argued to be particularly influential in English) turns out to be responsible for most of the results obtained in the analysis of the corpus data...|$|R

The effects of pulsating tensile loadings {{as well as of}} alternating tensilecompressive loadings were studiep. The results of the constant-amplitude tests have been presented in S-N diagrams and a Goodman diagram. From these results it emerged that fatigue life was strongly reduced by <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stress</b> from tension to compression. Furthermore the number of cycles to failure for wet specimens was lower than for dry ones. It was also found that for equal load signals applied, flexural tests resulted in longer fatigue lifes than concentric tests, probably because of the possibility <b>of</b> redistribution <b>of</b> <b>stresses.</b> The longitudinal strains of the concentric tests were analysed. This resulted in a strong relation between strain rate and fatigue life. The concentric tests were continued with program-loading tests in order to check Miner's rule. Based on strain rate Miner's rule could be verified and Miner's number, M = 1, at failure turned out to be safe in general. Stevin LaboratoryCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{emergence}} of the so called online social fitness open up new scenarios for fascinating challenges {{in the field of}} data science. Through these platforms, users can collect, monitor and share with friends their sport performance, with interesting details about heartrate, watt consumption and calories burned. The availability of this data, collected among a large number of users, gives us the possibility to explore new data mining applications. In the current work, we present the results of a study conducted on a sample of 29, 284 cyclists downloaded via APIs from the social fitness platform Strava. com. We defined two basic metrics: a measure of training effort, that is how much a cyclist struggled during the workout; and a measure of training performance indicating the results achieved during the training. Although the average effort is weakly correlated with the average performance, by deeply investigating workouts time evolution and cyclists 2 ̆ 7 training characteristics interesting findings came out. We found that athletes that better improve their performance follow precise training patterns usually referred as overcompensation theory, with <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> peaks and rest periods.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on Second Language Acquisition through blended {{learning}} and explores the application of new educational technologies {{in the development of}} distance education. In particular, the paper focuses on ways to enhance oral, aural, and intercultural skills through learners’ engagement, develop authentic social interaction and intercultural awareness in virtual environments {{and at the same time}} actively engage the students’ powers of perception, communication and reasoning. A speech visualization technology is introduced, specifically tailored to pronunciation training. It provides relevant and comprehensible visual feedback of all three components of speech: prosody-intonation, stress and rhythm. In this paper we stress that the achievement of successful communication should be the main objective of a second language learner, whilst overcoming the foreign accent can be deemed as a secondary goal. A strong or incorrect placement of word stress may impair understanding – from the listener’s point of view – of the word(s) being pronounced. On the other hand, acquiring correct timing of phonological units helps to overcome the impression of foreign accent, which may ensue from an incorrect distribution of stressed vs. unstressed stretches of linguistic units such as syllables or metric feet. For these reasons our study looks at how to improve a student’s performance both in perception and production of spoken Italian prosodic features, which include the correct position of stress at word level, the <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and unstressed syllables, the correct position of sentence accent, the generation of the adequate rhythm from the interleaving of stress, accent, phonological rules, and the generation of adequate intonation patterns for each utterance related to communicative functions...|$|E
40|$|DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOBILE ACCENT PARADIGM IN LITHUANIAN POLYSYLLABIC NOMINALS Summary The {{traditional}} mobile accent paradigm, {{alternating stress}} between {{the last and}} the initial syllables in polysyllabic words, has developed into two types of neomobility in certain classes of appellatives and nomina propria in Lithuanian. Different character of stress alternation is a distinctive feature of the two neomobile accent types. The first type of neomobility {{is characterized by the}} <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> between the last and the penultimate syllables of polysyllabic words, while the second type of neomobility is typical of tetrasyllabic nominals alternating stress between the last and the antepenultimate syllables. The first type of neomobility‚ which seems to have originated directly from Saussure’s Law, has spread (a) to adjectives (almost exclusively u -stem ones), (b) to some numerals, (c) to toponyms, and (d) to forms of the so-called collective plural, mostly derived from anthroponyms. The majority (4 / 5) of toponyms in question belongs to the class of pluralia tantum in -(i) ónys (accent paradigm 3) and -(i) aĩ (accent paradigm 4), while rare cases of singularia tantum toponyms end in -(i) a. The 3 rd accent paradigm of polysyllabic toponyms could be interpreted in many cases as a relic, reflecting changes in the accentuation of derivatives triggered by Saussure’s Law. Meanwhile, the 4 th accent paradigm seems to be inherited from the so-called collective plural (pluralia tantum toponyms) or to have arisen because of the replacement of acute under circumflex metatony, influence of palatal consonants, etc. (singularia tantum toponyms). The second type of accentual neomobility seems to be later than the first one. It has spread mostly to tetrasyllabic compounds with the composition vowel -a- or disyllabic first member. It seems to have originated from the tendency of shifting stress from the initial to the adjacent syllable, which represents either the composition vowel -a- or the syllable preceding the zero juncture of a fixed stress compound. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in metrical theory {{have opened the}} possibility of applying the resulting insights to {{the reconstruction of the}} Proto-Indo-European (PIE) accentual system and its development in the individual Indo-European (IE) languages. After introducing the principles of the “brackets-and-edges” framework of Idsardi (1992) and Halle and Idsardi (1995), the accentual categories of the PIE noun and verb are examined and analyzed in terms of underlying accent of roots, suffixes, and endings. As Halle (1997) has proposed, the parameter settings for determining surface stress in PIE are the same as those of IE languages such as Russian: stress falls on the first accented syllable head of the (phonological) word; if the word contains no accented morphemes, it receives default initial <b>stress.</b> The properties <b>of</b> the archaic ablaut- and stress-alternating paradigms, as well as of thematic nouns and verbs, may thus be represented as the realization of different combinations of accentual specifications: acrostatic roots, for instance, are accented and surface with constant root-stress, whereas in amphikinetic paradigms the root and suffix are unaccented, with default initial stress if the ending is unaccented and ending-stress if the ending is accented. ^ The main outlines of this system, which is largely reconstructed on the basis of Sanskrit, have been preserved in ancient Greek: despite numerous innovations, both the parameter settings and the accentuation of particular morphemes survive in the noun and the non-finite forms of the verb. In the Balto-Slavic languages, the complex <b>alternations</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> intonation, and length may be derived without serious difficulty from PIE. In place <b>of</b> a rightward <b>stress</b> shift from a non-acute syllable, Proto-Balto-Slavic has undergone stress retraction to acute syllables; this hypothesis accounts for a number of previously unexplained peculiarities. The accentuation of the Balto-Slavic nominal case endings continues the inherited PIE distinction between “strong” (unaccented) and “weak” (accented) endings in the non-thematic stem classes, which has spread to the thematic stems independently in the two branches. Finally, the stress alternations in the simple thematic present receive a plausible historical explanation and shed new light on the accentuation of this category in (post-) PIE; the relationship among present and aorist formations and accentual paradigms in Slavic is revealed to be the direct continuation of a classical IE pattern. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{examine the}} effect of {{elasticity}} on dynamic response of imperfect structures, by densely setting meshes {{in the vicinity of the}} imperfections, pre-cracked beams impinged by a striker are modeled and numerically investigated.

The high stress and large deformation zones, corresponding to the plastic hinges in the rigid-plastic model, appear at the impinging position and the supporting ends, and the locations coincide with those in the modal pattern in rigid-plastic response. It is concluded from comparison that when the impinging is intense, despite the effect of elasticity displaying in the early stage, the widely employed rigid-plastic analysis is still capable of providing favorable prediction on the final response parameters...|$|R

40|$|The {{teaching}} of the pronunciation of any foreign language must encompass both segmental and suprasegmental aspects of speech. In computational terms, the two levels of language learning activities can be decomposed at least into phonemic aspects, which include the correct pronunciation of single phonemes and the co-articulation of phonemes into higher phonological units; as well as prosodic aspects which include  the correct position of stress at word level;  the <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and unstressed syllables in terms of compensation and vowel reduction;  the correct position of sentence accent;  the generation of the adequate rhymth from the interleaving of stress, accent, and phonological rules;  the generation of adequate intonational pattern for each utterance related to communicative functions; As appears from above, for a student to communicate intelligibly and {{as close as possible}} to native-speaker's pronunciation, prosody is very important [3]. We also assume that an incorrect prosody may hamper communication from taking place and this may be regarded a strong motivation for having the {{teaching of}} Prosody as an integral part of any language course. From our point of view it is much more important to stress the achievement of successful communication as the main objective of a second language learner rather than the overcoming of what has been termed “foreign accent”, which can be deemed as a secondary goal. In any case, the two goals are certainly not coincident even though they may be overlapping in some cases. We will discuss about these matter in the following sections. All prosodic questions related to “rhythm” will be discussed in the first section of this chapter. In [4] the author argues in favour of prosodic aids, in particular because a strong placement of word stress may impair understanding from the listener’s point of view of the word being pronounced. He also argues in favour of acquiring correct timing of phonological units to overcome the impression of “foreign accent” which may ensue from an incorrect distribution of stressed vs. unstressed stretches of linguistic units such as syllables or metric feet. Timing is not to be confused with speaking rate which need not be increased forcefully to give the impression of a good fluency: trying to increase speaking rate may result in lower intelligibility. The question of “foreign accent” is also discussed at length in (Jilka M., 1999). This work is particularly relevant as far as intonational features of a learner of a second language which we will address in the second section of this chapter. Correcting the Intonational Foreign Accent (hence IFA) is an important component of a Prosodic Module for self-learning activities, as categorical aspects of the intonation of the two languages in contact, L 1 and L 2 are far apart and thus neatly distinguishable. Choice of the two languages in contact is determined mainly by the fact that the distance in prosodic terms between English and Italian is maximal, according to (Ramus, F. and J. Mehler, 1999; Ramus F., et al., 1999) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Genetic prion {{diseases}} {{are linked to}} point and inserted mutations in the prion protein (PrP) gene that are presumed to favor conversion of the cellular isoform of PrP (PrP C) to the pathogenic one (PrP Sc). The pathogenic mechanisms and the subcellular sites of the conversion are not completely understood. Here we introduce several PRNP gene mutations (such as, PrP-KDEL, PrP- 3 AV, PrP-A 117 V, PrP-G 114 V, PrP-P 102 L and PrP-E 200 K) into the cultured cells in order to explore the pathogenic mechanism of familial prion disease. Methodology/Principal Findings: To address the roles of aberrant retention of PrP in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the recombinant plasmids expressing full-length human PrP tailed with an ER signal peptide at the COOH-terminal (PrP-KDEL) and PrP with three amino acids exchange in transmembrane region (PrP- 3 AV) were constructed. In the preparations of transient transfections, 18 -kD COOH-terminal proteolytic resistant fragments (Ctm-PrP) were detected in the cells expressing PrP-KDEL and PrP- 3 AV. Analyses of the cell viabilities in the presences of tunicamycin and brefeldin A revealed that expressions of PrP-KDEL and PrP- 3 AV sensitized the transfected cells to ER stress stimuli. Western blots and RT-PCR identified the clear <b>alternations</b> <b>of</b> ER <b>stress</b> associated events in the cells expressing PrP-KDEL and PrP- 3 AV that induced ER mediated apoptosis by CHOP and capase- 12 apoptosis pathway. Moreover, several familial CJD related PrP mutants were transiently introduced into the cultured cells. Only the mutants within the transmembrane region (G 114 V and A 117 V...|$|R
