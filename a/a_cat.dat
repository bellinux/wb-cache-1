5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop. <b>A</b> <b>cat</b> bite {{differs from}} the bites of other pets. This is because the teeth of <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps {{microorganisms}} that cause infection.|$|E

5|$|Woo {{draws on}} animal {{symbolism}} throughout the film. He filled {{the church with}} doves and pigeons, employing doves to represent {{the spirits of the}} people. This was the first film where Woo used the dove symbolism and he has used it to similar effect in Hard Target and Face/Off. <b>A</b> <b>cat</b> appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li's partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie's apartment. In Chinese culture, <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> coming into a home is an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film.|$|E
5|$|A few {{attempts}} to build <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> census {{have been made}} over the years, both through associations or national and international organizations (such as the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies's one) and over the net, but such a task does not seem simple to achieve.

5|$|In March 1940, {{two months}} before the start of World War II in Belgium, Bob, his second child, was born. When the first tribulations of the war were over, Vandersteen could restart his work at L'Innovation. From November 1940 until August 1942, he created his first {{published}} comic, Kitty Inno, for the company, consisting of short, simple gags. When the German occupier forbade the publication of American and British comics in the Belgian newspapers and magazines, opportunies arose for local people. On 19 March 1941, the first comic strip of Tor de holbewoner (Tor the troglodyte) appeared in the newspaper De Dag. It continued until January 1942. Already on 26 March 1941 it was joined by De lollige avonturen van Pudifar (The funny adventures of Pudifar), a weekly comic strip about <b>a</b> <b>cat.</b> This was in May of the same year replaced by Barabitje, another comic about <b>a</b> <b>cat,</b> which ended in October 1941.|$|E

5|$|Spaying or neutering {{increases}} life expectancy: {{one study}} found neutered male cats live {{twice as long as}} intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females.
