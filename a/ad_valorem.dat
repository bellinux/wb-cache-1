5|$|In 1821, after {{tensions}} between the NWC and HBC had erupted into violence the NWC was forced to merge into the HBC. As a result, the HBC acquired the Columbia District and its trade with China. At first the system of shipping furs via the American Perkins and Company was continued, but in 1822 the United States Customs Service imposed a heavy <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> duty on the proceeds. The HBC stopped using American middlemen and instead tried selling furs through the EIC. In 1824 and 1825 the HBC sold 20,000 beaver and 7,000 land-otter skins in China through the EIC, but the arrangement did not prove advantageous for either firm.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005, South Dakota has {{the lowest}} per capita total state tax rate in the United States. The state does not levy {{personal}} or corporate income taxes, inheritance taxes, or taxes on intangible personal property. The state sales tax rate is 4.5 percent. Various localities have local levies so in some areas the rate is 6 percent. The state sales tax {{does not apply to}} sales to Indians on Indian reservations, but many reservations have a compact with the state. Businesses on the reservation collect the tax and the state refunds to the Indian Tribes the percentage of sales tax collections relating to the ratio of Indian population to total population in the county or area affected. <b>Ad</b> <b>valorem</b> property taxes are local taxes and are a large source of funding for school systems, counties, municipalities and other local government units.

25|$|An <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax is {{one where}} the tax base {{is the value of}} a good, service, or {{property}}. Sales taxes, tariffs, property taxes, inheritance taxes, and value added taxes are different types of <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax. An <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax is typically imposed at the time of a transaction (sales tax or value added tax (VAT)) but it may be imposed on an annual basis (property tax) or in connection with another significant event (inheritance tax or tariffs).|$|E

25|$|A land/location value tax (LVT), {{also called}} a site {{valuation}} tax, split rate tax, or site-value rating, is an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> levy on the unimproved value of land. Unlike property taxes, it disregards {{the value of}} buildings, personal property and other improvements to real estate. Land value taxes are generally favored by economists as (unlike other taxes) it does not cause economic inefficiency, and it tends to reduce inequality.|$|E
25|$|A {{property}} tax (or millage tax) is an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax levy {{on the value}} of property that the owner of the property is required to pay to a government in which the property is situated. Multiple jurisdictions may tax the same property. There are three general varieties of property: land, improvements to land (immovable man-made things, e.g. buildings) and personal property (movable things). Real estate or realty is the combination of land and improvements to land.|$|E
25|$|Tatangelo {{was also}} {{committed}} to cutting county spending and lowering property tax rates, issues that attracted Republican support. Homeowners, however, {{found that even}} when the county cut the <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax rates, their property taxes continued to climb because the Webb County Appraisal District in Laredo routinely increases the valuation of their properties on an annual basis. The district points out that state law requires the higher evaluations each year. Then {{it is up to}} the taxing bodies to set the actual tax rates per $100 assessed value.|$|E
25|$|In {{its first}} year of operation, the Morrill Tariff {{increased}} the effective rate collected on dutiable imports by approximately 70%. In 1860 American tariff rates were among {{the lowest in the}} world and also at historical lows by 19thcentury standards, the average rate for 1857 through 1860 being around 17% overall (<b>ad</b> <b>valorem),</b> or 21% on dutiable items only. The Morrill Tariff immediately raised these averages to about 26% overall or 36% on dutiable items, and further increases by 1865 left the comparable rates at 38% and 48%. Although higher than in the immediate antebellum period, these rates were still significantly lower than between 1825 and 1830, when rates had sometimes been over 50%.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{researchers}} (David Rodda, Jacob Vigdor, and Janna Matlack), argue that a shortage of affordable housing – {{at least in the}} US – is caused in part by income inequality. David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased (Rhoda 1994:148). Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.|$|E
25|$|Jennings {{was elected}} to the {{assembly}} again in 1880 as member for the Bogan and from January to July 1883 was vice-president of the executive council in the Stuart ministry. He was Colonial Secretary from October to December 1885 in the Dibbs ministry, and in February 1886 became the first practising Catholic Premier and was also Treasurer. His administration lasted only 11 months and had a troubled career, having inherited a financial crisis. His attempts to balance the budget included a 5 per cent <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tariff, which came {{to be seen as a}} violation of his free-trade platform. Jennings was scarcely a strong enough man to control a ministry which included Dibbs, Want and Lyne.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco was {{designated}} the official {{port of entry}} for all California ports where U.S. customs (also called tariffs and <b>Ad</b> <b>valorem</b> taxes) (averaging about 25%) were collected by the Collector of Customs from all ships bearing foreign goods. The first Collector of customs was Edward H. Harrison, appointed by General Kearny. Shipping boomed from the average of about 25 vessels from 1825 to 1847 to about 793 ships in 1849 and 803 ships in 1850. All ships were inspected for what goods they carried. Passengers disembarking in San Francisco {{had one of the}} easier accesses to the gold country since they could take another ship from there to get to Sacramento and several other towns.|$|E

The sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer in the parish and has both criminal and civil jurisdiction. The sheriff is in charge of all criminal investigations and is responsible for executing court orders and process. The sheriff is the collector of <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> taxes and other taxes and license fees as provided by law and is the keeper of the public jail in the parish.

25|$|The coffee {{companies}} of Houston formed the Greater Houston Coffee Association in fall 2000. The industry {{then tried to}} make Houston a major coffee shipping port. Coffee sold through futures contracts may only be shipped to a New York Board of Trade-certified port, and Texas's <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax on warehouse inventories {{made it impossible for}} Houston to get such a certification. The tax was written into the Constitution of Texas, so the Greater Houston Coffee Association asked State Representative Joe E. Moreno and State Senator Mario Gallegos to present a constitutional amendment bill to exempt cocoa and coffee stored in Harris County warehouses from the tax. Voters approved the amendment in 2001. Since then Houston's role as a coffee port increased. After Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, much of the traffic switched to Houston.|$|E
25|$|The {{property}} may be reassessed {{under certain}} conditions other than a change of ownership, such as when additions or new construction occur. The assessed value is also subject to reduction if {{the market value of}} the property declines below its assessed value, for example, during a real estate slump. Reductions of property valuation were not provided for by Proposition 13 itself, but were made possible by the passage of Proposition 8 (SCA No. 67) during 1978 that amended Proposition 13. Such a real estate slump and downward reassessments occurred during 2009 when the California State Board of Equalization announced an estimated reduction of property tax base year values due to negative inflation. The property tax in California is an <b>Ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax meaning that the tax assessed (generally) increases and decreases with the value of the property.|$|E
25|$|Henry Clay had {{not taken}} his defeat in the presidential {{election}} well and was unsure on what position he could take in the tariff negotiations. His long term concern was that Jackson eventually was determined to kill protectionism along with the American Plan. In February, after consulting with manufacturers and sugar interests in Louisiana who favored protection for the sugar industry, Clay started to work on a specific compromise plan. As a starting point, he accepted the nullifiers' offer of a transition period but extended it from seven and a half years to nine years with a final target of a 20% <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> rate. After first securing the support of his protectionist base, Clay, through an intermediary, broached the subject with Calhoun. Calhoun was receptive and after a private meeting with Clay at Clay’s boardinghouse, negotiations preceded.|$|E
25|$|From 1825 to 1848 {{the average}} number of ships {{traveling}} to California increased to about 25 ships per year—a large increase from the average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824. The port of entry for trading purposes was the Alta California Capital, Monterey, California, where custom duties (tariffs) of about 100% were applied. These high duties gave rise to much bribery and smuggling, as avoiding the tariffs made more money for the ship owners and made the goods less costly to the customers. Essentially all the cost of the California government (what little there was) was paid for by these tariffs (custom duties). In this they were much like the United States in 1850, where about 89% of the revenue of its federal government came from import tariffs (also called Customs or <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> taxes), although at an average rate of about 20%.|$|E
25|$|The Tariff of 1816 {{had some}} {{protective}} features, and it received support throughout the nation, {{including that of}} John C. Calhoun and fellow South Carolinian William Lowndes. The first explicitly protective tariff linked to a specific program of internal improvements was the Tariff of 1824. Sponsored by Henry Clay, this tariff provided a general level of protection at 35% <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> (compared to 25% with the 1816 act) and hiked duties on iron, woolens, cotton, hemp, and wool and cotton bagging. The bill barely passed the federal House of Representatives {{by a vote of}} 107 to 102. The Middle states and Northwest supported the bill, the South and Southwest opposed it, and New England split its vote with a majority opposing it. In the Senate the bill, with the support of Tennessee Senator Andrew Jackson, passed by four votes, and President James Monroe, the Virginia heir to the Jefferson-Madison control of the White House, signed the bill on March 25, 1824. Daniel Webster of Massachusetts led the New England opposition to this tariff.|$|E
25|$|The Panic of 1837 hit the {{following}} year, causing a sharp decrease in tax revenues, {{even as the}} state budget was already faced a large deficit because of the interest on the debt. Property taxes were the state's primary regular income, and to increase the revenue Noble proposed that the tax be levied <b>ad</b> <b>valorem.</b> The change would save the state a significant amount in administrative and collection costs, and make more land subject to taxation. The tax was approved {{and led to a}} 25% increase in revenue {{the following}} year, but it was still not enough to cover the deficit. Noble proposed the projects be prioritized, and work halted on the less important ones to conserve funds, but the plan was rejected. By the time Noble left office, the state's financial situation was bleak, but it was not yet fully apparent that far more had been borrowed than could be paid back. Despite the dire situation, Noble left office in 1837 as a popular political figure and was able to use his prestige to help elect David Wallace, his lieutenant governor, as governor.|$|E
25|$|Many {{economists have}} argued that the sharp decline in {{international}} trade after 1930 helped to worsen the depression, especially for countries significantly dependent on foreign trade. In a 1995 survey of American economic historians, two-thirds agreed that the Smoot-Hawley tariff act at least worsened the Great Depression. Most historians and economists partly blame the American Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (enacted June 17, 1930) for worsening the depression by seriously reducing international trade and causing retaliatory tariffs in other countries. While foreign trade was a small part of overall economic activity in the U.S. and was concentrated in a few businesses like farming, it was a much larger factor in many other countries. The average <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> rate of duties on dutiable imports for 1921–25 was 25.9% but under the new tariff it jumped to 50% during 1931–35. In dollar terms, American exports declined over the next four (4) years from about $5.2 billion in 1929 to $1.7 billion in 1933; so, not only did the physical volume of exports fall, but also the prices fell by about 1/3 as written. Hardest hit were farm commodities such as wheat, cotton, tobacco, and lumber.|$|E
25|$|The Munger Fort, {{located at}} Munger (also spelt as Monghyr during the British Raj), {{in the state}} of Bihar, India, is built on a rocky hillock on the south bank of the Ganges River. Its history is not {{completely}} dated but it is believed that it was built during the early rule of Slave dynasty of India. The Munger town where the fort is situated was under the control of Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi (1325-1351 AD). The fort has two prominent hills called the Karnachaura or Karanchaura, and the other a built up rectangular mound deduced to be the location of a citadel of the fort with historical links. The Fort had a succession of Muslim rulers (Khaljis, Tughlaqs, Lodis, Nawabs of Bengal, followed by Mughal rulers, till it was finally acceded to the British by Mir Quasim (1760–72), after unseating his father-in-aw Mīr Jafar on the grounds of old age, for a monetary reward negotiated by Vansittart. This deal involved payment by the East India Company’s merchants of an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> duty of 9 percent, against an Indian merchant’s duty of 40%. The fort became a place of considerable importance to the British in Bengal till 1947 (India'a independence).|$|E
25|$|Polk's {{other major}} {{domestic}} initiative was the lowering of the tariff, as Polk {{argued that the}} tariff should only {{be as high as}} necessary for the operation of the federal government. Though he had taken an ambivalent position on the tariff during the 1844 campaign in order to win Northern votes, Polk had long opposed a high tariff and viewed the protection of manufacturing interests as unfair to other economic activities. Polk directed Secretary of the Treasury Robert Walker to draft a new and lower tariff, which Polk submitted to Congress. After intense lobbying campaigns by both sides, the bill passed the House and, in a close vote that required Vice President Dallas to break a tie, the Senate. In 1846, Polk signed the Walker Tariff into law, substantially reducing the rates that had been set by the Whig-backed Tariff of 1842. The new law abandoned <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tariffs and set rates independent of the monetary value of the product. Polk's lowering of the tariff was popular in the South and West; however, it was despised by many protectionists in the Northeast, especially Pennsylvania. A reduction of tariffs in the United States and a repeal of the Corn Laws in Great Britain led to a boom in Anglo-American trade.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the outcome}} of the lawsuit, the insured diamond was valued between US$400,000 and $500,000 (allowing for inflation, this would now be $ and $). At the time the lawsuit was pending, {{imported}} diamonds that were cut and suitable for use in the manufacture of jewellery, without actually being set as jewellery were subject to an [...] tax of 20% its value. However, artistic antiquities produced more than one hundred years prior to the date of importation could be imported into the United States duty-free; that is to say, without having to pay a 20% tax. The final decision of the lawsuit was released on 4 June 1930. In that decision, the court determined that the unset [...] Nassak Diamond was not an artistic antiquity and was suitable for use in manufacture of jewellery. In particular, the court said that the 1930 Nassak Diamond was nothing more than [...] "a large diamond, cut in an ordinary way." [...] As a result, the importer owed an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> tax of 20% of the diamond's value under US Tariff Act of 1922.|$|E
