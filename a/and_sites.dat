5|$|In {{addition}} to the courthouse building, the public square contains several outbuildings <b>and</b> <b>sites</b> that are also historic in nature and considered contributing properties to the Oregon Commercial Historic District, including a sculpture by Lorado Taft and a cast-iron fountain. The courthouse joined the Register in 1981 and was included as a contributing property to the historic district in 2006. After initially joining the Register the structure underwent a careful restoration. The courthouse no longer serves as the primary judiciary center for the county; its successor is located directly across the street.|$|E
30|$|Before construction, {{abundance}} at downstream <b>site</b> C <b>and</b> <b>site</b> D {{was greater}} than at upstream <b>site</b> A <b>and</b> <b>site</b> B. But numbers declined drastically during construction. For example, the number of aquatic worms decreased from 13.8 individuals/m 2 before construction to 0.7 individuals/m 2 during construction and 0.9 individuals/m 2 after construction. In contrast, horsehair worm and mayfly larva populations increased during and after construction at downstream <b>site</b> C <b>and</b> <b>site</b> D. Caddisfly larvae were observed at <b>site</b> C <b>and</b> <b>site</b> D before <b>and</b> after, but not during construction. Other taxa including planarian, soldier fly larva, and stonefly larva seem to have disappeared altogether after construction.|$|R

5|$|In the United States, a {{historic}} district {{is a group}} of buildings, properties, or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects <b>and</b> <b>sites</b> within {{a historic}} district are normally divided into two categories, contributing and non-contributing.

5|$|As {{early as}} 2008, {{advocacy}} groups in Maryland and New York, and their federal representatives, pushed for legislation to establish two national historical parks honoring Harriet Tubman: one to include her {{place of birth}} on Maryland's eastern shore, <b>and</b> <b>sites</b> along {{the route of the}} Underground Railroad in Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties in Maryland; and a second to include her home in Auburn, NY. For the next six years, bills to do so were introduced, but were never advanced or enacted.

5|$|At {{that time}} the {{shutdown}} began, all state government spending and operations {{not considered to be}} critical stopped. Suspended state services included driving tests, childcare assistance, senior and disability linkage lines, criminal background checks, and road construction. State government offices, state parks, highway rest areas, <b>and</b> <b>sites</b> run by the Minnesota Historical Society, among others, closed. The commissioner of the Department of Human Services, Lucinda Jesson, said that letters had to be sent to over 580,000 households that relied on the department for social services to notify them about the possible shutdown. More critical parts of the state government, including public safety, health care, benefit payments, and care for residents of state facilities continued. Services that were continued during the shutdown could have amounted to as much as 80 percent of state spending.|$|E
5|$|During the Anglo-Saxon period, many shrines {{were built}} on former pagan sites which became popular pilgrimage destinations, while other pilgrims visited {{prominent}} monasteries <b>and</b> <b>sites</b> of learning. Senior nobles or kings would travel to Rome, {{which was a}} popular destination from the 7th century onwards; sometimes these trips were a form of convenient political exile. Under the Normans, religious institutions with important shrines, such as Glastonbury, Canterbury and Winchester, promoted themselves as pilgrimage destinations, maximising {{the value of the}} historic miracles associated with the sites. Accumulating relics became an important task for ambitious institutions, as these were believed to hold curative powers and lent status to the site. Indeed, by the 12th century reports of posthumous miracles by local saints were becoming increasing common in England, adding to the attractiveness of pilgrimages to prominent relics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Voronoi {{diagrams}} are {{an important}} data structure in computer science. However well studied mathematically, understanding such diagrams for different metrics, orders, <b>and</b> <b>site</b> shapes is a complex task. We propose a new method to visualize k-order diagrams and give an efficient adaptive implementation for this method. The algorithm is easy to customize for different metrics <b>and</b> <b>site</b> shapes. Its real-time performance makes it suitable for interactive planning and analysis of complex Voronoi configurations in 2 D. We illustrate the method for different combinations of metrics <b>and</b> <b>site</b> shapes. ...|$|R
25|$|These models {{state that}} each IR monomer {{possesses}} 2 insulin binding sites; site 1, which binds to the 'classical' binding surface of insulin: consisting of L1 plus αCT domains <b>and</b> <b>site</b> 2, consisting of loops {{at the junction}} of FnIII-1 and FnIII-2 predicted to bind to the 'novel' hexamer face binding site of insulin. As each monomer contributing to the IR ectodomain exhibits 3D 'mirrored' complementarity, N-terminal site 1 of one monomer ultimately faces C-terminal site 2 of the second monomer, where this is also true for each monomers mirrored complement (the {{opposite side of the}} ectodomain structure). Current literature distinguishes the complement binding sites by designating the second monomer's <b>site</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>site</b> 2 nomenclature as either <b>site</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>site</b> 4 or as <b>site</b> 1' <b>and</b> <b>site</b> 2' respectively.|$|R
5|$|In metapopulation terminology, {{migrating}} {{individuals are}} classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), <b>and</b> <b>sites</b> are classed either as sources or sinks. A {{site is a}} generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, many stone Norman keeps made {{considerable}} compromises {{to military}} utility. Norwich Castle, for example, included elaborate blind arcading {{on the outside}} of the building and appears to have had an entrance route designed for public ceremony, rather than for defence. The interior of the keep at Hedingham could certainly have hosted impressive ceremonies and events, but contained numerous flaws from a military perspective. Important early English and Welsh keeps such as the White Tower, Colchester, and Chepstow were all built in a distinctive Romanesque style, often reusing Roman materials <b>and</b> <b>sites,</b> and were almost certainly intended to impress and generate a political effect amongst local people. The political value of these keep designs, and the social prestige they lent to their builders, may help explain why they continued to be built in England into the late 12th century, beyond the point when military theory would have suggested that alternative designs were adopted.|$|E
