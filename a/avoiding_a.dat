5|$|The {{election}} of Matthias as king {{was the only}} way of <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> protracted civil war. Ladislaus Garai was the first baron to yield. At a meeting with Matthias's mother and uncle, he promised that he and his allies would promote Matthias's election, and Michael Szilágyi promised that his nephew would never seek vengeance for Ladislaus Hunyadi's execution. They also agreed that Matthias would marry the Palatine's daughter Annahis executed brother's bride.|$|E
5|$|Workers use several {{different}} strategies {{to deal with}} their dead, including burying, cannibalism, and <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> corpse altogether. To avoid pathogens, termites occasionally engage in necrophoresis, in which a nestmate carries away a corpse from the colony to dispose of it elsewhere. Which strategy is used depends {{on the nature of the}} corpse a worker is dealing with (i.e. the age of the carcass).|$|E

In 1966 MRD produced the BT18 for the lower category, with a Honda engine acting as a stressed component. The car was extremely successful, winning 11 consecutive Formula Two races {{in the hands of}} the Formula One pairing of Brabham and Hulme.

The brothers, along with six other prisoners at Fox River State Penitentiary, manage to escape, and the second season follows a massive manhunt chasing the group. Dubbed the Fox River Eight, the group splits and members go their individual way, occasionally meeting up to help each other. They struggle to escape from the police while <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> secret group of multinationals called The Company, that wants them all dead.|$|E

5|$|Sanchez {{once again}} {{put up the}} only points for the offense in another humiliating blowout, this time a 45-14 loss to the Detroit Lions. Sanchez played {{relatively}} well, <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> 3-and-out on the first drive with a 5-yard scramble and managing {{to tie the game}} 7-7 with a touchdown pass to Brent Celek, but a defensive meltdown and lack of offensive momentum left the Eagles hopeless, and Sanchez finished his Eagles record with an 0-2 record as starter. Sanchez finished 19/27 for 199 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions, which translated into a passer rating of 116.1.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{stands in}} {{semantic}} contrast with defensive mimicry, {{where it is}} the prey {{that acts as a}} mimic, with predators being duped. Defensive mimicry includes the well-known Batesian and Müllerian forms of mimicry, where the mimic shares outward characteristics with an aposematic or harmful model. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic is modeled on a dangerous (usually unpalatable) species, while in Müllerian mimicry both species are harmful, and act as comimics, converging on a common set of signals and sharing the burden of 'educating' their predators. Also included in defensive mimicry is the lesser known Mertensian mimicry, where the mimic is more harmful than the model, and Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds come to mimic crops through unintentional artificial selection. In defensive mimicry, the mimic benefits by <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> harmful interaction with another organism that {{would be more likely to}} take place without the deceptive signals employed. Harmful interactions might involve being eaten, or pulled out of the ground as a weed. In contrast, the aggressive mimic benefits from an interaction that would be less likely to take place without the deception, at the expense of its target.|$|E

5|$|As Q3 started, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Lewis Hamilton would be unable to take part, suffering from a hybrid system failure in the turbo charger, the same problem that had plagued him in China two weeks earlier. Nico Rosberg went on to secure pole position, even though his last timed lap was compromised by a tyre lockup into turn 13. Sebastian Vettel was closest to Rosberg, but a five-place grid penalty meant that he would start the race from seventh on the grid, moving Valtteri Bottas into the first row. Kimi Räikkönen was fourth fastest, ahead of Massa, Ricciardo, Pérez, Kvyat and Verstappen. After qualifying, Mercedes decided to switch Hamilton's car back to his spare power unit, which had been rebuilt following its failure at the Chinese Grand Prix, thereby <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> grid penalty, which they would have incurred if a new power unit would have been installed. Williams were satisfied with their pace in qualifying, praising the advances they made in slow-corner speed.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the lights}} went on for the start, Pascal Wehrlein {{came to a halt}} in the wrong grid slot, having mistakenly taken the spot left vacant by Massa, who was {{starting}} from the pitlane. Wehrlein was able to reverse into his slot one row behind just 0.5 seconds before the start light procedure started, <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> penalty. At the start, Hamilton got away well from pole position while Hülkenberg lost ground. Button was second as Rosberg moved ahead of Ricciardo and Verstappen. Having gotten a new car built overnight, Daniil Kvyat retired at the end of lap two, after having started from the pitlane. On lap six, Rosberg got ahead of Hülkenberg in fourth position, while Verstappen took advantage and overtook Hülkenberg as well. Räikkönen got ahead of Button into second on lap seven. Tyre stops started on lap nine, as Hülkenberg and Alonso were the first to come in, followed by Button one lap later. After Gutiérrez came past him into ninth on lap 12, Massa headed for the pitlane as well. As Wehrlein made a pit stop on lap 14, Hamilton was still in the lead, followed by Räikkönen and Rosberg.|$|E
5|$|Cleph {{kept the}} throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. Possibly {{he too was}} killed at the {{instigation}} of the Byzantines, who had every interest in <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> hostile and solid leadership among the Lombards. An important success for the Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed Cleph, opening a decade of interregnum, thus making them more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only {{when faced with the}} danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the dukes elected a new king in the person of Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom while the remaining imperial territories were reorganized under the control of an exarch in Ravenna with the capacity to defend the country without the Emperor's assistance.|$|E

5|$|Evacuation plans already existed as a {{standard}} procedure for American embassies. At the beginning of March, fixed-wing aircraft began evacuating civilians from Tan Son Nhat Airport through neighboring countries. By mid-April, contingency plans were in place and preparations were underway for a possible helicopter evacuation. As the imminent collapse of Saigon became evident, Task Force 76 (TF76) was assembled off the coast near Vung Tau to support a helicopter evacuation and provide air support if required. In the event, air support was not needed as the North Vietnamese paused for {{a week at the}} outskirts of Saigon, possibly waiting for the South Vietnamese government to collapse and <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> possible confrontation with the U.S. by allowing the mostly-unopposed evacuation of Americans from Saigon.|$|E
5|$|Finally, by 19:00 B Company {{was able}} break contact and withdrew after a five-hour battle, {{moving into a}} night harbour near the landing zone with the {{remainder}} of the battalion. Mortars, artillery fire and airstrikes covered the Australian withdrawal, and then proceeded to pound the battlefield into the evening. After a tense night the Australians returned the next morning only to find that the Viet Cong had left the area during the night, successfully <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> large blocking force while dragging most of their dead and wounded with them. A hard fought affair at close range, the Viet Cong had lost heavily during the fighting, yet the disciplined force had matched the Australians as both sides stood their ground, inflicting numerous casualties on the other before each fell back. Although 6 RAR had ultimately prevailed, if only by default, the vicious fighting at Ap My An was probably the closest that the Australian Army came to defeat in a major battle during the war.|$|E
5|$|Rawlinson had {{submitted}} Monash's {{proposals to}} Haig in July and Haig had forwarded them to Foch. At {{a meeting on}} 24 July, Foch agreed to the plan but insisted that the French First Army, which held the front {{to the south of}} the British Fourth Army, should participate. Rawlinson opposed this as his and Monash's plans depended on the large-scale use of tanks (now finally available in large numbers) to achieve surprise, by <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> preliminary bombardment. The French First Army lacked tanks and would be forced to bombard the German positions before the infantry advance began, thus removing the element of surprise. Eventually, it was agreed that the French would participate, but not launch their attack until 45 minutes after the Fourth Army. It was also agreed to advance the proposed date of the attack from 10 August to 8 August, to strike the Germans before they had completed their withdrawal from the Marne salient.|$|E

50|$|If he {{is unable}} to find an open {{receiver}} he will attempt to run the ball himself, throw the ball out of bounds to prevent a sack and/or turnover, or if there is no lane, he may collapse to the ground to protect the ball and try to <b>avoid</b> <b>a</b> fumble.

5|$|The 3rd Baltic Front {{launched}} an artillery barrage at {{the positions of}} the 2nd Battalion, 45 Waffen SS Grenadier Regiment (1st Estonian) covering the German right flank in the village of Nõo southeast of Tartu on 23 August. The Soviet 282nd Rifle Division backed by the 16th Single Tank Brigade and two self-propelled artillery regiments bypassed the defence on the west side and captured the Kärevere Bridge across the Emajõgi River west of Tartu. Being one of only four bridges across the 100 kilometres long marshy floodplains of the river, it was of high strategic importance. After sappers failed to destroy the bridge, Sturmbannführer Leon Degrelle improvised a defence line of the 5th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Wallonien, <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> Soviet breakthrough to Tartu. As a result, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves.|$|E
5|$|The Nevill Ground was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} host grounds for the 1983 Cricket World Cup. It hosted one group stage match between India and Zimbabwe on 18June 1983. Kapil Dev scored 175 not out after India were 9–4, which helped India win by 31 runs and qualify into the semi-finals, thus <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> play-off against Australia. Dev's partnership with Syed Kirmani set a world record for the largest ninth wicket stand of 126. This match led to the Nevill Ground being held in high regard by Indian cricket fans with there being a view that the game at the Nevill Ground inspired a change in the way cricket was played in India. This led to players such as Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid playing for India in later years.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of these tactics by the Tangmere Wing was used on 6 May 1941. The Wing engaged Bf 109Fs from Jagdgeschwader 51 (Fighter Wing 51), led by Werner Mölders. Noticing the {{approaching}} Germans below and behind them, the Spitfires feigned ignorance. Waiting for the optimum moment to turn the tables, Bader called for them to break, and whip around behind the Bf 109s. Unfortunately, while the tactic had been successful in <b>avoiding</b> <b>a</b> surprise attack, the break was mistimed. It left some Bf 109s still behind the Spitfires. In the battle that followed the Wing shot down one Bf 109 and damaged another, although Dundas was shot down {{for the second time}} in his career—and once again by Mölders, who had remained behind the British. Dundas was able to nurse his crippled fighter back to base and crash-land.|$|E
