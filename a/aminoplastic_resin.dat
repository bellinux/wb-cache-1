40|$|A long {{standing}} {{problem in the}} manufacture of wheat-straw based composites with cost-effective formaldehyde-based resins is their poor water resistance as demonstrated by their large water thickness swell. In this study, wheat straw based medium density fiberboards were manufactured using 3 resin/wax systems: a melamine-urea-formalde-hyde resin with either low or high wax content, and a phenol-formal-dehyde resin with low wax content. The flexural properties, internal bond strength, and thickness swell of the resulting composites were evaluated and compared according to ASTM methods. The three MDF compos-ites passed the requirements for MDF in interior application, except for the MDF manufactured with the <b>aminoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> and low wax content that failed to provide acceptable thickness swell. Using the phenolic resin in combination with low wax content resulted in a higher grade MDF composite, grade 120, than with the aminoplastic and high wax content. This study demonstrates that wheat straw based MDF manu-factured with cost-effective aminoplastic and phenolic resins can have flexural properties, internal bond strength and thickness swell perfor-mance above the requirements from the American National Standards Institute...|$|E
40|$|Nitrification via nitrite was {{studied in}} two aerobic {{reactors}} treating wastewater from an <b>aminoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> producing factory at HRT varying between 1. 37 - 1. 89 and 2. 45 - 3. 63 days. Both reactors were fed with concentrations of 366, 450, 1099 and 1899 mg N-NH 4 +/L. In {{general in the}} reactor operated at a lower HRT, the nitritation percentage decreased from 87. 2 to 21. 6 %, while the nitratation percentage remained always lower than 2. 5 % (except in the last period) when the ammonium concentration was increased. This behaviour {{could be due to}} the inhibition of the ammonium and nitrite oxidation produced by high free ammonia concentrations up to 179. 3 mg N-NH 3 /L. In the reactor operated at a higher HRT, the nitritation percentage decreased and the nitratation percentage increased from 88. 6 to 39. 6 % and from 0. 65 to 35. 7 %, respectively, due to an increase of the dissolved oxygen concentration from 0. 76 to 1. 02 mg O 2 /L. However, when ammonium was fed at a concentration of 1898. 7 mg N-NH 4 +/L, the nitritation increased and the nitratation decreased, probably {{as a result of the}} accumulation of free ammonia up to 2. 04 mg N-NH 3 /L, meaning that nitrite oxidizers were inhibited. Nitrite build-up was observed after each modification of ammonium concentration in the feed...|$|E
40|$|NOVELTY - Solid {{particles}} micro-encapsulated with <b>aminoplastic</b> <b>resin,</b> {{in which}} the resin is the condensation product of partly etherated amino-resin precondensates, at least one component of which shows a high surface activity due to co-condensation with an ethoxylated fatty amine, so that the micro-particles are evenly encapsulated even at exposed points. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for the quasi-continuous production of micro-encapsulated particles as above by: (a) introducing the solid particles into a reactor in which an acid-catalysed polycondensation {{of at least two}} amino-resin precondensates is carried out in the aqueous phase; (b) post-curing the polymer in a larger receiver with facilities for continuous removal of the aqueous medium; (c) separating the micro-encapsulated particles from the mother liquor and drying the micro-capsules and (d) working up the mother liquor and recycling it to the process. USE - For the production of micro-encapsulated metal particles, metal oxide particles and crystalline substances (claimed). Applications include substances such as metal flakes, titanium dioxide and other metal oxides, dyes, marker inks, magnetisable particles etc. for use {{in a wide range of}} industries. ADVANTAGE - Enables the quasi-continuous production of micro-encapsulated solid particles with very good homogeneity and uniformity (with regard to capsule wall thickness), without the disadvantages associated with prior-art processes, such as clumping, agglomeration and the formation of aggregates...|$|E

40|$|Fibreboards {{were made}} from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris [L. ]) using the thermo-mechanical (TMP) and chemo-thermomechanical pulping (CTMP). The boards were made without binders (insulation boards) and with <b>aminoplastic</b> <b>resins</b> as a binder (medium density fibreboards (MDF)). The results of a joint {{research}} work, {{carried out by the}} University of Göttingen and the Fraunhofer-Institute for Wood Research (WKI), Braunschweig, revealed that the pulping techniques (TMP and CTMP) have a significant influence on the chemical composition and the emission level of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from fibres and binderless fibreboards. Binderless fibreboards made from TMP release more aliphatic aldehyds and ketones compared to those made from CTMP. However, the emission of acetic acid was, in general, much higher from CTMP and binderless fibreboards made therefrom. Moreover, the results indicate that volatile organic compounds generated during the pulping process (TMP and CTMP) could interact with the binders used for making medium density fibreboards (MDF) affecting both the level of VOC emission and the chemical composition of the released volatile organic compounds (VOC) ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of moisture content on the formaldehyde release of particleboards and medium density fibreboards (MDF) bonded with tannin-formaldehyde (TF-) resins. The results revealed that increasing the moisture content in the TF-bonded boards elicited a decline in the content of extractable formaldehyde (perforator values according to EN 120). This is an opposing behaviour to the general state of knowledge related to the influence of moisture content on the formaldehyde content (EN 120) of particleboards and MDF bonded with urea-formaldehyde based resins. Moreover, the TF-bonded panels showed a decrease in the gas analysis values (EN 717 - 2), flask values (EN 717 - 3) as well as formaldehyde emission measured in the 1 m 3 -chamber (EN 717 - 1). EN 120 (now also pr EN ISO 124605, 2013) does not take into consideration that boards bonded with other binders rather than <b>aminoplastic</b> <b>resins</b> may behave differently at different moisture contents. Insofar, it leaves no leeway to consider different binders systems...|$|R

It {{was assumed}} that shafts of the columns would be solid timber C 18, and that their gussets would be produced, as variants, from timber, plywood, {{particleboard}} and fibreboard. It {{was assumed that}} the solid timber gussets would be made from timber class C 18. It was assumed that the gussets were attached to the column shaft with glue. <b>Aminoplastic</b> <b>resin,</b> phenolic resin and polycondensation adhesive, described in the standard EN 301 [9], are among the possible materials {{that can be used}} for glueing. The height of the gussets was chosen appropriately to fulfil the load-bearing capacity condition for a glued joint, connecting the gusset with the column shaft, affected by torsional moment and shearing force. Then, the gusset thicknesses were chosen in such a way that they would be able to carry the shearing force and the bending moment created by it. Values of longitudinal compressive forces in the columns were chosen so that the load-bearing capacities of the columns, calculated with the formulae given in EN- 1995 Eurocode 5 [4], accounting for the assumed dimensions of the column elements, were n[*]=[*] 1.0. Load-bearing capacity n[*]=[*] 1.0 means that stresses taking place in a stressed element are of equal value to permissible stress values for the given class of timber. Values n[*]>[*] 1 indicate by how much the load-bearing capacity has been exceeded. Values n[*]<[*] 1 indicate the existing reserve in the load-bearing capacity. In order to determine how much the load-bearing capacity has been exceeded and what reserve still exists in it, one has to calculate the value of (n[*]−[*] 1)⋅ 100 %.|$|E
40|$|Colloidal {{particle}} formation {{followed by}} their clustering {{has been shown}} to be the normal way of ageing of <b>aminoplastic</b> <b>resins,</b> in particular melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) resins. Ageing (or further advancement of the resin by other means such as longer condensation times) causes whitening of the resin. This is a macroscopic indication both of the formation of colloidal particles and of their clustering. Some clustering appears rather early in this process, even when the great majority of the resin does visually appear to be in colloidal state, being transparent. However, it eventually progresses to resins which are mostly in colloidal, clustered state, followed much later by a supercluster formation starting to involve the whole resin. There appears to be clear correspondence between molecular mass increases as obtained by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), low-angle laser light scattering (LALLS) analysis, and observation by polarizing optical microscopy. LALLS, however, appears to indicate the dimensions of the colloidal particles themselves when the level of colloidal aggregation is rather low, but it indicates the dimensions of the clusters once these are mostly aggregated. The smaller visible colloidal particles, already aggregates, were found by polarizing optical microscopy to be of a mostly elongated, rodlike shape, the length of which was shown to grow much further than their width with resin advancement and ageing. As their dimensions indicate, these are already clusters; this implies that the mainly linear increase of the polycondensate chains influences also the simpler colloidal clusters' growth direction, possibly explaining the resins' lack of tridimensional hardening while still in storage. It also explains why molecules such as free urea and acetals, by disrupting these colloidal aggregation mechanisms, allow both a much longer shelf life of the resin and its better performance in hardening. These findings explained the considerable difference in the behavior and performance of different MUF resin formulations. The ageing of the MUF resins of different preparation procedures appeared then to proceed from (1) clear resin (molecular colloidal aggregation) to (2) superclusters of a whitened, heavily thixotropic resin, which is the beginning of physical gelation to (3) liquid/cluster separation, which is the terminal stage of physical gelation...|$|R
40|$|Today, the cost, {{excellence}} {{and availability of}} raw materials are of principal importance. Due to environmental concerns, {{a very large number}} of companies are currently developing manufacturing processes using alternative materials for their crop and in search of new markets for the sub-products of their first-line production. Textile industry is an example of the reality that the industry is living these days. With a significant production of waste fibrous materials, textile companies are now looking for applications where waste materials could be an added-value material. Composites reinforced by fibres are being considered for several uses when high performance is essential. The corrosion resistance, potentially high overall durability, light weight, tailor ability and high specific performance attributes enable the use of composite materials in areas in which the use of conventional material might be constrain due to durability, weight or lack of design flexibility. This paper describes the work that is being done at University of Minho concerning the development of waste fibers reinforced composite materials. Different waste fibers reinforced composite materials have been produced varying the density and the variation in ratio of resin and waste fibers. Waste fibers have been collected within some textile companies and processed in order to individualize the fibers and to allow subsequent processing. Composite panels have been produced by compression moulding technique, through the application of heat and pressure. Panel thicknesses of 5 mm using <b>resin</b> <b>aminoplastic</b> for urea-formaldehyde have been produced. Materials thus obtained have been tested in tensile, bending, compression test. The results obtained are presented and discussed...|$|R
