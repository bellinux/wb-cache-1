5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{measurement}} the river is divided into five water body areas by the Environment Agency. Both the <b>area</b> <b>from</b> the source to Broad River around Crewkerne and the <b>area</b> <b>from</b> Broad River to Lopen Brook are rated good for chemical quality and moderate for ecological quality. The <b>area</b> <b>from</b> Lopen Brook to the River Isle, around Martock and South Petherton, is rated good for chemical quality, poor for ecological quality and poor overall. From the River Isle to River Yeo around Muchelney, chemical quality is rated good, and ecology is rated moderate. The section around Langport to the West Sedgemoor Drain continues to rate good for chemical quality and moderate for ecological quality, as does the final area leading to Bridgwater Bay.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Sir Archibald Murray, the Imperial Commander in Chief of Egypt, {{partially}} {{addressed the}} threat of von Kressenstein's forces to the Suez Canal by organising the defences into three sectors. No. 1 (Southern) sector, with its headquarters at Suez, covered the <b>area</b> <b>from</b> Suez to Kabrit, No. 2 (Central) sector, with its headquarters at Ismailia, covered the <b>area</b> <b>from</b> Kabrit to Ferdan, and No. 3 (Northern) sector, with its headquarters at Port Said, covered the <b>area</b> <b>from</b> Ferdan to Port Said. The No. 3 sector also had an advanced headquarters at Kantara. To support these forward defences, the British Empire improved their lines of communication by doubling the single railway line that ran from Cairo to the Suez Canal, and also pumped water from the River Nile along the Sweet Water Canal to supply the troops and the towns on the Suez Canal.|$|E
30|$|This system {{comprises}} forty generators with valve-point loading. The generator {{data has}} been taken from [22]. The total load demand is 10500 MW. The forty generators are divided into four areas. Area 1 includes first ten units and 15 % of the total load demand. Area 2 has second ten generators and 40 % of the total load demand. Area 3 consists of third ten generators and 30 % of the total load demand. Area four includes last ten generators and 15 % of the total load demand. The power flow limit <b>from</b> <b>area</b> 1 to <b>area</b> 2 or <b>from</b> <b>area</b> 2 to area 1 is 200 MW.

5|$|The Territory of Utah was an {{organized}} incorporated {{territory of the}} United States formed on September 9, 1850.

Nevada Territory was organized from the western section of Utah Territory on March 2, 1861.

5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding <b>area</b> <b>from</b> atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
