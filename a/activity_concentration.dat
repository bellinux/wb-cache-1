This survey was undertaken {{to better understand}} the radioactivity content of the modern diet and also to assess the suitability of the current use of milk as a sentinel for dietary radionuclide trends. Thirteen radionuclides were analysed in 40 common food commodities, including animal products, fruits, vegetables, cereal grains and seafood.

Attenuation correction was based on micro-CT information. Scatter correction was based on dual and triple-energy window methods. Phantom and animal experiments were performed. A phantom containing nine vials was filled with different concentrations of (99 m) Tc. Three vials were also filled with CT contrast agent to increase attenuation. <b>Activity</b> <b>concentrations</b> measured on the pinhole SPECT images were compared with <b>activity</b> <b>concentrations</b> measured by the dose calibrator.

Detections of 137 Caesium were evenly distributed across all regions. <b>Activity</b> <b>concentrations</b> were consistent with those expected from the oceanic inventory representing residual fallout from global nuclear testing. 210 Polonium was detected above the minimum detectable concentration in 33 (92 %) of the analysed samples.
