2500|$|During the 1880s the {{discrepancies}} between {{the best available}} lunar tables (published by Hansen in 1857) and observations had become so large that navigators could no longer use the moon's position to determine their longitude accurately. Nevill tackled the problem by first verifying Hansen's treatment of lunar perturbations caused by the direct action of the sun. He then devised an improved method for calculating perturbations caused by Venus. The remaining errors he ascribed to the gravitational pull of the other planets, whose effects were very difficult to calculate. This work was published, among others, in a paper in the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society (1885), describing the corrections required by Hansen's tables. He next studied all available lunar observations {{since the middle of}} the 17th century and reduced them to a uniform basis. Comparing these observations to Hansen's tables, he used {{the discrepancies}} to derive the amplitudes and periods of appropriate correction terms. After all these improvements the tables provided <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> to all lunar observations made since 1650.|$|E

Namely, vast stands of timber for the production of charcoal, running water to operate the bellows, and an ample supply of limestone needed to add flux to the smelting furnaces. Grubb's plans were further helped {{by the fact that the}} magnetite at Cornwall was either very close to or on the surface of his land. He was ready to venture into the iron business and set about the task of building an iron [...] "plantation". These centers of iron production were usually located well away from the heavily cleared farmlands and were nestled in the Ridge and Valley section of Pennsylvania. Grubb constructed his furnaces, first a bloomery and later the more modern charcoal-fired blast furnace and the support buildings and mill village that was needed to house his workers. [...] He named his operation Cornwall because his father, John Grubb had come from Cornwall, UK in 1677. [...] Cornwall Iron Furnace was <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> for the agricultural based economy of the Thirteen Colonies. Iron was needed to make into tools, nails and weapons.

We also investigate the effect of metallicity on the overall SED and in particular, on the strength of the PAH features. We provide templates for the mean emission produced by the young compact Hii regions, the older (10 − 100 Myr) stars and for the wavelength-dependent attenuation produced by a foreground screen of the dust used in our model.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Severe fatigue is {{reported}} {{by the majority of}} patients with three relatively common types of neuromuscular disorders. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify predictors of fatigue in a longitudinal study and to develop a model of fatigue in patients with three neuromuscular disorders. METHODS: One hundred ninety-eight patients [60 facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), 70 adult-onset myotonic dystrophy (MD), and 68 hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type I (HMSN-I) patients] were studied twice during an 18 -month period. Fatigue severity was assessed by the Checklist Individual Strength. A multidimensional assessment method was used, including self-report questionnaires, a daily Self-Observation List, and physical activity (actometer). Muscle strength was determined using the Medical Research Council scale. Structural equation modeling was used to develop and test a model of factors contributing to the persistence of experienced fatigue. RESULTS: Muscle strength, self-reported physical activity, sleep disturbances, and pain at baseline contributed directly or indirectly to fatigue and impairment at follow-up. Lower muscle strength contributed to lower levels of physical activity, which, in turn, contributed to fatigue severity. The model showed <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> for the whole group of neuromuscular disorders. In FSHD, pain also contributed to physical activity. A model with the actometer as measurement for actual physical activity instead of self-report showed <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> model <b>fit</b> in FSHD and HMSN but an insufficient fit in MD. CONCLUSION: The model of perpetuating factors for fatigue in FSHD and HMSN is different from the model in MD. The main difference is in physical (in) activity. These differences have implications for interventions based on these models...|$|R

Next, the definitions of DDH used in the various literature series was likely different from study to study, which might introduce some bias. However the overall Pearson Chi-square test for non-uniform distribution was highly significant for both the Northern hemisphere (p <  0.0001), and Southern hemisphere (p =  0.0001). There could also be selection bias from the literature review, but it was exhaustive, and all the studies that mentioned seasonal variation were completely reviewed (not just the abstract), and the data extracted where given. Thus, there was minimal selection bias regarding this aspect of the study. Therefore, we believe the data is very representative as both our data as well as that from the literature demonstrate seasonal variation in the month of birth.|$|R
