5|$|Stan {{tries to}} persuade Randy {{to tell the}} truth about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses in order to avoid embarrassment. As the pair works on the warp drive, an Intergalactic Police ship {{approaches}} Earth; McGeezax cloaks his ship and drags Stan out of sight as a hostage, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers' questions. The officers say that McGeezax stole a large sum of space cash, but no one admits to seeing him, and the officers leave. Randy then provides a diversion for McGeezax while Stan, at Randy's insistence, stabs him to death with <b>a</b> <b>shank.</b> McGeezax's ship is found to contain the stolen space cash, but instead of returning it, Randy persuades everyone to divide it among themselves. Randy, in contact with all world leaders, buys other countries' silence by giving them a share. Four days later, the officers return to South Park. They now know that McGeezax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, but everyone denies finding any space cash.|$|E

25|$|Shanks are {{typically}} made from leather, plastic, cardstock, or layers of glue-hardened burlap. The flexibility of <b>a</b> <b>shank</b> {{is determined by}} its thickness {{and the type of}} material used. A shank's thickness may be consistent throughout or it may vary along its length to produce different strengths at select points. For example, slits may be cut across <b>a</b> <b>shank</b> at demi-pointe to enhance roll through. Also, a shank's thickness may transition at some point along its length in order to implement differing strengths above and below the transition. Standard pointe shoes typically have a full shank, in which the shank runs the full length of the sole, or fractional (e.g., half or three-quarter) length shanks. Many pointe shoe manufacturers offer a choice of shank materials, and some will build shoes with customized shanks of varying stiffness and length.|$|E

60|$|In {{addition}} to the harpoon every swordfish fisherman carries a lance. This implement is precisely similar to a whaleman's lance, except that it is smaller, consisting of a lanceolate blade perhaps one inch wide and two inches long, upon the end of <b>a</b> <b>shank</b> of five-eighths-inch iron, perhaps two or three feet in length, fastened in the ordinary way upon a pole fifteen to eighteen feet in length.|$|E

50|$|Different {{manufacturers}} have produced machines {{with one of}} three types of presser foot shank in mind. These are the low shank, high shank, and the slant <b>shank</b> presser foot. <b>A</b> low <b>shank</b> presser foot has a 0.5 in distance {{from the bottom of}} the foot to the center of the thumbscrew; <b>a</b> high <b>shank</b> foot has <b>a</b> 1 in distance; <b>a</b> slant <b>shank</b> foot is distinctly slanted. The kind of foot a given machine requires is not interchangeable: a low-shank machine will only accept <b>a</b> low <b>shank</b> presser foot, and <b>a</b> high <b>shank</b> machine only <b>a</b> high-shank presser foot, though within these categories any low shank or high shank foot will fit any corresponding low shank or high <b>shank</b> machine; exceptionally, <b>a</b> slant <b>shank</b> foot can only be used with a Singer slant needle machine and no other (likewise, such a machine can accept no other kind of foot).|$|R

6000|$|When {{they were}} {{out of sight of the}} King and his party, the {{musician}} wished to enter into conversation with his companions, and addressed himself first to Fenella with a broad compliment of, [...] "By the mass, ye dance rarely--ne'er a slut on the boards shows such <b>a</b> <b>shank!</b> I would be content to play to you till my throat were as dry as my whistle. Come, be a little free--old Rowley will not quit the Park till nine. I will carry you to Spring-Garden, and bestow sweet-cakes and a quart of Rhenish on both of you; and we'll be cameradoes,--What the devil? no answer?--How's this, brother?--Is this neat wench of yours deaf or dumb or both? I should laugh at that, and she trip it so well to the flageolet." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then they {{determined}} to return home. As with beating hearts {{they approached the}} old city, their birthplace, and gazed with moistened eyes upon its tall spires and grim pagodas, its verdant meads and venerable groves, they saw a Kanjar,[FN#142] who, having tied up in a bundle the skin and bones of a tiger which he had found dead, {{was about to go}} on his way. Then said the thief to the gambler, [...] "Take we these remains with us, and by means of them prove the truth of our science before the people of Gaur, to the offence of their noses.[FN#143]" [...] Being now possessed of knowledge, they resolved to apply it to its proper purpose, namely, power over the property of others. Accordingly, the wencher, the gambler, and the atheist kept the Kanjar in conversation whilst the thief vivified <b>a</b> <b>shank</b> bone; and the bone thereupon stood upright, and hopped about in so grotesque and wonderful a way that the man, being frightened, fled as if I had been close behind him.|$|E
50|$|In some {{sports and}} {{specific}} classes, amputees can use prosthetic limbs. This {{is true in}} athletics for leg amputees. These have different designs based on where the amputation occurs. Blades for above the knee amputees have four parts: a socket, a knee, <b>a</b> <b>shank</b> and a foot, while blades for below the knee amputees have three: a socket, <b>a</b> <b>shank</b> and a foot.|$|E
50|$|Threaded {{fasteners}} {{either have}} <b>a</b> tapered <b>shank</b> or <b>a</b> non-tapered <b>shank.</b> Fasteners with tapered shanks {{are designed to}} either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with <b>a</b> non-tapered <b>shank</b> are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.|$|R
50|$|The flats of <b>a</b> hex <b>shank</b> {{can either}} be {{machined}} on <b>a</b> round <b>shank,</b> as in the photograph, or be the natural flats of hex bar stock. <b>A</b> hex <b>shank</b> can be grasped by a 3-jaw drill chuck or held in a chuck specifically for hex shanks.
