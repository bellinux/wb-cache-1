40|$|When crude, radiolabeled {{extracts}} {{of various}} cells {{were applied to}} homogeneous simian virus 40 small t antigen-Sepharose adsorbents, three cell proteins (57, 32, and 20 kilodaltons [kDa]) bound specifically. Each also bound to an insoluble, truncated t derivative composed of the COOH-terminal 123 residues of the protein. The binding of these proteins was greatly inhibited after reduction and alkylation of the t ligand. Therefore, some element of native conformation, {{but not all of}} the primary structure of t, is necessary for this binding property, which may constitute a discrete, in vitro biochemical function of this protein. Results of cell fractionation experiments suggested that the 57 - and 32 -kDa proteins are nonnuclear cell constituents, whereas the 20 -kDa protein was closely associated with a detergent-washed nuclear fraction. Specific immunoblotting and comparative partial proteolytic digestion analyses indicated that the 57 -kDa protein is tubulin, a major component of the cytoskeleton. In this regard, t and tubulin were observed to coimmunoprecipitate from crude cell extracts after incubation with monospecific <b>anti-t</b> <b>antibody.</b> Therefore, it is possible that t and tubulin interact in vivo...|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} ultrastructural {{study has}} been carried out on the lesions that are induced in vitro in guinea-pig spermatozoa by the action of auto-antispermatozoa antibodies and complement. The responsibility of three-independent autoantigen-autoantibody systems (S, P and T) has been explored. The only <b>anti-T</b> <b>antibody</b> known to fix complement and to be spermotoxic (T is a membrane-linked autoantigen), caused significant and important lesions, the immunologically specific origin of which was demonstrated. These lesions began a few seconds after complement had been added. The cytoplasmic membrane is first involved, then the acrosomal membranes, and then the acrosomal contents are lysed. The remarkable rapidity of action of complement on the antibody-sensitized target is emphasized. A typical dose-effect curve is obtained with dilutions of anti-T immune sera. Non-C 1 -fixing anti-S as well as C 1 -fixing anti-P antibodies (P {{has been shown to be}} intra-acrosomal) do not provoke any significant lesions, even in the presence fo complement, as compared to normal and various controls. However, anti-P serum, when added to non-damaging dilutions of anti-T in the presence of complement, was able to provoke significant lesions in the acrosomes. The bearing of these findings on the mechanisms of in vivo lesions is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{patients}} with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had differing T cell T 4 +/T 8 + ratios and that the ratio correlated with clinical features of the disease. In the present study, we wished to determine whether the peripheral blood T cell subsets in these patients were related to the specificity of <b>anti-T</b> cell <b>antibodies</b> found in their plasma. Plasma from 24 SLE patients that reacted with greater than 20 % of normal T cells were analyzed for their effect on in vitro pokeweed mitogen-stimulated immunoglobulin synthesis and for their reactivity with human T 4 + and T 8 + cells. <b>Anti-T</b> cell <b>antibodies</b> found in SLE patients have a spectrum of reactivities. We concentrated upon antibodies that interfere with suppressor function. One group of SLE <b>anti-T</b> cell <b>antibodies</b> reacts preferentially with the T 8 + suppressor effector cell whereas another is reactive with T 4 + suppressor inducer subsets. SLE patients with high T 4 +/T 8 + ratios had <b>anti-T</b> cell <b>antibodies</b> predominantly reactive with the T 8 + suppressor effector cells. Patients with low T 4 +/T 8 + ratios, on the other hand, had <b>anti-T</b> cell <b>antibodies</b> reactive with either the T 4 + suppressor inducer or with both the T 4 + suppressor inducer and T 8 + suppressor effector cells. In addition, a fourth group was defined whose <b>anti-T</b> cell <b>antibodies</b> were neither reactive with a functional T 4 + suppressor inducer nor a functional T 8 + suppressor effector cells. There was a significant correlation between the circulating T 4 +/T 8 + ratio of peripheral T cells in these patients and the relative ability of their <b>anti-T</b> cell <b>antibodies</b> to kill T 8 + cells vs. T 4 + cells (gamma = 0. 666, P less than 0. 001). These results support the notion that in SLE different cellular defects in the immunoregulatory circuit underlie the development of autoimmune reactions and that the <b>anti-T</b> cell <b>antibodies</b> may cause numerical and functional deficiencies in T cell subsets...|$|R

In contrast to anti-T 3 or <b>anti-T</b> 8 mAbs, <b>antibodies</b> to T 11 molecules inhibited the cytolytic activity of MLC-derived allospecific clones in a uniform manner. In addition, <b>anti-T</b> 11 <b>antibodies</b> inhibited the specific activity of CTL clones resistant to <b>anti-T</b> 3 <b>antibodies,</b> even after antibody-induced modulation of T 3 molecules (while anti-T 3 mAbs had no effect).

40|$|Biological {{properties}} of two strains of simian virus 40 (SV 40) from brains of two patients with {{progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy}} (PML) have been compared to those of a standard laboratory strain of SV 40. Infectivity of both SV 40 -PML viruses was resistant to treatment with chloroform, low pH, and 50 C for 120 min. African green monkey kidney and BSC- 1 cells were the most sensitive for viral replication, and cytopathology in these cultures was indistinguishable from that caused by SV 40. Both viruses formed plaques in these cells. but, in African green monkey kidney cells, strain 1 virus produced plaques measuring 2 mm in diameter whereas strain 2 virus produced pleomorphic plaques varying from 1 to 10 mm in diameter. Hamster cells were not permissive for viral replication, and infection resulted only in viral transformation. Inoculation of human fetal glial cells resulted in a permissive lytic infection of one cell type and a persistent infection with only partial expression of the viral genome in the other. No morphological evidence of transformation {{was evident in the}} latter cells. Both strains of SV 40 -PML viruses were neutralized by commercial anti-SV 40 serum, but in reciprocal kinetic neutralization tests differences in K values were noted when each was compared to SV 40. Both viruses showed oncogenicity for hamsters, producing undifferentiated sarcomas when injected subcutaneously and choroid plexus papillomas after intracerebral inoculation. All hamster tumor cells contained intranuclear immunofluorescent tumor antigen. This was indistinguishable from SV 40 T antigen in reciprocal staining reactions using hamster <b>anti-T</b> <b>antibody</b> induced by the two SV 40 -PML agents and SV 40.

All patients had normal levels of peripheral blood neutrophils, normal bone marrow cellularity, and a normal myeloid-erythroid ratio. Both peripheral blood- and bone marrow-derived CFU-G,M were markedly reduced compared with normal controls and bone marrow donors [5 +/- 1 / 10 (6) vs. 37 +/- 4 / 10 (6) (P less than 0. 001) and 23 +/- 5 / 2 x 10 (5) vs. 170 +/- 21 / 2 x 10 (5) (P less than 0. 001) ]. Five patients had no detectable CFU-G,M even when 10 (6) bone marrow cels were plated. These abnormalities of CFU-G,M were unrelated to age, sex, diagnosis, conditioning regimen, dose of bone marrow cells transplanted, and {{presence or absence of}} graft-vs. -host disease. Patients who received either autotransplants or transplants from identical twins also had decreased or absent CFU-G,M indicating that allogeneic factors and posttransplant immune suppressor with methotrexate or corticosteroids were not major determinants of this abnormality. Co-culture of normal or donor peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells with recipients peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells, purified T cells, or serum failed to show any evidence of active CFU-G,M suppression. Furthermore, the abnormality of CFU-G,M could not be corrected by the addition of normal syngeneic (donor) hematopoietic cells or serum. Depletion of T-cells from recipient bone marrow by physical techniques resulted in marked increase in CFU-G,M (36 +/- 13 vs. 138 +/- 36; P less than 0. 05). The abnormality could be reproduced in vitro by readdition of autologous T cells. In contrast to results with T cell depletion by physical techniques, T cell depletion with a monoclonal <b>anti-T</b> <b>antibody</b> (B 7) and complement had no effect. These data indicate that most-transplant recipients have a marked abnormality in CFU-G,M when these cells are cultured in vitro.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{monoclonal}} <b>anti-T</b> 3 <b>antibodies</b> on the effector phase of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were studied {{with respect to}} antigen-specific and antigen-nonspecific lysis of different target cells. <b>Anti-T</b> 3 <b>antibodies</b> inhibited the antigen-specific lysis by CTL generated in mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), but they concomitantly augmented the nonspecific killing of third-party cells such as the cell lines Daudi, Raji, and K 562. This nonspecific cytotoxicity was induced by various <b>anti-T</b> 3 <b>antibodies,</b> whereas antibodies reactive with other antigens expressed on the cytotoxic effector cells lacked any such activity. <b>Anti-T</b> 3 <b>antibodies</b> induced nonspecific cytotoxicity only when activated T cells, obtained by primary MLC, by repeated restimulation, or after cloning, were used.

The inhibition of the antigen-specific lysis and the induction of nonspecific lysis by anti-T 3 was dose dependent, and both effects occurred at the same concentration range of anti-T 3. F(ab') 2 fragments of anti-T 3 inhibited the specific lysis but were not able to induce cytotoxic activity, indicating that this induction is an Fc-dependent process. When different target cells were tested, only Fc receptor-positive cells were susceptible for this nonspecific cytotoxicity.

40|$|Aim: Toxoplasmosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} zoonotic parasitic diseases worldwide. Infection is not only acquired by contact with the definitive host, but also by ingestion of raw milk and milk products. The aim of the study was to detect T. gondii DNA in milk samples, and to estimate <b>anti-T.</b> gondii <b>antibodies</b> in pregnant women for the analysis of the associated risk factors. Materials and Methods: The study involved molecular examination of 150 milk samples collected from rural settings at Sharkia, Egypt. Seroprevalence of <b>anti-T.</b> gondii <b>antibodies</b> was determined in 100 pregnant women by indirect haemagglutination test. The analysis of risk factors associated with seropositive results was assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: T. gondii DNA was detected in 8...|$|R
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii (Nicolle et Manceaux, 1909) is an {{obligatory}} intracellular protozoan parasite of warm animals, including {{human and}} non-human primates. Domestic and wild felids are considered definitive hosts. Several authors have already identified lesions in New World primates caused by T. gondii. Nevertheless, {{little is known}} about serological studies on those animals. With this reason, New World non-human primates of the genera Cebus and Callithrix that were apprehended by governmental authorities and sent to the Wildlife Screening Center (Cetas) /IBAMA, at the municipality of Seropédica, state of Rio Janeiro, were bled and sera were submitted to the indirect hemagglutination test for detection of <b>anti-T.</b> gondii <b>antibodies.</b> From 21 sera of Cebus primates, 76. 19 % (16 / 21) had <b>anti-T.</b> gondii <b>antibodies.</b> Titles varied from 16 to 2048. In samples from 21 Callithrix, only 4. 5 % (1 / 22) had <b>anti-T.</b> gondii <b>antibodies.</b> Only one animal had a title of 32. During all the time those animals were clinical evaluated until sample was collected; none of them had any clinical sign or sequel related to infection by T. gondii. The fact that the origin of these primates is unknown and that there is no information about their feeding habits before captivity makes it difficult to determine the source of T. gondii infection...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} and {{risk factors for}} anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were investigated in goats of the Serido Oriental microregion, Rio Grande do Norte state, Northeast region of Brazil. Three hundred and sixty-six blood samples from goats collected by jugular venopuncture were used. For the serologic diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infection, the indirect fluorescent-anti body test (IFAT) with cut-off value 1 : 64 was carried out. The prevalence of <b>anti-T.</b> gondii <b>antibodies</b> was 30. 6 % [95 % CI = 25. 9 - 35. 6 %] with titers ranging from 1 : 64 to 1 : 16, 384.

40|$|Abstract. Schizophrenia is a {{pervasive}} neuropsychiatric disease of unknown cause. Previous {{studies have reported}} that toxoplasmosis may be a possible cause of schizophrenia. To ascertain possible relationship between Toxoplasma gondii and schizophrenia, a cross sectional study, employing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to study the seroprevalence of <b>anti-T.</b> gondii IgG <b>antibody</b> in schizophrenic patients. Furthermore, demographic data analysis from schizophrenic patients were analysed to associate toxoplasmosis with schizophrenia. A total of 288 serum samples from schizophrenic patients (n= 144) and psychiatrically healthy volunteers (n= 144) were recruited in this study. Interestingly, a significant result in the serointensity rate of <b>anti-T.</b> gondii IgG <b>antibody</b> (> 60 IU/mL) in schizophrenic patients (61. 1 %) was demonstrated as compared to psychiatrically healthy volunteers (40. 8 %) (X 2 = 4. 236, p < 0. 050). However, {{there was no significant}} difference between the seropositivity rate of <b>anti-T.</b> gondii IgG <b>antibody</b> between the two groups. Analysis from demographic data revealed that the seropositivity rate of <b>anti-T.</b> gondii IgG <b>antibody</b> in schizophrenic patients was significantly associated with age group of more than 40 years old (p= 0. 007) and between ethnic (p= 0. 046).

40|$|The {{influence}} of activators of protein kinase C (PKC) on {{the delivery of}} the lethal hit by human cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones was studied. In the absence of other signals, short-term incubation with two structurally unrelated activators of PKC, but not with a non-activating phorbolester, resulted in significant triggering of CTL, whereas overnight incubation with PKC activators led to reduction of cytotoxic activity. Furthermore, activation of PKC had an inhibitory effect on simultaneous triggering by <b>anti-T</b> 3 monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> or by phytohaemagglutinin, but strongly enhanced the activating effect of <b>anti-T</b> 11 <b>antibodies.</b> These results suggest that PKC {{is part of the}} cascade of signals transmitted within a CTL after triggering...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Toxoplasma gondii infects {{humans in}} several manners {{including}} by the gastrointestinal tract where a- 2 -L-fucosyltransferase (FUTII) coded by the FUT 2 gene (19 q 13. 3) controls {{the expression of}} the ABH glycoconjugate profile. The presence of functional FUTII defines the secretor phenotype which is associated with ABO erythrocytic phenotypes. Due to the epidemiological and clinical importance of T gondii infection, the aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that the ABH glycoconjugate profile expressed in the gastrointestinal tract is associated with the presence of antibodies against this parasite. Material and methods: A total of 367 pregnant women from the High-Risk Pregnancy Clinic of the University Hospital de Base in Sao Jose do Rio Preto were enrolled in this study. Two blood samples were drawn with only one being mixed with anticoagulant. ABO erythrocytic phenotyping and detection of <b>anti-T</b> gondii <b>antibodies</b> were achieved by the haemagglutination test. Identification of the secretor status used the PCR-RFLP method. Results: Differences in the ABO erythrocytic phenotypes (P= 0. 20) and secretor and nonsecretor phenotypes (P= 0. 41), either in isolation or in association, were not statistically significant with respect to {{the presence or absence of}} <b>anti-T</b> gondii <b>antibodies.</b> Conclusions: These results suggest that the ABH glycoconjugate profile expressed in the gastrointestinal tract under regulation of the FUT 2 gene is not associated with <b>anti-T</b> gondii <b>antibodies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Pooled normal polyspecific IgG for {{therapeutic}} use (IVIg) contain anti-idiotypes against idiotypic determinants expressed by autoantibodies from {{patients with a}} variety of autoimmune diseases. In the present study, antiidiotypes in IVIg are shown to recognize a cross-reactive idiotype on human anti-thyroglobulin (TG) autoantibodies, that was defined by heterologous antiidiotypic <b>antibodies,</b> termed <b>anti-T</b> 44 <b>antibodies.</b> The T 44 idiotype is located outside the antibody-combining site of anti-TG autoantibodies. F(ab') 2 fragments from <b>anti-T</b> 44 <b>antibodies</b> inhibited the binding of IVIg to affinity-purified F(ab') 2 anti-TG autoantibodies. <b>Anti-T</b> 44 <b>antibodies</b> bound to F(ab') 2 fragments of patients' antibodies, which were retained on an affinity column of Sepharose-bound F(ab') 2 fragments from IVIg, but not to F(ab') 2 fragments from the effluent of the column. The T 44 idiotype was expressed on antibodies that bound to IVIg from eight of nine patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, but not on IVIg-binding Igs from healthy individuals. A small amount of the T 44 idiotype was also expressed on the fraction of IVIg that bound to itself upon affinity chromatography. The T 44 idiotype was cross-reactive between antibodies from patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. Thus, IVIg contain antiidiotypic antibodies directed against an immunodominant disease-associated cross-reactive alpha-idiotype of human anti-TG autoantibodies. These results support the concept that IVIg may be beneficial in selected autoimmune diseases by modulating the function of the idiotypic network...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{relevance}} of consuming raw or undercooked beef in {{the transmission of}} toxoplasmosis is unclear due to the high resistance of cattle to infection. However, this possibility needs {{to be considered in}} endemic areas, such as the Amazon, where the consumption of beef is frequent. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the frequency of anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies in beef cattle slaughtered in the metropolitan region of Belem, Pará state, Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 500 animals of both genders in a licensed slaughterhouse in Belém. <b>Anti-T.</b> gondii IgG <b>antibodies</b> were detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with a cut-off titer of 1 : 64. <b>Anti-T.</b> gondii <b>antibodies</b> were found in 203 animals (40. 6 %), with a titer of 64 in 112 animals (55. 2 %), 128 in 68 animals (33. 5 %), 256 in 15 animals (7. 4 %), 512 in 5 animals (2. 5 %), and 1, 024 in 3 animals (1. 4 %). No significant difference was observed between males and females (p > 0. 05). The high frequency of <b>anti-T.</b> gondii <b>antibodies</b> observed in beef cattle slaughtered in Belém indicates that the meat of these animals may be an important source of infection for humans and carnivorous domestic animals when inadequately cooked beef is consumed...|$|R
