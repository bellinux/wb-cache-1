40|$|Augmentation {{of solar}} {{radiation}} absorbed {{on a flat}} plate solar thermal collector by a flat plate bottom reflector was numerically determined {{when there was a}} gap between the collector <b>and</b> <b>reflector.</b> The inclination of both the collector <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> was assumed to be adjustable according to the season. A mirror-symmetric plane of the collector to the <b>reflector</b> was introduced, <b>and</b> a graphical model was proposed to calculate the amount of solar radiation reflected by the <b>reflector</b> <b>and</b> then absorbed on the collector. The performance was analyzed for three typical days at a latitude of 30 °N. Solar radiation absorbed on the collector can be increased by the bottom reflector even if there is a gap between the collector <b>and</b> <b>reflector.</b> The optimum inclinations of both the collector <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> are almost the same while the gap length is less than the lengths of the collector <b>and</b> <b>reflector.</b> However, the range of inclination of the reflector that can increase the solar radiation absorbed on the collector decreases with an increase in gap length, and the solar radiation absorbed on the collector rapidly decreased with an increase in the gap length when the reflector and/or collector were not set at a proper angle...|$|R

40|$|In the CNGS (Cern Neutrino to Gran Sasso) {{installation}} two magnetic lenses, {{namely the}} horn <b>and</b> the <b>reflector,</b> focus the secondary beam {{generated in the}} target station. The gap between the horn <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> is chosen to optimize a wide-band high-energy muon-neutrino beam. These two focusing elements are two coaxial lenses: the outer conductor has a cylindrical shape whereas the inner conductor consists of a sequence of conical shapes to optimize the focusing capacity. The evaluation of the heat load on the support structures is crucial since modifications in the elements around the horn <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> are under way and the support structures {{can be adapted to}} the heat load found. Furthermore, the heat load in the whole horn area has been evaluated to optimize the cooling-ventilation system. The energy deposited on the horn <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> as well as on their adjacent elements has been estimated using the FLUKA Monte Carlo package and results are presented in this paper. The FLUKA geometry input of the horn <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> electrical connections has been notably improved in order to accommodate the detailed striplines design to the thermal expansion...|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} {{we present a}} {{theoretical}} analysis of a solar thermal collector with a flat plate top reflector. The top reflector extends from the upper edge of the collector, and can be inclined forwards or backwards from vertical according to the seasons. We theoretically predicted the daily solar radiation absorbed on an absorbing plate of the collector throughout the year, which varies considerably with the inclination of both the collector <b>and</b> <b>reflector,</b> <b>and</b> is slightly affected by {{the ratio of the}} <b>reflector</b> <b>and</b> collector length. We found the optimum inclination of the collector <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> for each month at 30 Â°N latitude. An increase in the daily solar radiation absorbed on the absorbing plate over a conventional solar thermal collector would average about 19 %, 26 % and 33 % throughout the year by using the flat plate reflector when the ratio of <b>reflector</b> <b>and</b> collector length is 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 and both the collector <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> are adjusted to the proper inclination.

40|$|There {{the study}} objecst are the fibrous metal-composition materials, {{which have been}} {{reinforced}} by the continuous and discrete fibres. The paper purpose is to study the influence of pressure at the crystallization on the wettability of reinforcing fibres by the matrix melt for the making of industrial production process of shape castings in the metal-composition materials. The effective protective coat of carbon fibres against the burn-out {{of them at the}} heating in the oxidizing medium has been found. The improvement of fibre wettability by the metal melts under the influence of pressure at the crystallization has been showed by experiment for the first time. The influence of starting state of alloy on the wettability has been ascertained. The production process as the press-die casting with the crystallization has been developed for the Reflector parts of aerials of space communication in the metal-composition materials, for seven type sizes of pistons in the aluminium alloys and in the magnesium alloys, which have been reinforced by the fibres in the carbon, in the bazalt and in the mullite-silica. The pistons <b>and</b> the <b>aerials</b> of space communication passed the tests successfully, the experimental batches of articles have been produced. One from the pistons has been accepted for the quantity production. The application field is the production of metal-composition pistons, of connecting rods, of <b>aerial</b> <b>reflectors</b> <b>and</b> of other parts, which operate at the risen temperatures and at the risen loadsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
