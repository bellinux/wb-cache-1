50|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1896, Marić {{switched}} to the Zurich Polytechnic (later Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH)), having passed the mathematics entrance examination with an average grade of 4.25 (scale 1-6). She enrolled for the diploma course to teach physics and mathematics in secondary schools (section VIA) {{at the same time}} as Albert Einstein. She was the only woman in her group of six students, and the fifth woman to enter that section, an impressive feat at a time when women were not usually admitted. She would have had to have been extraordinarily talented to overcome the restrictions on the admission of women. She and Einstein became close friends quite soon. In October Marić went to Heidelberg to study at Heidelberg University for the winter semester 1897/98, attending physics and mathematics lectures as an auditor. She rejoined the Zurich Polytechnic in April 1898, where her studies included the following courses: differential and integral calculus, descriptive and projective geometry, mechanics, theoretical <b>physics,</b> <b>applied</b> <b>physics,</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>physics,</b> and astronomy.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis focuses {{on the study of}} chaotic transport in phase space applied to the analysis of ionization in two different atomic systems. The first system consists of an atom exposed to periodic alternating positive and negative external electric field pulses, and the second system consists of an atom placed in constant external electric and magnetic fields. The main goal of this thesis is to develop a connection between the general mathematical constructs of a dynamical system, and an atomic experiment. As such, this research acts as a bridge between the areas of <b>applied</b> math and <b>experimental</b> <b>physics</b> [...] Abstract...|$|R
50|$|In 1897 Beattie was {{appointed}} as Professor of <b>Applied</b> Mathematics and <b>Experimental</b> <b>Physics</b> at the South African College in Cape Town. Beattie’s research included {{the influence of}} X-rays, ultra-violet light, and the rays from uranium on the electrical conductivity of gases, and the leakage of electricity from charged bodies at moderate temperatures. During the Anglo-Boer War in February 1899, he and others demonstrated the application of wireless telegraphy by transmitting signals over a distance of 120 metres on Cape Town's Grand Parade using equipment imported from Britain. In 1901 he began a magnetic survey of South Africa. Starting in 1908 he extended the survey through central Africa to Egypt, arriving in Cairo in December 1909.|$|R
50|$|Sir John Carruthers Beattie (born 1866, died 1946) was {{the first}} {{principal}} and Vice Chancellor of the University of Cape Town from 1918 to 1937. He was born on 21 November 1866 in Waterbeck, Scotland. He graduated from Edinburgh University having studied at Munich, Vienna, Berlin and Glasgow. Soon afterwards he was appointed Professor of <b>Applied</b> Mathematics and <b>Experimental</b> <b>Physics</b> at South African College in Cape Town. He married Elizabeth Paton in 1898. They had two daughters and a son. The son who was killed while serving with the R.A.F. in 1942. For his contributions to education in South Africa, he was knighted in 1920. He died in Cape Town on 10 September 1946.|$|R
