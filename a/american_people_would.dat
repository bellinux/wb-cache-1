25|$|Eisenhower {{had warned}} Eden {{not to do}} it, saying the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> never approve of a {{military}} solution to the crisis. He threatened to use financial pressure unless the British withdrew from Egypt. Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. Eden had poor staff support because the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Colonial Office had been slow to realize the need for change in Britain's world role. After Suez they started to heed Treasury warnings about the effect of high defence expenditure on the economy, and the slow growth of the British population compared with the United States and the Soviet Union. Historians often use the crisis to mark the end of Britain's status as a superpower, being able to act and control international affairs without assistance or coalition.|$|E

He {{published an article}} in the April 1928 issue of Harper's Magazine called [...] "The Possibilities of Large Telescopes". [...] This article contained Hale's vision for building what was to become the 200-inch Palomar reflector; it was an invitation to the American public to learn about how large telescopes could help answer questions relating to the fundamental nature of the universe. Hale hoped that the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> understand and support his project.|$|E

British Carolina's power was damaged and the colony nearly destroyed during the Yamasee War of 1715-1717, after which the Native American slave trade was radically reformed.|$|R
2500|$|Instead of the 18-nation proposal, the United States {{proposed}} {{an association of}} canal users that would set rules for its operation. 14 of the other nations, not including Pakistan, agreed. Britain, in particular, believed that violation of the association rules would result in military force, but after Eden made a speech to this effect in parliament on 12 September, the US ambassador Dulles insisted [...] "we {{do not intend to}} shoot our way through" [...] the canal. The United States worked hard through diplomatic channels to resolve the crisis without resorting to conflict. [...] "The British and French reluctantly agreed to pursue the diplomatic avenue but viewed it as merely an attempt to buy time, during which they continued their military preparations." [...] The British, Washington's closest ally, ignored Eisenhower's pointed warning that the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> not accept a military solution.|$|E
2500|$|FairTax {{supporters}} {{assert that}} the proposal would make the cost of federal government highly visible as consumers would see most of this cost in a single tax paid every time they purchase a good or service. Under the current tax system, the federal government collects revenue through {{a wide variety of}} taxes on individuals and businesses. Thus the cost of government is spread out among many different avenues and may not be fully visible to individual citizens. For example, corporate taxes and compliance costs are passed partially from producers to final consumers when producers include those costs in the retail price of goods and services. The use of income tax withholding has also reduced the visibility of taxes. The U.S. Department of Treasury describes (in the history of the income tax) that withholding [...] "greatly reduced the taxpayer's awareness of the amount of tax being collected, i.e. it reduced the transparency of the tax, which made it easier to raise taxes in the future." [...] Proponents claim that the FairTax would greatly reduce, if not eliminate, the [...] "K Street tax lobbyist's" [...] ability to influence legislators to manipulate the U.S. tax code for the benefit of their clients. The FairTax legislation does not prevent future changes by Congress, however, due to the transparency of the FairTax, the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be aware of changes to the tax base from exemptions because a change in tax rate would likely be reflected. [...] Congressman John Linder, the bill sponsor, is considering adding language to H.R. 25 during the 111th Congress that would require a supermajority vote of Congress to exempt any industry from the tax.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Wyden {{was one of}} 10 {{senators}} to vote against re-authorization of the Patriot Act. In 2011, with the expiration of the Patriot Act approaching and with efforts to reauthorize the Act once more intensifying, Wyden and fellow Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley sharply criticized the rush to pass the bill. Wyden stated on the Senate floor that [...] "The Patriot Act was passed a decade ago {{during a period of}} understandable fear. Now is the time to revisit this, revisit it and ensure that a better job is done of striking that balance between fighting terror and protecting individual liberty." [...] Wyden and Merkley expressed particular concern with a provision of current law allowing law enforcement authorities to collect [...] "a vast array of business records, emails, phone numbers, [...] even DNA from anyone deemed 'relevant' to an investigation." [...] Wyden offered an amendment to reform the [...] "business-records provision" [...] of the Patriot Act, which he views as being used in an abusive and secret way. In a May 2011 speech in the Senate, Wyden sharply criticized the use of Patriot Act, stating: [...] "The fact is that anyone can read the plain text of the Patriot Act, and yet many members of Congress have no idea how the law is being secretly interpreted by the executive branch, because that interpretation is classified. It's almost as if there were two Patriot Acts, and many members of Congress have not read the one that matters. Our constituents, of course, are totally in the dark. Members of the public have no access to the secret legal interpretations, so they have no idea what their government believes the law actually means." [...] In an interview for the documentary [...] Wyden was asked about legal reviews and the scope of potential assassinations (or [...] "targeted killings") of American citizens by their government, and responded that [...] "the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be extraordinarily surprised if they could see the difference between what they believe a law says and how it has actually been interpreted in secret," [...] but that he [...] "is not permitted" [...] to disclose the difference publicly.|$|E

6000|$|MR. JUSTICE TALFOURD,[D] having {{spoken of}} the {{literature}} of England and America, alluded to two distinguished authors then present. The one was a lady, who had shed a lustre on the literature of America, and whose works were deeply engraven on every English heart. He spoke particularly of the consecration of so much genius to so noble a cause--the cause of humanity; and expressed the confident hope that the great <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> see and remedy the wrongs so vividly depicted. The learned judge, having paid an eloquent tribute to the works of Mr. Charles Dickens, concluded by proposing [...] "Mr. Charles Dickens and {{the literature of the}} Anglo-Saxons." ...|$|E

[...] The words fell {{from his lips}} with a fine {{unexpected}} austerity which imposed itself, producing a momentary silence, {{and it is a}} sign of Gaston's complete emancipation that he didn't in his heart resent this image of eventual favours denied his race. The resentment was rather Delia's, but she kept it to herself, for she was capable of reflecting with complacency that the key of the house would after all be hers, so that she could open the door for the Proberts if the Proberts should knock. Now that her sister's marriage was really to take place her consciousness that the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> have been resoundingly told so was still more agreeable. The party left the Hotel de l'Univers et de Cheltenham on the morrow, but it appeared to the German waiter, as he accepted another five-franc piece from the happy and now reckless Gaston, that they were even yet not at all clear as to where they were going.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{all other}} Panthera species, jaguars very rarely attack humans. However, jaguar attacks {{appear to be}} on the rise with {{increased}} human encroachment on their habitat and a decrease in prey populations. Sometimes jaguars in captivity attack zookeepers. In addition, it appears that attacks on humans had been more common in the past, at least after Conquistadors arrived in the Americas, {{to the extent that the}} jaguar had a fearsome reputation in the Americas, akin to the lion and tiger in the Old World. Nevertheless, even in those times, the jaguar's chief prey was the capybara, not the human, and Charles Darwin reported a saying of Native <b>Americans</b> that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> not have to fear the jaguar much, as long as capybaras were abundant.|$|R
