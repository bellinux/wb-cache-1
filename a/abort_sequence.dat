40|$|The Ares Real-Time Environment for Modeling, Integration, and Simulation (ARTEMIS) {{has been}} {{developed}} {{for use by the}} Ares I launch vehicle System Integration Laboratory (SIL) at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The primary purpose of the Ares SIL is to test the vehicle avionics hardware and software in a hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) environment to certify that the integrated system is prepared for flight. ARTEMIS has been designed to be the real-time software backbone to stimulate all required Ares components through high-fidelity simulation. ARTEMIS has been designed {{to take full advantage of}} the advances in underlying computational power now available to support HWIL testing. A modular real-time design relying on a fully distributed computing architecture has been achieved. Two fundamental requirements drove ARTEMIS to pursue the use of high-fidelity simulation models in a real-time environment. First, ARTEMIS must be used to test a man-rated integrated avionics hardware and software system, thus requiring a wide variety of nominal and off-nominal simulation capabilities to certify system robustness. The second driving requirement - derived from a nationwide review of current state-of-the-art HWIL facilities - was that preserving digital model fidelity significantly reduced overall vehicle lifecycle cost by reducing testing time for certification runs and increasing flight tempo through an expanded operational envelope. These two driving requirements necessitated the use of high-fidelity models throughout the ARTEMIS simulation. The nature of the Ares mission profile imposed a variety of additional requirements on the ARTEMIS simulation. The Ares I vehicle is composed of multiple elements, including the First Stage Solid Rocket Booster (SRB), the Upper Stage powered by the J- 2 X engine, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) which houses the crew, the Launch Abort System (LAS), and various secondary elements that separate from the vehicle. At launch, the integrated vehicle stack is composed of these stages, and throughout the mission, various elements separate from the integrated stack and tumble back towards the earth. ARTEMIS must be capable of simulating the integrated stack through the flight as well as propagating each individual element after separation. In addition, <b>abort</b> <b>sequences</b> can lead to other unique configurations of the integrated stack as the timing and sequence of the stage separations are altered...|$|R

As PMEs, na década de 90, passaram a ser o {{principal}} alvo de desenvolvimento mercadológico para os fornecedores de ERPs. Tendo em vista que os mercados consumidores formados estavam saturados, abriu-se, então, esse novo nicho. Por outro lado as PMEs, como as demais empresas, viviam à época o risco eminente do bug do milênio e, por isso mesmo, acenaram positivamente para tal investida. A ânsia de solução para o referido bug, aliada às expectativas de sensíveis avanços tecnológicos em suas estruturas empresariais, levou alguns empresários a agir rapidamente e optar, em sua grande maioria, pela adoção do ERP, sem antes proceder à pesquisa de mercado sobre o produto, visitas a outras empresas que já tinham o sistema em operação e, principalmente, deixando de lado a estrutura do projeto-piloto. A falta destes procedimentos levou muitas empresas a abortarem seus projetos de adoção de ERP por não terem se preparado adequadamente para esta solução tecnológica, que por muitas vezes requer uma qualificação de mão-de-obra superior a que o adotante detém. O método adotado nesta pesquisa é o estudo de caso com aplicação de entrevistas e a observação. Os gastos financeiros na adoção de um ERP, normalmente, são altos e, ultimamente essa adoção tem sido bastante questionada no que se refere à importância deste software e sua aplicabilidade, avalia-se se o ERP tem gerado soluções para todos os segmentos empresariais, tanto na ótica dos custos da licença de uso quanto da implementação. O estudo de caso demonstrou ter havido uma grande fragilidade no momento da decisão pela adoção de ERP por parte do empresário, isto porque desconhecia as exigências do software para com a empresa bem como não se sabia ao certo como seria o funcionamento e os procedimentos requeridos/oferecidos por tal sistema. Verificou-se também um insucesso total na adoção do ERP pela empresa objeto deste estudo de caso, tanto assim que o projeto foi abortado e não se deu mais seqüência até o fechamento desta pesquisa. The PMEs, in {{the decade}} of 90, had started {{to be the main}} target of marketing development for the suppliers of ERPs, in view of that the formed consuming markets were saturated, confided, then, this new niche. On the other hand the PMEs, as the too much companies, lived to the time the eminent risk of bug of the millennium and, therefore, they had waved positively for such onslaught. The anxiety of solution for related bug, allied the expectations of sensible technological advances in its enterprise structures, took some entrepreneurs to act quickly and to opt, in its great majority, for the adoption of the ERP, without before proceeding to the market research on the product, visits to other companies who already had the system in operation and, mainly, leaving of side the structure of the project-pilot. The lack of these procedures took many companies to abort its projects of adoption of ERP for not having if prepared adequately for this technological solution, that for many times requires a qualification of superior man power the one that the adoptive one withholds. The method adopted in this research is the study of case with application of interviews and the comment. The financial expenses in the adoption of a ERP, normally, are high and, lately this adoption has been sufficiently questioned in that if it relates to the importance of this software and its applicability, is evaluated if the ERP has generated solutions for all the enterprise segments, as much in the optics of the costs of the license of use how much of the implementation.

40|$|This {{paper will}} present an {{overview}} of the flight test objectives and performance of the Orion Launch Abort System during Exploration Flight Test- 1. Exploration Flight Test- 1, the first flight test of the Orion spacecraft, was managed and led by the Orion prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, and launched atop a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. This flight test was a two-orbit, high-apogee, high-energy entry, low-inclination test mission used to validate and test systems critical to crew safety. This test included the first flight test of the Launch Abort System preforming Orion nominal flight mission critical objectives. NASA is currently designing and testing the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV). Orion will serve as NASA's new exploration vehicle to carry astronauts to deep space destinations and safely return them to earth. The Orion spacecraft is composed of four main elements: the Launch Abort System, the Crew Module, the Service Module, and the Spacecraft Adapter (Fig. 1). The Launch Abort System (LAS) provides two functions; during nominal launches, the LAS provides protection for the Crew Module from atmospheric loads and heating during first stage flight and during emergencies provides a reliable abort capability for aborts that occur within the atmosphere. The Orion Launch Abort System (LAS) consists of an Abort Motor to provide the abort separation from the Launch Vehicle, an Attitude Control Motor to provide attitude and rate control, and a Jettison Motor for crew module to LAS separation (Fig. 2). The jettison motor is used during a nominal launch to separate the LAS from the Launch Vehicle (LV) early in the flight of the second stage when it is no longer needed for aborts {{and at the end of}} an LAS <b>abort</b> <b>sequence</b> to enable deployment of the crew module's Landing Recovery System. The LAS also provides a Boost Protective Cover fairing that shields the crew module from debris and the aero-thermal environment during ascent. Although the Orion Program has tested a number of the critical systems of the Orion spacecraft on the ground, the launch environment cannot be replicated completely on Earth. A number of flight tests have been conducted and are planned to demonstrate the performance and enable certification of the Orion Spacecraft. Exploration Flight Test 1, the first flight test of the Orion spacecraft, was successfully flown on December 5, 2014 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex 37. Orion's first flight was a two-orbit, high-apogee, high-energy entry, low-inclination test mission used to validate and test systems critical to crew safety, such as heat shield performance, separation events, avionics and software performance, attitude control and guidance, parachute deployment and recovery operations. One of the key separation events tested during this flight was the nominal jettison of the LAS. Data from this flight will be used to verify the function of the jettison motor to separate the Launch Abort System from the crew module so it can continue on with the mission. The LAS nominal jettison event on Exploration Flight Test 1 occurred at six minutes and twenty seconds after liftoff (See Fig. 3). The abort motor and attitude control motors were inert for Exploration Flight Test 1, since the mission did not require abort capabilities. A suite of developmental flight instrumentation was included on the flight test to provide data on spacecraft subsystems and separation events. This paper will focus on the flight test objectives and performance of the LAS during ascent and nominal jettison. Selected LAS subsystem flight test data will be presented and discussed in the paper. Exploration Flight Test - 1 will provide critical data that will enable engineering to improve Orion's design and reduce risk for the astronauts it will protect as NASA continues to move forward on its human journey to Mars. The lessons learned from Exploration Flight Test 1 and the other Flight Test Vehicles will certainly contribute to the vehicle architecture of a human-rated space launch vehicle...|$|E
