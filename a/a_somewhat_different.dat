5|$|<b>A</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> {{design of}} cutting tool that can achieve the {{irregular}} hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching {{is that it does not}} require a broaching machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> DAG-based {{formulation}} of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of the}} first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E

This proof covers slightly different ground {{from the previous}} one in that it relates the real and imaginary parts in the frequency domain of any function that is causal in the time domain, offering <b>an</b> approach <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> from the condition of analyticity in the upper half plane of the frequency domain.|$|R

25|$|The {{conflict}} of Vandals and Sueves is also narrated by Gregory of Tours, {{who in the}} 6th century narrated the blockade, the death of Gunderic under unknown circumstances, and {{the resolution of the}} conflict in a champions' fight, with the defeated Vandals forced to leave Galicia. <b>A</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> history apparently was told among the Vandals, as Procopius wrote that in their traditions king Gunderic was captured and impaled by Germans in Spain.|$|E
25|$|Much of the removed content {{included}} passages where Churchill recounted his own experiences, as he {{had done}} in other works, such as The Story of the Malakand Field Force. This removal gave the revised book <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> feel to these others, and to its original form. Other removals included discussions on the ethics of warfare, Churchill's own opinions of events, and his assessment on Islam. The revised book was described as an authoritative history of the war.|$|E

Using a rather simple dynamical Hamiltonian model, vacuum excitations carrying helicities 0 and +/- 1 are discussed in connection with the dynamical stability of solutions. We speculate on how the rest masses of the light mesons pi^ 0, eta^ 0 and eta'^ 0 could be related to these excitations. Comment: 20 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
50|$|The See of Milan {{claimed the}} Apostle Barnabas as its founder, {{but this was}} disputed.
