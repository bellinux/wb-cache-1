While post-conflict countries ’ capacity to absorb aid (i. e., the quality of their policies and institutions) is built up only gradually after peace onset, the evidence suggests that aid tends to peak immediately after peace is attained and decline thereafter. Aid composition broadly reflects post-conflict priorities, with large parts of <b>aid</b> <b>financing</b> social expenditure and infrastructure investment. While moderate RER overvaluation is observed in post-conflicts, it cannot be traced down to the aid flows. The empirical evidence on world growth reveals new findings about the pattern of catch-up growth during post-conflicts and the role of key growth determinants on post-conflict growth. Aid is an important determinant of growth, both generally and more strongly during post-conflict periods. Because RER misalignment reduces growth, RER overvaluation during post-conflicts reduces catch-up growth. Aid and RER overvaluation combined also lower growth. However, the negative growth effect of RER overvaluation declines with financial development...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} seven {{challenges in}} development assistance for health, {{which in the}} current financial context, have become even more important to address. These include the following: (1) the proliferation of initiatives, focusing on specific diseases or issues, as well as (2) the lack of attention given to reforming the existing focal health institutions, the WHO and World Bank. (3) The lack of accountability of donors and their influence on priority-setting {{are part of the}} reason that there is "initiavitis," and resistance to creating a strong UN system.

Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. Since the turn of the century, aid flows to Africa have increased on average and become more volatile. As a result, policymakers, particularly in post-stabilization countries where inflation has only recently been brought under control, have been increasingly preoccupied with how best to deploy the available instruments of monetary policy without yielding on hard-won inflation gains. We use a stochastic simulation model, in which private sector currency substitution effects play a central role, to examine the properties of alternative monetary and fiscal policy strategies in the face of volatile aid flows. We show that simple monetary rules, specifically an (unsterilized) exchange rate crawl and a ‘reserve buffer plus float’-under which the authorities set a time-varying reserve target corresponding to the unspent portion of <b>aid</b> <b>financing</b> and allow the exchange rate to float freely once this reserve target is satisfied—have attractive properties relative to a range of alternative strategies including those involving heavy relianc...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{responds}} to the development policy debate involving the World Bank and the IMF {{on the use of}} fiscal policy not only for economic stabilization but also to promote growth and the increase of per capita income. A key issue in this debate relates to the effect of the composition of public expenditure, and its financing, on economic growth. The current paper lays out a research strategy to explore the effects of fiscal policy, including the composition of public expenditure, on economic growth, using a time series approach. Based on the modeling strategy by Greiner, Semmler and Gong (2005) we suggest a general model that includes (a) recurrent expenditure on education and health (which influences human capital), as well as expenditure on (b) public infrastructure investment, (c) transfers and consumption of public goods, and (d) public administration. The model can be used to explore the impact of expenditure composition on long run per capita income. Debt and external <b>aid</b> <b>financing</b> are also possible in the general model. A simplified model is proposed, numerically solved and the out of steady state dynamics studied.

We collected gross disbursements from bilateral donor countries and international organizations toward the DPRK according to specific health sectors by using the Or-ganization for Economic Cooperation and Development creditor reporting system database and the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs financial tracking service database. We analyzed sources of health aid to the DPRK from the Repub-lic of Korea (ROK) using the official records from the ROK’s Ministry of Unification. We identified the ROK, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tu-berculosis and Malaria (GFATM) as the major donor entities not only according to their level of health aid expenditures but also their growing roles within the health sector of the DPRK.

Drawing on simulations with the Maquette for MDG Simulations (MAMS), a model for strategy analysis, and a linked microsimulation model, this paper addresses Yemen 2 ̆ 019 s MDG challenges. A first simulation set considers scaled-up government actions {{with the aim of}} fully achieving the 2015 international MDG targets with required additional financing from foreign or domestic sources. The main finding is sobering but not surprising: given the required expansion of MDG-related services, on-time achievement of key MDG targets {{does not appear to have}} been a realistic objective even if the government, hypothetically, would have expanded services with grant <b>aid</b> <b>financing</b> starting from 2005; macroeconomic stability, government efficiency, and the production of tradables would all have suffered due to the size of spending and aid increases as well as the resulting real exchange rate appreciation. The results suggest that countries, instead of relying on international targets, should set MDG targets grounded in their own reality. In light of these results, the authors designed a second simulation set that is focused on the remaining period up to 2015, and on what may be feasible once the current conflict has been settled. The simulations introduce moderate increases in foreign aid or government allocative efficiency. The government uses the resulting fiscal space for spending and service expansion in infrastructure and human development without losses in productive efficiency. The results suggest that, under these conditions, substantial improvements could still be achieved...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reproductive {{health needs}} are {{particularly}} acute in countries affected by armed conflict. Reliable information on aid investment for reproductive health {{in these countries}} is essential for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of aid. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyse official development assistance (ODA) for reproductive health activities in conflict-affected countries from 2003 to 2006. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Creditor Reporting System and the Financial Tracking System databases were the chosen data sources for the study. ODA disbursement for reproductive health activities to 18 conflict-affected countries was analysed for 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. An average of US $ 20. 8 billion in total ODA was disbursed annually to the 18 conflict-affected countries between 2003 and 2006, of which US $ 509. 3 million (2. 4 %) was allocated to reproductive health. This represents an annual average of US $ 1. 30 disbursed per capita in the 18 sampled countries for reproductive health activities. Non-conflict-affected least-developed countries received 53. 3 % more ODA for reproductive health activities than conflict-affected least-developed countries, despite the latter generally having greater reproductive health needs. ODA disbursed for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment increased by 119. 4 % from 2003 to 2006. The ODA disbursed for other direct reproductive health activities declined by 35. 9 % over the same period. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of inequity in disbursement of reproductive health ODA between conflict-affected countries and non-conflict-affected countries, and between different reproductive health activities. These findings and the study's recommendations seek to support initiatives to make <b>aid</b> <b>financing</b> more responsive to need in the context of armed conflic...|$|E
40|$|This report aims to {{contribute}} to the debate on climate change policies and their link to development. A climate resilient perspective is adopted to understand how climate change policy objectives can be reconciled with development goals. The report reviews the main theoretical concepts that characterise the scientific literature on climate risk and vulnerability assessments, and identifies climate resilient fit-for-purpose indicators accordingly. This makes it possible to build the theoretical foundations to improve understanding of the implications of climate <b>aid</b> <b>financing.</b> The novelty of this report lies in the emphasis given to economic aspects of climate risk, most notably: the concepts of loss and damage, the understanding of factors that enhance economic resilience, the links between climate change policies and development (besides economic growth) and the acknowledgment of the role of natural capital in pursuing development policies. By reviewing grey and peer-reviewed literature, 102 suitable indicators are identified and grouped into six components. A case study is proposed which involves building three climate resilient development indices. The three indices are built for climate resilient development using the same components and indicators but adopting different political perspectives. Our case study demonstrates that although there is some agreement on which indicators should be included in an index for climate resilient development, a single approach to building a global index for climate resilient development does not exist. The high number of differences between the scores of the three indices indicates that a single index in the climate resilient development domain is a sort of chimera. Any index should address a specific policy request with a clear objective. This is a first step to building a fit-for-purpose index. JRC. H. 7 -Climate Risk Managemen...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{evolving}} nature of the accountability relationship between a group of Irish non-governmental development organisations (NGDOs) and their primary governmental funder. Design/methodology/approach – The examination is undertaken in the context of a unique funder-led initiative to instil a broad social accountability focus among NGDOs while re-orienting the NGDO-funder accountability dynamic towards a partnership-based approach – whereby the accountability entity would effectively be a supra-organisation comprising the funder and the NGDOs. The empirical content of the paper is derived from a series of in-depth interviews with senior individuals working within the Irish NGDO sector, along with a comprehensive analysis of documentary sources. Findings – The partnership rhetoric central to promoting the enhanced focus on social accountability across the “virtual” accountability supra-organisation has not been transformed into reality, and the NGDO-funder accountability relationship within the supra-organisation remains centred on control and justification. A lack of resources, organisational commitment, guidance, and expertise from the governmental funder has contributed to an attitude of scepticism among many NGDOs towards both the partnership rhetoric and the accompanying adoption of the central tenets of social accountability, particularly downward accountability to beneficiaries. Research limitations/implications – The research is based on a detailed analysis in a specific context which may limit its wider applicability. Nevertheless, it adds insights to the developing academic literature on NGO accountability, with particular reference to their broader social accountabilities. Practical implications – Although highly context-specific, the findings of the study will be useful to researchers and policy makers interested in understanding how NGDO-funder accountability relationships can move towards mutual accountability and genuine partnerships focused on promoting social accountability. Originality/value – Very few in-depth academic examinations of the evolving nature of NGDO-funder accountability relationships in specific NGO contexts have emerged in the accountability literature. Many of the insights in this paper are derived from individuals inside organisations in the NGDO sector who are regularly addressing issues of accountability, both social and otherwise. This provides in-depth, highly-informed insider perspectives on the evolving nature of these relationships, especially in the context of attempts to promote more partnership-based approaches to the delivery of development <b>aid.</b> <b>Financing,</b> Ireland, Non-governmental organizations, Partnership...|$|E
