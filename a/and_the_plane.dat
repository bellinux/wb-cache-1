5|$|On 22 December Hinkler, {{accompanied}} by John F. Leeming, {{president of the}} Lancashire Aero Club, made another attempt. The landing was no problem. On the steep slope and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing.

5|$|During June, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Miller's squadron would be deployed to Burma {{to fight against}} Japan. In the meantime, the airmen continued to practice their flying, Miller earning Reeves' ire by making unauthorised leisure flights. Later, {{he was ordered to}} fly tour flights over Germany. Not wanting to do so, Miller lodged bogus reports saying that the Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work. Thus, Reeves ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire in mid-flight. With one functional engine and no navigator to assist him, Miller came back to the air base and bellylanded. The fuselage and one of the wings was broken off <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> became engulfed in flames. Miller escaped physical injury, but was shaken by the accident. Again Miller escaped disciplinary action, and was playing sport an hour later.|$|E
5|$|After finding Sharon's trashed hotel room, Mulder {{meets with}} Millar, who {{tells him that}} the door was pulled off the plane from the outside while it was in flight. Later, Frish finds his {{colleague}} dead from a faked suicide. A group of commandos arrive to capture Frish, but he escapes. Frish goes to see Mulder and Scully, telling them that he lied before and that his commanding officer had ordered him to track the plane's coordinates as it was being intercepted by a second aircraft. Seconds later, {{there was an explosion}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> disappeared from his radar. Mulder believes that a third aircraft, a UFO, approached the plane and was destroyed by the second aircraft, also causing the Flight 549 crash. The agents leave with Frish and are soon chased by the commandos. Meanwhile, Millar returns to the crash site and encounters a UFO. He finds Sharon nearby, having just been returned by her abductors.|$|E
5|$|Carpender was not inflexible, {{and reached}} a {{compromise}} with Mackay to transport a battalion to Finschhafen in high speed transports (APDs). Herring was in Dobodura, lunching with Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, {{when he heard}} this news. He decided to fly to Milne Bay {{to discuss the matter}} of resupply in general with Barbey. On 28 September, Herring and two of his staff officers, Brigadiers R. B. Sutherland and R. Bierwirth, boarded a U.S. Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bomber at Dobodura. As the plane was about to take off, the undercarriage collapsed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> ploughed into the Marston Mat runway. A propeller shattered, splinters ripped through the fuselage into the cabin and Sutherland, who was sitting in the navigator's compartment next to Herring, was struck by a flying fragment that killed him instantly. The crew, Herring and Bierwirth escaped shaken but unscathed. The trip to Milne Bay was cancelled. Brigadier Sutherland was buried with full military honours at Soputa the next day, with a fly past by B-25s. When next he flew, Herring once again took a B-25 and made a point of requesting the major who had been in charge of the crashed plane to be his pilot.|$|E

5|$|On December 5, 1942 Hansell {{received}} his first combat command, the 3rd Bombardment Wing. Originally {{one of the}} three wings of General Headquarters Air Force, the 3rd was now part of the Eighth Air Force in England, planned as a Martin B-26 Marauder unit with the mission of supporting the Eighth's heavy bomber operations by bombing Luftwaffe fighter airfields. However the wing had no aircraft or units yet assigned, and on January 2, 1943, Hansell was shifted to command the 1st Bomb Wing, the B-17 component of VIII Bomber Command. Hansell flew his first mission with his new command the next day to bomb the submarine pens at Saint-Nazaire, France. He saw first hand the effectiveness of German interceptors, as both wingmen of Hansell's bomber were shot down. Later that month, on a January 13 mission to Lille, France, the pilot of the B-17 in which he flew was killed in action <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> nearly shot down on.|$|E
5|$|Onassis died on January 23, 1973, {{at the age}} of 24, from {{injuries}} {{sustained the}} previous day when his personal Piaggio P.136L-2 amphibious airplane, in which he was a passenger, crashed at Hellinikon International Airport in Athens. Onassis was instructing a potential new pilot of the plane, Donald McCusker, {{at the time of the}} crash, in his role as President of Olympic Aviation. Onassis and McCusker were accompanied by Donald McGregor, Onassis's regular pilot, who was recovering from an eye infection. A few seconds after takeoff from runway 33, the plane's right wing dropped and stayed down, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> crashed shortly after losing balance, in a flight lasting no more than 15 seconds. McCusker and the other pilot both suffered serious injuries in the crash. The trio had planned to practice amphibious landings between the Saronic Gulf islands of Aegina and Poros after takeoff.|$|E
5|$|The 33-seat Saab 340B {{airplane}} {{used for}} Crossair Flight LX498 had been leased to Crossair from Moldavian Airlines since 1 October 1999. The plane {{was scheduled to}} depart from Zurich Airport on Monday, 10 January 2000, at around 6:00p.m. and arrive at Dresden Airport a few hours later. The cold, drizzly weather was normal for the area, there were no indications that anything {{was wrong with the}} aircraft, and, although this particular aircraft had 24,000 flying hours since its November 1990 delivery, this type of airplane had a very good safety record. Captain Pavel Gruzin, 41, had 8,100 hours of flying time, with 1,900 in the Saab 340 type. Co-pilot Rastislav Kolesár, 35, had about 1,800 total hours, with 1,100 hours in the Saab 340 type.

5|$|Some of {{the snakes}} attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally {{releases}} the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to {{drop into the}} cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have {{made their way to}} the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases. Based on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing exotic and highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, the dealer is bitten by one of his snakes and Harris withholds the antivenom if he does not give them details. The dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane. Price injects antivenom to the injured dealer and he commandeers the dealer's supply of antivenom for the plane's victims based on the list given to him, while Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.|$|E
