The following month, Gaga pledged to donate $1 million to the American Red Cross to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Gaga also contributes {{in the fight against}} HIV and AIDS, focusing on educating young women <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> the disease. In collaboration with Cyndi Lauper, Gaga joined forces with MAC Cosmetics to launch a line of lipstick under their supplementary cosmetic line, Viva Glam. Sales have raised more than $202 million to fight HIV and AIDS.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposals}} faced strong {{objections from}} the Metropolitan and District Railways (MR and DR) whose routes on the Inner Circle, {{to the north}} and the south respectively, the CLR route paralleled; and from which the new line was expected to take passengers. The City Corporation also objected, concerned about potential damage to buildings close to the route caused by subsidence as was experienced during the construction of the C The Dean and Chapter of St Paul's Cathedral objected, concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> undermining the cathedral's foundations. Sir Joseph Bazalgette objected that the tunnels would damage the city's sewer system. The bill was approved by the House of Commons, but was rejected by the House of Lords, which recommended that any decision be postponed until after the C had opened and its operation could be assessed.|$|E
25|$|The {{usage of}} single embryo {{transfer}} is highest in Sweden (69.4%), but {{as low as}} 2.8% in the USA.

25|$|Individuals know a {{lot more}} about {{themselves}} than they do about others. Because information about others is less available, information about the self versus others leads people to make specific conclusions about their own risk, but results in them having a harder time making conclusions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> others. This leads to differences in judgments and conclusions about self-risks compared to the risks of others, leading to larger gaps in the optimistic bias.|$|E
25|$|Body image {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} {{psychological}} effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely difficult for people {{to live up to the}} standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is. There are many factors that lead to a person’s body image, some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for obesity or malnutrition, and cultural expectations (e.g., media and politics). People who are both underweight and overweight can have poor body image. However, because people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. This is something that can lead to a change in a person's body image. Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by dieting or undergoing cosmetic surgery.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{metabolic}} {{concerns have}} been of grave concern to clinicians, patients and the FDA. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required all manufacturers of atypical antipsychotics to change their labeling to include a warning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> hyperglycemia and diabetes with atypical antipsychotics. It must also {{be pointed out that}} although all atypicals must carry the warning on their labeling, some evidence shows that atypicals are not equal in their effects on weight and insulin sensitivity. The general consensus is that clozapine and olanzapine are associated with the greatest effects on weight gain and decreased insulin sensitivity, followed by risperidone and quetiapine. Ziprasidone and aripiprazole are thought to have the smallest effects on weight and insulin resistance, but clinical experience with these newer agents is not as developed as that with the older agents. The mechanism of these adverse effects is not completely understood but it is believed to result from a complex interaction between a number of pharmacologic actions of these drugs. Their effects on weight are believed to mostly derive from their actions on the H1 and 5-HT2C receptors, while their effects on insulin sensitivity are believed {{to be the result of}} a combination of their effects on body weight (as increased body mass is known to be a risk factor for insulin resistance) and their antagonistic effects on the M3receptor. Some of the newer agents, however, such as risperidone and its metabolite paliperidone, ziprasidone, lurasidone, aripiprazole, asenapine and iloperidone have clinically-insignificant effects on the M3 receptor and appear to carry a lower risk of insulin resistance. Whereas clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine (indirectly via its active metabolite, norquetiapine) all antagonise the M3 receptor at therapeutic-relevant concentrations.|$|E

500|$|The bridge {{acquired}} the nickname of [...] "The Trembling Lady" [...] {{because of its}} tendency to vibrate, particularly when used by troops from the nearby Chelsea Barracks. Concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> mechanical resonance effects on suspension bridges, following the 1831 collapse of the Broughton Suspension Bridge and the 1850 collapse of Angers Bridge, led to notices being placed at the entrances warning troops to break step (i.e. not to march in rhythm) when crossing the bridge; Although the barracks closed in 2008, the warning signs are still in place.|$|E
500|$|Holden, {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> {{introducing a}} new platform and drivetrain {{at the same}} time, introduced the Australian-built Alloytec V6 engine in the proven VZ model. This allowed time to address any issues or faults before fitting it to the VE. The original base V6 benefited from power increases over the VZ, with engine noise reduced by using new timing chains among other modifications. An updated version of the long-serving four-speed GM 4L60-E automatic transmission remained for this engine. Manual transmission options are the Aisin AY6 and Tremec T-56 six-speeders. Two automatics featuring Active Select; the five-speed GM 5L40-E and six-speed GM 6L80-E were also offered. The latter was reserved exclusively for a modified L76 V8 engine, giving an extra [...] of power compared to the VZ. This new engine designated L98 does not readily support fuel-saving Active Fuel Management technology, unlike the L76.|$|E

In the second chapter, [...] "Why Risk a Music Career?", Lopez is interviewed by her sister Lynda Lopez, who oversees each interview segment, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> starting a music career after having an already thriving movie career. Critics believed that she was only launching a music career with an intent to expand her brand, while Lopez {{felt as if it}} was simply the [...] "next natural step" [...] in her career. Lopez's manager Benny Medina further discusses this, labeling her as the [...] "ultimate" [...] triple threat – [...] "the actor, singer and dancer". Lopez then confers, in the chapter [...] "Press Tours / Promotions", about the extensive promotional schedule she was on to promote the album. She examines the differences in promoting an album and a film, stating that promoting an album is more [...] "personal" [...] as it is something that is [...] "closer to your heart" [...] and something she [...] "really believes in". According to Lopez, {{by the end of the}} promotional tour for the album she [...] "lost" [...] her voice from the amount of interviews she had.

2500|$|London's [...] "strength of utterance" [...] is at {{its height}} in his stories, and they are {{painstakingly}} well-constructed. [...] "To Build a Fire" [...] is {{the best known of}} all his stories. Set in the harsh Klondike, it recounts the haphazard trek of a new arrival who has ignored an old-timer's warning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> traveling alone. Falling through the ice into a creek in seventy-five-below weather, the unnamed man is keenly aware that survival depends on his untested skills at quickly building a fire to dry his clothes and warm his extremities. After publishing a tame version of this story—with a sunny outcome—in The Youth's Companion in 1902, London offered a second, more severe take on the man's predicament in The Century Magazine in 1908. Reading both provides an illustration of London's growth and maturation as a writer. As Labor (1994) observes: [...] "To compare the two versions is itself an instructive lesson in what distinguished a great work of literary art from a good children's story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hyperkalemic {{periodic}} paralysis (HYPP), {{which is}} caused by an autosomal dominant gene linked to the stallion Impressive. [...] It is characterized by uncontrollable muscle twitching and substantial muscle weakness or paralysis among affected horses. [...] Because it is a dominant gene, only one parent has to have the gene {{for it to be}} transmitted to offspring. [...] There is a DNA test for HYPP, which is required by the AQHA. Since 2007, the AQHA bars registration of horses who possess the homozygous form (H/H) of the gene, and though heterozygous (H/N) horses are still eligible for registration, altering that status is currently being discussed. Additionally all Quarter Horses born 2007 or later that are confirmed to be descendants of Impressive must carry a note <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> HYPP on their registration papers. Due to HYPP, the halter classes are undergoing significant changes. [...] Halter classes are dominated by the Impressive bloodline. [...] Impressive, a very prolific halter horse, brought to the stock breeds the muscle mass that is popular in halter competition today. [...] This muscle mass is linked to HYPP, and as the condition is reduced within the breed, the style of horse in halter classes is also likely to change. [...] Already there have been rule changes, including the creation of a [...] "Performance Halter class" [...] in which a horse must possess a Register of Merit [...] in performance or racing before it [...] can compete.|$|E
