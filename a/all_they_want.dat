25|$|Harry and Edna are {{the most}} obvious escapees as they run from their own home and set up camp {{in the home of}} Agnes and Tobias. They run from a general sense of fear or dread, not even knowing what they are afraid of. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to do is escape by hiding, all day if they must, in a bedroom in their friends’ home.|$|E
25|$|At sea, Full-Eyes spots two {{warships}} tailing them. Thorfinn, {{along with}} the unwanted assistance of Hild, separates from the group, as {{he is the one}} Floki wants dead. They will meet back up in Odense, Denmark. Some of Floki’s men follow them on land where they attack fishermen and burn boats to stop their means of escape. Thorfinn tries to rationalize with those men to take him to Floki but <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> is his head. With no other choice, Thorfinn fights them barehanded and backup from Hild. With only three pursuers remaining, one of them kills their leader. It turns out that the other two are part of the Vagn Battalion who infiltrated Floki’s army to track their movements. The two men, Eskil and Vrage, ask Thorfinn for assistance to vanquish Floki once and for all. They were testing him during his fight against the pursuers to observe his strength and noble birth as the candidate for leader of the Jomsvikings. Even if Thorfinn tries to live his life as a traveling merchant, he still cannot escape his bloody past.|$|E
500|$|Michael calls {{a meeting}} with Dwight, Andy, Phyllis and Stanley {{to give them a}} formal apology, but they do not accept it since <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> is their clients back. Michael reluctantly agrees to give back their clients. In doing so, however, there are not enough clients to keep both Pam and Ryan on the sales team, leaving Michael to decide which one to keep. He talks it over with Jim, who {{suggests}} Pam would be better suited, but Michael argues that Jim is biased since Pam is his fiance. Michael calls {{a meeting with}} Pam and tells her she did not get the sales job. Pam is visibly disappointed, but Michael starts laughing and tells her that she did get it, having offered Ryan a temp position again. Pam tells him he should stop with the [...] "fake-firing" [...] joke, but Michael decides to pull the joke on the new receptionist, Erin (Ellie Kemper). This is a callback to the pilot episode in which Michael [...] "fake fires" [...] Pam.|$|E

500|$|He was billeted with Alexander, who {{was working}} in Hut 8, the {{counterpart}} to Hut 6 working on German Naval Enigma. Their close friendship let them easily resolve the competing needs of their sections for the limited available bombe time. By October 1941, he was deputy head of Hut 6 under Welchman. At this time, Bletchley Park was experiencing a shortage of clerical staff which was delaying the work on Enigma, and the management of GCCS appeared unable to obtain the resources needed. This affected both Hut 6 and Hut 8, which was run by mathematician Alan Turing with Hugh Alexander as his deputy. Together, Welchman, Milner-Barry, Turing and Alexander bypassed {{the chain of command}} and wrote a memorandum directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, outlining their difficulties. It fell to Milner-Barry to deliver the message to 10 Downing Street in person, on 21 October 1941. The next day, Churchill responded, [...] "Action this day: Make sure they have <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done." [...] Within a month their needs were being met.|$|E
500|$|It {{was then}} an annual custom for the Pope {{to receive a}} {{delegation}} from Rome's Jewish community shortly after the New Year. The meeting on 2 February 1859 quickly descended into a heated argument, with Pope Pius berating the Jewish visitors for [...] "stirring up a storm all over Europe about this Mortara case". When the delegation denied that the Jews of Rome had had any hand in the anti-clerical articles, the Pope dismissed Scazzocchio as inexperienced and foolish, then shouted: [...] "The newspapers can write <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> I couldn't care less what the world thinks!" [...] The Pope then calmed down somewhat: [...] "So strong is the pity I have for you, that I pardon you, indeed, I must pardon you." [...] One of the delegates proposed that the Church should not give so much credence to Morisi's testimony, given her spurious morals—the Pope countered that regardless of her character, so {{far as he could}} see the servant had no reason to invent such a story, and in any case Momolo Mortara should not have employed a Catholic in the first place.|$|E

2500|$|Buck himself sized up CBS' {{handling}} of the announcers by saying [...] "CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let [...] McCarver run the show.' In television, <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> {{you to do is}} shut up. I'm not very good at shutting up." [...] Buck though, would add that although he knew Tim McCarver well, they never developed a good relationship with each other on the air despite high hopes to the contrary. Phil Mushnick added insult to injury to Buck by accusing him of [...] "trying to predict plays, as if to prove he was still on top." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{two years}} of calling {{baseball}} telecasts (including the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week, All-Star Game, National League Championship Series, and World Series), Buck was dismissed by CBS. The official reasoning behind Buck's ouster was that he simply had poor chemistry with lead analyst Tim McCarver. Buck was soon replaced by Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Buck later noted that [...] "CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let McCarver run the show ...

During a September 1941 morale-boosting visit, Winston Churchill {{reportedly}} remarked to Denniston: [...] "I {{told you to}} leave no stone unturned to get staff, but I had no idea you had taken me so literally." [...] Six weeks later, having failed to get sufficient typing and unskilled staff to achieve the productivity that was possible, Turing, Welchman, Alexander and Milner-Barry wrote directly to Churchill.

60|$|Furthermore, {{not only}} will {{socialism}} get food more easily and in greater quantity, but it will achieve a more equitable distribution of that food. Socialism promises, for a time, to give all men, women, and children <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to eat, and {{to enable them to}} eat <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> as often as they want. Subsistence will be pushed back, temporarily, an exceedingly long way. In consequence, the flood of life will rise like a tidal wave. There will be more marriages and more children born. The enforced sterility that obtains to-day for many millions, will no longer obtain. Nor will the fecund millions in the slums and labour-ghettos, who to-day die of all the ills due to chronic underfeeding and overcrowding, and who die with their fecundity largely unrealised, die in that future day when the increased food-getting efficiency of socialism will give them <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to eat.|$|E
