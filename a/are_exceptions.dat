5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets {{are very close to}} the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There <b>are</b> <b>exceptions,</b> such as Halley's Comet.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all {{butterflies}} are diurnal, {{have relatively}} bright colours, and hold their wings vertically above their bodies when at rest, unlike {{the majority of}} moths which fly by night, are often cryptically coloured (well camouflaged), and either hold their wings flat (touching the surface on which the moth is standing) or fold them closely over their bodies. Some day-flying moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth, <b>are</b> <b>exceptions</b> to these rules.|$|E
5|$|The table below {{consists}} of averages for August (generally the warmest month) and January (generally the coldest) in selected cities in various {{regions of the}} state. El Paso and Amarillo <b>are</b> <b>exceptions</b> with July and December respectively being the warmest and coldest months respectively, but with August and January only being narrowly different.|$|E
5|$|Although {{plants are}} {{better known for}} {{defensive}} mimicry, there <b>are</b> <b>exceptions.</b> For example, many flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators, while others may trick insects into dispersing their seeds. Nonetheless, most mimicry in plants would not be classified as aggressive, as although luring pollinators is similar to cases above, they are certainly not eaten by the plant. However some carnivorous plants {{may be able to}} increase their rate of capture through mimicry. For example, some have patterns in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, much like the spider webs described above.|$|E

5|$|Chen Guangcheng, a blind self-taught Weiquan lawyer, rose to {{prominence}} for defending victims of China's one-child policy. First implemented in 1979, the one-child policy mandates that couples may {{only have one}} child, though there <b>are</b> <b>exceptions</b> for some rural citizens, ethnic minorities, and couples who were themselves only children. Though Chinese laws condemn harsh enforcement measures, Chinese authorities and family planning staff {{have been accused of}} carrying out coercive, late-term forced abortions, sterilization, incarceration and torture to enforce the policy. In 2005, Chen Guangcheng filed a class action case against family planning officials in Linyi, Shandong, who were accused of subjecting thousands of women to sterilization or forced abortions.|$|E
5|$|Colleges {{arrange the}} {{tutorial}} teaching for their undergraduates, {{and the members}} of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these <b>are</b> <b>exceptions,</b> and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There <b>are</b> <b>exceptions</b> to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E

5|$|Many {{pictures}} {{depict the}} countryside at Wiedensahl and Lüthorst. They include pollarded willows, cottages in cornfields, cowherds, autumn landscapes and meadows with streams. A particular {{feature is the}} use of red jackets, found in about 280 of 1000 Busch paintings and drawings. The muted or bright red coats are worn usually by a small figure, depicted from behind. The paintings generally represent typical villages. Portraits of the Kesslers, and a series of other portraits depicting Lina Weissenborn in the mid-1870s, <b>are</b> <b>exceptions.</b> A painting of a 10-year-old girl from a Jewish family at Lüthorst portrays her as serious, and having dark, oriental features.|$|E
5|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there <b>are</b> <b>exceptions,</b> {{such as the}} great cormorant. Birds with eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of female social dominance sets lemurs apart from most other primates and mammals; in most primate societies, males are dominant unless females band {{together to form}} coalitions that displace them. However, many Eulemur species <b>are</b> <b>exceptions</b> and the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) does not exhibit female dominance. When females are dominant within a group, the way they maintain dominance varies. Ring-tailed lemur males act submissively with or without signs of female aggression. Male crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus), on the other hand, will only act submissively when females act aggressively towards them. Female aggression is often associated with, but not limited to, feeding.|$|E

5|$|Excepting some domesticated forms, {{all male}} bovids have horns, {{and in many}} species, females, too, possess horns. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic {{structure}} is a pair of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted, or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Although horns occur in a single pair on almost all bovid species, there <b>are</b> <b>exceptions</b> such as the four-horned antelope and the Jacob sheep. The unique horn structure is the only unambiguous morphological feature of bovids that distinguishes them from other pecorans. A high correlation exists between horn morphology and fighting behaviour of the individual. For instance, long horns are intended for wrestling and fencing, whereas curved horns are used in ramming. Males with horns directed inwards are monogamous and solitary, while those with horns directed outwards tend to be polygynous. These results were independent of body size.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} similar {{reproductive}} strategy to other herd animals. A group of ewes is generally mated {{by a single}} ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in feral populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams. Most sheep are seasonal breeders, although some are able to breed year-round. Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months old, and rams generally at four to six months. However, there <b>are</b> <b>exceptions.</b> For example, Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months, and Merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months. Ewes have estrus cycles about every 17 days, during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. A minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for homosexuality and {{a small number of}} the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are freemartins (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning ovaries).|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There <b>are</b> <b>exceptions</b> for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. The trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees.|$|E
5|$|The shraddha is {{performed}} on the specific lunar day during the Pitru Paksha, when the ancestorusually a parent or paternal grandparentdied. There <b>are</b> <b>exceptions</b> to the lunar day rule; special days are allotted for people {{who died in a}} particular manner or had a certain status in life. Chautha Bharani and Bharani Panchami, the fourth and fifth lunar day respectively, are allocated for people deceased in the past year. Avidhava navami ("Unwidowed ninth"), the ninth lunar day, is for married women who died before their husband. Widowers invite Brahmin women as guests for their wife's shraddha. The twelfth lunar day is for children and ascetics who had renounced the worldly pleasures. The fourteenth day is known as Ghata chaturdashi or Ghayala chaturdashi, and is reserved for those people killed by arms, in war or suffered a violent death.|$|E
