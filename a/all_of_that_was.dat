25|$|In 1934, {{the capital}} of Soviet Ukraine moved from Kharkiv to Kiev. Previously, the city was seen as only a {{regional}} centre, hence received little attention. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> to change, at great price. The first examples of Stalinist architecture were already showing, and, {{in light of the}} official policy, a new city was to be built on top of the old one. This meant that much-admired examples such as the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery were destroyed. Even the St. Sophia Cathedral was under threat. Also, the Second World War contributed to the wreckage. After the war, a new project for the reconstruction of central Kiev transformed Khreshchatyk avenue into a notable example of Stalinism in Architecture. However, by 1955, the new politics of architecture once again stopped the project from fully being realised.|$|E
500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lowell {{attended}} Harvard College for two years. While he was {{a freshman}} at Harvard, he visited Robert Frost in Cambridge and asked for feedback on a long poem he had written on the Crusades; Frost suggested that Lowell needed {{to work on his}} compression. In an interview, Lowell recalled, [...] "I had a huge blank verse epic on the First Crusade and took it to him all in my undecipherable pencil-writing, and he read a little of it, and said, 'It goes on rather a bit, doesn't it?' And then he read me the opening of Keats's 'Hyperion,' the first version, and I thought <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> sublime." ...|$|E

He'd done it without thinking, although in his opinion, the kid deserved it.|$|R
2500|$|There {{have been}} some {{positive}} reviews, however. One modern critic said [...] "the story is adequately paced, the acting is engaging, and we still get a thrill seeing the Army guys empty their cartridges at the unstoppable insects." [...] Another modern reviewer found the screenplay effective, especially the beginning: [...] "As in Deadly Mantis, the complete disappearance of the victims is especially chilling, as {{is the notion of}} 150 men, women and children being devoured overnight while in their beds. This aspect is like something out of Lovecraft, although it is not exploited as well as it could have been." [...] Producer-director Bert I. Gordon said he did not care whether reviews were bad; what mattered was whether people went to see the film: [...] "The movie audience these days consists almost entirely of teenagers. Either they're naïve and go to get scared, or they're sophisticated and enjoy scoffing at the pictures. There isn't much a teenager can scoff at these days, you know." [...] Lead actor Peter Graves also felt the film worked on a certain level. [...] "I think they played OK. ... <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> ludicrous, but there were a certain amount of people who 'bought' it and loved it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{stood for}} a time looking at the dry limbs and still human face of that {{desiccated}} unwrapped mummy from the very beginnings of social life. It looked very patient, she thought, and a little self-satisfied. It {{looked as if it}} had taken its world for granted and prospered on that assumption--a world in which children were trained to obey their elders and the wills of women over-ruled as a matter of course. It was wonderful to think this thing had lived, had felt and suffered. Perhaps once it had desired some other human being intolerably. Perhaps some one had kissed the brow that was now so cadaverous, rubbed that sunken cheek with loving fingers, held that stringy neck with passionately living hands. But <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> forgotten. [...] "In the end," [...] it seemed to be thinking, [...] "they embalmed me with the utmost respect--sound spices chosen to endure--the best! I took my world as I found it. THINGS ARE SO!" ...|$|E

500|$|After she {{was awarded}} the Nobel Peace Prize, there was praise, but also some disapproval of the {{decision}} to award it to her.

What Nobel wanted <b>was</b> a prize <b>that</b> promoted global disarmament." ...|$|R
25|$|Tactically, {{the guerrilla}} army would avoid any {{confrontation}} with large units of enemy troops, but seek and eliminate {{small groups of}} soldiers to minimize losses and exhaust the opposing force. Not limiting their targets to personnel, enemy resources are also preferred targets. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to weaken the enemy's strength, to cause the enemy eventually to be unable to persue the war any longer, and to force the enemy to withdraw.|$|R
2500|$|Some of {{the lower}} scores were {{reactions}} to {{the large amount of}} bugs and glitches in the initial release, including crash to desktop bugs and network problems.

50|$|New Zealand is {{a unitary}} state {{rather than a}} {{federation}} - regions are created by {{the authority of the}} central government, rather than the central government being created by the authority of the regions. Local government in New Zealand has only the powers conferred upon it by Parliament. These powers have traditionally been distinctly fewer than in some other countries. For example, police and education are run by central government, while the provision of low-cost housing is optional for local councils. Many of them used to control gas and electricity supply, but nearly <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> privatised or centralised in the 1990s.|$|E
