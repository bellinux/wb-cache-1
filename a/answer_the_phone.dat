5|$|Meanwhile in Scranton, {{the office}} is left without a {{receptionist}}. Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) orders to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> With {{the rest of the}} staff similarly declining to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|E

25|$|This can be {{illustrated}} by the following example. Assume that an opinion poll is conducted by calling random telephone numbers. Unemployed {{people are more likely}} to be home and <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> than employed people are. Therefore, unemployed respondents are likely to be over-represented in the sample. The probability distribution of employed versus unemployed respondents in a sample of n respondents can be described as a noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E

25|$|On December 7, 1973, {{investigators}} {{found that an}} 18½-minute portion of one recorded tape had been erased. Rose Mary Woods, Nixon’s longtime personal secretary, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her tape player when answering the phone. The press ran photos of the set-up, showing that it was unlikely for Woods to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> while keeping her foot on the pedal. Later forensic analysis in 2003 determined that the tape had been erased in several segments—at least five, and {{perhaps as many as}} nine.|$|E
500|$|Seacology {{is a small}} nonprofit, {{with only}} eight {{full-time}} staff, {{and as a result}} has little overhead costs and operates on a modest budget. [...] Its tax identification number is 87-0495235. [...] According to Silverstein, its annual budget for all of its staff and office expenditures is significantly lower than the median compensation for business chief executive officers (CEOs) alone. Board members receive no compensation and are not reimbursed for the costs of attending board meetings. [...] Unlike other environmental groups, Seacology does not offer memberships, which further reduces its expenditures. Staff <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> instead of using automated answering services, and Seacology respects donor privacy and is compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).|$|E

500|$|... "After Hours" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producers}} Halsted Sullivan and Warren Lieberstein. It was directed by Brian Baumgartner, who portrays Kevin Malone on the series, marking his directorial debut. [...] The episode features a guest appearance from David Koechner, who appears as Todd Packer in the series. He recently {{made a deal with}} NBC to do more episodes for the series and also possibly join the cast of series developer Greg Daniels's next series, Friday Night Dinner, an adaption of the British series of the same name. The episode marks the third appearance of Catherine Tate as Nellie Bertram and her second consecutive appearance. Her character, Nellie will work with several of the office workers on a special project for Sabre in a six episode arc. The episode also marks the tenth appearance of Lindsey Broad who plays Cathy, Pam's replacement during her maternity leave. She appeared in a recurring role for the season, after she initially appeared in [...] "Pam's Replacement". The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Nellie establishing boundaries for flirtation, Nellie and Dwight confessing peculiar secrets to each other, and Pam and Andy calling Jim for advice, only to have Cathy <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b>|$|E
500|$|Scarface {{provoked}} outrage mainly {{due to its}} unprecedented violence, {{but also}} because of its shifts of tone from serious to comedic. Dave Kehr, writing in the Chicago Reader, said that the film blends [...] "comedy and horror in a manner that suggests Chico Marx let loose with a live machine gun." [...] In one scene, Camonte is inside a cafe while a torrent of machine gun fire from the car of a rival gang is headed his way. His bumbling assistant, following orders from Camonte, keeps trying to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> instead of ducking even after the gangsters make several passes by the cafe. After the barrage is over, Camonte picks up a tommy gun one of the mobsters dropped, and exhibits child like wonder and unrestrained excitement over the new toy. Civic leaders became furious that gangsters like Capone (who was also the blatant inspiration for Little Caesar) were being applauded in movie houses all across America. Some of the biographical details that were used for Muni's character in Scarface were so obviously taken from Capone, and the detail so close, that it was impossible not to draw the parallels. Capone sent several members of his gang to threaten screenwriter Ben Hecht, but Hecht was able to convince them the picture was based on other gangsters. When Scarface was released however, Capone adored the film, and purchased a personal copy. The film remained out of circulation, until Hughes's death in 1976. Universal then re-released the picture, but some scenes from the film's original cut are lost.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Cerati's sister, Maria Laura Cerati, {{saw herself}} {{repeatedly}} harassed by Carlos Ficicchia, {{a man she}} had met in River Plate, Argentina who called repeatedly to ask her out, all advances of which she rejected. Gustavo would one day <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> for his sister, and thus enter a lengthy conservation about music with Ficicchia, who mentioned {{that he was a}} drummer, son of the famous jazz drummer, Tito Alberti, known to many as the songwriter of a well known Argentine children's song, [...] "El Elefante Trompita". Interested in his talents, Cerati and Bosio would ask him to join the band after hearing him playif he would cut his hair.

2500|$|Mailer {{software}} {{was responsible for}} transferring files and messages between systems, as well as passing control to other applications, such as the BBS software, at appropriate times. [...] The mailer would initially <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and, if necessary, deal with incoming mail via FidoNet transfer protocols. [...] If the mailer answered the phone and a human caller was detected rather than other mailer software, the mailer would exit, and pass control to the BBS software, which would then initialise for interaction with the user. [...] When outgoing mail was waiting on the local system, the mailer software would attempt to send it {{from time to time}} by dialing and connecting to other systems who would accept and route the mail further. [...] Due to the costs of toll calls which often varied between peak and off-peak times, mailer software would usually allow its operator to configure the optimal times in which to attempt to send mail to other systems.|$|E

2500|$|The {{games are}} visual novels, {{in which the}} player can affect {{the outcome of the}} story through choices. In Chaos;Head and Chaos;Child, the player does this by {{controlling}} what types of delusions the player character experiences: they can make him experience positive or negative delusions, or alternatively choose to let him stay in reality. Chaos;Child Love Chu Chu!! additionally uses a [...] "yes/no" [...] questionnaire the player character takes in in-game magazines to determine the plot's direction. In Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0, the player affects the outcome by using the player character's cell phone: in Steins;Gate, it is done by choosing to respond to certain messages, make phone calls, or taking out the phone at specific times, as this affects what information the player character learns and how he interacts with other characters; and in Steins;Gate 0, it is done by deciding whether or not to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> at certain times. Robotics;Notes works similarly to Steins;Gate, but with the player using a tablet computer and its apps instead of a cell phone.|$|E

When Darius does not <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> MacLeod and Fitzcairn rush to the chapel to find Darius' body in the messy nave.

He meets their leader, renegade Watcher James Horton (Peter Hudson), who believes all Immortals to be threats to mankind and considers Darius [...] "a malignant evil that has walked this earth {{in the form of a}} man for the last two thousand years." [...] MacLeod fights them, but Horton escapes. After setting Fitzcairn free, they return to the barge and along with Tessa and Richie scatter Darius' ashes in the Seine River while MacLeod says, [...] "Fifteen hundred years ago, you led an army of barbarians to the gates of Paris...
