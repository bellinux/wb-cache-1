5|$|The right heart {{consists}} of two chambers, the right atrium and the right ventricle, separated by <b>a</b> <b>valve,</b> the tricuspid valve.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>valve</b> failed on a diver’s {{emergency}} cylinder on {{a diving}} support vessel during {{preparation for a}} dive injuring five divers. The cylinder valve was ejected at 180 bar due to incompatible thread. Pillar valve was M25x2 parallel thread and cylinder was a 3/4″x14 BSP parallel thread.|$|E
50|$|Any similar {{arrangement}} of <b>a</b> stop <b>valve</b> {{used to protect}} leaking past <b>a</b> throttling <b>valve</b> could also {{be referred to as}} <b>a</b> guardian <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|Compared to the {{progressive}} control of <b>a</b> gate <b>valve</b> <b>a</b> ball <b>valve</b> style petcock's is coarse, confining their use principally to on-off applications.|$|R
50|$|The pump {{contains}} a chamber which has <b>a</b> <b>valved</b> inlet from the fluid to be pumped, <b>a</b> <b>valved</b> outlet - {{both of these}} {{at the bottom of}} the pump, and a pressurant inlet at the top of the pump. A pressurant is used, such as steam or pressurized helium, to drive the fluid through the pump.|$|R
5|$|U-43 {{returned}} to Lorient on 17 December 1940 after a patrol of 38 days. On 4 February 1941, while at Lorient docks, U-43 was sunk after <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> was accidentally left open, putting the U-boat {{out of action}} {{for the next three}} months.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>valve</b> ejected due to {{incompatible}} thread (metric valve in imperial cylinder) injured commercial diver by {{impact on}} the back of the helmet during preparations for a dive. Cylinder had been under pressure for several days following hydrostatic testing, and no particular triggering event was identified. Diver was knocked down and bruised but protected from serious injury by the helmet.|$|E
5|$|Also {{known as}} a {{manifold}} cage or regulator cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to {{the neck of the}} cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead. <b>A</b> <b>valve</b> cage is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruit is}} <b>a</b> <b>valved</b> capsule under <b>a</b> {{centimeter}} long which contains many seeds.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> solenoid <b>valve</b> is <b>an</b> electromechanically {{operated}} <b>valve.</b> The valve {{is controlled}} by an electric current through a solenoid: {{in the case of}} <b>a</b> two-port <b>valve</b> the flow is switched on or off; in the case of <b>a</b> three-port <b>valve,</b> the outflow is switched between the two outlet ports. Multiple solenoid valves can be placed together on a manifold.|$|R
25|$|Schwarzenegger {{was born}} with <b>a</b> {{bicuspid}} aortic <b>valve,</b> <b>an</b> aortic <b>valve</b> with only two leaflets (<b>a</b> normal aortic <b>valve</b> has three leaflets). Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for <b>a</b> replacement heart <b>valve</b> made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against <b>a</b> mechanical <b>valve,</b> the only permanent solution {{available at the time}} of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.|$|R
5|$|Around 1900, Dr. Richard H. Stein, a Berlin musicologist, made a quarter-tone clarinet, {{which was}} soon abandoned. Years later, another German, Fritz Schüller of Markneukirchen, built a quarter tone clarinet, with two {{parallel}} bores of slightly different lengths whose tone holes are operated {{using the same}} keywork and <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> to switch from one bore to the other.|$|E
5|$|Isolation {{manifolded}} twin sets or manifolded doubles {{with two}} regulators, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves {{connected by a}} manifold, with <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves. In {{the event of a}} problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolator valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed. The advantages of this configuration include: a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders; thus, no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive; and in most failure situations, the diver may close <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks. The disadvantages are that the manifold is another potential point of failure, and there is a danger of losing all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs. This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{submarine}} I-179 (originally I-79) was a Kaidai type cruiser submarine of the KD7 sub-class {{built for}} the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the 1940s. She was lost with all hands when <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> was accidentally left open during her sea trials in July 1943. Her wreck was later salvaged and scrapped in 1957.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> shuttle <b>valve</b> is <b>a</b> type of <b>valve</b> {{which allows}} fluid to flow through {{it from one}} of two sources. Generally <b>a</b> shuttle <b>valve</b> is used in {{pneumatic}} systems, although sometimes it will be found in hydraulic systems.|$|R

5|$|The pilots felt a jolt, and the {{autopilot}} disengaged. As Records {{took hold of}} his control column, Haynes focused on the tail engine, whose instruments indicated it was malfunctioning; he found its throttle and fuel supply controls jammed. At Dvorak's suggestion, <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> cutting fuel to the tail engine was shut off. This part of the emergency took 14 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on sales}} data from Amazon.com, Portal 2 was the best-selling {{game in the}} United States {{in the first week}} of its release, but was {{overtaken}} by Mortal Kombat in its second week. According to NPD Group, Portal 2 was the second-best selling game in the U.S. in April 2011, at 637,000 copies, and the fourth-best selling in May. However, NPD does not include sales on Valve's Steam platform. Portal 2 was the best selling game in the U.K. {{in the first week of}} its release, the first number-one for <b>a</b> <b>Valve</b> game. It retained the top spot during its second week.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, {{there is an}} opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass {{directly}} from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in the surface of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale once walls, called the fossa ovalis.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} unintentional arsenic incorporation {{during the}} molecular-beam epitaxial growth of AlSb/InAs/GaSb heterostructures, using both a standard As sub 4 evaporation cell and <b>a</b> <b>valved</b> arsenic cracker. When a standard As, cell is used, unintentional arsenic concentrations {{as large as}} 10 - 20 % {{can be incorporated into}} the AlSb and GaSb layers from the background As ambient in the growth chamber, both during growth and on stationary surfaces. This incorporation can be controlled and suppressed with the use of <b>a</b> <b>valved</b> <b>As</b> cracker. Suppression of the As background substantially improves the electrical transport properties of AlSb/InAs/AlSb quantum well structures...|$|R

40|$|An early {{percutaneous}} catheter-mounted valve The early {{surgical treatment}} of aortic insufficiency can be briefly stated. In 1952, Charles Hufnagel of Chicago invented <b>a</b> ball <b>valve</b> prosthesis that {{was placed in}} the descending thoracic aorta to partially correct regurgitation, and in 1955, Gordon Murray of Toronto placed <b>a</b> homograft <b>valve</b> in the same position. Aortic valve replacement was inaugurated in 1960 by Albert Starr of Seattle with <b>a</b> mechanical <b>valve</b> and in 1962 by Donald Ross of London with <b>a</b> homograft <b>valve.</b> Percutaneous implantation of <b>an</b> aortic <b>valve</b> prosthesis is now a well-established procedure, and it is of some interest to recount what was probably the first attempt to place <b>an</b> artificial heart <b>valve</b> via the arterial route. This was accomplished in dogs in 1965 by Dr Hywel Davies while working at Guy’s Hospital...|$|R
5|$|Often, DVT {{begins in}} the valves of veins. The blood flow pattern in the valves can cause low oxygen {{concentrations}} in the blood (hypoxemia) of <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> sinus. Hypoxemia, which is worsened by venous stasis, activates pathways—ones that include hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1. Hypoxemia also results {{in the production of}} reactive oxygen species, which can activate these pathways, as well as nuclear factor-κB, which regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transcription. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1 contribute to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as P-selectin, prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled microvesicles, which presumably begin clotting after binding to the endothelial surface.|$|E
5|$|Since the anemone lacks a rigid skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which acts as <b>a</b> <b>valve,</b> keeping the gastrovascular cavity {{at a constant}} volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E
5|$|While {{the valve}} is off, the threads of {{cylinder}} and valve are checked {{to identify the}} thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves {{that are to be}} reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked to ensure that <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{duckbill}} <b>valve</b> is <b>a</b> check <b>valve</b> {{in which}} flow proceeds through a soft tube that protrudes into the downstream side. Back-pressure collapses this tube, cutting off flow.|$|R

"Backflow {{prevention}} {{should include}} <b>a</b> check <b>valve</b> between the irrigation pump and the injection device to prevent backward flow; a low-pressure drain to prevent seepage past the check valve; <b>a</b> vacuum relief <b>valve</b> {{to ensure that}} a siphon cannot develop; and <b>a</b> check <b>valve</b> on the injection line." ...|$|R
5|$|During gunnery {{training}} on 5 May, {{there was a}} premature detonation in the left gun of Hyūgas Turret No. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen. Both aft magazines were flooded to douse the resulting fire and save the ship. She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25mm gun mounts were positioned. On 11 May <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> in Ises No. 2 engine room stuck {{in the open position}} and flooded the engine room. While under repair at Kure, both ships received prototype Type 21 radars. Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, {{at the same time that}} most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).|$|E
5|$|Fluor {{has been}} working on the cleanup and {{shutdown}} of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s. In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste. By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project. After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries. In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after complaining that <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.|$|E

50|$|The Dunlop <b>valve,</b> (also called <b>a</b> Woods <b>valve</b> or <b>an</b> English <b>valve)</b> is <b>a</b> type of {{pneumatic}} valve stem {{in use in}} some countries, such as Japan, Czech Republic, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Poland, Romania, Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, Britain, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, {{and a number of}} developing countries, mostly on bicycle inner tubes. It has a wider base than <b>a</b> Presta <b>valve,</b> similar enough in size to <b>a</b> Schrader <b>valve</b> to use identically drilled valve holes in rims, but it can be inflated with <b>a</b> Presta <b>valve</b> adapter. The inner mechanism of the valve can be replaced easily, without the need for special tools. The inventor was C. H. Woods. It superseded Dunlop's original valve for pneumatic tyres.|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} release valve is often one {{of a variety of}} commercially available types such as <b>a</b> plumbing ball <b>valve,</b> <b>an</b> irrigation sprinkler <b>valve</b> or <b>a</b> quick exhaust <b>valve.</b> Experienced builders often make their own valves for this purpose to gain greater flow and faster actuation. The most common custom design used is the piston valve. Multiple valves arranged to be triggered together are occasionally used as an alternative to <b>a</b> single larger <b>valve.</b>|$|R
