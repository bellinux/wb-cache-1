5|$|Though Tech joined {{athletic}} {{conferences in}} other sports during the 1980s, it remained a football independent until 1991, when Virginia Tech {{became a member of}} the Big East conference. In 1993, Tech received an invitation to the Independence bowl, beginning a 16-year streak that has seen the Hokies invited to a bowl game at the conclusion of every season since then. In 1995, the Hokies defeated the Texas Longhorns in the 1995 Sugar Bowl, vaulting them into national prominence. In recent years, Virginia Tech football teams have been ranked among the best in the country according to season-ending polls. In 2000, Virginia Tech participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl, which served as the national championship game of the 1999 college football season. In <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> appearance, the Hokies have participated in several other Bowl Championship Series games, which represent the highest tier of postseason accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|Almost immediately, {{the company}} began looking at the {{possibility}} of converting {{all or part of the}} system into railways. W A Povis, their engineer, was convinced that railways could be built along the routes at around half the cost of building a new line. The move was opposed by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal who argued that closing bits of the inland waterways system would have serious repercussions on the parts left. Robert Stephenson suggested that a number of railways and canals should amalgamate, to reduce competition when bills were presented to Parliament. The canals to join the Ellesmere and Chester Company were the eastern and western branches of the Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. Although some would be converted to railways, the route from Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Barbridge Junction was part of the system that would be retained as a waterway, on which salt was a major source of revenue. The plans resulted in the formation of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in 1846. The new company could raise £3.3 million of new capital, in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> already in existence, with another £1.1 million if necessary. They prompted new railways, but before any of the existing canals were converted, the company was leased to the London and North Western Railway, who took control in June 1847. They allowed the Shropshire Union to continue to operate fairly independently, and by 1849, the idea of conversion had been dropped, as the canals could still operate profitably.|$|E

5|$|The Hokies {{started the}} season well, winning their {{first four games}} in {{succession}} and culminating with a victory against West Virginia in the annual battle for the Black Diamond Trophy. The Hokies, who had begun the season ranked No. 21 in the country, rose to No. 14 by their fifth game of the season, a trip to Syracuse, New York, to play the Syracuse Orange. There, Virginia Tech suffered its first loss of the season, permitting 100-yard rushing games from Syracuse's Malcolm Thomas and Kirby Dar Dar, {{the last time the}} Hokies allowed two hundred-yard rushers in the same game. Tech responded to the loss by reeling off another three wins in succession. That winning streak ended at No. 6 Miami, when Tech lost its second game of the season, a loss that was followed by a season-ending defeat to perennial rival Virginia. The Hokies concluded the regular season with an 84 record overall and a 52 record in the Big East. Ironically, despite their season-ending loss to Virginia, the Hokies were awarded an invitation to the Gator Bowl over the Cavaliers, who lost to North Carolina State in their season-ending game. In <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> loss, Gator Bowl officials later stated they were reluctant to invite an Atlantic Coast Conference team for a fourth straight year, thus opening the door for the Hokies from the Big East.|$|E
