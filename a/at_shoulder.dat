5|$|The tournament {{generated}} {{a profit of}} £10 and the pony roller stayed in use. When the tournament was finished, Henry Jones gathered all the score cards to analyse the results and found that, of the 601 games played during the tournament, 376 were won by the server ("striker-in") and 225 by the receiver ("striker-out"). At {{a time when the}} service was either made underarm or, usually, <b>at</b> <b>shoulder</b> height, this was seen as a serving dominance and resulted in a modification of the rules for the 1878 Championship. To decrease the target area for the server, the length of the service court was reduced from 26 to 22ft (7.92 to 6.71m) and to make passing shots easier against volleyers the height of the net was reduced to 4ft 9 in (1.45m) at the posts and 3 feet (0.91m) at the centre. These rules were published jointly by the AEC & LTC and the MCC, giving the AEC & LTC an official rule-making authority and in effect retroactively sanctioning its 1877 rules. It marked the moment when the AEC & LTC effectively usurped the rule-making initiative from the MCC although the latter would still ratify rule changes until 1882. In recognition of the importance and popularity of lawn tennis, the club was renamed in 1882 to All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC).|$|E

25|$|Stephen Bullock, {{a lawyer}} by profession, who was 150 metres from the shooting, and another {{independent}} witness saw Dan McCann falling backwards {{with his hands}} <b>at</b> <b>shoulder</b> height.

25|$|Whatever the origin, John Willes {{realised}} {{that the}} pace and bounce generated by this raised arm action made the delivery potentially more difficult to play than a conventional underarm one and so he adopted the style himself with his arm coming through <b>at</b> <b>shoulder</b> height. He tried, without success, to have it accepted in senior cricket.|$|E
25|$|The arms {{enter the}} water with the thumbs first <b>at</b> <b>shoulder</b> width.

However, some people prefer to touch in front, because it helps them catch water, {{as long as they}} can do this efficiently, they are not losing anything.|$|E

25|$|The one-handed {{shoulder}} pass involves {{holding the}} ball in one hand behind the shoulder with the elbow bent, and weight on the back foot. The passer then shifts the weight to the forward foot, while moving the ball with their hand forward and extending the elbow, and releasing the ball as the elbow fully extends <b>at</b> <b>shoulder</b> height. The purpose of the one-handed shoulder pass is {{to throw the ball}} a long distance while throwing the ball hard, fast and direct.|$|E
25|$|Lodner D. Phillips {{designed}} the first wholly enclosed ADS in 1856. His design comprised a barrel-shaped upper torso with domed ends and included {{ball and socket}} joints in the articulated arms and legs.

The suit included a ballast tank, a viewing port, entrance through a manhole cover on top, a hand-cranked propeller, and rudimentary manipulators {{at the ends of}} the arms. Air was to be supplied from the surface via hose. There is no indication, however, Phillips' suit was ever constructed.|$|E

The head-and-body length is {{typically}} between [...] This cat stands nearly [...] <b>at</b> <b>shoulder</b> and weighs [...] A study found that body size showed a decrease from west (Israel) to east (India); this was attributed to greater competition from small cats in the east; body size shows a similar decrease from the northern latitudes toward the tropics. Sexually dimorphic, females tend to be smaller and lighter than males.. The face is long and narrow, with a white muzzle. The large, pointed ears, [...] in length and reddish brown on the back, are set close together; a small tuft of black hairs, nearly [...] long, emerges from the tip of both ears. The eyes have yellow irides and elliptical pupils; white lines can be seen around the eye. Dark lines run from the corner of the eyes down the sides of the nose and a dark patch marks the nose. The skull is fairly broad in the region of the zygomatic arch; hence the head of this cat appears relatively rounder.|$|E
