5|$|Marshall {{lived with}} his parents into his thirties. His father died in the late 1880s and his mother died in 1894, leaving him with the family estate and business. In 1895, while working on a case, Marshall met Lois Kimsey who {{was working as a}} clerk in her father's law firm. Despite their nineteen-year <b>age</b> <b>difference,</b> the couple fell in love and married on October 2.

Bicknell decided to tell Sabrina the truth about the experiment, that she was hand-picked to be Day's wife from childhood, and that all of Day's actions were designed to further his goal of turning her into the ideal bride. Horrified, Sabrina wrote to Day to confront him over Bicknell's statements. Day admitted the truth but refused to apologise. After a series of letters, Day gave his consent to the marriage, telling her that the letter would be his final communication with her.|$|E
40|$|The authors report 2 {{experiments}} {{in which they}} examined <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in working memory tasks involving complex item manipulation (i. e., letter-number sequencing). In Experiment 1, <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> on tasks involving item manipulation were not greater than <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> on tasks requiring recall of items in {{the order in which}} they appeared, suggesting that older adults do not have difficulty with item manipulation per se. In Experiment 2, slower presentation rates increased <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in item manipulation spans, although <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> at the fastest rate may be attributed to differences in strategy use. In both experiments, <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> were largest when participants were most likely to be remembering familiar sequences, suggesting that older adults may have difficulties dampening the representations of such sequences once they are activated. Psychologists have long believed that age has little effect on performance of short-term memory tasks requiring mere repetition of items, such as a forward digit span, whereas larger <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> emerge when tasks involve either item manipulation, as in a backward digit span, or divided attention (e. g., Craik, 1977). This belief may be found restated in such authoritativ...|$|R

All <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in scanning rates, however, disappeared when <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in a magnitude-judgment control task were controlled for, showing that <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in memory scanning tasks are not because of the scanning process per se, but because of attention, sensorimotor speed, and decision processes.

40|$|This study {{tested a}} model of the {{development}} of incongruity-resolution and nonsense humor during adulthood. Subjects were 4, 292 14 - to 66 -year-old Germans. Twenty jokes and cartoons representing structure-based humor categories of incongruity resolution and nonsense were rated for funniness and aversiveness. Humor structure preferences were also assessed with a direct comparison task. The results generally confirmed the hypotheses. Incongruity-resolution humor increased in funniness and nonsense humor decreased in funniness among progressively older subjects after the late teens. Aversiveness of both forms of humor generally decreased over the <b>ages</b> sampled. <b>Age</b> <b>differences</b> in humor appreciation were strongly correlated with <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in conservatism.

5|$|In 1913, {{paleontologist}} Charles H. Sternberg recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton {{from the}} slightly older Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. Lawrence Lambe named this dinosaur Gorgosaurus libratus in 1914. Other specimens were later found in Alberta and the US state of Montana. Finding, {{largely due to}} a lack of good Albertosaurus skull material, no significant differences to separate the two taxa, Dale Russell declared the name Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of Albertosaurus, which had been named first, and G. libratus was renamed Albertosaurus libratus in 1970. A species distinction was maintained because of the <b>age</b> <b>difference.</b> This addition extended the temporal range of the genus Albertosaurus backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres.|$|E
5|$|In February 1921 {{he met the}} 21-year-old {{photographer}} Charlotte ("Yolla") Niclas; {{the close}} romantic {{relationship between the two}} was to last many years, despite their <b>age</b> <b>difference.</b> The same year, following a family vacation to the Baltic coast, he began preparatory work on his science fiction novel Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants), which would be published in 1924. In 1920 Döblin joined the Association of German Writers (Schutzverband Deutscher Schriftsteller), and in 1924 he became its president. In November 1921 he began reviewing plays for the Prager Tagblatt, and in 1925 joined the Gruppe 1925, a discussion circle of progressive and communist intellectuals including Bertolt Brecht, Johannes R. Becher, Ernst Bloch, Hermann Kasack, Rudolf Leonhard, Walter Mehring, Robert Musil, Joseph Roth, Ernst Toller, Kurt Tucholsky, and Ernst Weiß, among others. It was likely Brecht, who counted Döblin among his significant influences, who introduced him to Erwin Piscator in 1928.|$|E
5|$|John Struthers {{was the son}} of Dr Alexander Struthers (1767–1853) and {{his wife}} Mary Reid (1793–1859). They lived in Brucefield, a large stone-built 18th century house with spacious grounds, which was then just outside Dunfermline; John was born in the house. Alexander was a wealthy mill owner and linen merchant. He bought Brucefield early in the 19th century, along with Brucefield Mill, a linen {{spinning}} mill built in 1792. Linen was threshed at the nearby threshing mill, and bleached in the open air near the house. There were still linen bleachers living in Brucefield House in 1841, but they had gone by 1851, leaving the house as the seat of the Struthers family. Mary's father, Deacon John Reid, was also a linen maker. Alexander and Mary were married in 1818; the marriage, though not warmly affectionate, lasted until Alexander's death despite the large <b>age</b> <b>difference.</b> Both Alexander and Mary are buried at Dunfermline Abbey.|$|E
40|$|The {{studies in}} this {{dissertation}} asses <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> {{in the experience}} of pain in humans and animals and the appropriateness of pain assessment tools across the adult life-span. Chapter I reviews <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in experimental, acute and chronic pain in humans. Chapter 2 reviews <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in the outcome of psychological treatments for chronic pain. It is concluded do there are <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in each type of pain and that the elderly appear to benefit from psychological treatments as much as younger groups. Several experiments were conducted to examine the concepts that the elderly believe that pain is an inevitable part of aging and are not distressed by it, and that they experience less interim pain than younger patients. However, Chapter 3 presents two studies which find no <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in pain beliefs. Furthermore, the studies described in Chapters 4 and 5 suggest that there may be <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in the perceived qualities of chronic pain, measured with the short and full form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), but no <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in pain intensity measured with single-item scales The data from Chapters 3, 4 and 5 suggest that the affective and cognitive components of chronic pain do not differ among age groups. Analysis of the psychometric properties of the pain measures suggests that verbal descriptor scales of pain intensity and both forms of the MPQ may be appropriate for use across the adult life-span. However, visual analog scales may not be appropriate for use with the elderly. To further elucidate the effects of aging on pain, Chapter 6 reviews <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in nociceptive responsivity and pain behaviours in the rat. This review suggests that reflexive responses to nociceptive stimuli may not be age dependent although sensitivity on tests of more highly organized behaviours may decrease with age.

40|$|Younger {{employees}} are often promoted into supervisory positions {{in which they}} then manage older subordinates.

We propose that the average <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> determine how frequently older subordinates and their coworkers experience negative emotions, and that these emotion frequency levels in turn relate to company performance. The indirect relationship between <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> and performance occurs only if subordinates express their feelings toward their supervisor, but the association is neutralized if emotions are suppressed.

5|$|As a child, Juha Vainio loved {{singing and}} the family's {{neighbours}} often {{asked him to}} come over and perform. When the Winter War started in 1939, Juha was too young to understand events. After his father went to war as a captain of the military reserve force, Juha moved with his mother to Metsola, Kotka. As an adult, the only thing Juha Vainio remembered from the war were the air-raid sirens and people's anxiety. He once said that he was more afraid of the women next door than the war, {{but on the other hand}} admitted that the war left him with emotional scars. His song Eräänlainen sotaveteraani ("Some Kind of War Veteran"), on the album Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is"), echoes these sentiments. Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed, Juha and his mother had to often evacuate. Sometimes they went to stay at her mother's cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen, a cousin of his mother. The two had an <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> of six years. The only brother of Kaarina Vainio, Mauno, was killed in the war.|$|E
5|$|The February 1852 {{death of}} Prime Minister Rainiharo left the queen without her consort, long-time {{political}} adviser and military Commander-in-Chief. She consequently awarded Rainilaiarivony a double promotion to Twelfth Honor ten days afterward, {{in preparation for}} an increase in military and political responsibilities. Shortly thereafter the queen expressed romantic interest in Rainilaiarivony and proposed that he assume the former role of his father as prince consort and Prime Minister. The young man refused on the double basis of their <b>age</b> <b>difference,</b> the queen being forty years his senior, as well as the perceived impropriety of becoming intimate with his father's former lover. Ranavalona continued to harbor feelings for him throughout her lifetime but she did not express resentment over his refusal to reciprocate them and went on to take another high-ranking official as consort: Rainijohary, who was jointly awarded the role of Prime Minister along with the new Commander-in-Chief, Rainivoninahitriniony. Within a year the queen had assigned the 24-year-old Rainilaiarivony to his first position of responsibility within the military, and promoted him to Royal Secretary, keeper of the Royal Seal, and supervisor to the Royal Treasurer.|$|E

40|$|Implicit {{tests of}} memory assess the {{influence}} of recent experience without requiring awareness of remembering. Evidence concerning <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> on implicit tests of memory suggests small <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in favor of younger adults. However, the majority of research examining this issue has relied upon perceptually based implicit tests. Recently, a second type of implicit test, one that relies upon conceptually based processes, has been identified. The pattern of <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> on this second type of implicit test is less clear. In the present study, we examined the pattern of <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> oh one conceptually based (fact completion) and one perceptually based (stem completion) implicit test of memory, {{as well as two}} explicit tests of memory (fact and word recall). Tasks were administered to 403 adults from three age groups (19 - 34 years, 58 - 73 years, 74 - 89 years).
