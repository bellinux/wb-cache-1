5|$|According to Meek, Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead, yet Borshchland lives on. Recipes, like birds, ignore {{political}} boundaries.... The faint {{outline of}} the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot <b>and</b> <b>cabbage</b> in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and, in emigration, from Brooklyn to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|On a more {{practical}} level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the top priority of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas <b>and</b> <b>cabbage</b> to Britain.|$|E

5|$|Pliny the Elder {{wrote about}} the use of onions <b>and</b> <b>cabbage</b> in Pompeii. He {{documented}} Roman beliefs about the onion's ability to improve vision ailments, aid in sleep, and heal everything from mouth sores and toothaches, to dog bites, lumbago and even dysentery. Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after it was buried in a volcanic explosion found gardens of Pliny's detailed narratives, where onions had grown.|$|E
5|$|The two-storied {{structure}} is rectangular in plan. The portico has four Ionic columns with fluted stems <b>and</b> <b>cabbage</b> leaf capitals. The front gables {{of the building}} have Renaissance style plaster moulding. The {{lower part of the}} exterior walls are made of plastered brick. The upper windows have semi-circular French windows, with pilasters on both sides. In 1902 a new royal mint department was constructed outside the palace's walls and the old mint building was left vacant. The building was then first converted for use as a royal guards barracks and later as a royal guards officer's club.|$|E
5|$|The cooling {{properties}} of the leaves were used in Britain {{as a treatment for}} trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses. Accumulated scientific evidence corroborates that cabbage leaf treatment can reduce the pain and hardness of engorged breasts, and increase the duration of breast feeding. Other medicinal uses recorded in European folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism, sore throat, hoarseness, colic, and melancholy. In the United States, cabbage {{has been used as a}} hangover cure, to treat abscesses, to prevent sunstroke, or to cool body parts affected by fevers. The leaves have also been used to soothe sore feet and, when tied around a child's neck, to relieve croup. Both mashed cabbage <b>and</b> <b>cabbage</b> juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts, pneumonia, appendicitis, and ulcers.|$|E

5|$|Cabbage is {{prepared}} and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it, though many cuisines pickle, stew, sautée or braise cabbage. Pickling {{is one of}} the most popular ways of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from Chinese cabbage (B.rapa). Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. Bean curd <b>and</b> <b>cabbage</b> is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat. In Poland, cabbage {{is one of the}} main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient.

25|$|In {{the north}} of Italy, in particular, in the Friuli region of the northeast, {{potatoes}} serve to make a type of pasta called gnocchi.

25|$|When {{structures}} in different species {{are believed to}} exist and develop {{as a result of}} common, inherited genetic pathways, those structures are termed homologous. For example, the leaves of pine, oak, <b>and</b> <b>cabbage</b> all look very different, but share certain basic structures and arrangement of parts. The homology of leaves is an easy conclusion to make. The plant morphologist goes further, and discovers that the spines of cactus also share the same basic structure and development as leaves in other plants, and therefore cactus spines are homologous to leaves as well.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigated}} and compared the fermentation characteristics of intact kimchi <b>and</b> brined baechu <b>cabbage</b> <b>and</b> seasoning fermented separately. Fermentation characteristics of kimchi, brined baechu <b>cabbage</b> <b>and</b> season-ing, such as pH, acidity, microbial counts, and springiness were measured during the fermentation period (4 weeks at 4 °C). Changes in pH, acidity, and microbial counts of the seasoning fermented separately were slower {{than those of}} brined baechu <b>cabbage</b> <b>and</b> kimchi itself. The fermentation characteristics of brined baechu cabbage were {{very similar to those}} of kimchi during the fermentation period. Additionally, we manufactured and fermented kimchi, after which baechu <b>cabbage</b> <b>and</b> seasoning were separated shortly before the measurements. Baechu <b>cabbage</b> <b>and</b> seasoning separated instantly from kimchi showed similar fermentation characteristics to their separately fermented counterparts.
