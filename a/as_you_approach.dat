25|$|The {{earliest}} {{accounts of}} Blue Licks {{describe it as}} a place where animals gathered to lick the salt deposits flowing from the springs in the area. The Reverend James Smith provides this account in his 1795–97 diary: <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>approach</b> the Licks, at the distance of 4 or 5 miles from it, you begin to perceive the change. The earth seems to be worn away; the roots of the trees lie naked and bare; the rocks forsaken of the earth, that once covered them, lie naked on the neighboring hills, and roads of an amazing size, in all directions, unite at the Licks, as their common center. Here immense herds of buffalo used formerly to meet and with their fighting, scraping etc., have worn away the ground to what it is at present.|$|E
500|$|Aether is a space {{adventure}} {{game with}} washed-out pastel colors and a varying soundtrack {{consisting of a}} piano, synthesizer, guitar, and percussion piece. There are four monochrome planets to explore, which have subdued hues. Players control a lonely boy from Earth and an octopus-like monster he befriends. The monster's tongue is used to propel itself and the boy through space and onto other planets. Each planet has a unique soundtrack that gets louder <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>approach</b> it. Each moon or planet exerts gravity over the player character, requiring momentum {{to escape from the}} planet's orbit. To escape a planet, the tongue must first be latched onto a cloud floating above the planet's surface, which can then be used to swing the player around. By propelling themselves from the initial cloud using swinging momentum, players can latch onto the next and repeat the process to leave the planet's orbit. After reaching space the process is repeated with stars and asteroids. In space the lack of gravity causes the player to drift until the direction is changed by swinging on another object.|$|E

Larson once shot a 75 in 39 minutes and 9 seconds on a 6,500 course with a slope rating of 125 (using the old rules of speed golf where one could have a caddy in a cart riding {{out in front of}} you carrying your clubs and calling out distances <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>approached</b> the ball).|$|R
2500|$|Prosthetics {{designers}} should {{carefully consider}} {{the nature of}} dimensionality alteration of sensorimotor signaling from and to the CNS when designing prothesitic devices. As reported in literatures, neural signaling from the CNS to the motors is organized {{in a way that}} the dimensionalities of the signals are gradually increased <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>approach</b> the muscles, also called muscle synergies. In the same principal, but in opposite ordering, on the other hand, signals dimensionalities from the sensory receptors are gradually integrated, also called sensory synergies, as they approaches the CNS. This bow tie like signaling formation enables the CNS to process abstract yet valuable information only. Such as process will decrease complexity of the data, handle the noises and guarantee to the CNS the optimum energy consumption.|$|E
2500|$|Heather Phares {{opined that}} [...] "Danilova's throatily majestic voice" [...] is [...] "as unmistakable as ever. Her {{instrument}} is undeniably powerful, and more controlled here {{than it was}} before", but still demonstrates [...] "remarkable rawness and vulnerability". Sam Shepherd wrote that [...] "er voice is so unique and haunting that it is instantly recognisable." [...] Brian Howe of Pitchfork commented, [...] "Whatever biosphere you choose to project on it , Danilova's voice remains fixed on a faraway horizon, receding <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>approach.</b> When she bursts into the foreground on 'Avalanche' and stays there {{for the remainder of}} the album, the impression of impassable distance lingers. This is partly because of the authority of Danilova's voice, and partly because the music gives nothing away, thrumming along with power that shades into ambivalence toward the shifting emotional register of the singing. The results are dramatic but never melodramatic, as Danilova maps the dimensions of her self-imprisonment with resolve." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Temple family fortune {{was based}} on sheep farming, they were first {{recorded}} as such at Witney in Oxfordshire. Later from 1546 they had been renting a sheep farm in Burton Dassett in Warwickshire. The Stowe estate was leased from Thomas Gifford in 1571 by Peter Temple, his son John Temple bought the manor and estate of Stowe in 1589 and it became {{the home of the}} Temple family. In the late 17th century, the house was completely rebuilt by Sir Richard Temple, 3rd Baronet, (c.1683) on the present site. This house is now the core of the mansion known today. The old medieval stronghold was located near Stowe Parish Church that is about 100 yards to the south-east of the current house. Having been redesigned subsequently over the years, the whole front is now [...] in length and can be seen <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>approach</b> from the direction of Buckingham.

The driveway approach to the house is still in use today, although it no longer runs through the arch.|$|E

50|$|The Gerhard Marcks Museum's {{building}} and Wilhelm Wagenfeld House were {{built as a}} pair in 1825. The two buildings were {{designed to be a}} gatehouse and a prison located {{on either side of the}} road <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>approached</b> or left the town. They were both designed by the architect Friedrich Moritz Stamm. Until 1848 these buildings were used to close the city at night and to charge any customs tax that was due on goods travelling across the city's perimeter. The museum's building has been extended twice to create space for its new function as a museum. The conversion work was done in 1991 by Peter Schnorrenberger and was designed to complement the existing building. Although the two buildings have only one row of windows at the front, they both have two storeys and matching Doric columns.|$|R

5000|$|The DC-3 was a {{two-stage}} {{vehicle with}} a large booster and smaller shuttle of overall similar design. Both were similar to [...] "jumbo jets" [...] in layout in general terms, with their large cylindrical fuselage containing fuel tanks instead of passengers or cargo. The bottom of the fuselage was flattened for re-entry aerodynamics, with a slight upward curve <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>approached</b> the nose in early models. The wings were low-mounted, in-line with {{the bottom of the}} fuselage, with a 14 degree rearward sweep on the front and no sweep on the back. The general layout of the wing planform was similar to the original DC-3. The empennage was a conventional three-surface unit, although in the original MSC-001 design the delta-shaped horizontal stabilizer was located {{at the bottom of the}} fuselage and served double-duty in protecting the rear-mounted engines during re-entry. Later versions did not generally include this feature, and used more conventional surfaces mid-mounted on the fuselage.|$|R

60|$|But {{sometimes}} they were {{interrupted by a}} fierce endeavor to carry the lair, when boys from Cathro's climbed to it up each other's backs, the rope, of course, having been pulled into safety at the first sound, and then that end of the Den rang with shouts, and deeds of valor on both sides were as common as pine needles, and once Tommy and Corp were only saved from captors who had them down, by Grizel rushing into the midst of things with two flaring torches, and another time bold Birkie, most daring of the storming party, was seized with two others and made to walk the plank. The plank {{had been part of}} a gate, and was suspended over the bank of the Silent Pool, so that, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>approached</b> the farther end, down you went.

50|$|The first sets {{consisted}} {{of up to}} 4 Formula 5000 cars. The track (which stayed the same throughout successive generations of cars) was wide enough for two cars side by side and had raised edges along both sides to prevent the cars from leaving the track. No {{more than one or}} two cars could be controlled and raced. They were controlled by the user by means of a trigger controller which also carried a toggle switch. When switched up, the car would travel in the outermost lane of the track, when switched down, the car would travel in the innermost lane of the track. By this means, the user could genuinely overtake their opponent by switching lanes at the correct moment. The two remaining cars were 'Jam Cars' which would run around the track when either or both of the trigger controllers were depressed. The Jam Cars were slower than the racing cars and had front wheels that were fixed to steer permanently left or right. This meant that a Jam Car was relatively easy to pass, or manoeuvred automatically out of the way <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>approached</b> (<b>as</b> a lapped vehicle would in a race).|$|R
60|$|Grasmere, 1803. These Yew-trees {{are still}} standing, but {{the spread of}} that at Lorton is much diminished by mutilation.

Calculating upon what I have observed of the slow growth of this tree in rocky situations, and of its durability, I have often thought that the one I am describing must have been as old as the Christian era. The tree lay in the line of a fence. Great masses of its ruins were strewn about, and some had been rolled down the hill-side and lay near the road at the bottom. As <b>you</b> <b>approached</b> the tree <b>you</b> were struck with the number of shrubs and young plants, ashes, &c. which had found a bed upon the decayed trunk and grew to no inconsiderable height, forming, as it were, a part of the hedgerow. In no part of England, or of Europe, have I ever seen a yew-tree at all approaching this in magnitude, as it must have stood. By the bye, Hutton, the Old Guide of Keswick, had been so imprest with the remains of this tree that he used gravely to tell strangers that there could be no doubt of its having been in existence before the Flood.|$|R

Into it your track apparently runs point-blank: a confronting mass which, if it were to slip down, would overwhelm the whole town. But in a moment you find that the road, the old Roman highway into the peninsula, turns at a sharp angle when it reaches the base of the scarp, and ascends in the stiffest of inclines to the right. To the left there is also another ascending road, modern, almost as steep as the first, and perfectly straight. This is the road to the forts.|$|E
60|$|The {{country which}} lies between {{the waters of}} the Hudson and Long Island Sound, is, for the first forty miles from their junction, a {{succession}} of hills and dales.

But <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>approach</b> the Hudson, the rugged aspect increases, until you at length meet with the formidable barrier of the Highlands. Here the neutral ground ceased. The royal army held the two points of land that commanded the southern entrance of the river into the mountains; but all the remaining passes were guarded by the Americans.|$|E
60|$|Chickadee wears well. He {{is not in}} {{the least}} a {{creature}} of moods.

An insect must hide well to escape those bright eyes. He is helping you raise your plants. He looks up brightly <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>approach,</b> hops fearlessly down and looks at you with frank, innocent eyes. Chick a dee dee dee dee! Tsic a de-e-e?--this last with a rising inflection, as if he were asking how you were, after he had said good-morning.
