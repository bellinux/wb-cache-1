25|$|Before {{implementing}} the Single Audit, {{the federal government}} relied on numerous audits carried out on individual federally funded programs to ensure these funds were spent properly. Because the government had numerous agencies awarding hundreds of different programs, the task of auditing all programs became increasingly difficult and time consuming.

40|$|Background: In November 2010, the {{statutory}} <b>audit</b> <b>requirement</b> in Sweden was abolished for Swedish SMEs. The abolishment {{was the result}} of the objective of a 25 % reduction of administrative costs, for companies within the European Union. Further on, Sweden is considered to have a bank-oriented system, which means that banks play an important role when it comes to financing SMEs. When assessing the creditworthiness of an SME, financial accounting information is an important source of information for the banks. This means that banks are concerned by the abolishment of {{the statutory}} <b>audit</b> <b>requirement</b> since one of their most important source of information no longer has to be reviewed by a third party. Aim: The aim of this thesis is to investigate how the new legislation regarding the abolishment of the statutory <b>audit</b> <b>requirement</b> affects the credit assessment process of a Swedish bank located in a metropolitan area and a Swedish bank with a distinct local profile. Method: Due to the complexity of the subject of this thesis, interviews have been performed in order to receive more deeply understanding for the subject and to find out the arguments behind the banks’ opinions regarding the abolishment of the statutory <b>audit</b> <b>requirement.</b> Three personal interviews have been performed with a total number of four respondents. The empirical data was then analyzed based on the frame of reference to be able to answer the research questions. Conclusion: The conclusion of this thesis is that the credit assessment process of the investigated banks is not greatly affected by the abolishment of the statutory <b>audit</b> <b>requirement</b> and that no major differences exist between the different bank types. Contrary to previous research, this thesis also concludes that no major differences can be found in the credit process of the two types of banks compared. Further research: It would be interesting to further investigate how the abolishment of the statutory <b>audit</b> <b>requirement</b> has affected the credit assessments after a period of time. Will there be a different result after a couple of years when the banks have had the opportunity to fully adapt to the new legislation?

40|$|In this study, we empirically {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} financial and <b>auditing</b> <b>requirements,</b> capital requirements, official supervisory power, {{and the likelihood of}} receiving a qualified audit opinion. The sample consists of 71 qualified financial statements and 17, 526 unqualified ones, from 3, 642 banking institutions operating in 15 old and new EU countries over the period 1999 - 2006. The results indicate that financial and <b>auditing</b> <b>requirements</b> have a negative influence, while supervisory power has a positive impact, on the likelihood of qualified audit opinions. Concerning capital requirements, we find that only initial stringency has an impact on audit opinions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R

40|$|November 1, 2010 the <b>audit</b> <b>requirement</b> in Sweden {{for small}} and medium {{enterprises}} was abolished, {{after many years}} of discussion. This essay aims {{to examine the effects of}} the abolishment of the <b>audit</b> <b>requirement</b> on credit. The intention is to draw conclusions about how the possible negative effects of the abolishment of the <b>audit</b> <b>requirement</b> could be prevented. The study has been made using a qualitative method to get a clearer and broader explanation that leads to deeper understanding. It includes an interview with creditors from one of the largest banks whose position represents a large group of lenders. In addition to the lender, two auditors with years of experience have been interviewed. Analysis of collected data has shown that there are both advantages and disadvantages of abolished mandatory auditing. One advantage of the audit abolition is that entrepreneurs no longer see the auditor as a constraint, but now they can see the added value of the skilled help that they can get. The disadvantages are that if companies opt out of the auditor, it could possibly lead to fewer companies qualified for credit because of the lack of audited accounts. The essay group consists of Oksana Brodin and Maria Lindén, who choose to study this topic because auditing is an economically relevant subject. The essay is written at Södertörn University, with Cheick Wagué as supervisor. Many thanks to the supervisor and opponent group for fruitful discussions and valuable comments. We thank our respondents for an interesting and committed cooperation in the study and hope that the essay can be a support to the stakeholders who work with credit, and to entrepreneurs of small and medium enterprises...|$|R

40|$|Background: The audit has {{not always}} been as it is today. The first law {{requiring}} auditing was legislated in the Companies Act 1895. Many events have taken place in the audit history; among them was the Krueger crash, which affected the auditing profession hard in Sweden. This led to new recommendations and laws that would save the profession. Because of the events in the past, there are many who question the audit profession and discussions have been held regarding the auditor's independence and objectivity. Nov. 1, 2010 abolished the <b>audit</b> <b>requirement</b> for certain companies. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe and analyze the role of the auditor - the independence and objectivity, by perusing the number of qualified / unqualified audit reports, before and after removal of the <b>audit</b> <b>requirement.</b> Methodology: To answer the study's purpose, a quantitative study was conducted in which 400 annual reports from Stockholm and 200 annual reports outside of Stockholm, has been selected to be examined, to see how the number of qualified / unqualified audit reports has changed during the years 2008 - 2011. Theoretical Framework: The theories that have been applied in the study are the auditor's role, Independence & Objectivity and Profession. Framework: To complement the theoretical framework the audit significance, audit procedure, audit report and previous studies have been applied. Empirism: The data collected for this study is illustrated in diagrams showing that 2010 was a defining year where most unqualified audit reports were reported, while the remaining years showed non or few unqualified audit reports. Conclusion: Based on the empirical evidence presented, auditor's independence and objectivity has been questioned. Clear indications that the <b>audit</b> <b>requirement</b> has influenced the audit profession is illustrated in the diagrams from empirical data, however, it is too early to say if it has a positive or negative impact on profession...|$|R
