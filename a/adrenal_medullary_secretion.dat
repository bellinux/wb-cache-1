40|$|In dogs caused {{experimental}} strangulation obstruction by ligation of {{the upper}} small intestine together with the mesentery measuring 80 cm in length, adrenal venous blood was observed for the secretion rate of adrenaline and noradrenaline by the fluorimetric method. Increase of <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> <b>secretion</b> was not induced by the continued strangulation alone. However, when the strangulation was released three hours after the onset, the secretion rate of adrenaline and noradrenaline increased rapidly. When 250 mg of kanamycin was injected into the strangulated intestinal loop and the obstruction was released three hours later, the increase of <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> <b>secretion</b> was slight. When the strangulated intestinal loop was resected and anastomosed three hours after the onset of obstruction, the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> <b>secretion</b> showed no increase. When strangulation was released after resection of the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves on the side wherefrom the adrenal venous blood was drawn, any increase in secretion rate of adrenaline and noradrenaline did not occur. In brief, the release of strangulation obstruction {{was followed by a}} remarkable increase of <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> <b>secretion</b> rate and the state of sympathetic overactivity in experimental animals.

40|$|ACONTINUOUS SUPPLY of glucose is {{essential}} for the function and survival of the brain. Glucoprivation, a condition of reduced brain glucose availability, evokes glucoregulatory responses adapted to restore the availability of th{{is essential}} fuel. Administration of 2 -deoxy-d-glucose (2 DG), a competitive inhibitor of intracellular glucose use (1), induces glucoprivation and triggers a number of glucoregulatory responses, including hyperphagia (2 – 4), increased <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> <b>secretion</b> (5 – 7), and inhibition of the estrous cycle (8 – 10). Although the specific location and phenotype of these hindbrain glucoreceptive cells are still unknown, studies using the retrogradely transported catecholamine immunotoxin, anti-dopamine-�-hydroxylase (anti-DBH) -saporin (DSAP), have shown that hindbrain norepinephrine (NE) and/or epinephrine (E) neurons are required for elicitation of major glucoregulatory responses, including increased feeding, corticosterone secretion, and <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> <b>secretion</b> (10 – 12).

40|$|PREVIOUS {{studies have}} {{indicated}} thatreduced tissue oxygen supply due to hy-poxia or to hemorrhagic hypotension may increase <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> <b>secretion.</b> Cannon and Hoskins 1 studied asphyxiated cats by sampling inferior vena caval blood from an area just above the adrenal veins. These work-ers demonstrated inhibition of rabbit intestine contraction by vena caval blood during as-phyxia, suggesting epinephrine release. Hous-say and Molinelli 2 anastomosed the left lumbo-adrenal vein of the dog to the jugular vein of another dog. Hypoxia in the donor animal produced tachycardia and increased systemic blood pressure in the recipient, suggesting in-creased <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> <b>secretion.</b> Baugh, Cornett, and Hatcher 3 produced hypoxia in dogs by 6 per cent 02 in N 2 breathing and observed an increase of cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, respiratory rate, and hem-atocrit.

40|$|Neuroendocrine and {{behavioral}} effects of subcutaneously administered AVP (6 µg/kg b. wt.) were determined in resting conditions {{and after the}} mild stress of transportation to and placement in a novel environment. In resting conditions, systemic administration of AVP caused a rapid increase in blood glucose level and a long-lasting increase in CORT secretion. A decrease in circulating plasma NE level was observed. AVP did not affect <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> E <b>secretion.</b> The stress-induced sympathetic activation, as reflected in plasma NE level, was inhibited 60 min after AVP administration. Stress-induced increases in blood glucose, CORT, and E secretion were not influenced by AVP. In resting condition, AVP caused a 60 -min lasting increase in grooming behavior with a concomitant decrease in time spent resting. Sixty minutes after administration, the behavioral activation after the stress of transportation and placement in a novel environment was more rapidly terminated in AVP-treated rats than in vehicle-treated control rats. The state- and time-dependent modulation of spontaneous behavior suggests that AVP has arousing properties shortly after administration when marked pressor and endocrine effects are apparent.

50|$|Neuroendocrine {{cells are}} cells that receive {{neuronal}} input (neurotransmitters released by nerve cells or neurosecretory cells) and, {{as a consequence}} of this input, release message molecules (hormones) to the blood. In this way they bring about an integration between the nervous system and the endocrine system, a process known as neuroendocrine integration. An example of a neuroendocrine cell is a cell of the adrenal medulla (innermost part of the adrenal gland), which releases adrenaline to the blood. The <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> cells are controlled by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. These cells are modified postganglionic neurons. Autonomic nerve fibers lead directly to them from the central nervous system. The <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> hormones are kept in vesicles much in the same way neurotransmitters are kept in neuronal vesicles. Hormonal effects can last up to ten times longer than those of neurotransmitters. Sympathetic nerve fiber impulses stimulate the release of <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> hormones.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the mechanisms by which systemically admiitered arginine-vasopressin (AVP) modulates behavior and autonomic functioning, (neuro) endoaine and behavioral measurements were taken in young adult male Wistar rats. The effects of subcutaneously admiitered AVP (6 pg/kg b. wt.) were determined in resting and mild emotional stress conditions before and 5 to 92 min after treatment. Systemic admiitration of AVP caused a biphasic increase in blood glucose level, a long-lasting increase in CORT secretion, and a decrease in circulating NE under resting condition. It did not affect <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> E <b>secretion.</b> The stress induced sympathetic activation as reflected in plasma NE level was inhibited 60 min after AVP admiitration. In resting condition AVP caused a 60 min lasting increase in grooming behavior with a concomitant decrease in time spent resting. Sixty min after administration, AVP-treated rats were less active after the mild emotional stress of transportation and placement in a novel environment than vehicle-treated control rats. The results suggest that AVP may modulate behavior not only by its hypothesized direct action in the brain or by its systemic pressor effect, but also by enhancing blood glucose and adrenal CORT secretion. The vasopressinergic sympatho-inhibitory action {{may play a role in}} the previously reported vasopressinergic enhancement of parasympathetic cardiac stress responsiveness. Furthermore, this action of AVP and the suppression of stress induced active behavior suggest that AVP may also be a neuroendocrine factor with dearousing properties...|$|R

In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis of developmental marker expression and other well-recognized prognostic variables, evidence of maturation along a fetal ganglionic lineage, as monitored by HNK- 1 immunoreactivity (relative risk of 6. 42, P 2 = 0. 0001), and age at diagnosis (relative risk of 5. 05, P 2 = 0. 0042) were independent and significant prognostic indicators of patient survival.

40|$|The {{syndrome}} of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia is inherited as an {{autosomal dominant}} trait, and {{is characterized by}} development of bilateral and multicentric thyroidal and <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> tumors.

40|$|The {{effects of}} severe {{arterial}} hypoxia (breathing low 0 ₂ mixtures), and primary tissue hypoxia (breathing 0. 2 % CO + 21 % 0 ₂) with normal arterial Po₂, on the sympatho-adrenal (S-A) activity, {{have been studied}} in unanesthetized rabbits. In arterial hypoxia the chemoreceptors are {{the primary source of}} reflex activity, whereas this increases through baroreceptor reflexes in primary tissue hypoxia. In arterial hypoxia total S-A discharge increases markedly, and there is preponderance of sympathetic nerve activity over <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> hormone <b>secretion.</b> In primary tissue hypoxia total S-A discharge is smaller, and activity of both S-A components is balanced more evenly. Changes in peripheral blood flow (portal vein, renal vein, muscle, ear, and hindlimb skin) observed in normal animals differ in the two types of hypoxia, and the flow changes in each type in the various beds are not uniform. The differences between the two types of hypoxia are greatly reduced in "de-efferented" animals without autonomic effectors, suggesting a similarity of local dilator effects on a given bed. The experiments suggest that the nonuniform blood-flow patterns seen in normal animals after strong stimulation of a specific receptor occur despite a diffusely acting neural discharge on most vascular beds controlled by the S-A system. Stimulation of different receptors varies the total S-A discharge, and the proportion of neural relative to adrenal activity. Despite the generalized S-A discharge produced by stimulating one receptor, nonuniform blood-flow patterns are produced, as a result of differences in the mode of action on the various beds of the adrenal hormones acting as peripheral inhibitory or excitatory modulators of sympathetic nerve activity and because of differences in local factors. The ear skin blood-flow responses are an exception to the hypothesis of a diffusely acting generalized S-A discharge, since in this region (and to a lesser extent in the body skin) with a special thermoregulatory function, the direction of change in sympathetic nerve discharge diverges from that of the other vascular beds...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to test the possibility that histological changes of the sciatic nerve in a neuropathic model as well as sensory dysfunction are repaired by <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> transplantation. Material and Methods: Left sciatic nerve was ligated in three groups of rats by 4 loose ligatures (CCI). After one week of nerve constriction, rats of first group were implanted with <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> tissue (CCI + adrenal medulla) and rats of the second group with striated muscle at the level of L 1 -L 2 (CCI + muscle). The third group received only left ligature (CCI) and in the fourth group the sciatic nerve was exposed and then muscle and skin sutured (sham). Behavioral assessment was evaluated before surgery and 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56 days after the onset of experiment. According to behavioral results, 4 rats in each group were anesthetized and then the distal part of sciatic nerve were isolated and prepared for histological quantitative investigation of nerve regeneration. Results: The results showed that CCI was accompanied with hyperalgesia and morphological changes in the distal part of sciatic nerve.

40|$|Interest in <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> {{function}} {{has been}} revived {{in recent years}} by the demonstration that the adrenal medulla produces two hormones, epi-nephrine and nor-epinephrine. Nor-epinephrine, which is also produced by adrenergic nerves (1), differs in its chemical structure from epinephrine by the absence of an N-methyl group, and is the probable precursor of epinephrine. The obser-vation by Goldenberg, Faber, Alston, and Chargaff (2) that <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> extract from cattle (natural epinephrine, U. S.

40|$|Abstract. Pheochromocytomas and <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> {{hyperplasia}} {{were investigated}} ultra-structurally and by assaying catecholamines in tissue and urine. Three of seven bulls had concomitant thyroid C-cell neoplasms and normal parathyroid glands.

Two pheochromocytomas were composed of cells with ultrastructural characteristics of the epinephrine-secreting type and contained round secretory granules of low electron density. The norepinephrine-secreting type of chromaffi cell predominated in one pheochromocytoma and had storage granules with an electron-dense, eccentric core and a wide submembranous space. Two pheochromocytomas were composed of a mixture of epinephrine- and norepinephrine-secreting cells. <b>Adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> hyperplasia in four bulls consisted of multinodular or diffuse areas of hyperchromatic chromaffi cells that were non-encapsulated, and compressed adjacent cortical tissue.

Fragments efficiently bound to bovine <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> and cortical cells, a binding that was specifically displaced by AIV > AIII = AII.

40|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} of mammals has a {{heterogeneous}} population of cells. In adults most are epithelial cells containing {{a particular type}} of cytoplasmic granule. Based on a variety of cytochemical and ultrastructural studies it is now accepted that 2 different <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> chromaffin cell types can be distinguished, i. e. noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) synthesising and storing cells. Other cell types present in the adrenal medulla include neuronal elements comprising either cell bodies or nerve fibres entering from outside the gland (extrinsic innervation). It is assumed that <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> cells have a limited life span, i. e. they are replaced after a certain period. Data on this replacement process are scarce.

40|$|Abstract– Neural {{grafting}} {{has over}} the last decade emerged as a possible tool for the substitution of damaged neurons in the central nervous system and for the promotion of symptomatic recovery after brain damage. Transplantation studies in the 6 ‐hydroxydopamine lesion rat model of Parkinson's disease were initiated in the late seventies. The first studies were based on the neuronal replacement paradigm, using developing dopamine brain cells obtained from the substantia nigra region of embryonic cadavers. When implanted into the striatum such grafts were found to reinnervate part of the previously denervated striatum and restore dopamine turnover and release to near‐normal levels. In both rats and monkeys the nigral grafts have been shown to normalize some, but not all, Parkinson‐like symptoms in the dopamine deficient recipients. Grafting of <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> tissue was introduced in the early eighties {{as an alternative to the}} use of embryonic cadaver tissue. The <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> grafts have, however, so far shown poor long‐term survival in both rats and monkeys, and consistent with this no sustained dopamine release have been observed in the brain of long‐term grafted animals. Likewise, no long‐lasting effects of <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> grafts on spontaneous motor or sensori‐motor behavior have so far been documented in either the rat or the monkey model. The results so far reported from trials using <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> grafts in patients with Parkinson's disease appear to conform to the available animal experimental data at least in two important respects: significant long‐term graft survival has not been possible to document, and any clear‐cut functional effects consistent with sustained graft‐induced dopamine release have not been demonstrated. Initial results from ongoing trials using grafts of fetal nigral tissue are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> chromaffin {{cells are}} a {{potential}} source of neuroactive substances for transplantation into the CNS to alleviate neurochemical deficits. In particular, work in our laboratory has suggested that <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> transplants. in the spinal subarachnoid space can alleviate pain by providing sustained local delivery of catecholamines and opioid peptides. One of the major limitations for clinical application of neural transplantation is the availability of donor material in sufficient quantities.

40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{evaluate}} the significance of the endothelin system in catecholamine release and synthesis in the adrenal gland. Main Methods: Primary cultures of isolated bovine <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> cells were prepared. Gene expression, intracellular calcium changes, epinephrine release, and other factors were investigated. Key findings: Expression of endothelin receptors in the rat adrenal gland was confirmed. Intravenous infusion of endothelin- 1 (1. 0 nmol) increased blood pressure (systolic and diastolic). Endothelin- 1 stimulated intracellular calcium changes, resulting in increased nuclear factor of T cell (NFAT) activity and epinephrine release from cultured <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> cells. Furthermore, endothelin- 1 increased catecholamine synthesis and caused hypertrophic changes in the cell size. Significance: Our findings indicate involvement of the endothelin system in the sympathetic regulation of the adrenal medulla...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} medium {{conditioned}} by rat C 6 glioma cells (C 6 -CM) on the survival, neurite formation, and catecholamine content of <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> cells in culture were investigated and {{compared with the}} effects of nerve growth factor (NGF). <b>Adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> cells were isolated from 10 -day-old rats and the proportions of surviving and neurite-extending cells were determined after 8 days in culture. In the presence of C 6 -CM virtually all seeded cells survived and 50 % developed neuritic processes. In contrast, NGF did not support survival above control levels (30 %) and induced neurite formation from approximately one-third of the surviving cells. C 6 -CM and NGF had no additive effects on neurite outgrowth. C 6 -CM-mediated fiber outgrowth was not inhibited by physiological concentrations of glucocorticoids which abolished the NGF-induced neurite formation. Both C 6 -CM and NGF increased the catecholamine content of the cultures and reduced the relative content of epinephrine. However, in view of its substantial effect on cell survival as compared to NGF, C 6 -CM caused a reduction of the catecholamine content per cell. We conclude that <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> cells, like other members of the sensory-sympathetic cell lineage of the neural crest, respond to glial-conditioned medium. This response differs both quantitatively and qualitatively from that mediated by NGF...|$|R
40|$|The histoautoradiography {{and fine}} {{structure}} of the adrenal medulla in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR, Okamoto and Aoki) was examined in the prenatal stage. The labeling index of the fetal adrenal medulla in SHR was 10 ± 1. 38 on the 20 th day of gestation and became lower on the 22 nd day of gestation. This tendency {{was consistent with the}} decrease of mitotic index. The autoradiographical grain count per labeled cell on the 20 th day of gestation didn't differ from that on the 22 nd day of gestation. These results indicate that the generation time of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> cell in SHR became more longer on successive day of gestation. However, {{there was no significant difference}} of the histology and histoautoradiography between SHR and control. Ultrastructurally, most of medullary tissue on the 20 th day of gestation were composed of the intermediate cells containing many intermediate granules. These granules increased in number during the fetal life. In most of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> cells, the fine structure was similar to that observed in the control group. These findings suggest that the difference of cell proliferation and cell differentiation in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>medullary</b> cells between SHR and control appears after birth, because the significant difference in the medullary cells of both groups has previously reported in the adult rats...|$|R

At the same time, pancreatic enzymes were increased in concentration. An abdominal computed tomographic scan revealed an enlarged pancreas and a 3 -cm left adrenal incidentaloma.
