40|$|Cold-formed steel unequal angles are non-symmetric sections. The design {{procedure}} of non-symmetric sections subjected to axial compression load {{could be quite}} difficult. The unequal <b>angle</b> <b>columns</b> may fail by different buckling modes, such as local, flexural and flexural-torsional buckling as well as interaction of these buckling modes. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the behaviour and design of cold-formed steel unequal <b>angle</b> <b>columns.</b> A nonlinear finite element analysis was conducted to investigate the strength and behaviour of unequal <b>angle</b> <b>columns.</b> The measured initial local and overall geometric imperfections as well as the material properties of the angle specimens were included in the finite element model. The finite element analysis was performed on fixed-ended columns for different lengths ranged from stub to long columns. It is demonstrated that the finite element model closely predicted the experimental ultimate loads and the behaviour of cold-formed steel unequal <b>angle</b> <b>columns.</b> Hence, the model was used for an extensive parametric study of cross-section geometries. The column strengths obtained from the parametric study were compared with the design strengths calculated using the North American Specification for cold-formed steel structural members.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{investigation of the}} strength and behavior of single <b>angle</b> <b>columns,</b> with special emphasis on the inelastic response. Flexural and flexural-torsional buckling characteristics are examined, including residual stress and differential warping effects. A general solution is presented that is applicable to asymmetric shapes in general and angles in particular; to ease the incremental, iterative solution, the column length is found that corresponds to a certain load, {{rather than the other}} way around. It is shown that for unequal-legged angles, the flexural-torsional buckling load will always govern; for equal-legged angles the picture is more complex. Thus, for angles with low width-to-thickness ratios for the leg, the flexural and the flexural-torsional modes give essentially the same result. For high width-to-thickness ratios the elastic critical loads for the two modes of buckling are very close; in the inelastic range the flexural-torsional buckling load is the lowest. It is noted that further studies are needed, especially regarding the influence of the width-to-thickness ratios of the angle legs. © 1989...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEntrainment of {{underlying}} debris by geophysical flows can significantly increase the flow deposit extent. To study this phenomenon, analog laboratory experiments {{have been conducted}} on granular column collapse over an inclined channel with and without an erodible bed made of similar granular material. Results show that for slope angles below a critical value θc, between 10 ° and 16 °, the run out distance rf depends only on the initial column height h 0 and is unaffected {{by the presence of}} an erodible bed. On steeper slopes, the flow dynamics change fundamentally, with a slow propagation phase developing after flow front deceleration, significantly extending the flow duration. This phase has characteristics similar to those of steady uniform flows. Its duration increases with increasing slope <b>angle,</b> <b>column</b> volume, column inclination with respect to the slope and channel width, decreasing column aspect ratio (height over length), and in the presence of an erodible bed. It is independent, however, of the maximum front velocity. The increase in the duration of the slow propagation phase has a crucial effect on flow dynamics and deposition. Over a rigid bed, the development of this phase leads to run out distances rf that depend on both the initial column height h 0 and length r 0. Over an erodible bed, as the duration of the slow propagation phase increases, the duration of bed excavation increases, leading to a greater increase in the run out distance compared with that over a rigid bed (up to 50 %).

40|$|Envolto ao já conhecido comportamento de cantoneiras esbeltas de abas iguais, questões aparentemente contraditórias tem sido reportadas em estudos experimentais de diversos autores, entre elas a ocorrência de modos de instabilidade em desacordo com aqueles obtidos via análise de estabilidade elástica, e forças axiais resistentes muito diferentes dos resultados teóricos (em geral, conservadoramente). Nestas condições, este trabalho procura analisar a fundo o comportamento das cantoneiras esbeltas de abas iguais, de modo a contribuir com o entendimento dos fenômenos que dificultam a interpretação dos resultados experimentais, dentre os quais, o afastamento {{longitudinal}} entre a rótula e a extremidade das barras (no caso de barras com extremidades rotuladas), e o sentido da imperfeição global de flexão em torno do eixo de menor inércia, o qual mostrou-se um fator chave na determinação do comportamento das cantoneiras, especialmente para comprimentos próximos da transição entre os dois modos globais de instabilidade elástica. Para esta faixa de comprimentos, diferentes níveis de interação entre os dois modos globais podem ser obtidos. Ademais, estudos experimentais realizados por diversos autores, aqui complementados por uma série de ensaios realizados em cantoneiras com extremidades engastadas, formam um vasto banco de resultados, que é utilizado para (além de comparações nos estudos teóricos) avaliar diversos procedimentos de previsão teórica sugeridos por diferentes autores, ou advindos de interpretações a partir do procedimento normativo, à luz do comportamento teórico estudado na primeira etapa do trabalho. Assim, destes procedimentos, apenas um baseado no Método da Resistência Direta, e dois baseados no Método das Larguras Efetivas demonstraram bons resultados, sendo que todos eles, desconsiderando o modo de flexo-torção como um modo global de instabilidade. Ao fim, comenta-se da necessidade de se expandir alguns estudos específicos, pois ao adotar-se um procedimento baseado somente no modo global de flexão, apesar de se mostrar estatisticamente mais eficiente, verifica-se a possível ocorrência de resultados demasiadamente contra a segurança. On {{the well}} known behavior of equal-leg <b>angle</b> <b>columns,</b> some questions apparently paradoxical {{have been reported}} in experimental results from several authors, including the occurrence of different instability modes from the expected by the elastic stability analysis, and maximum axial compressive load expressly different (generally conservative) from theoretical previsions. Therefore, the aim of this work is to improve the knowledge about the equal-leg <b>angle</b> <b>columns</b> behavior, contributing {{to the understanding of the}} features that complicate the interpretation of experimental results, among which, the longitudinal distance between the end sections and the center of hinges (pin-ended columns), and also the direction of the minor-axis flexural initial imperfection, which proved to play a key role in the post-critical column behavior, specially for column lengths near of the transition between global buckling modes (major-axis flexural-torsional and minor-axis flexural modes). On this range of lengths, different modal interaction amplitudes can be obtained, only with the direction of the minor-axis flexural initial imperfection (i. e., the amplitude of this imperfection plays a negligible influence on the column behavior). Furthermore, putting together a fairly large column ultimate strength data bank comprising experimental test results performed by several authors, collected from the available literature, and new experimental results on fixed-ended <b>angle</b> <b>columns</b> performed in this work, important comparisons with theoretical studies can be showed as well as evaluation of several ultimate strength theoretical prevision procedures, either those suggested by another authors as those arising from interpretations of normative procedures in the light of theoretical behavior verified in the first stage of labor. In conclusion, only one procedure based on Direct Strength Method and two procedures based on Effective Width Method exhibited accurate results, all of which neglecting the flexural-torsional mode as a global mode. Thus, it is important to mention that some additional studies are needed, because if adopted a procedure based only in the minor-axis flexural mode, despite being statistically advantageous, it is verified the possibility to occurs quite unconservative results...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{use of the}} {{hindfoot}} {{moment arm}} in the radiographic assessment of pes planovalgus (flatfoot) deformity is well described in the literature and commonly used for surgical planning of deformity correction. No study to the authors’ knowledge has investigated {{the relationship between the}} hindfoot moment arm and other common pes planovalgus radiographic parameters in both the normal patient population and those with pes planovalgus. This concept is important because in the setting of an increased hindfoot moment arm, the choice of surgical procedure for pes planovalgus deformity correction may change. PUROPOSE: The purpose of the current study was to determine if there is a relationship between an increased hindfoot moment arm and a pes planovalgus deformity or a difference in hindfoot moment arm between pes planovalgus deformity and a control population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IRB approval was obtained. A retrospective chart review of 86 patients was performed from the senior author’s clinical practice. Forty-three controls (no history of significant foot or ankle pain) as well as 43 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pes planovalgus deformity with complete foot, ankle and hindfoot alignment radiographs of the affected were included. On the lateral radiographs, the talar-first metatarsal angle, calcaneal pitch, talocalcaneal <b>angle,</b> medial <b>column</b> height, calcaneal-fifth metatarsal height, and lateral column height was measured. The hindfoot moment arm was calculated on hindfoot alignment radiograph. On the AP radiographs, talar-first metatarsal angle and talar head uncoverage was measured. RESULTS: Forty-three patient with pes planovalgus deformity and forty-three normal patients were identified. There was a statistically significant difference between the pes planovalgus and control groups with respect to the talar-first metatarsal angle, calcaneal pitch, talocalcaneal <b>angle,</b> medial <b>column</b> height, calcaneal-fifth metatarsal angle, and hindfoot moment arm (p 3 ̆c 0. 001, 3 ̆c 0. 001, 0. 012, 3 ̆c 0. 001, 3 ̆c 0. 001, 3 ̆c 0. 001 respectively). The medial column height was correlated most strongly to the hindfoot moment arm (R squared – 0. 48).

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of steel and}} composite frames has traditionally been carried out by idealizing beam-to-column connections as either rigid or pinned. Although some advanced analysis methods have been proposed to account for semi-rigid connections, the performance of these methods strongly depends on the proper modeling of connection behavior. The primary challenge of modeling beam-to-column connections is their inelastic response and continuously varying stiffness, strength, and ductility. In this dissertation, two distinct approaches—mathematical models and informational models—are proposed {{to account for the}} complex hysteretic behavior of beam-to-column connections. The performance of the two approaches is examined and is then followed by a discussion of their merits and deficiencies. To capitalize on the merits of both mathematical and informational representations, a new approach, a hybrid modeling framework, is developed and demonstrated through modeling beam-to-column connections. Component-based modeling is a compromise spanning two extremes in the field of mathematical modeling: simplified global models and finite element models. In the component-based modeling of angle connections, the five critical components of excessive deformation are identified. Constitutive relationships of <b>angles,</b> <b>column</b> panel zones, and contact between <b>angles</b> and <b>column</b> flanges, are derived by using only material and geometric properties and theoretical mechanics considerations. Those of slip and bolt hole ovalization are simplified by empirically-suggested mathematical representation and expert opinions. A mathematical model is then assembled as a macro-element by combining rigid bars and springs that represent the constitutive relationship of components. Lastly, the moment-rotation curves of the mathematical models are compared with those of experimental tests. In the case of a top-and-seat angle connection with double web angles, a pinched hysteretic response is predicted quite well by complete mechanical models, which take advantage of only material and geometric properties. On the other hand, to exhibit the highly pinched behavior of a top-and-seat angle connection without web angles, a mathematical model requires components of slip and bolt hole ovalization, which are more amenable to informational modeling. An alternative method is informational modeling, which constitutes a fundamental shift from mathematical equations to data that contain the required information about underlying mechanics. The information is extracted from observed data and stored in neural networks. Two different training data sets, analytically-generated and experimental data, are tested to examine the performance of informational models. Both informational models show acceptable agreement with the moment-rotation curves of the experiments. Adding a degradation parameter improves the informational models when modeling highly pinched hysteretic behavior. However, informational models cannot represent the contribution of individual components and therefore do not provide an insight into the underlying mechanics of components. In this study, a new hybrid modeling framework is proposed. In the hybrid framework, a conventional mathematical model is complemented by the informational methods. The basic premise of the proposed hybrid methodology is that not all features of system response are amenable to mathematical modeling, hence considering informational alternatives. This may be because (i) the underlying theory is not available or not sufficiently developed, or (ii) the existing theory is too complex and therefore not suitable for modeling within building frame analysis. The role of informational methods is to model aspects that the mathematical model leaves out. Autoprogressive algorithm and self-learning simulation extract the missing aspects from a system response. In a hybrid framework, experimental data {{is an integral part of}} modeling, rather than being used strictly for validation processes. The potential of the hybrid methodology is illustrated through modeling complex hysteretic behavior of beam-to-column connections. Mechanics-based components of deformation such as <b>angles,</b> flange-plates, and <b>column</b> panel zone, are idealized to a mathematical model by using a complete mechanical approach. Although the mathematical model represents envelope curves in terms of initial stiffness and yielding strength, it is not capable of capturing the pinching effects. Pinching is caused mainly by separation between <b>angles</b> and <b>column</b> flanges as well as slip between angles/flange-plates and beam flanges. These components of deformation are suitable for informational modeling. Finally, the moment-rotation curves of the hybrid models are validated with those of the experimental tests. The comparison shows that the hybrid models are capable of representing the highly pinched hysteretic behavior of beam-to-column connections. In addition, the developed hybrid model is successfully used to predict the behavior of a newly-designed connection...|$|R
