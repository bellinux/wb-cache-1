5|$|By September 5, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>organizations</b> {{had served}} 100,000 meals to those {{displaced}} by the hurricane in Mississippi, and federal food stocks became available {{for the state to}} distribute to storm victims. Still, resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest-hit locations, and long lines formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen. With dwindling supplies, the Salvation Army had to procure food {{from other parts of the}} region to serve to victims. In the days after the hurricane, an increase in heart attack deaths in the Harrison County area was noted.|$|E

5|$|Henry Whitney Bellows {{determined}} {{to take a}} different approach, establishing a civilian organization of nurses separate from the U.S. Army. Bellows was the founder of the United States Sanitary Commission and served as its only president. An influential minister, born and raised in Boston, Bellows went to Washington in May 1861 as head of a delegation of physicians representing the Women's Central Relief Association of New York <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>organizations.</b> Bellows's aim was to convince the government to establish a civilian auxiliary branch of the Army Medical Bureau. The Sanitary Commission, established by President Lincoln on June 13, 1861, provided nurses (mostly female) with medical supplies and organized hospital ships and soldiers' homes.|$|E
5|$|Lightning has {{received}} mixed commentary from critics—much of it relating to her cold personality, which {{was compared to}} that of Final Fantasy VIIs protagonist Cloud Strife. She was criticized for her relative absence in XIII-2. Her role in Lightning Returns had a mixed reception: some critics saw her as underdeveloped and unlikable, while others found her better developed and more human than in previous games. Lightning later appeared on lists, compiled by video game publications, of the best characters in the Final Fantasy series and in video games as a whole. She has been received favorably in polls of public opinion by Famitsu, Square Enix, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>organizations.</b>|$|E

The DHS helps during times of crisis such as Hurricane Ivan in September 2004, when the department helped establish and support shelters for 700 evacuees. The city now serves {{as the leader of}} one of the task forces in the Mississippi DHS, a combination of three nine-county teams.|$|E

The development, maintenance, {{and operation of}} these different modes of transportation are overseen by various agencies, including the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. These <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>organizations</b> collectively manage several interstate highways and state routes, two subway networks, two commuter rail agencies, eight trans-bay bridges, transbay ferry service, local bus service, three international airports (San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland), and an extensive network of roads, tunnels, and paths such as the San Francisco Bay Trail.|$|E
5|$|By {{about two}} days after the passage of Hurricane Wilma, 800residents on Grand Bahama {{remained}} in shelters, including 65 families who lost their homes and stayed in a hotel set up as a government shelter in Freeport. On Bimini, most residents who evacuated to shelters returned to their homes within two days of the hurricane. The Bahamian Red Cross quickly assessed the damage on Grand Bahama and Bimini, and successfully requested to be included under the federation's hurricane appeal for Central America. Local Red Cross chapters mobilized all available resources to assist the residents most affected. The Bahamian Red Cross began a three-month program to distribute food and other items to 1,000 of the 3,500affected families, primarily on Grand Bahama; the remaining 2,500families received assistance from the government <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>organizations.</b> Volunteers delivered building materials and provided water vouchers to those affected. In Nassau, the Red Cross disaster contingency stock sent a boat with food items, blankets, health kits, tarpaulins and water. About a week after the hurricane, the United States Agency for International Development began providing $50,000 (2005USD) to the Bahamian National Emergency Management Agency for the purchase and distribution of emergency supplies. The agency also provided $9,000 (2005USD) for locally contracted helicopter assessments in the affected areas. Red Cross agencies throughout the Caribbean Sea provided hygienic kits, plastic sheeting, blankets, and jerry cans.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{earthquake}} swarms can be dangerous, {{scientists are}} able to model such events to analyze their structure. During the earthquake swarm in 2007, {{a group of scientists}} investigated the possibility that a volcanic eruption would occur. Five additional seismographs were placed in the earthquake zone, and scientists closely monitored the seismic activity. After additional data were gathered, scientists with the United States Geological Survey, the University of Washington, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>organizations,</b> agreed that the Nazko earthquakes probably originated from movement of magma beneath the surface near Nazko Cone. However, because of the number and small size of the Nazko earthquakes, no volcanic eruption is likely. Other recent earthquakes in North America that have been attributed to magma but did not result in a volcanic eruption include the 2003 earthquakes under Lake Tahoe in the U.S. state of California and a 2004 earthquake swarm at Jordan Craters in the U.S. state of Oregon.|$|E
