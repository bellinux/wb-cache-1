40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{characterization}} of <b>almond</b> kernel <b>oils</b> extracted mechanically from five sweet almond varieties Marcona, Fournat, Ferragnes, Ferraduel and Beldi), cultivated in eastern Morocco. Oil content, physicochemical parameters, triacylglycerol and fatty acid compositions were determined. Analyzed oils showed low acidity values that range between 0. 77 – 0. 88 %, peroxide values range between 6. 43 – 16. 39 meq/kg and Iodine values range between 98. 42 – 103. 90 %. The principal fatty acid of <b>almond</b> kernel <b>oils</b> is oleic acid (C 18 : 1); oils of Ferragnes-Ferraduel and Beldi varieties show higher values of C 18 : 1 respectively of 72. 87 and 71. 62 %, however Fournat <b>almond</b> kernel <b>oil</b> shows the lowest content of C 18 : 1 (63. 54 %). HPLC analysis of triglycerides was carried out, and {{results show that}} analyzed <b>almond</b> kernel <b>oils</b> are characterized by the dominance of trioleylglycerol (OOO) that contents range between a minimum of 31. 48 % for Fournat’s oil and 43. 82 % for Ferragnes-Ferraduel’s oil. The oxidative stability of <b>almond</b> kernel <b>oils</b> was determined by rancimat tests as the induction period (IP, h recorded by a 743 Rancimat apparatus Metrohm, Switzerland). Results show that stability, of <b>almond</b> kernel <b>oils</b> is clearly influenced by the almond variety; Oxidative stability of tested <b>almond</b> kernel <b>oils</b> ranged between an IP = 20. 28 h for Marcona oil and an IP = 27. 55 h for Ferragnes-Ferraduel...|$|R

40|$|In Morocco, {{cultivation}} of almond tree (Prunus amygdalus L.) constitutes {{the second most}} important plantation of fruit trees after olive growing. It is mostly cultivated in two regions, « Taza, Al Houceima Taounate » in the north and « Souss Massa Draa » in the south. Almond genetic resources (Marcoma, Fournat, Ferragnes/Ferraduel and Beldi), cultivated in eastern Morocco were studied during two consecutive crop years in order to evaluate variations in kernel oil yield, fatty acid profiles, oleic /linoleic (O/L) ratio and <b>almond</b> <b>oils</b> oxydative stability (OSI,evaluated by rancimat tests) in comparison to monovarietal olive <b>oils.</b> <b>Almond</b> kernel total <b>oil</b> (AO), Oleic acid (C 18 : 1), Linoleic acid (C 18 : 2), O/L-ratio, and tocopherol contents range between: 48 - 62 % for kernel total oil; 65 - 77. 5 % for C 18 : 1; 17 - 25 % for C 18 : 2; 2. 5 - 4 for O/L ratio and 370 - 675 μg/g oil for tocopherols, respectively. We conclude that the genotype is the main variability source for all these chemical traits of AOs. Results obtained from Ferragnes/Ferraduel may be of interest for almond breeding focused to improve kernel oil yield and fatty acid profile. Besides, tocopherols contents of AOs seem {{to be the most important}} contributor for their stability to oxidation, even though compared to monovarietal olive oils, stability of AOs were very low and OSI value range between 20 - 27 hours. This fragility of AOs is due to their high content of unsaturated fatty acid which not allows their use for cooking or storage for long period.

One hundred grams of crushed apple seeds can yield about 70mg of HCN. Some millipedes release hydrogen cyanide as a defense mechanism, as do certain insects, such as some burnet moths. Hydrogen cyanide is contained in the exhaust of vehicles, and in smoke from burning nitrogen-containing plastics.

40|$|Almond tree "Prunus dulcis" is a {{fruit tree}} {{that belongs to}} the Rosaceae family. It’s a drought {{tolerant}} crop, thanks to ability of these trees to endure high water deficits. This physiological propriety of almond trees is a characteristic that prove its efficiency for valorization of semi-arid areas which are widespread in Morocco. According to Agriculture ministry reports, most of almond plantations are located in mountain areas in the Rif and foothills the high Atlas and in the southern areas in arid or semi-arid climate, but Semi-intensive plantations, conducted using modern techniques exist in regions of Fez, Meknes and Marrakech. The commercial production of Morocco is about 97000 tons in kernels and it’s marketed only locally. In the oriental region, the almond growing area is estimated to 9 % of total area of almond cultivation in Morocco. Furthermore, an important new plantation program is implemented by DRA 1 -Oriental with collaboration of CTB 2. The objective {{of this study is}} a contribution to strengthen competitiveness of the almond sector in the easthern region of Morocco, and focuses on the physico-chemical characterization of <b>almond</b> <b>oils</b> of some local varieties.
