5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The <b>ankle</b> <b>joint</b> can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Malvern Hill on 1 July 1862, Brandon's <b>ankle</b> <b>joint</b> {{was struck}} by a ball. As he fell, his hand hit a rolling shell which did not explode. Oblivious to his wounds, Brandon tried to rise again but he fell once more and {{remained}} on the field until men were able to pick him up and carry him to the rear. Because there was no visible bleeding, Brandon thought that his injuries were not serious but was taken on horse-back to a hospital. Initially, Brandon was offered whiskey which would have eased the pain, but he refused to drink it without water and sugar. He drank it only after being convinced it was necessary. Brandon's foot was removed after a torniquet was put in place. Brandon's arteries were then sewn in what was likely to be a very painful procedure, as there was not enough choloroform to produce a full anesthesia. To replace his amputated leg, his doctors gave him a wooden prosthetic leg. Because of Brandon's age, his doctors thought his chances of survival were slight. After coming to Richmond, he was tended to by friends and his servant. Confederate President Jefferson Davis even offered Brandon the hospitality of his mansion in the city.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are {{important}} in tissue remodelling. Here we investigate the role of collagenase- 3 (MMP- 13) in antibody-induced arthritis. METHODS: For this study we employed the K/BxN serum-induced arthritis model. Arthritis was induced in C 57 BL/ 6 wild type (WT) and MMP- 13 -deficient (MMP- 13 -/-) mice by intraperitoneal injection of 200 ?l of K/BxN serum. Arthritis was assessed by measuring the ankle swelling. During {{the course of the}} experiments, mice were sacrificed every second day for histological examination of the <b>ankle</b> <b>joints.</b> <b>Ankle</b> sections were evaluated histologically for infiltration of inflammatory cells, pannus tissue formation and bone/cartilage destruction. Semi-quantitative PCR was used to determine MMP- 13 expression levels in <b>ankle</b> <b>joints</b> of untreated and K/BxN serum-injected mice. RESULTS: This study shows that MMP- 13 is a regulator of inflammation. We observed increased expression of MMP- 13 in <b>ankle</b> <b>joints</b> of WT mice during K/BxN serum-induced arthritis and both K/BxN serum-treated WT and MMP- 13 -/- mice developed progressive arthritis with a similar onset. However, MMP- 13 -/- mice showed significantly reduced disease over the whole arthritic period. <b>Ankle</b> <b>joints</b> of WT mice showed severe joint destruction with extensive inflammation and erosion of cartilage and bone. In contrast, MMP- 13 -/- mice displayed significantly decreased severity of arthritis (50...|$|R
40|$|Power {{reduction}} in the <b>ankle</b> <b>joints</b> of a biped robot is considered in this paper. The ankle of human being has small torque and is very flexible within a certain range (very stiff near and beyond this range). This characterist,ic makes foot landing soft and gives a good contact between its sole and the ground. This feature can be implemented in a biped robot by using a small actuator for the <b>ankle</b> <b>joints.</b> A small actuator consumes less energy and makes the robot leg light. With less power in the <b>ankle</b> <b>joints.</b> walking be-conies more difficult to control for the robot. This problem can be solved by providing the feedback control presented in this paper.

25|$|Eversion and inversion: Stretching the {{eversion}} and inversion muscles {{allows for}} better {{range of motion}} to the <b>ankle</b> <b>joint.</b> Seated ankle elevations and depressions will stretch the peroneus and tibilalis muscles {{that are associated with}} these movements as they lengthen. Eversion muscles are stretched when the ankle becomes depressed from the starting position. In like manner, the inversion muscles are stretched when the <b>ankle</b> <b>joint</b> becomes elevated. Throughout this seated stretch, the <b>ankle</b> <b>joint</b> is to remain supported while depressed and elevated with the ipsilateral (same side) hand in order to sustain the stretch for 10–15 seconds. This stretch will increase overall eversion and inversion muscle group length and provide more flexibility to the <b>ankle</b> <b>joint</b> for larger range of motion during activity.|$|E

25|$|Dorsiflexion: In {{order to}} stretch the {{anterior}} muscles of the lower leg, crossover shin stretches work well. This motion will stretch the dorsiflexion muscles, mainly the anterior tibialis, extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus, by slowly causing the muscles to lengthen as body weight is leaned on the <b>ankle</b> <b>joint</b> by using the floor as resistance against {{the top of the}} foot. Crossover shin stretches can vary in intensity depending on the amount of body weight applied on the <b>ankle</b> <b>joint</b> as the individual bends at the knee. This stretch is typically held for 15–30 seconds.|$|E

When a properly aligned dancer is viewed from the side, the line passes through the knee, <b>ankle</b> <b>joint,</b> and big toe joints. When viewed from the front, the line passes through the knee, <b>ankle</b> <b>joint,</b> and the joints of the second toe or middle toe or the area between those toe joints. In cases of unusually high instep or metatarsal joint flexibility, it is sometimes necessary to flex the toes to achieve proper alignment.|$|E

25|$|The legs of tetrapods, {{the main}} group of {{terrestrial}} vertebrates, have internal bones, with externally attached muscles for movement, {{and the basic}} form has three key joints: the shoulder joint, the knee joint, and the <b>ankle</b> <b>joint,</b> at which the foot is attached. Within this theme there is much variation in form. An alternative form of vertebrate 'leg' to the tetrapod leg is the fins found on amphibious fish. Also a few tetrapods, such as the macropods, have adapted their tails as additional locomotory appendages.|$|E
25|$|Plantar flexion: One of {{the most}} popular lower leg muscle {{stretches}} is the step standing heel raises, which mainly involves the gastrocnemius, soleus, and the Achilles tendon. Standing heel raises allow the individual to activate their calf muscles by standing on a step with toes and forefoot, leaving the heel hanging off the step, and plantar flexing the <b>ankle</b> <b>joint</b> by raising the heel. This exercise is easily modified by holding on to a nearby rail for balance and is generally repeated 5-10 times.|$|E

500|$|König {{named the}} disease [...] "osteochondritis dissecans", {{describing}} it as a subchondral inflammatory {{process of the}} knee, resulting in a loose fragment of cartilage from the femoral condyle. In 1922, Kappis described this process in the <b>ankle</b> <b>joint.</b> On review of all literature describing transchondral fractures of the talus, Berndt and Harty developed a classification system for staging of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs). The term osteochondritis dissecans has persisted, and has since been broadened to describe a similar process occurring in many other joints, including the knee, hip, elbow, and metatarsophalangeal joints.|$|E
500|$|Argentine naturalist Florentino Ameghino {{described}} Veratalpa in {{an overview}} of the astragali from the middle Miocene of Vieux Collonges in France. The astragalus is a bone of the foot {{that is part of the}} <b>ankle</b> <b>joint.</b> He listed several species of the family Talpidae (moles and related species) from Vieux Collonges, including [...] "espèce C" [...] ("species C"), which he named as a new genus and species, Veratalpa lugdunensiana, in a footnote. In a 1906 review of Ameghino's paper, Édouard Louis Trouessart affirmed that Veratalpa probably represented a new genus of mole, but noted that the specific name lugdunensiana would have been more correctly written [...] "lugdunensis". According to Trouessart, the suffix -ana is appropriate for names that reference persons, but not for those that refer to places, such as this name, which is derived from Lugdunum (the Latin name for Lyon).|$|E
500|$|A {{complete}} Herrerasaurus skull {{was found}} in 1988, {{by a team of}} paleontologists led by Paul Sereno. Based on the new fossils, authors such as Thomas Holtz and José Bonaparte classified Herrerasaurus {{at the base of the}} saurischian tree before the divergence between prosauropods and theropods. However, Sereno favored classifying Herrerasaurus (and the Herrerasauridae) as primitive theropods. These two classifications have become the most persistent, with Rauhut (2003) and Bittencourt and Kellner (2004) favoring the early theropod hypothesis, and Max Langer (2004), Langer and Benton (2006), and Randall Irmis and his coauthors (2007) favoring the basal saurischian hypothesis. If Herrerasaurus were indeed a theropod, it would indicate that theropods, sauropodomorphs, and ornithischians diverged even earlier than herrerasaurids, before the middle Carnian, and that [...] "all three lineages independently evolved several dinosaurian features, such as a more advanced <b>ankle</b> <b>joint</b> or an open acetabulum". This view is further supported by ichnological records showing large tridactyl (three-toed) footprints that can be attributed only to a theropod dinosaur. These footprints date from the Ladinian (Middle Triassic) of the Los Rastros Formation in Argentina and predate Herrerasaurus by 3 to 5 million years.|$|E

500|$|Skrepenak {{was drafted}} in the 1992 NFL Draft with the 32nd overall pick {{in the second round}} by the Los Angeles Raiders. [...] He stayed with the {{franchise}} for four seasons, which included a relocation from Los Angeles to Oakland.

[...] Skrepenak was deactivated from the roster for the final two games of the season right before his contract expired. [...] Officially, the deactivation was due to a combination of a rib injury and the flu, but some say it may have also been partially due to vocal play selection criticism. [...] However, head coach Mike White and assistant coach Joe Bugel said the benching was merely a function of the full strength depth chart upon the return of Gerald Perry. Skrepenak was a vocal detractor on the organization after leaving the Raiders.

500|$|To resolve {{questions}} about the blades, Pistorius was asked {{to take part in}} a series of scientific tests in November 2007 at the German Sport University Cologne with Professor of Biomechanics Peter Brüggemann and IAAF technical expert Elio Locatelli. After two days of tests, Brüggemann reported that Pistorius used about 25 percent less energy expenditure than non-disabled athletes once he achieved a given speed. The study also found that he showed major differences in sprint mechanics, with significantly different maximum vertical ground return forces, and that the positive work or returned energy was close to three times higher than that of a human ankle. The energy loss in the blade during stance phase when the foot was on the ground was measured as 9.3 percent, while that of normal <b>ankle</b> <b>joint</b> was measured at 42.4 percent, showing a difference of more than 30 percent. Brüggemann's analysis stated that the blades allowed lower energy consumption at the same speed, and that the energy loss in the blade is significantly less than in a human ankle at maximum speed. In December of that year, Brüggemann stated to Die Welt newspaper that Pistorius [...] "has considerable advantages over athletes without prosthetic limbs who were tested by us. It was more than just a few percentage points. I did not expect it to be so clear." [...] The study was published in 2008 in Sports Technology, but later researchers stated that the analysis [...] "did not take enough variables into consideration". Commentators have also argued that the IAAF study did not accurately determine whether Cheetahs confer a net advantage because measuring the net advantage or disadvantage conferred on an athlete using Cheetahs is not possible given current scientific knowledge. Second, the IAAF study may not have measured Pistorius’s performance against appropriate controls. IAAF used five non-disabled athletes, who run 400-meter races in similar times to Pistorius, as controls. However, because Pistorius was relatively new to the sport of running, he may not have trained enough to maximize his physical potential and reach his peak performance when the IAAF study was conducted. In March 2007, approximately 9 months before the IAAF study was conducted, Pistorius’s coach commented that Pistorius had not trained enough to achieve an upper body commensurate with the upper bodies of most elite sprinters. To obtain the most accurate understanding of how the prostheses affect Pistorius’s performance, he should be compared to athletes with similar physical potential. Consequently, the IAAF study may have been flawed because it compared Pistorius, who might have the physical potential to run faster than his current times, against athletes at their peak.|$|E
