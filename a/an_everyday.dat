5|$|Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a 1977 American {{science fiction}} film written and {{directed}} by Steven Spielberg, and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Melinda Dillon, Teri Garr, Bob Balaban, Cary Guffey, and François Truffaut. It tells the story of Roy Neary, <b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> blue-collar worker in Indiana, whose life changes after an encounter with an unidentified flying object (UFO).|$|E
5|$|A {{compound}} that has two immiscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts {{within the same}} molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is <b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.|$|E
5|$|In the NBA, Miller had {{a modest}} role {{for most of}} his first two seasons. He began to get regular playing time midway through his second season and in the final weeks of his second season he became <b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> starter due to injury. In 2016, he earned an All-EuroLeague Second Team {{selection}} and {{was a member of the}} 2015–16 ABA League champion, the 2015–16 Basketball League of Serbia champion and the 2016–17 Israeli Basketball State Cup winner.|$|E

5|$|Palestinians bake {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of breads: they include khubz, pita and markook and taboon. Khubz is <b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> bread and is very similar to pita. It often takes the place of utensils; It is torn into bite size pieces and used to scoop various dips such as hummus or ful. Markook bread is a paper-thin unleavened bread and when unfolded it is almost transparent. Taboon receives its name from the ovens used to bake them.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} heavy industry, the {{possibility}} of serious injury or death was <b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> risk for the mine workers of the Rhondda Valley. The most notorious form of colliery disaster was the gas explosion, caused by either a buildup of methane gas or coal dust. As the mines became deeper and ventilation become more difficult to control the risk increased. The worst single incident in the Rhondda was the 1867 Ferndale disaster in which an explosion saw the loss of 178 lives. However, the major disasters only accounted for roughly 20% of overall fatalities, with individual accidents accounting {{for the bulk of}} deaths. The list below shows mining disasters which saw the loss of five or more lives during a single incident.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{official}} forms of their respective languages, the four linguistic regions of Switzerland also have their local dialectal forms. The role played by dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically: in the German-speaking regions, Swiss German dialects have become ever more prevalent since {{the second half of}} the 20th century, especially in the media, such as radio and television, and are used as <b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> language, while the Swiss variety of Standard German is almost always used instead of dialect for written communication (c.f. diglossic usage of a language). Conversely, in the French-speaking regions the local dialects have almost disappeared (only 6.3% of the population of Valais, 3.9% of Fribourg, and 3.1% of Jura still spoke dialects at the end of the 20th century), while in the Italian-speaking regions dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation.|$|E

5|$|Death metal, like thrash metal, {{generally}} {{rejects the}} theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for <b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets. One major {{exception to this}} rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.|$|E
5|$|Living River Siam was {{launched}} on March 14, 1999, the International Rivers Day of Action, {{by a group}} of NGO workers and Thai academics. Its first action, on March 23, was to support an occupation of the Pak Mun Dam site by 5,000 villagers. The Pak Mun Dam, funded partially by the World Bank, was built in 1994 and slowly became the focus of national controversy. It received widespread complaints from Thai villagers and was the focus of the Assembly of the Poor's 99-day, 20,000-person protest in Bangkok in 1997. The dam generates 0.5 percent of Thailand's electric capacity; 40 percent of Thailand's total electric capacity goes unused on <b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> basis.|$|E
5|$|The Knicks in March {{replaced}} D'Antoni with Mike Woodson, who ran fewer pick-and {{rolls and}} more isolation plays. Lin had excelled running pick-and-rolls under D'Antoni. After the March 24 {{game against the}} Detroit Pistons he complained about a sore knee, and an MRI later revealed a small meniscus tear in the left knee. Lin opted to have knee surgery and missed {{the remainder of the}} regular season. He averaged 18.5 points and 7.6 assists during his 26 games as <b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> player. In the first 10 games, Lin averaged 24.6 points and 9.2 assists, shooting 49.7 percent from the field but with 5.6 turnovers. In the next seven games, he averaged 16 points and 7.7 assists with 3.9 turnovers. In the last nine games, Lin averaged 13.6 points and 5.9 assists and shot only 39.1 percent while dealing with his then-undisclosed knee injury.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a variety}} of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On <b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2014, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.|$|E
5|$|Willy Vandersteen used a wild {{variety of}} themes and {{influences}} {{in his work}} from early on. He made fairytales, historic series, westerns, but also science fiction and many contemporary comics. While some series like De Familie Snoek and Bessy stuck very close to their origin (<b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> Flemish contemporary family for the former, and a pioneer family in the American Old West in the latter), others were more loose. De Rode Ridder, {{the story of a}} medieval knight, wandered from Arthurian tales over the crusades until the explorations of the fifteenth and sixteenth century, thereby spanning some ten centuries, and later (when Vandersteen was less involved in the series) brought in many elements of sword and sorcery and fantasy.|$|E
5|$|Gromek {{also led}} the AL with twelve hit batsmen in 1954. On August 29, he hit Bill Wilson {{in the fourth}} inning of a 14–3 win against the Athletics. In the ninth inning, Athletics pitcher Marion Fricano, who had a {{reputation}} as a head hunter himself (two days prior, he ended the Chicago White Sox's Cass Michaels' career with a beanball), retaliated and threw at Gromek's back. Gromek charged the mound, causing both dugouts and bullpens to empty. Both players were ejected from the game, and fined by the league. Gromek entered the 1955 Detroit Tigers season as <b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> starting pitcher, though he was not the opening day starter that year. During the offseason, he worked to lessen the control he had on the ball, as he felt his low ERA but league-leading 26 home runs allowed was the result of overly controlling the ball. He remained a starter throughout the season, with the exception of September, in which Gromek pitched three games in relief, earning two wins in the process. He finished the season with 13 wins and 10 losses and a 3.98 ERA in 28 appearances, and led the league with 26 home runs allowed for the second straight year.|$|E

5|$|Turner {{attended}} St. Joseph High School in Westchester, Illinois. By {{his senior}} season, {{he was one}} of the top high school basketball players at his position in the nation. As a true freshman, he helped lead the Buckeyes to the 2008 National Invitation Tournament championship. The following year, he was the Big Ten Conference scoring champion for the 2008–09 season and was a first-team 2009 All-Big Ten selection. That season, he was also an honorable mention All-American and was selected as a member of the 2009 All-Big Ten Conference Tournament team, and he became one of five Big Ten players to have been among the top ten in the conference in average points, rebounds, and assists in the same season. He is the conference record-holder for most career Player of the Week awards and despite missing over a month of his junior season for the 2009–10 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team he also set the single-season record for Player of the Week awards. As a pro, he has participated in the Rising Stars Challenge and helped the 76ers reach the NBA playoffs in his first two NBA seasons. During his third season he became <b>an</b> <b>everyday</b> starter. With an impending free agent status, he was traded to Indiana during his fourth season.|$|E

His numbers improved as he became the <b>A's</b> <b>everyday</b> center fielder. His power numbers grew as well. The Athletics in the early 1980s had an outfield of Murphy, Rickey Henderson, and Tony Armas, and many fans saw it as the best young outfield in baseball.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to {{investigate}} how four 3 rd grade pedagogues allow communication in the teaching of mathematics and how these pedagogues allow their students to use and expand their language of mathematics. It has also been an aim to investigate these four pedagogues’ opinions about the significance of communication and of the language of mathematics for students’ mathematical learning. The study is based on a sociocultural perspective of Vygotskij’s. The theory implies the importance of using the language and communication for students’ learning. The study contains a description of prewievs researchers’ perspective of the significance of communication and of the language of mathematics for students’ mathematical learning. The empirical data consist of qualitative methods in forms of interviews and observations. The results of this study show that all of the participating pedagogues believe that communication and the language of mathematics are important for students’ mathematical learning, but only three of them offered their students an opportunity to communicate in the teaching of mathematics. Only one of four pedagogues uses purely the language of mathematics, instead of <b>a</b> <b>everyday</b> mathematical language. Two of the four pedagogues use a combination of a language of mathematics and <b>a</b> <b>everyday</b> mathematical language, and one of these two succedeed to expand their students’ mathematical vocabulary...|$|R
