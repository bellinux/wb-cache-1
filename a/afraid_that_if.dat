5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} day of the oral {{examinations}} in May 1943, Bloeme's non-Jewish boyfriend warned her that the Germans were looking for her. She asked the school board to administer all 12 of her examinations at once, and she received her high school diploma that same day. When the Germans arrived, they took her to an assembly point for Amsterdam Jews, but she managed to enter the building without being registered. A few days later, she sneaked out with a group of younger teens. At first she hid in the home of Christian friends of her parents who worked in the Dutch underground, but they were <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they were arrested, Bloeme would be, too. She spent the next year hiding in 15 to 16 different places, including an Amsterdam old-age home and a job as a maid for a widow and her son in Rotterdam. When she returned to the people who worked in the underground, she was arrested and sent to Westerbork.|$|E
25|$|The New York City Sons of Liberty {{learned of}} Boston's plan {{to stop the}} {{unloading}} of any tea and resolved to also follow this policy. Since the Association had not obtained the support they had expected, the Sons of Liberty were <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the tea was landed the population would demand its distribution for retail.|$|E

25|$|On 14 April 2007, an {{estimated}} 300,000 people marched in Ankara to {{protest against the}} possible candidacy of Erdoğan in the 2007 presidential election, <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdoğan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gül as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued {{over the next several}} weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Çanakkale, and one million in İzmir on 13 May.|$|E
25|$|Landrith made {{immediate}} headlines when he {{was involved}} in a scuffle against the New York Yankees on June 11. Rookie Oriole outfielder Boog Powell was hospitalized after Yankees pitcher Bud Daley beaned Powell {{in the head with a}} pitch in the top of the 4th. In the bottom of the 4th, Baltimore pitcher Robin Roberts immediately threw a fastball over the head of Yankees star Roger Maris. Maris started walking toward the mound, bat in hand. Roberts was <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> things got physical he would break his hand. Landrith jumped on Maris' back, clearing the benches. No punches were thrown in the incident, nor were any suspensions or fines levied by American League president Joe Cronin. The Orioles won 5-3.|$|E
500|$|Juskalian {{spent the}} next twenty-seven months as a POW and was held in various camps in Italy, Poland and Germany. After being interrogated in Kairouan, {{he was sent to}} Tunis and flown to Naples. The planes flew at a low {{altitude}} as Juskalian described: [...] "They flew about 100feet above the Mediterranean because they were <b>afraid</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> they flew higher, the American fighter planes—not knowing POWs were inside—would see us and shoot us down." [...] The POWs were sent to Oflag IX-A/Z British POW camp in Rotenburg an der Fulda where they remained until June 6, 1943, when they were transferred to Oflag 64 in Szubin, Poland.|$|E

[...] I am <b>afraid</b> {314} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he {{represents}} any great party in the Church, the spirit of justice and reasonableness which animates the three bishops has as slender a chance of being imitated, on a large scale, as their common sense and their courtesy.

500|$|Halperin {{states that}} he told a Scientology {{official}} {{he wanted to have}} a successful career in Hollywood but was <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> his homosexuality was revealed it would stymie his career. He states that the Scientology official said the organization would [...] "cure him of his sexuality through auditing". According to Halperin the Scientology organization has arranged [...] "cover" [...] marriages as part of a [...] "cure" [...] for homosexuality, and notes that actor and Scientologist John Travolta married Kelly Preston two days after a male porn star told the National Enquirer of an alleged relationship he had with Travolta. According to Halperin, Anna Nicole Smith had wanted to become a Scientologist, but decided against it after she was informed by a friend of the organization's stance on homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|According to Leach, {{the volume}} of work was small. A big {{problem was that the}} team had too many ideas, and {{insufficient}} time to implement them all. For example, other diseases were planned; one of these was Animal Magnetism, which would see patients with attached animals which would have to be cut away. Another idea that was not implemented was the possibility of four separate in-game eras: futuristic, mediaeval, Victorian, and modern. The game was originally to have players begin in the mediaeval zone, and progress to more modern ones. By May 1996, the idea of the other time periods had been deemed [...] "prohibitive" [...] due to the amount of graphics required. Carr later stated that the game did not need the other eras, and that the team was small enough to make things up as they went along. Carr was also <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they had produced a design document, Electronic Arts would have considered the omission of the other eras feature cutting. An idea that Molyneux pushed Webley's team to implement was a screen that enabled players to mix coloured chemicals to apply them to diseases. Accessibility was also a concern for the team: with so many options, it was felt that players could treat the game like work. The tester Jon Rennie simplified the game from the original design; Webley was keen for players to be able to begin play without a long tutorial.|$|E
2500|$|According to Cronauer, he and Williams were {{forbidden}} by Levinson to {{meet each other}} because the director [...] "was <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Robin and I met, that Robin would somehow start to do an unconscious imitation of me, which would change his characterization." [...] Williams and Cronauer eventually met at the film's New York premiere.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, Pawlenty {{expressed}} {{support for}} the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). But in 2010 Pawlenty claimed {{that he had made}} those statements solely as a surrogate for presidential nominee McCain and never actually supported the idea himself. On May 23, 2011, Pawlenty formally announced he'd run for the Republican presidential nomination, saying, “politicians are often <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they're too honest, they might lose an election. I'm afraid that in 2012, if we're not honest enough, we may lose our country.” ...|$|E
2500|$|According to The New York Times, a [...] "prominent Iranian cleric and {{a former}} lawmaker said on Sunday that they had spoken {{to some of the}} authors and had no doubt the letter was genuine". According to this cleric, the letter's signatories number [...] "several dozen, and are mostly midranking figures from Qum, Isfahan and Mashhad", and that [...] "the {{pressure}} on clerics in Qum is much worse than the pressure on activists because the establishment is <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they say anything they can turn the more traditional sectors of society against the regime".|$|E
2500|$|Keith Hoerig: We got {{the name}} Five Iron Frenzy from a roommate {{of most of}} ours. He was kind of paranoid, and <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he went outside on this {{particular}} night {{he was going to}} get jumped by some people. He had a golf club to defend himself and he said something to the effect of it being like [...] "putter mayhem". Scott looked at the golf club he was holding, and noting that it was a five iron said, [...] "No, more like a Five Iron Frenzy." [...] The name stuck.|$|E

60|$|My {{mother said}} nothing in that discussion. The word colonies always upset her. She was <b>afraid,</b> I think, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{she turned her}} mind in that {{direction}} my errant father might suddenly and shockingly be discovered, no doubt conspicuously bigamic and altogether offensive and revolutionary. She {{did not want to}} rediscover my father at all.|$|R
5000|$|At first Eugenio {{does not}} {{seemingly}} remember much about Martín, but {{little by little}} they start to recall their shared memories as children. Eugenio realizes his growing attraction to Martín but is reluctant to pursue it, as {{he does not want}} to seem to be taking advantage of Martín's current financial situation. He is also <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> the soft-spoken Martín might reciprocate his feelings, it might only be because Martín feels indebted to him. Martín himself is attracted to Eugenio, but he does not know if Eugenio is gay. And given his impoverished background, {{he does not want to}} presume on Eugenio's kindness.|$|R
2500|$|Franz Boas was {{an immensely}} {{influential}} figure throughout {{the development of}} folklore as a discipline. At first glance, it might seem that his only concern was for the discipline of anthropology—after all, he fought {{for most of his}} life to keep folklore as a part of anthropology. Yet Boas was motivated by his desire to see both anthropology and folklore become more professional and well-respected. Boas was <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> folklore was allowed to become its own discipline the standards for folklore scholarship would be lowered. This, combined with the scholarships of [...] "amateurs", would lead folklore to be completely discredited, Boas believed.|$|E
2500|$|Miley {{has several}} reasons for {{creating}} Hannah. She is <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the kids at school discover she is famous they won't treat her the same. While she enjoys the attention of her fame as Hannah, she equally enjoys the option of [...] "stepping out" [...] of her role. Miley also values her privacy and doesn't want fans or paparazzi photographers mobbing her when she goes out in public. In this way, Hannah Montana presents a unique inversion of typical celebrity experiences. While most celebrities become famous as themselves and later need disguises to not be noticed in public, Hannah Montana became famous while in disguise, and now has the freedom to be in public as herself.|$|E

The tournament {{marked the first}} time the 17-year-old Polgár was invited to compete with the world's strongest players. After four games she had two points. During her game with Kasparov in the fifth round, Kasparov gradually outplayed her and had a clear advantage after 35 moves. On his 36th move, the [...] World Champion reportedly changed his mind about the move of a knight, and moved the piece to a different square. According to chess rules, once a player has released a piece, the move must stand, so if Kasparov did remove his hand, he should have been required to play his original move. Polgár did not challenge Kasparov, in the moment, because, she stated, [...] "I was playing the World Champion and didn't want to cause unpleasantness during my first invitation to such an important event. I was also <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> my complaint was overruled I would be penalized on the clock when we were in time pressure."

2500|$|Immediately {{after finding}} out the {{election}} results, a special South Carolina convention declared [...] "that the Union now subsisting between South Carolina {{and other states}} {{under the name of}} the 'United States of America' is hereby dissolved"; by February six more cotton states would follow (Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas), forming the Confederate States of America. In 1960, Lipset examined the secessionist vote in each Southern state in 1860–61. In each state he divided the counties by the proportion of slaves, low, medium and high. He found that in the 181 high-slavery counties, the vote was 72% for secession. In the 205 low-slavery counties, the vote was only 37% for secession and in the 153 middle counties, the vote for secession was at 60%. [...] Both the outgoing Buchanan administration and the incoming Lincoln administration refused to recognize the legality of secession or the legitimacy of the Confederacy. After Lincoln called for troops, four border states (that lacked cotton) seceded (Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee). The Upper Southern States were in a dilemma, they wanted to retain their slaves but were <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they joined with the lower southern states that were rebelling they would be {{caught in the middle of}} a conflict, and their states would be the battle ground.

5|$|Laurence succeeded Augustine to the see of Canterbury {{in about}} 604, and ruled {{until his death}} on 2February 619. To secure the succession, Augustine had consecrated Laurence before he died, even though that was {{prohibited}} by canon law. Augustine was <b>afraid</b> though <b>that</b> <b>if</b> someone did not step into the office immediately, it would damage the missionary efforts in Britain. However, Laurence never received a pallium from Rome, so {{he may have been}} considered uncanonical by the papacy. Bede makes a point of comparing Augustine's action in consecrating Laurence to Saint Peter's action of consecrating Clement as Bishop of Rome during Peter's lifetime, which the theologian J. Robert Wright believes may be Bede's way of criticising the practices of the church in his day.|$|R
