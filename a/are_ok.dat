The risk of injury if there is an equipment problem is greater for negative entry, particularly with breathing gas failures.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} those who have a high degree of {{cognitive}} impairment, such as an intellectual disability, are unable to process the loss of those around them, but this is untrue, those with cognitive impairments such as an intellectual disability are able to process grief in a similar manner to those without cognitive impairment. One of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without, is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss, which is why non-verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important, because these are usually signs of distress and expression of grief among this population. It is important when working with individuals with these such impairments that caregivers and family members meet them where their level of functioning is and allow them to process the loss and grief with assistance given where needed, and not to ignore the grief that these individuals undergo. An important aspect of treatment of grief for those with an intellectual disability is family involvement where possible, this can be a biological family or a family created in a group home or clinical setting. By having the family involved in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual it helps them to process. However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated. The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a soci-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling. In this approach the individual with intellectual disability has the opportunity to see how those around them handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling behavior. This approach also helps the individual know that their emotions <b>are</b> <b>ok</b> and normal.|$|E

There were officials with the cricket association who I regarded as good friends and I had drinks with them whenever I was in Sydney or whenever they were in Newcastle. And they started treating me and the other players in WSC like lepers. I think that was the most hurtful thing of all. It was something that they didn't go along with and they just couldn't handle it".".|$|E

2500|$|Hinting expert Beat Stamm, {{who worked}} on ClearType at Microsoft, agrees that ClearType may look blurry at 96 dpi, which was a typical {{resolution}} for LCDs in 2008, but adds that higher resolution displays improve on this aspect: [...] "WPF [...] uses method C , but few display devices have a sufficiently high resolution to make the potential blur a moot point for everybody....

Many people are fine with the colors of ClearType, even at 96 dpi, but a few aren’t… To my eyes and at 96 dpi, Method C doesn’t read as well as Method A. It reads “blurrily” to me. Conversely, at 144 dpi, I don’t see a problem with Method C. It looks and reads just fine to me." [...] One illustration of the potential problem is the following image: ...|$|E
