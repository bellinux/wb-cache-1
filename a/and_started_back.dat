500|$|The {{next day}} the brigade started towards their first objective, the bridge at Damieh. At 10:30 the Auckland Mounted Rifles, {{assisted}} by the 1st Squadron, assaulted and captured the Damieh bridge with a bayonet charge. The 10th Squadron arrived after the bridge was secured, and followed the Auckanders pursuing the withdrawing Turks into the hills. That night the regiment moved back across the bridge, leaving the 1st Squadron behind to guard it. The {{next day the}} brigade was ordered to resume the advance, so with the regiment as the vanguard, overcame the first obstacle, a Turkish machine-gun post. At 15:30 they reached Es Salt, passed through the town to the east, and formed a defensive position in the hills for the night. During the day they had captured 250 men, three artillery pieces and several machine-guns. The next day, 24 September, the regiment continued their advance, heading towards Suweile where {{they were joined by}} the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades. The next day about [...] north-west of Amman they came upon two Turkish redoubts covering the road to the town. While the brigade's other regiments deployed to attack them, the regiment, with a section from the Machine-Gun Squadron, were ordered to manoeuvre around to assault them from the rear. At midday they were confronted by around two hundred Turkish troops defending a ridge line. The regiment, through artillery and machine-gun fire, assaulted and captured the ridge. Not stopping to consolidate the position, they continued forward towards Amman. Once there the 10th Squadron, and part of the 8th Squadron, assaulted the Citadel in a bayonet charge, capturing 119 German prisoners and six machine-guns. The regiment then charged through the town, capturing the railway station at 16:30. All told the regiment took 1,200 prisoners, fourteen machine-guns, and other military stores. Their own casualties were one dead and two wounded. Casualties and illness had reduced the regiment's strength to only 350 men, many of whom were struck down with malaria. The regiment remained in the Amman area until the night of 29/30 September when they moved south to Kastel and secured a large number of prisoners from the Turkish II Corps. On 3 October they were relieved by the 3rd Light Horse Regiment, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>back</b> towards the Jordan Valley. By 9 October they had crossed the valley and had reached Jerusalem; they then went back to Ayun Kara, their part in the war being over.|$|E
2500|$|RoboCup Junior {{was invented}} <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>back</b> in 1998 with a {{demonstration}} held by Henrik Hautop Lund and Luigi Pagliarini [...] at the RoboCup international competition held in Paris, France. In 1999, an interactive workshop and competition {{was held by}} Henrik Hautop Lund and Luigi Pagliarini [...] at the RoboCup international competition in Stockholm, Sweden.

2500|$|A little later, the 5th Foot and 55th Foot arrived [...] at {{the front}} and the 2nd Light Infantry {{attempted}} to rally. Sullivan's column overpowered this position and pressed ahead. A British officer in command of a picket of the 46th Foot watched in amazement as the light infantry ran away. Then the 2nd Pennsylvania Brigade and part of Nathanael Greene's left column forced his men to flee also. As Sullivan's line passed the Benjamin Chew House, 120 men of the 40th Foot took refuge in the building, but the Americans ignored them and pressed onward into the fog. Sullivan shifted Conway's brigade {{to the right of}} his Marylanders and all contact between his troops and Wayne's was lost. Presently, the American reserve arrived before the Chew House. Persuaded by Henry Knox, Washington decided to attack the structure. Accordingly, two cannons of Proctor's 4th Continental Artillery Regiment and two captured British 6-pound guns began firing at the Chew House. Two New Jersey regiments tried to storm the house to no avail, suffering heavy losses. Completely isolated to the east of Germantown Road and several hundred yards south, Wayne heard the racket, about-faced his division, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>back</b> {{in the direction of the}} Chew House. As they moved back, Adam Stephen's Virginia division spotted them in the fog and opened fire. The friendly fire volley ripped into the 2nd Pennsylvania Brigade, whose men returned fire. In the growing confusion, Wayne's men panicked and did not rally until they were [...] from the battlefield. The regiment was present at the Battle of White Marsh from 5 to 8 December 1777, though only light infantry and militia were engaged. At the time the regiment went into winter quarters at Valley Forge, Humpton's field officers were Lieutenant Colonel Caleb North and Major Francis Mentges.|$|E
