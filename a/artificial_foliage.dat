40|$|Drift of aerially applied forest {{herbicides}} {{can result}} in chemical deposition to streams. Riparian vegetation is expected to attenuate drift, {{but there is little}} corresponding data. A field study was conducted in the Coast Range west of Corvallis, Oregon, {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} forested riparian buffers. The buffers studied are typical of those used for small and medium fish-bearing streams in western Oregon as mandated by the Oregon Forest Practices Act. A helicopter sprayed two tracers over four transects. Twenty trials were conducted, resulting in over 1400 tracer samples. Results confirm that these vegetative barriers are effective at reducing deposition into streams. Reduction of deposition on <b>artificial</b> <b>foliage</b> samplers placed immediately above the stream surface ranged from 37 % to 99 % and averaged 92 %. Reductions were less clear in stable atmospheric conditions due to low wind speed and highly variable wind directions. Low wind speed conditions are not generally high-drift scenarios, but there is evidence that drift of suspended droplets beyond the barrier, comprising a small fraction of the total mass, increases in stable conditions...|$|E

It is available at: [URL] 10. 1177 / 0278364912471865. Clutter creates challenges for robot manipulation, including a lack of non-contact trajectories and reduced visibility for line-of-sight sensors. We demonstrate that robots can use whole-arm tactile sensing to perceive clutter and maneuver within it, while keeping contact forces low. We first present our approach to manipulation, which emphasizes the benefits of making contact across the entire manipulator and assumes the manipulator has low-stiffness actuation and tactile sensing across its entire surface. We then present a novel controller that exploits these assumptions. The controller only requires haptic sensing, handles multiple contacts, and does not need an explicit model of the environment prior to contact. It uses model predictive control with a time horizon of length one and a linear quasi-static mechanical model. In our experiments, the controller enabled a real robot and a simulated robot to reach goal locations in a variety of environments, including <b>artificial</b> <b>foliage,</b> a cinder block, and randomly generated clutter, while keeping contact forces low. While reaching, the robots performed maneuvers that included bending objects, compressing objects, sliding objects, and pivoting around objects. In simulation, whole-arm tactile sensing also outperformed per-link force–torque sensing in moderate clutter, with the relative benefits increasing with the amount of clutter...|$|E
40|$|Background: Psychological {{stress and}} inadequately {{controlled}} pain {{can have a}} negative effect on wound healing and patient comfort. Prolonged hospital stays and the use of analgesics and anesthetics for anxiety and pain may contribute to increased patient cost and can cause adverse events. Individuals recover more quickly from stress and report less physical discomfort when exposed to a natural environment. Patients with views of nature have been shown to have faster recovery from surgery, and those exposed to a garden environment demonstrate less pain and emotional distress during hospitalization. In this setting, it is prudent to consider: what are the effects of real or artificial plants on the patient experience in a hospital setting? Methods: An exhaustive search was conducted using Medline-Ovid, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Medline-PubMed using the key words: plants, houseplants, nature, hospital, patient rooms, hospital rooms, stress, anxiety, recovery, and pain. Included studies were assessed using the GRADE criteria. Results: Four studies were identified meeting search criteria. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 90 appendectomy patients assigned to rooms with or without plants found that patients exposed to plants during recovery demonstrated lower anxiety and pain ratings, and reported higher satisfaction with the hospital environment. A second RCT of 80 thyroidectomy patients showed shorter hospitalizations, reduced analgesic intake, higher environment satisfaction, and lower anxiety and pain ratings in patients who viewed plants during recovery. A third study, a RCT of 90 hemorrhoidectomy patients, demonstrated significantly reduced anxiety and pain ratings in patients who had plants placed in their hospital rooms during recovery, with patients rating their rooms as more comfortable. A fourth clinical trial demonstrated lower anxiety rates in patients waiting for imaging studies when plants, either real or images as posters, were present in the waiting rooms. In addition, these patients rated these rooms as more attractive. Conclusion: The presence of plants in the hospital setting has been shown to reduce patient stress and pain, as well as provide a more satisfying healthcare environment. Patients reported lower levels of anxiety, pain intensity, and pain distress when viewing plants. Rooms containing plants were rated as more attractive, comforting, and satisfying. The addition of live or <b>artificial</b> <b>foliage</b> provides a cost-effective and safe method to improve patient experiences in a hospital setting...|$|E
40|$|A white spruce, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss. (pinaceae), {{plantation}} {{in southern}} Quebec contained two distinct types of trees: resistant and susceptible to attack by spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). The {{primary purpose of}} this study was to evaluate if and how the pattern of feeding and oviposition preference are modified in response to past nutritional experience. Both lab-reared insects and field-reared insects, tested on <b>artificial</b> diet and <b>foliage,</b> respectively, failed to show differences in the pattern of feeding between groups with different nutritional experience. These findings suggest that the spruce budworm, like other specialists feeders, may not have evolved mechanisms of physiological or behavioral modification in response to previous nutritional stress. That being said, adult budworm, when reared on foliage from resistant trees, preferentially laid more eggs on foliage from susceptible trees but showed no significant preference when reared on foliage from susceptible trees. These findings illustrate that the presence of deterrent compounds on the surface of needles, coupled with larval experience, may be influencing adult oviposition preference. Both these findings have important implications for forest management strategies; plantations using mixed tree phenotypes may slow budworm adaptation to resistant trees...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} explore how {{representations}} of nature were worn {{on the body}} as fashion in the nineteenth century. At a time when urban life began to replace the rural as the dominant experience of many, how did nineteenth century fashion &# 039;artificially&# 039; reenact the natural world on the body? &# 039;The landscapes of the body&# 039; as described by Walter Benjamin are &# 039;traversed by paths which lead sexuality {{into the world of}} the inorganic. &# 039; Fashion in this instance is allied with fetishism and the object. The artificial flower is poised within these symbolic languages and the corporeal suggestiveness of the flower can be read as emblematic of sexual desire. An iconography is revealed in cultural fantasies of nature spirits, and fairy creatures depicted wearing wreaths, flowing organic robes and adorned with petals. Whilst in the drawing rooms of cities, women performed their social rituals accessorised by both fresh and artificial flowers. Surveying three terrains: the domestic and public interior, the garden or rural landscape and the body, this paper will examine the cultural fascination of the floral in the popular use of <b>artificial</b> flowers and <b>foliage</b> in fashion...|$|R
