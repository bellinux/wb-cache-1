500|$|Postbellum {{criticism}} of Longstreet {{claims that he}} was ordered by Lee to attack {{in the early morning}} and that his delays were a significant contributor to the loss of the battle. However, Lee agreed to the delays for arriving troops and did not issue his formal order for the attack until 11 a.m. Although Longstreet's motivations have long been clouded by the vitriol of the Lost Cause partisans (see Legacy), many historians agree that Longstreet did not aggressively pursue Lee's orders to launch an attack as early as possible. Biographer Jeffry D. Wert wrote, [...] "Longstreet deserves censure for his performance on the morning of July 2. He allowed his disagreement with Lee's decision to affect his conduct. Once the commanding general determined to assail the enemy, duty required Longstreet to comply with the vigor and thoroughness that had previously characterized his generalship. The concern for detail, the regard for timely information, and the need for preparation were absent." [...] Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones wrote, [...] "Unenthusiastic about the attack, Longstreet consumed so much time in properly assembling and aligning the corps that the assault did not commence until 4 p.m. During <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> passed, Meade continued to move in troops to bring about a more and more complete concentration; by 6 p.m. he had achieved numerical superiority and had his left well covered." [...] Campaign historian Edwin Coddington presents a lengthy description of the approach march, which he described as [...] "a comedy of errors such as one might expect of inexperienced commanders and raw militia, but not of Lee's [...] "War Horse" [...] and his veteran troops." [...] He called the episode [...] "a dark moment in Longstreet's career as a general." [...] Gettysburg historian Harry Pfanz concluded that [...] "Longstreet's angry dissidence had resulted in further wasted time and delay." [...] David L. Callihan, in a 2002 reassessment of Longstreet's legacy, wrote, [...] "It is appalling that a field commander of Longstreet's experience and caliber would so cavalierly and ineptly march and prepare his men for battle." ...|$|E

Robb told an Inside Soap reporter that Val wants to give Dylan a [...] "normal family life". She believed her character did not want to ruin Grace's relationship but thought it felt natural to try.

John Romita, Sr. designed the first Wolverine costume, and believes he introduced the retractable claws, saying, [...] "When I make a design, I {{want it to be}} practical and functional.

[...] Wolverine first appeared in the final [...] "teaser" [...] panel of The Incredible Hulk #180 (cover-dated Oct. 1974) written by Wein and penciled by Herb Trimpe. The character then appeared in a number of advertisements in various Marvel Comics publications before making his first major appearance in The Incredible Hulk #181 (Nov. 1974) again by the Wein–Trimpe team. In 2009, Trimpe said he [...] "distinctly remembers" [...] Romita's sketch and that, [...] "The way I see it, [...] sewed the monster together and I shocked it to life!...

2500|$|As {{soon as it}} is {{admitted}} that, in the real world, all economic goods can trade at prices above or below their real production-cost, {{it can no longer}} be true, that the only source of all profits is the exploitation of wage labor. The reason is, that profit income can arise simply from selling the same priced good for more than it was purchased for, resulting in a capital gain for the seller, where this capital gain can be completely unrelated (or quite disproportional) to any identifiable labor cost. Effectively, more labor can exchange for less labor, and vice versa, and in the real world, this happens – fortunately or unfortunately – <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>That</b> insight is the basis of the theory of unequal exchange. According to this theory, exploitation is not something that is limited only to [...] "the point of production" [...] of the revolutionary classical orthodox Marxists. Exploitation could occur in all sorts of ways, including at the level of international trade. In turn, that means that profit rates can be influenced by the terms of market trade, quite independently of production (as long as everybody can make gains, then even if the gains are not equal, it may attract no attention; but when incomes fall, the problem becomes manifest). Profit rates may not fall, because products are made cheaply {{in one part of the}} world, and resold somewhere else for a much higher price. The financial gain involved in the resales is not made explicit by value-added statistics, except indirectly.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 August 2010, the Russian Islamist website Kavkaz Center claimed Umarov had officially {{announced}} his resignation {{for health reasons}} and appointed his military deputy Aslambek Vadalov as his successor.

And I will serve the word of Allah and work to kill the enemies of Allah in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he gives me to live on this earth." [...] He called the initial video a [...] "fabrication," [...] but did not say why there was a conflict. Later in 2010, Vadalov and the Arab mujahid Muhannad attempted to overthrow Umarov {{as the leader of the}} Caucasus Emirate. The [...] "supreme judge" [...] of the group, Sayfullah and Emir Adam, the [...] "governor of Ingushetia province", continued to support Umarov. Umarov blamed the split in the organization for Muhannad, who was killed by Russian forces in April 2011, paving the way for re-unification. In July 2011, the insurgents' supreme Islamic court ruled in favour of recognizing Umarov as the leader of the Caucasus Emirate. Amir Khamzat, the commander of the Riyad-us-Saliheen Martyr Brigade suicide battalion was named the commander of the western sector; Hussein Gakayev was named to lead the eastern sector. Vadalov and Tarkhan Gaziyev consequently followed suit and re-affirmed their allegiance to Umarov. Umarov then warned Russia that it would be the target of a new strengthened insurgency as he promised a year of [...] "blood and tears" [...] as a result of the new unity.|$|E
