5|$|It Takes a Church is an American dating {{game show}} hosted by Natalie Grant and {{broadcast}} by Game Show Network. The show travels to multiple churches {{across the country}} looking for single members of congregations looking for a partner. The congregation {{of the church is}} primarily in charge of looking at potential daters <b>and</b> <b>judging</b> which one would be the best match. The first season, sponsored by Christian Mingle, began airing on June 5, 2014. The series was later renewed for a second season, which began airing March 26, 2015.|$|E
5|$|It {{rejects the}} Christian {{emphasis}} on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming <b>and</b> <b>judging</b> of others for their actions, believing {{that if an}} individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.|$|E
5|$|The {{roughness}} of {{this version}} succeeded {{in a way}} the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, <b>and</b> <b>judging</b> by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. It was a rare moment, one that true performers strive for and don't find often enough to satisfy themselves.|$|E

5|$|In 1974 RobertA.Martin {{proposed}} that the large North American wolf C.armbrusteri (Armbruster's wolf) was C.lupus. Nowak, Kurten, and Annalisa Berta {{proposed that}} C.dirus was not derived from C.lupus. In 1987, a new hypothesis proposed that a mammal population could {{give rise to a}} larger form called a hypermorph during times when food was abundant, but when food later became scarce the hypermorph would either adapt to a smaller form or go extinct. This hypothesis might explain the large body sizes found in many Late Pleistocene mammals compared to their modern counterparts. Both extinction and speciationa process by which a new species splits from an older onecould occur together during periods of climatic extremes. Gloria D. Goulet agreed with Martin, proposing further that this hypothesis might explain the sudden appearance of C.dirus in North America <b>and,</b> <b>judging</b> from the similarities in their skull shapes, that C.lupus had given rise to the C.dirus hypermorph due to an abundance of game, a stable environment, and large competitors.|$|E
5|$|Kyle, Cartman and Kenny {{surprise}} Stan {{by creating}} a Facebook account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family and friends to add them as friends. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as Randy, his grandmother and even Wendy confronting him over his supposed disregard for them <b>and</b> <b>judging</b> his real-world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy (anagram: Dorky Drip) to his thriving friends list out of pity. Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, {{in part due to}} a Mad Friends podcast he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and asserts nobody will want to hang out with Kyle. Kyle understands this, but, on principle and out of pity, cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to Chatroulette as a way to make new friends, which fails as most {{of the people on the}} site are either jacking off or showing their genitals, until Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of modern {{tropical}} cyclone tracking technology, notably satellite imagery, many hurricanes that did not affect land directly went unnoticed, and storms that did affect land were not recognized until their onslaught. As a result, information on older hurricane seasons was often incomplete. Modern-day efforts have been made and are still ongoing to reconstruct the tracks of known hurricanes and to identify initially undetected storms. In many cases, the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path, <b>and</b> <b>judging</b> by the direction of winds experienced by ships, and their location {{in relation to the}} storm, it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm's center of circulation for a given point in time. This is the manner in which all of the eleven known storms in the 1906 season were identified by hurricane expert José Fernández-Partagás's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910. Partagás also extended the known tracks of three other hurricanes previously identified by scholars. The information Partagás and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with some slight adjustments. HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity, although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed, listings on some storms are incomplete.|$|E

5|$|The {{resident}} supercargo {{was responsible}} for buying goods such as tea, porcelain, silk, arrack, sago and miscellaneous for the next ship arriving from Sweden. The SOIC traded mainly with the Chinese merchant Puankhequa, who had his factory next to the Swedish, <b>and</b> <b>judging</b> from their letters, Puankhequa and Grill became friends. Grill was entrusted with funds from the SOIC for buying tea and other goods during off-season when the price was at its lowest. He bought most of the tea from Puankhequa, and several contracts are preserved. However, he did not buy the tea from the Chinese merchant on the SOIC's behalf but instead bought it through his own company and sold {{it on to the}} SOIC at a slightly higher price. After some time the SOIC became suspicious and director David Sandberg was sent to Canton to investigate the matter in 1766. Grill and his companions, Grubb and Hahr, had to sign an agreement not to misuse their position within the SOIC. In 1768, Grill was ordered to return home as supercargo on the ship Cron Prins Gustaf. Even so, Hahr stayed behind in Canton, continued their business and was able to transfer Grill's share of the profit through international bank notes.|$|E
5|$|During Roman times, Volubilis {{was a major}} {{producer}} of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible, as are {{the remains of the}} original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central {{to the life of the}} city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the olives, a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a prelum or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed. The olives were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, <b>and</b> <b>judging</b> from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} factors affecting the evaluations of Judo referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> accredited with A, B and C licenses (n= 100 each) after observing four different throwing techniques from four directions. Referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> {{were asked to}} evaluate the throwing techniques without being allowed to freely select their field of view or {{hear the sound of}} impact between the thrown competitor and the mat. In addition, we investigated the reasons for differences in evaluations according to the direction of view by focusing on contact between the thrown competitor and the mat. 1. Significant interactions were observed for only one of the four throwing techniques. In addition, a significant main effect was observed for all four throwing techniques. Based on these findings, the following factors appeared to influence the evaluations made by the referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> with regard to throwing techniques: 1) direction of view, 2) refereeing level, and 3) a combination of both the direction of view and refereeing level. In addition, differences in evaluations were considered highly likely to have been caused by individual effects related to the direction of view and the level of refereeing. 2. When the execution of a throwing technique prevents referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> from clearly observing body contact with the mat, the technique is evaluated by considering the series of body movements and estimating contact between the body and the mat based on available visual data. This may also result in differences of evaluation. 3. The average scores awarded for throwing techniques by A- and B-licensed referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> were significantly higher than those awarded by C-licensed referees <b>and</b> <b>judges.</b> Although the difference between A- and B-licensed referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> did not reach significance, A-licensed referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> tended to award higher average scores than B-licensed referees <b>and</b> <b>judges.</b> This suggests that more qualified referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> evaluate throwing techniques more accurately. The {{reason for this is that}} less qualified referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> tend to undervalue throwing techniques...|$|R

25|$|The earlier text, {{of which}} five short {{fragments}} {{have come down}} to us, {{is known as the}} Pactus Alamannorum, <b>and</b> <b>judging</b> from the persistent recurrence of the expression et sic convenit, was most probably drawn up by an official commission.

25|$|There is {{a general}} {{misconception}} about scoring <b>and</b> <b>judging.</b> In serious meets, the absolute score is somewhat meaningless. It is the relative score, not the absolute score that wins meets. Accordingly, good judging implies consistent scoring across the dives. Specifically, if a judge consistently gives low scores for all divers, or consistently gives high scores for the same divers, the judging will yield fair relative results and will cause divers to place in the correct order. However, absolute scores have significance to the individual divers. Besides the obvious instances of setting records, absolute scores are also used for rankings and qualifications for higher level meets.|$|E
