The more conservative women wear burqas {{that may or may}} not cover the face. Combinations of Pakistani and Western attire are worn by women, such as an embroidered kurta worn with jeans or trousers, and half sleeve or sleeveless shirts with Capri pants.

5|$|The {{dress code}} of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair <b>and</b> <b>jeans,</b> black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Yusef is wrongly {{accused of}} {{having an affair with}} Zainab, due to his {{sister-in-law}} overhearing them speaking. A source said that the whole day turns into a disaster. When Shameem sees Yusef and Zainab together she automatically thinks they're having an affair and everyone struggles {{to come to terms with}} what they have heard. Bhatti has admitted that he is surprised by his status as a heartthrob. Interviewed by Will Payne of the Sunday Mirror, he said that it's a great compliment however, it was a complete surprise. Bhatti hinted that perhaps women love the character, but he prefer trainers <b>and</b> <b>jeans</b> to smart suits.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} sweater <b>and</b> <b>jeans,</b> {{walking through}} a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|Everest {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of the bespoke casual movement which, as the name suggests, provides individually tailored casual clothing of Savile Row quality, including: casual shirts; smart-casual jackets; T-shirts; <b>and</b> <b>jeans.</b> In collaboration with Levi's in 2004, he designed a tailored-denim suit, sold in Japanese retailer Oki-Ni's stores. Expanding the bespoke casual concept, he offered a bespoke denim tailoring service dressing celebrities from sports, Hollywood and rock music, such as David Beckham, Kevin Bacon and Ricky Wilson of the Kaiser Chiefs. Everest designed a suit collection in 2004/05 in collaboration with Rocawear, the fashion clothing company founded by American hip hop artists Damon Dash and Jay-Z. The advertising campaign was fronted by Dash's friends Kevin Bacon and Naomi Campbell. He teamed up with British casual and sportswear designer Kim Jones during 2005 and 2006. The collaboration produced tailoring collections for four seasons that were shown on the catwalk at Paris fashion week. For his next collaboration, in 2006 Everest showed a limited collection of menswear with New York hair salon Bumble and bumble, including a fully bespoke denim line, which retailed at around US$1,000. Marketed as a 'destination location', the retail space on the store's 8th floor, in the fashionable Meatpacking District of Manhattan, also featured a barbershop, a café and a teahouse. In autumn 2007, the Timothy Everest ready-to-wear collection was available in shops for the first time, including Flannels, Liberty and John Lewis. The range included suits, shirts and trousers. He was costume designer for the 2008 film Mamma Mia!, dressing its stars, including Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth. He opened a West End store in 2008, at Bruton Street, Mayfair, off Bond Street; less than five minutes walk from Savile Row. He has been a creative contributor and Sartorial Advisor to men's magazine The Rake since 2008.|$|E

One {{reason for that is}} that acrobatic elements have grown more and more dangerous, requiring both freedom of movement and enough durability to avoid tearing.|$|E

5000|$|The 1960s and the 1970s {{were the}} start of {{crafting}} jeans for individual taste, based on the fashion and social movements at the time. Examples of these include embroidered <b>jeans,</b> painted <b>jeans,</b> <b>and</b> psychedelic <b>jeans.</b> John Fiske describes this as “the raggedness is {{the production of the}} choice of the user; it is an excorporation of the commodity into a subordinates subculture and a transfer of {{at least some of the}} power inherent in the commoditization process.” In the 1980s jeans became designer fashion, labels such as Guess jeans. More recently, the focus on personalization of jeans includes finish, styles, cuts, shapes, aged, authentic, <b>and</b> vintage <b>jeans.</b> John Fiske is quoted as saying “the wearer of torn jeans is, after all, wearing <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> not, for instance the Buddhist derived robes of the orange people." ...|$|R

25|$|Kurtas {{are often}} worn with jeans. Women {{sometimes}} wear kurtas as blouses, usually over jeans pants. Jeans are sometimes preferred over pajamas or leggings {{as they are}} more durable for rough use. Most colours of kurtas match with blue jeans. In 2014, an Indian family court in Mumbai ruled that a husband objecting to his wife wearing a kurta <b>and</b> <b>jeans</b> and forcing her to wear a sari amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce.

25|$|Upon Starr's {{retirement}} in 2000, he was succeeded by Daily News writer Jay Maeder and artist Andrew Pepoy, beginning Monday, June 5, 2000. Pepoy was eventually succeeded by Alan Kupperberg (2001–2004) and Ted Slampyak (2004–2010). The new creators updated the strip's settings and characters {{for a modern}} audience, giving Annie a new hairdo <b>and</b> <b>jeans</b> rather than her trademark dress. However, Maeder's new stories never managed {{to live up to}} the pathos and emotional engagement of the stories by Gray and Starr. Annie herself was often reduced to a supporting role and was a far less complex character than the girl readers had known for seven decades. Maeder's writing style tended to make the stories feel like tongue-in-cheek adventures compared to the serious, heartfelt tales Gray and Starr favored. Annie gradually lost subscribers during the 2000s, and by 2010, it was running in fewer than 20 U.S. newspapers.|$|E

25|$|On January 1, 1985, {{another victim}} was found near Jellico, Tennessee, in Campbell County on interstate 75. Although her murder {{occurred}} three days before, presumably on December 30, 1984, {{she was already}} in an advanced state of decomposition. Like the others, she was white and had short red hair, which was somewhat curly. She was likely {{between the ages of}} 17 and 25, although she may have been as old as 30 at the time she was murdered. The victim was found clothed, with a tan pullover, a shirt <b>and</b> <b>jeans.</b> The Jane Doe had green or hazel eyes, which could not be positively confirmed as a certain color because of the state of her body. The young woman also had freckles, various scars and burn marks on her body and was two and a half to five months pregnant when murdered by an undisclosed method. She had no evidence of dental work, except for a partial denture holding two false teeth on her upper jaw.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} six days later that her remains, which were in an {{advanced}} state of decomposition, {{were found in the}} weeds a few feet off the side of a scarcely traveled road in Holmes County, Ohio. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted with a vibrator and a large plastic bag had been wrapped around her legs. Because of the condition of her remains, police were not able to identify the body until Harrison's father confirmed that it was his daughter. A Budweiser towel, a bloody car seat box, a wad of Harrison's hair, gloves, a plaid shirt <b>and</b> <b>jeans</b> were all found {{in the vicinity of the}} dump site. Examination of the remains indicated that the body was subjected to high temperatures, which was likely a consequence of her body remaining inside of the vehicle for a long period of time during summer weather. Krista was buried in the Maple Grove Cemetery in Marshallville.|$|E
