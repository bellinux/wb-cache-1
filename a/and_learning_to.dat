5|$|The White Stag Leadership Development Program's methods {{address all}} of the areas the studies identified. Mentored and coached by adults, the youth staff develop, plan and {{implement}} the week-long summer camp programs. They develop skills in research, writing, planning, and evaluation. Using the outdoors, they practice learning activities, games, and outdoor skills required {{to live in a}} camping environment. They learn to get along with and other counsel youth from different backgrounds. They study eleven specific skills of leadership and practice presenting them to one another before summer camp, when they present these learning sessions to the participants. The youth, led and mentored by adults, work together with other youth they have never met, forming new relationships <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> connect and cooperate. They learn basic group membership skills required in work life, like communication and planning, and plan and implement their leadership skills in their home community. They learn and practice problem-solving and counseling skills, how groups form and grow, and planning skills. They learn and rehearse various kinds of communications skills, how to represent their group—both with and without the group's input—and how to work effectively with others.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{strove to}} be a painter of rural life and nature, and {{during his first}} summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and {{traditional}} rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led {{him to try to}} capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His renditions of the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower.|$|E

25|$|Picard {{wakes up}} to find himself {{on the surface of}} Kataan, a non-Federation planet.

Kamin spends much time outdoors and with his Dobsonian telescope studying nature.

25|$|Frontman Justin Pierre {{composed}} the lyrics for Go, which is themed around mortality, growing older, <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> {{live in the}} moment. The reflective tone includes subjects such as procrastination, relationship miscommunication, and optimism, but also personal struggles such as the death of loved ones. Many songs on Go were developed over years at a time, and several date to the band's first few studio albums. Musically, the album retains the band's pop-rock, Moog-based sound, with a heavier emphasis on electronic experimentation. Following the album's recording, the band entered talks with Epitaph Records, where they were signed from 2003 to 2008. Discussions with label founder Brett Gurewitz led the band to re-sign with Epitaph, who co-released Go alongside the band's own label, The Boombox Generation. It is the final album by the band to feature long-time drummer Tony Thaxton before he announced his departure on March, 20th, 2013.|$|E
25|$|Beatty's early {{education}} concentrated on horsemanship, hunting <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> be a gentleman. Beatty {{had a close}} relationship with his elder brother Charles, who became his ally against their oppressive and overbearing father. They remained close throughout life, {{so much so that the}} only time Beatty felt despair was at his brother's death. Beatty later wrote to his wife about Charles, we lived together, played together, rode together, fought together. His brothers would later join the British Army, but early on young David developed an interest in ships and the sea and expressed a desire to join the Royal Navy. In 1881 Beatty's grandfather died and David Longfield succeeded to the 18th century mansion, 'Borodale', outside Enniscorthy, in County Wexford. After retiring from the army David Longfield established a business training horses first in Cheshire and then at 'The Mount', near Rugby, Warwickshire. On inheriting and following the death of his wife at 'The Mount', David Longfield returned to Ireland abandoning the training business.|$|E
50|$|Children from {{indigenous}} heritage {{communities of}} the Americas often learn through observation, a strategy that can carry over into adulthood. The heightened value towards observation allows children to multi-task and actively engage in simultaneous activities. The exposure to an uncensored adult lifestyle allows children <b>to</b> observe <b>and</b> <b>learn</b> the skills <b>and</b> practices that are valued in their communities. Children observe elders, parents, and siblings complete tasks <b>and</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> participate in them.

25|$|One of the para-Alpine skiing {{techniques}} used by this class {{is called the}} three track method, and was developed {{as part of the}} American Training System. One of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier can learn how to flex the ankle, knee and hip. This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity. The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis. This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill. The skier next learns how to fall down and get back up again. The next skill learned is climbing gentle terrain, followed by learning to go down a straight run <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> stop. After this, the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift. This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line, which teaches the skier how to maintain the ski edge. Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie, beginning turns, parallel turns, short swings and moguls.|$|E
