The valve and stem can be threaded such that the stem can be screwed into or out of the valve by turning it in one direction or the other, thus moving the disc back or forth inside the body. Packing is often used between the stem and the bonnet to maintain a seal. Some valves have no external control and do not need a stem as in most check valves.|$|E

Often, gas cylinders are somewhat long and narrow and may stand upright on a flattened bottom at one end with the valve at the top. During storage, transportation, and handling when the gas is not in use, a cap may be screwed over the protruding valve {{to protect it from}} damage or breaking off in case the cylinder were to fall over. Instead of a cap, cylinders commonly have a protective collar or neck ring around the service valve assembly.|$|E

Within the pump activity the problem of hemolysis and clotting is encountered. In this study the influence of valve geometry on blood cell damage and stagnant zones has been investigated. A variable valve length coupled to a catheter ejection gap and a Variable valve angle have been studied. In case of the studied valve, optimal parameter values have been determined. Compared to small catheter ejection gaps with a corresponding valve length, blood damage {{is found to be}} less for large ejection gaps with corresponding valve dimensions. In systole a valve positioned in a 0 degrees angle proves to be best, whereas in diastole a + 20 degrees angle is preferable.

40|$|Owing {{to their}} high mass centre, {{relatively}} soft tyres, extreme {{variations in the}} load and load distributions during work cycles and greater flexibility of the steering system, the articulated steer vehicles (ASV) exhibit lower directional stability limits compared to vehicles with conventional steering. In this study, a kineto-dynamic model of the frame steering mechanism is formulated {{in conjunction with a}} nonlinear yaw-plane model of an articulated dump-truck. The validity of the model is demonstrated based on the available measured data. The proposed model is initially analysed to derive response characteristics of the steering system in terms of articulation <b>angle,</b> <b>valve</b> opening, strut orientations and deflections, fluid pressures and resultant strut forces and torque. The influences of variations in selected operating and design parameters on the steering system responses are investigated under a steady-turning and pulse steering inputs. The results provide important design guidelines with regard to kinematic and dynamic parameters of the steering mechanism and show that the lateral stability of the ASV is strongly influenced by the effective damping of the steering mechanism which is determined by kineto-dynamic characteristics of the articulated steering system including leakage flows across the struts piston, valve flow characteristics and struts orientations...|$|E

40|$|The PETRA {{storage ring}} at DESY will be {{upgraded}} {{to a third}} generation synchrotron radiation source with 15 beamlines in the PETRA III project [1]. Mobile pumping stations will be needed for the initial pump down of the beamlines and beamline components to a hydrocarbon-free and particle-free ultra-high vacuum [2]. They will be placed at the disposal for users to pump down and bake their experimental chambers and for leak detection. Since the old HASYLAB pumping station design used at DORIS does not fulfil the resulting requirements, a new pumping station was developed (see Fig. 1). Figure 1 : The new mobile dry pumping station for PETRA III beamlines. The outer dimensions of the station are adapted to the tight space in the PETRA tunnel.

40|$|Sizing a valve or {{a fitting}} in {{single-phase}} flow {{is an easy}} to do operation. In two-phase flow, however, more complex flowing conditions occur and attention must be paid when selecting the model to predict pressure losses. Some special types of valves are also used in industrial plant for regulation purposes and flow control. In this case {{is important to have}} a reliable model to predict the flow rate through the valve in order to operate adequately on the valve actuator to control flow conditions. Different types of valve are used with this purpose: gate valves, globe valves, orifice valves, etc. In previous works a special type of valve used in the petroleum industry has been studied: the choke valve. It could be classified as an <b>angle</b> <b>valve,</b> apart {{from the fact that the}} flow follows a reverse path (it is first diverted, then it passes through a restriction) This paper presents the experimental characterisation study of a gate valve of 2 ” nominal diameter and the comparison with the previous studies on MOV. The aim of the study was to investigate the flow through this type of valve, to understand the phenomena that occur inside it and to improve a model to calculate pressure drops in two-phase flow conditions.

40|$|Despite {{governmental}} {{constraints and}} legislation, the fuel consumption in traffic and transporta-tion increases persistently. To help diminishing this problem, TUE, Van Doorne’s Transmissie (VDT) and TNO early 1997 launched the EcoDrive project. They develop a hybrid driveline, using a high or medium speed flywheel, an internal combustion engine, a {{continuously variable transmission}} and an integral driveline control strategy. This hybrid driveline and the control strategy decreases the fuel consumption (0 - 20 %) without detoriating the driveability. To realise a good control strategy, {{it is necessary to}} obtain a relation between the throttle <b>angle</b> <b>valve</b> q 5 and the engine output torque Ma at each realistic engine angular speed w,. Therefore, the Meun Vulue Engine Model is applied. It describes the transfers between input (e. g. the crankshaft angular speed w, and the throttle valve angle q 5) and the output (e. g. Md and fuel mass flow Qf,). Starting point of this research are the earlier derived mean value engine models in [9] and [lo]. These can be used to generate the engine maps. Often these engine maps are already generated by the manufacturer. The current research concentrates itself on the question {{whether or not it is}} possible to go in the opposite direction and to identify the MB A-class spark ignition (si.) engine.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Various {{environmental}} {{studies have shown}} that the problem of elevated concentrations of lead in drinking water exists mainly in older buildings, where lead parts are built in the network or the network contains other materials containing lead. Migration of lead into drinking water is also affected by particular characteristics of the drinking water and by stagnation of the water in the pipes. Children are particularly susceptible to increased risk of lead exposure in the environment and adverse effects of lead will manifests at lower concentrations in the blood. The purpose of this work is to contribute starting points for the creation of evidence-based measures to reduce the levels of lead in drinking water, and thus its impact on human health in Slovenia. METHODS: The author conducted a cross-sectional study in order to assess the status of selected public water supply systems and domestic water supply systems in selected kindergartens and elementary schools on the basis of a questionnaire. The concentration of lead in the drinking water of the selected kindergartens and elementary schools was determined by means of an experimental method in a laboratory. Cold drinking water samples of 250 ml that stood in the pipes from 8 to 18 hours were used. A method for determining the migration from different materials was applied. An old lead pipe was used, which had already been installed in the facility, as well as new materials (plastic, copper, galvanized pipes and stainless steel pipes and also brass faucet, chrome <b>angle</b> <b>valve</b> and plastic hose) which had not been used yet. To determine the concentration of lead in the water the method ICP-MS was applied. Then the ecological study followed. Lead exposure for a 6 -year- old child was calculated on the basis of assessing the uptake of lead from air, water, food and soil. In the calculation, absorption factors were considered and also worst–case scenario was provided. For the assessment, the model IEUBK was used. RESULTS: Sampling showed that more than 22...|$|E
