25|$|In Man la yahduruhu al-faqih, Babawayh {{discusses}} his sources. These {{include the}} works of Hariz ibn 'Abd Allah al-Sijistani and 'Ubaid Allah ibn 'Ali al-Halabi who were contemporaries of the Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq. They also included {{the works of}} Ali ibn Mahziyar; al-Husayn ibn Sa'id; and Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn 'Isa (died 297 A.H.) who <b>all</b> <b>heard</b> {{the traditions of the}} Imams Ali Al-Ridha, Muhammad al-Jawad and al-Hadi. Other sources were the works of Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn 'Imran al-Ash'ari, Sa'd ibn 'Abd Allah (died about 300 A.H.) and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan (died 343 A.H.) Ibn Babawayh was taught by the latter. The sources also included the works of Muhammad b. Abi 'Umayr (died 218 A.H.), Ahmad ibn Abi 'Abd Allah al-Barqi (died in 274 or 280 A.H.) and the Risala which Ibn Babawayh's father had written to him. Ibn Babawayh also cites his own works.|$|E
500|$|Han't or ha'n't, {{an early}} {{contraction}} for has not and have not, {{developed from the}} elision of the [...] "s" [...] of has not and the [...] "v" [...] of have not. Han't appeared {{in the work of}} English Restoration playwrights, as in The Country Wife (1675) by William Wycherley: Gentlemen and Ladies, han't you <b>all</b> <b>heard</b> the late sad report / of poor Mr. Horner. Much like an't, han't was sometimes pronounced with a long [...] "a", yielding hain't. With H-dropping, the [...] "h" [...] of han't or hain't gradually disappeared in most dialects, and became ain't.|$|E
500|$|After Jacobs {{decided that}} Evans {{would no longer}} play Pam, he began searching for another actress to play the character. The role was {{eventually}} won by then 28-year-old actress, Victoria Principal. Principal won the role over another finalist, Judith Chapman, who was known famously for her work in daytime television. Shortly after Principal's role on Fantasy Island, a friend pointed her {{in the direction of}} Dallas and [...] "a part in it that was written for you". [...] Eventually, Principal received a copy of the script [...] "and read it and thought [...] was absolutely right". Acting as her own agent, she set up a meeting with the producers of Dallas. Lee Rich, an executive producer in 1979, recounted: [...] "We had <b>all</b> <b>heard</b> rumors about Victoria. This is a small town. Victoria's background, her so-called past, was a plus. We felt that she had experienced life and could understand the part." [...] Jacobs later said, [...] "Victoria, of all the actors, went for the role the most aggressively. And that sort of determination just became part of the character." [...] Prior to being cast in Dallas, Principal had starred in a few small roles in movies and television specials. These works include Earthquake in 1974, and Fantasy Island in 1977.|$|E

2500|$|... 1996 â€“ Robert Wilensky once jocularly remarked, [...] "We've <b>all</b> <b>heard</b> that {{a million}} monkeys banging on a million {{typewriters}} will eventually reproduce the entire works of Shakespeare. Now, {{thanks to the}} Internet, we know this is not true." [...] This version of the internet analogy [...] "began appearing as a very frequent email and web-page epigraph starting in 1997".|$|E
2500|$|Fraser McAlpine {{from the}} BBC's Chartblog rated the song three stars out of five, {{stating that the}} song was [...] "the sort of thing we've <b>all</b> <b>heard</b> {{hundreds}} of times" [...] yet praised Ewen's vocal abilities: [...] "Still, Jade Ewen has a formidable set of pipes and copes admirably with the mad range the song requires, so you never know." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Stratford-upon-Avon in 1962 Peter Brook (who {{would later}} film the {{play with the}} same actor, Paul Scofield, {{in the role of}} Lear) set the action simply, against a huge, empty white stage. The effect of the scene when Lear and Gloucester meet, two tiny figures in rags {{in the midst of this}} emptiness, was said (by the scholar Roger Warren) to catch [...] "both the human pathos ... and the {{universal}} scale ... of the scene." [...] Some of the lines from the radio broadcast were used by The Beatles to add into the recorded mix of the song [...] "I Am the Walrus". John Lennon happened upon the play on the BBC Third Programme while fiddling with the radio while working on the song. The voices of actors Mark Dignam, Philip Guard, and John Bryning from the play are <b>all</b> <b>heard</b> in the song.|$|E

2500|$|Mike Ayers from Billboard gave {{a mostly}} {{positive}} review, saying, [...] "Lyrically, Louder is rather one-sided, as she often sings about {{the perils of}} relationships, over and over, in ways that we've <b>all</b> <b>heard</b> many times at this point. Still, it's a solid effort that shows she has promise as a bonafide pop artist." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe gave the album a mostly positive review, writing, [...] "The Broadway veteran puts her mighty soprano through its paces on bouncy dance tracks, soaring ballads, and midtempo pop tunes where she straddles the line, mostly comfortably, between Katy Perry and Celine Dion." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B-, writing, [...] "It's hard to be that mad at Louder, because it's so admirably and lovingly crafted. There's nothing wrong with Lea Michele's debut, and that's its biggest problem. While well curated and exquisitely executed, Louder is missing the visceral oomph that defines the gulf between superstars {{and the rest of}} the top 40 chum." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, 67 {{claims for}} {{compensation}} were lodged against Cunard, which were <b>all</b> <b>heard</b> together in 1918. Judge Julius Mayer, who {{was chosen to}} hear the case, had previously presided over the case brought following {{the loss of the}} Titanic, where he had ruled in favour of the shipping company. Mayer was a conservative who was considered a safe pair of hands with matters of national interest, and whose favourite remark to lawyers was to [...] "come to the point". The case was to be heard without a jury. The two sides agreed beforehand that no question would be raised regarding whether Lusitania had been armed or carrying troops or ammunition. Thirty-three witnesses who could not travel to the US gave statements in England to Commissioner R. V. Wynne. Evidence produced in open court for the Mersey investigation was considered, but evidence from the British closed sessions was not. The Defence of the Realm Act was invoked so that British witnesses could not give evidence on any subject it covered. Statements had been collected in Queenstown immediately after the sinking by the American Consul, Wesley Frost, but these were not produced.|$|E
2500|$|The {{district}} {{soon began}} construction of drainage canals, and Disney {{built the first}} roads and the Magic Kingdom. The Contemporary Resort Hotel and Polynesian Village were also completed {{in time for the}} park's opening on October 1, 1971. The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before, while Fort Wilderness opened a month later. 24 days after the park opened , Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as [...] "Walt Disney World" [...] in his brother's honor. In his own words: [...] "Everyone has heard of Ford cars. But have they <b>all</b> <b>heard</b> of Henry Ford, who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here." [...] After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, Lillian, what she thought of Walt Disney World. According to biographer Bob Thomas, she responded, [...] "I think Walt would have approved." [...] Roy Disney died at age 78 on December 20, 1971, less than three months after the property opened.|$|E
