5|$|Scholars have differing {{views on}} whether this {{dialogue}} {{is evidence that}} in ancient Vedic tradition women were accepted as active participants in spiritual discussions and as scholars of Brahman. Wendy Doniger, an American Indologist <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> History of Religions, states that in this dialogue Maitreyi is not portrayed as an author, but {{is part of an}} Upanishadic story of a Brahmin with two wives who are distinguished by their intellect. Karen Pechelis, another American Indologist <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> Comparative Religion, in contrast, states that Maitreyi is portrayed as theologically minded, as she challenges Yajnavalkya in this dialogue and asks the right questions.|$|E

5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) was {{a member}} of the French Academy of Sciences <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>{{professor}}</b> <b>of</b> botany at the Jardin des Plantes and then became the first professor of zoology at the new Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle. He became known for his work on the taxonomy of the invertebrates, especially of molluscs. However, he is mainly remembered for the theory that now bears his name, Lamarckism, and in particular his view that the environment (called by Lamarck the conditions of life) gave rise to permanent, inherited, evolutionary changes in animals. He described his theory in his 1802 Recherches sur l'organisation des corps vivants, and in his 1809 Philosophie Zoologique, and later in his Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertèbres, (1815–1822).|$|E
5|$|Fundraising {{efforts were}} led by Achsah M. Ely, {{a member of the}} college's class of 1868 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> math at the school from 1887–1904. Donations came {{from a variety of sources}} {{including}} students attending the college (the class of 1889 donated a total of $148), student groups (the Philaletheis Society, the college's student dramatic organization, contributed $41 dollars in the hopes it could use the building once completed), trustees, and alumnae and their families. By June 1887, the college had raised between $18,000–20,000 and so hired architect William Tubby to design the new hall. Tubby returned to the college with estimates from Poughkeepsie builders ranging in cost from $39,997–50,000, higher than the available budget. The Vassar Board of Trustees formed a subcommittee and attempted to find solutions, including modifying Tubby's designs. The subcommittee received estimates from builders outside of Poughkeepsie (in Kingston, Brooklyn, Troy, and Albany) but the lowest was still above budget at $32,000.|$|E
