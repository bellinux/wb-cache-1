5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move <b>any</b> <b>farther.</b> Norris was well aware of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he {{would have to go to}} him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall line}} is the geomorphologic break between the upland region of {{relatively}} hard crystalline basement rock and the coastal plain of softer sedimentary rock. The fall line is most prominent when crossed by a river. It {{is at this point}} that cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel <b>any</b> <b>farther</b> inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in elevation of the water, and the resulting energy release, made the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Because of the need for a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed the fall line. In Georgia, the Fall Line extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on to Columbus.|$|E

5|$|Danielle {{levelled}} off {{somewhat in}} intensity after that round of rapid intensification, only gradually strengthening afterward due to structural {{changes in the}} storm related to the small wind field relative {{to the size of}} the eye. Nonetheless, Danielle became a Category2 hurricane on the afternoon of August 15 as it approached the subtropical ridge which blocked the continued westward movement. Beginning late on August 15, at about 35°W, Danielle began to recurve to the northwest and eventually north while continuing to gradually strengthen. Early on August 16, the recurvature became more pronounced, and Danielle turned abruptly northward in the central Atlantic Ocean as an upper-level trough opened up a large break in the ridge. That movement took it along the eastern side of the subtropical ridge, preventing Danielle from moving <b>any</b> <b>farther</b> west and becoming any threat to North America or the Caribbean. While moving northwest, Danielle strengthened a bit more, reaching its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity, on the afternoon of August 16.|$|E
5|$|Picton's probing {{attacks against}} the French center also met stiff resistance. Picton split the 3rd Division, sending Thomas Brisbane's brigade up the right spur toward Foy's {{position}} and Keane's brigade up the left spur toward Darmagnac's division. Keane was supported by Manley Power's Portuguese brigade from 3rd Division. Brisbane was followed up the right spur by Clinton's 6th Division. Since the valleys between the spurs were deep and muddy, both advances were restricted to narrow fronts. Picton's skirmishers quickly drove back the French outposts. When the leading brigades came under accurate artillery fire from the Escorial and Lafaurie knolls, Picton held back his formed troops and reinforced his skirmish line to seven British light companies, three 5th/60th Foot rifle companies and the entire 11th Caçadores Battalion. This heavy skirmish line moved forward until it {{came into contact with}} Soult's main defense line, but it was unable to press <b>any</b> <b>farther.</b> For two hours, Picton waited for Beresford's attack to make progress as the two sides skirmished.|$|E

After a skirmish, Philemon Dickinson's New Jersey militia was driven back by the Queen's Rangers. When Grayson's Detachment came on the scene, the Queen's Rangers retreated eastward. Dickinson advised Grayson not to advance <b>any</b> <b>farther</b> because it would a put narrow bridge behind his troops with British troops {{hovering}} nearby. However, Lee created an ad hoc command made up of Grayson's Detachment, Butler's detachment, Henry Jackson's detachment, and Eleazer Oswald's four cannons and sent the troops forward under Wayne. Seeing British troops around 9:30 AM, Wayne ordered Butler and Jackson to engage them while keeping back Grayson's men to guard a key road intersection. Wayne's men skirmished with their adversaries.|$|E

25|$|Long-term {{plans for}} the parkway called for it to extend westward along the {{entirety}} of the Lake Ontario shoreline to Niagara Falls, and from there as far southward as Buffalo. By 1960, the proposed routing was adjusted to meet the northern end of the Robert Moses State Parkway in Porter, near Fort Niagara. When the city of Niagara Falls released its Regional Highway Plan for the Buffalo–Niagara Falls area in 1971, the proposed routing of the Lake Ontario State Parkway was unchanged. Despite the widespread intentions of extending the parkway westward to Niagara County, the highway never extended <b>any</b> <b>farther</b> westward than Lakeside Beach State Park. The lone portion of the extension that was built—between Hamlin Beach and Lakeside Beach state parks—was constructed between 1969 and December 1972 and officially opened on February16, 1973.|$|E

By noon on the 21st a breach was battered in the wall at the northwest corner.
