5|$|The D'Angelo-indebted grind session 'Rocket' and frisky 'Drunk In Love' are {{similarly}} sexy, but they're not sexy like a glamour shot or <b>a</b> <b>steamy</b> video. They're sexy like an overeager, pre-shower quickie, or a hushed morning make-out session before the baby wakes up. These {{are the most}} unapologetically raunchy songs she's ever sung, {{and in many ways}} also the most romantic.|$|E
5|$|Facing an {{uncertain}} future owing {{to the cost of}} restoration and refurbishment necessary to meet the stringent engineering standards required for main line operation, salvation came in 1996 when Dr Tony Marchington, already well known in the vintage movement, bought the locomotive, and had it restored over three years to running condition at a cost of £1million, a restoration which, at the time, was recognised as the most extensive in the locomotive's history. Marchington's time with the Flying Scotsman was documented in a documentary, the Channel 4 programme <b>A</b> <b>Steamy</b> Affair: The Story of Flying Scotsman.|$|E

25|$|Heidegger had a {{long and}} highly {{problematic}} romantic relationship with Hannah Arendt and <b>a</b> <b>steamy</b> affair (over many decades) with Elisabeth Blochmann, both students of his. Arendt was Jewish, and Blochmann had one Jewish parent, making them subject to severe persecution by the Nazi authorities.

The character embarked in <b>a</b> <b>steamy</b> on/off relationship with the hugely popular Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing) in a romance storyline that lasted four years. The character's final storyline saw Craig investigate dodgy pills from a pharmaceutical company, Scott Spear, which resulted in his murder by hired thugs. His relationships often stemmed from his kind but overly protective personality, with a hugely cemented friendship with Chris Warner (Michael Galvin) and a long running relationship with the feisty Alice Piper (Toni Potter).|$|E

Trey Laird was the executive creative director, while Hans Dorsinville was the creative director of the video. Laird stated that the main theme of the commercial was that Beyoncé should appear [...] "sexy {{and a little bit}} dangerous", but in a [...] "sophisticated and elegant way". Released on television channels in December 2009, the commercial is set to Beyoncé's cover version of [...] "Fever" [...] (2010) playing in the background. It features her in the same red satin kimono that she has worn on the print advertisement. The dress has been described as [...] "revealing".

500|$|Cruz's {{next film}} was the kid-friendly G-Force voicing a guinea pig spy named Juarez. G-Force was a {{commercial}} success, making over $290million worldwide. Also in 2009, {{she appeared in}} the film Broken Embraces as Lena. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com noted in her review for the film that Cruz [...] "doesn't coast on her beauty in Broken Embraces, and she {{has the kind of}} role that can be difficult to flesh out". Cruz received nominations from the Satellite Awards and European Film Awards for her performance in Broken Embraces. Cruz's final 2009 film was the film version of the musical Nine, playing the character Carla Albanese, the lead character's mistress. Variety reported that Cruz had originally auditioned for the role of the film within a film's star, Claudia, which eventually went to Nicole Kidman. Cruz said that she trained for three months for the dance routine in the film. Claudia Puig of USA Today commented that while Cruz [...] "does <b>a</b> <b>steamy</b> song and dance", her [...] "acting is strangely caricatured". Cruz's performance as Carla garnered her nominations for Best Supporting Actress from the Academy Awards, Golden Globes and SAG Awards.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{also noted}} that the {{potential}} for interracial conflict remained unexplored; Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "The movie wants to tease us with intimations of <b>a</b> <b>steamy</b> biracial liaison; it just doesn't want to actually go there." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe was disappointed that [...] "Obsessed basically plays it safe. The obvious racial buttons are never pushed". Greg Quill from the Toronto Star agreed, and wrote that Shill and Loughery [...] "stripped the drama of its potentially gripping – and obvious – racial overtones". However, Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer pointed out that having the two female roles of differing races [...] "creates racial tension", and noted similarities to [...] "the racially charged" [...] Lakeview Terrace (2008), which Loughery also wrote. Braun was of the impression that a well-written script was replaced by the film's [...] "racial politics". When Derek confronts Lisa at the business conference, she threatens him with a sexual harassment complaint; Sady Doyle from The Guardian wrote that this alludes to [...] "the history of black men being lynched for their perceived threat to white women". Doyle pointed out that historically white women are more revered for their beauty than black women, which is a side theme of the fight between Sharon and Lisa. Melissa Anderson of LA Weekly suggested that awkwardness of the interracial relationship of Derek and Lisa as a reason why the filmmakers did not have the two characters partake in any sexual activity.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez of Billboard {{magazine}} praised Beyoncé's [...] "sexy" [...] vocals on {{the track}} which they hailed as a [...] "slinky club banger".

Sal Cinquemani, writing for Slant Magazine {{described it as a}} [...] "post-disco slink". The Quietus writer Mof Gimmers wrote, [...] "The cocaine soul bears down again, with the excellent 'Blow' which grooves along like Kelis on a Friday night, before gnashing its teeth into the gonzo pop of Cameo or Parliament." [...] The Guardians Michael Cragg described it as a [...] "delicious throwback funk" [...] song. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times felt that the [...] "sumptuous" [...] song allowed Beyoncé [...] "to flex her impressive stylistic chops". Spins Anupa Mistry praised the collaboration of Timbaland and Pharrell on the [...] "nimble and funky" [...] track [...] "Blow" [...] as [...] "mighty" [...] and [...] "genius". Similarly, Claire Lobenfeld from Complex who felt that Justin Timberlake and Timbaland [...] "lost their ability to make their distinctive, infectious love-pop" [...] on Timberlake's album The 20/20 Experience, noted that [...] "Blow" [...] proved the opposite: [...] "The two have reinvigorated the overused private-parts-as-candy trope by writing one of Bey's friskiest songs ever. Add some Pharrell production... and you have one of the smoothest pieces of filth of the year." [...] Ryan Dennehy from AbsolutePunk found [...] "trademark" [...] Timbaland production in [...] "Blow" [...] and opined, [...] "Bey wisely co-opts Timbaland himself to deliver <b>a</b> <b>steamy</b> hook that interlocks with her own vocals."

2500|$|A {{number of}} critics said the clip {{manifested}} growth in Gomez's artistic imagery. Wendy Geller of Yahoo! wrote, [...] "If ever {{there were any}} doubts that Selena Gomez has moved on from her Disney roots, [...] should quickly dispel them". Similarly, Allison Corneau of Us Weekly said the singer showed [...] "a decidedly more adult side" [...] and proved she was [...] "far from the Disney princess we used to know". Dennis Hinzmann of Out said the visual showcased a continuation of Gomez redefining herself as an artist. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse said the video [...] "shed any Disney princess connection [...] may have had with <b>a</b> <b>steamy</b> shower scene". Other critics said the video silenced then-recent hate speech Gomez had received, noting an underlying message in its premise. Cydney Eckert of Cosmopolitan wrote, [...] "While the video reveals a sexier side of the singer we haven't really seen since Spring Breakers, it also showcases that same confidence that allows Selena to keep standing up to body-shamers and haters". This view was shared by Corneau, who said the clip was [...] "no doubt part of [...] plan to silence the haters and live life on her own terms".|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well received {{at the time}} of its release by the UK music press. Record Mirror enthused, [...] "This picks up where [...] left off, taking its themes and mashing them up, pointing them in new, exciting directions... An album of moods and atmospheres, it must be listened to at maximum volume in a very dark room. Bliss." [...] Sounds declared that [...] "Yello's wry, pulsating melodramas lavish themselves on Stella in a sensuous escapade, leaving no room for faint hearts or lovers. Each haunting episode reeks of a sublime suspense with a liberal coating of electric eccentricity. Mellow moods are savaged by impassioned cries and discordant desires as humour seeps from vital pores." [...] Melody Maker was less impressed, saying, [...] "Their slick marriage... no, make it <b>a</b> <b>steamy</b> affair, between accessible splicing montage methods and sophisticated disco has the necessary balance of artifice and sweet melody, crisp danceateria [...] moves and conceptual laziness (posing as artful dodging) that could conceivably pull the wool over people's eyes... Post-Fairlight, Yello are clever, sometimes too clever-clever, occasionally jarring as the montaging lays code upon codas." ...|$|E
2500|$|After filming {{ended on}} the series Mercy Peak, Bartolomei {{decided he would}} stay in New Zealand rather than {{returning}} to Australia and was offered {{the role of a}} new character – Craig Valentine on Shortland Street, who was set to undergo <b>a</b> <b>steamy</b> romance with the upcoming character Sarah Potts. Bartolomei decided to leave the soap in 2008, saying, [...] "It was a very difficult decision, from an actor's point of view it's not very often that you have the security that a job like Shortland Street provides. But after {{four and a half years}} I longed for a degree of anonymity again. I'm a very private person, and given what I do for a job, the spectre of Shortland Street will invariably take that away from you." [...] The character was killed off in a dramatic gang storyline, something which producers at first thought would be [...] "unforgivable" [...] but which, due to Bartolomei's iinsistence on leaving, they went through with. Bartolomei said of the storyline, [...] "It's all a bit of fun and it's nice to see the characters away from the normal hospital setting and involved in something a little bit different," [...] and of the conclusion to Sarah and Craig's romance, [...] "That does get revisited but not in a stereotypical way. There is a great deal of resolution at the end for everyone concerned." ...|$|E

The patter swelled into a roar, and <b>a</b> heavy, <b>steamy</b> smell like that of a {{hothouse}} rose from the drinking earth.
