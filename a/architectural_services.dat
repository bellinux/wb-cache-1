25|$|Local Comfort {{businessman}} Paul Ingenhuett {{contracted with}} Giles {{to design the}} original Ingenhuett-Faust Hotel at 818 High Street in 1880, and again contracted with Giles to expand the hotel in 1894. Louis and Matilda Faust operated the hotel from 1909 until 1946. The hotel was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1985. Ingenhuett secured the <b>architectural</b> <b>services</b> of Giles for the 1883 Ingenhuett Store. The store was operated until 2006, when it was destroyed by fire. Paul Ingenhuett again hired Giles in 1891 to design the Ingenhuett-Karger Saloon at 727 High Street.. Hubert Ingenhuett operated the store until it {{was taken over by}} Ernst Karger. During the Prohibition years, the building was operated as a grocery store and ice cream parlor. It was designated a Recorded Texas Historical Landmark in 2010. The 1897 Paul Ingenhuett Home at 421 Eighth Street in the Comfort Historic District was also designed by Giles. The home remains in private ownership and was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1979.|$|E
25|$|From {{the very}} start of his {{professional}} practice as an architect Dyson sought to demonstrate architecture as a force for community good, particularly in an unpublicized commitment to bring professional <b>architectural</b> <b>services</b> to {{the causes of the}} culturally disadvantaged. Notable unbuilt projects during this period include the Monterey Institute for the Arts project (1966) in Pacific Grove, California, and the American Indian Center project (1975) in Fresno, California, a museum facility done pro bono to showcase objects relating the history of the Mono and Yokuts people of central California. In 1971, Dyson developed two schemes for a publicly subsidized children’s center constructed in Orange Cove, California that combined both a Head Start and day care operation. By serving at this same time as chairman of the Urban Planning Task Force in Fresno, Dyson commenced a lifelong journey in public service. He also began to lecture at colleges, universities, and museums as outreach for progressive design principles.|$|E

2500|$|While status {{arising from}} {{patronage}} from the Church and State continued {{with the rise}} of Enlightenment and capitalism (e.g.,the position of architect Christopher Wren in the patronage of the British Crown, the City of London, the Church of England and Oxford University during the 17thcentury), there was an expansion in artistic and <b>architectural</b> <b>services</b> available, each competing for commissions with the growth of industry and the middle-classes. Architects nevertheless remained essentially servants to their clients: while Romanticism and Modernism in the other arts encouraged individualism, progress in architecture was geared mostly to improvements in building performance (standards of comfort), engineering and the development of new building typologies (e.g.,factories, railway stations, and later airports) and public benevolence (the problems of urbanization, [...] "public housing", overcrowding, etc.), yet allowing some architects to concern themselves with architecture as an autonomous art (as flourished with Art Nouveau and Art Deco). The heroes of modern architecture, in particular Le Corbusier, were seen as heroic for generating theories about how architecture should be concerned with the development of society.|$|E

40|$|<b>Architectural</b> firms deliver <b>services</b> for various, unique {{projects}} that are all characterized by {{a high level of}} uncertainty. To successfully propose, create and capture value, they need business models that are able to deal with this variety and uncertainty. So far, {{little is known about the}} different business models that are used in <b>architectural</b> <b>service</b> delivery and how they enable or constrain firms to create and capture value in their projects. To continuously compete in a changing and competitive environment, this insight is much needed. In this research, a theoretical framework is developed to study the business of architectural firms. The framework is used to systematically unravel the business models for three types of value proposition that were identified from interview data collected at 22 Dutch architectural firms. The focus is on a supply-driven context. Findings highlight the importance of financial knowledge, capital-intensive partners, support of influential actors and a relationship with the buyer. Resources that are beneficial to the firm’s value creation, can sometimes constrain the firm’s value capture. The contribution of this research is a profound insight into the pitfalls and opportunities of business models for supply-driven <b>architectural</b> <b>service</b> delivery. It helps architectural firms to develop future business model alternatives and to enhance benefits from the offer of unique, creative value propositions.

He extended the limits of <b>architectural</b> <b>services</b> to include interior decoration, dealing in art and antiques, and even planning and designing parties. He collected paintings, pottery, and tapestries, and if White could not procure the right antiques for his interiors, he would sketch neo-Georgian standing electroliers or a Renaissance library table.
