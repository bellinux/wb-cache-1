5|$|<b>An</b> <b>Ideal</b> <b>World,</b> {{authored}} by Weidong Chen {{and illustrated by}} Chao Peng, was originally published in China by the Tian Jin Creator World Comic Company and entitled Seek Self's World.

Contracts were made that allowed for the French, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Mainland Chinese companies to release the five volumes {{at the same time as}} the original company; French, Chinese, and Korean language editions were published through a partnership with Beijing Total Vision Culture Spreads. An Ideal Worlds global release was meant to aid in the development of the Chinese comic industry and create a new business model, and its release marked the first simultaneous global release for a comic. Xiao Pan also made an omnibus of the original Chinese version available for purchase.|$|E
40|$|Economics {{represents}} a social science, directly concerning the factors and determinants of commerce, production, distribution, government, management and naturally consumption {{of goods and}} services, but unlike the natural sciences, it is unique {{in the area of}} hardly finding a broad consensus, whether we talk about rules, methodology, economic processes or basic axioms. Economic cycle would not exist in <b>an</b> economically <b>ideal</b> <b>world</b> where the prices of goods and factors of production are very flexible, people have full information about {{what is happening in the}} economy, government and unions do not regulate prices, and so on. Since the real world differs from <b>an</b> economically <b>ideal</b> <b>world,</b> economic cycle presents inevitable reality in every market economy. The aim of our research paper is to analyse essential monetary determinants and the practical aspects of the theory of the business cycle. Moreover, we focus on the instruments of central banks and their impact on the economic cycle, inextricably affecting the socio-economic development and the state of business environment and commerce...|$|R

5|$|Periyar's {{philosophy}} of self-respect {{was based on}} his image of <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>world</b> and a universally accepted one. His philosophy preaches that human actions {{should be based on}} rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the {{philosophy of}} self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.|$|E

Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, {{the creator of the}} Sensens. Upon finding him, she sees that, fuelled by the car accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>world</b> free from painful memories, all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter the Central Server. Once {{in the presence of the}} Central Server, it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted memories within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the memories of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the memories back into the general population. As the memories are released, Nilin remembers Edge's words about the mind being a fortress, and says that Edge died to remind people that memories should not become open to all, and that painful memories should be lived with rather than forcibly removed. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she has a family again and a damaged world to heal.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{value of}} the Sangam poems has been critically analysed by scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries. Sivaraja Pillay, a 20th-century historian, while constructing the genealogy of ancient Tamil kings from Sangam literature, insists that the Sangam poems show no similarities with ancient Puranic literature and medieval Tamil literature, both of which contain, according to him, fanciful myths and impossible legends. He feels that the Sangam literature is, for the most part, a plain unvarnished tale of the happenings of a by-gone age. Scholars like Dr. Venkata Subramanian, Dr. N. Subrahmanian, Dr. Sundararajan and J.K. Pillay concur with this view. Noted historian K.A.N. Sastri dates the presently available Sangam corpus to the early centuries of the Christian Era. He asserts that the picture drawn by the poets is in obedience to literary tradition and must {{have been based on}} solid foundation in the facts of contemporary life; he proceeds to use the Sangam literature to describe the government, culture and society of the early Pandyan kingdom. Kanakalatha Mukund, while describing the mercantile history of Tamilakam, points out that the heroic poetry in Sangam literature often described <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>world</b> rather than reality, but the basic facts are reliable and an important source of Tamil history. Her reasoning is that they have been supported by archaeological and numismatic evidence and the fact that similar vivid descriptions are found in works by different poets. Dr. Husaini relies on Sangam literature to describe the early Pandyan society and justifies his source by saying that some of the poetical works contain really trustworthy accounts of early Pandyan kings and present facts as they occurred, though they never throw much light about the chronology of their rule.|$|E

500|$|<b>An</b> <b>Ideal</b> <b>World</b> has {{received}} mixed reviews from Western critics, who generally praised the book's artwork and second half {{but did not}} like the beginning. School Library Journal's Lori Henderson reviewed <b>An</b> <b>Ideal</b> <b>World</b> positively; she praised the [...] "Wizard of Oz feel" [...] ending and the message that A You [...] "controls his life, and he has the power to change it". Henderson called the characters [...] "great" [...] and the world [...] "fantastic", also noting that the [...] "cartoonish" [...] and [...] "exaggerated" [...] artwork worked with the story. However, she remarked that the beginning of <b>An</b> <b>Ideal</b> <b>World</b> was [...] "slow and plodding" [...] and could [...] "leave you wondering if it's ever going to go anywhere". Another School Library Journal critic, Joanna Fabicon, felt that the lessons and themes were [...] "unimaginative", which made the artwork [...] "a waste of visual whimsy".|$|E
500|$|Publishers Weekly praised <b>An</b> <b>Ideal</b> <b>World</b> for {{its message}} and art, but criticized how [...] "the book gets {{bogged down in}} talky heavy-handedness, as if someone put nice fantasy {{illustrations}} into a business self-help book". R. Bézard, a French critic for BD Gest, rated {{the first volume of}} the Xiao Pan edition of <b>An</b> <b>Ideal</b> <b>World</b> with two out of five stars. Bézard stated that the volume did not draw in the reader or give any indication of A You's future adventure.

30|$|We {{simulated}} 2, 490 scenarios {{and repeated}} {{each of them}} 10 times to compare ReTaClasses with three scheduling algorithms: WQ, WQR, and MFTF. ReTaClasses was simulated using one, three, and five classes (denoted, respectively, GridTS 1, GridTS 3, and GridTS 5) and WQR using only two replicas (denoted WQR 2 X). MFTF used accurate information about resources, something difficult to be obtained in the real world. All simulations used the same value for the grid speed, i.e., for {{the sum of the}} resources speeds: 1, 000. The resource speed represents how fast it can execute a task. A resource with speed 5 can execute a task with size 100 in 20 time units. We also used a fixed value for the job size: 6, 000, 000 time units. In <b>a</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>world,</b> the makespan of this job would be 6, 000 time units, i.e., 100 hours, if the unit was the minute. Thus, by fixing the grid speed and the job size, the variation of makespan is due only to the differences of the scheduling algorithms.|$|R
500|$|England {{called up}} three {{uncapped}} players, naming bowlers Ajmal Shahzad and James Tredwell in both squads, and opening batsman Michael Carberry in the Test squad.

Kieswetter had only completed his qualification period for England on the day before his first Lions match, and had previously represented South Africa Under-19s. Former England captain Michael Vaughan was unhappy with the inclusion of Kieswetter in the squad, and said that in <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>world</b> {{he would like to see}} [...] "11 complete Englishmen in the team," [...] and complained that he had [...] "a problem, that we have almost got a 'ship-in' system of looking at talent".

500|$|Richard Fogle {{responded to}} the {{critical}} attack on Keats's emphasis on rhyme and language put forth by Garrod, Gerard, and others in 1953. His argument was similar to Brooks: that the poem was thematically coherent {{and that there is}} a poet within the poem that is different from Keats the writer of the poem. As such, Keats consciously chose the shift in the themes of the poem and the contrasts within the poem represent the pain felt when comparing the real world to <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>world</b> found within the imagination. Fogle also responded directly to the claims made by Leavis: [...] "I find Mr. Leavis too austere, but he points out a quality which Keats plainly sought for. His profusion and prodigality is, however, modified by a principle of sobriety." [...] It is possible that Fogle's statements were a defense of Romanticism as a group that was both respectable in terms of thought and poetic ability. Wasserman, following in 1953, claimed that [...] "Of all Keats' poems, it is probably the 'Ode to a Nightingale' that has most tormented the critic [...] in any reading of the 'Ode to a Nightingale' the turmoil will not down. Forces contend wildly within the poem, not only without resolution, but without possibility of resolution; and the reader comes away from his experience with the sense that he has been in 'a wild Abyss'". He then explained, [...] "It is this turbulence, I suspect, that has led Allen Tate to believe the ode 'at least tries to say everything that poetry can say.' But I propose it is the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' that succeeds in saying what poetry can say, and that the other ode attempts to say all that the poet can." ...|$|E

2500|$|Henry A. Clapp (1885) and Horace Howard Furness (1895) {{were both}} more {{concerned}} with the problem of the play's duration, though they held opposing views. In 1887, Denton Jacques Snider argued that the play should be read as a dialectic, either between understanding and imagination or between prose and poetry. He also viewed the play as representing three phases or movements. The first is the Real World of the play, which represents reason. The second is the Fairy World, <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>world</b> which represents imagination and the supernatural. The third is their representation in art, where the action is self-reflective. Snider viewed Titania and her caprice as solely to blame for her marital strife with Oberon. She therefore deserves punishment, and Oberon is a dutiful husband who provides her with one.
