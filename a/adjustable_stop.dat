2500|$|Resonator tuning {{involves}} adjusting [...] "stops" [...] in {{the tubes}} themselves {{to compensate for}} temperature and humidity conditions {{in the room where}} the instrument is stored. Some companies offer adjustment in the upper octaves only.

50|$|Therefore, {{even the}} Meniscus had a {{permanent}} stop. Nevertheless, the earliest lenses {{did not have}} adjustable stops: their small working apertures {{and the lack of}} sensitivity of the daguerreotype process meant that exposure times were measured in many minutes. Photographers did not want to limit the light passing through the lens and lengthen the exposure time. When the increased sensitivity wet collodion process was perfected in 1851, exposure times were shortened dramatically and <b>adjustable</b> <b>stops</b> became practical.|$|R
5000|$|The Remington Model 513 Matchmaster is a bolt-action rifle, {{manufactured}} from 1940 to 1968. Since {{the rifle}} {{was designed for}} target shooting, it came equipped with a sturdy half stock with sling swivels, a beavertail fore end, and a straight comb which rose at the heel. Matchmaster barrels were a 27" [...] heavy target semi-floating type. The patented Matchmaster trigger mechanism had an <b>adjustable</b> <b>stop.</b> The Matchmaster was made to fire only the [...]22-caliber Long Rifle cartridge from a detachable magazine. Civilian versions of the Matchmaster have a blued finish, while those made for U.S. Army and ROTC service can have either a blued or a parkerized finish.|$|E
50|$|Around 1880, photographers {{realized}} that aperture size affected depth of field. Aperture control gained more significance, and adjustable stops became a standard lens feature. The iris diaphragm made its appearance as an adjustable lens {{stop in the}} 1880s, andi t became the standard <b>adjustable</b> <b>stop</b> about 1900. The iris diaphragm had been common in early nineteenth century cameras obscura, and Niépce used one {{in at least one}} of his experimental cameras. However, the specific type of iris used in modern lenses was invented in 1858 by Charles Harrison and Joseph Schnitzer. Harrison and Schnitzer's iris diaphragm was capable of rapid open and close cycles, an absolute necessity for lenses with camera auto-aperture control.|$|E

50|$|A {{miter gauge}} is a device used for holding {{workpieces}} at a set angle while being cut on table saws, band saws or sanded on stationary disk sanders. The miter gauge slides in a slot on the worktable (known as a miter slot) {{on the machine}} being used. Typically, the Miter Gauge and the workpiece are held together by hand and moved across the worktable making the cut (or sanded edge). Although, there are more sophisticated miter gauges that {{have the ability to}} clamp the workpiece or have <b>adjustable</b> <b>stops</b> for repetitive machining of workpieces.|$|R
5000|$|Sliding {{compound}} miter saws {{are relatively}} portable, easy to set up, and robust enough to maintain accuracy even when moved around. Because they cut from above {{it is not}} necessary to adjust blade depth for different thicknesses of work piece and, like any bench machine, repeat cuts are very easy. Most saws have an adjustable scale plate for table swiveling with positive stops at commonly used angles. Also, there are usually <b>adjustable</b> <b>stops</b> at 90 and 45 degrees for head tilting allowing easy and very accurate adjustment of the saw.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{version of}} the pistol is the SP22 M1. The M1 is {{equipped}} with a 4 in standard barrel, adjustable steel sights, and a two-stage trigger complete with <b>adjustable</b> trigger <b>stop.</b>|$|R
30|$|Solution 3 Repetitive melting {{involves}} {{changing the}} procedure from standard PCR, with an <b>adjustable</b> cycling <b>stop</b> {{and a single}} melting, to repeated sequences of amplification cycles and melting.

5000|$|The USP Tactical (9mm Parabellum, [...]40 S&W, [...]45 ACP) {{incorporates}} a fully adjustable rear sight, a higher-profile front sight (as {{to be visible}} above the suppressor), an extended threaded barrel and O-ring, a match grade trigger, and an <b>adjustable</b> trigger <b>stop</b> (the 9mm model, referred to by HK as the [...] "USP9SD (tactical)" [...] {{does not have the}} match trigger with <b>adjustable</b> trigger <b>stop,</b> O-ring, and does not carry the [...] "Tactical" [...] marking on the slide that the USP40 and USP45 Tactical models do, making it essentially a full size USP9 with threaded barrel and raised & adjustable target sights, but those features were added to it in 2015). Sound suppressors designed for the USP Tactical are available from Brügger & Thomet and Knight's Armament. A unique feature of the USP Tactical is that the barrel is left-hand threaded (counter-clockwise to tighten), which makes the pistol incompatible with suppressors designed for the MK23 Mod 0.|$|R
40|$|A {{neck brace}} was {{developed}} aimed {{to improve the}} peripherals of patients with neck paralysis and to supply safe support during the rehabilitation process of patients suffering from surgeries or accidents. The brace allows the patient to manipulate their head in a vertical fashion via pressure switches or a toggle controllable by hand. The increased motion allows patients with neck paralysis to better view obstacles and reduces daily fatigue on their eyes in many cases due to being wheel chair bound. Whereas the implementation for patients {{that have come out}} of stationary braces from surgeries or accidents allows them to reduce the reoccurrence of damage from accidental movements that strain the repairing tissue and or the skeletal structure. The brace has <b>adjustable</b> <b>stops</b> allowing the doctor to ensure the travel length does not exceed the desired travel thus harming the condition of the patient. Furthermore built in fail safes prevent endangerment issues such as back driving, energy loss, and over traveling. The basis of the design was on a human head weighing approximately ten pounds. The driving arm was coupled to the chin support of the neck brace allowing natural rotating motion of the head to occur. A breast plate coupled to a back plate would distribute the load of the head as well as mounting for the mechanical components...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the standard P9S, a P9S Target model was also offered. This model included a taller front sight, a windage and elevation adjustable rear sight, an <b>adjustable</b> trigger over-travel <b>stop,</b> and an <b>adjustable</b> trigger that could be adjusted down to as low as approximately a 2.5# pull. The P9S Target model was offered in both 9mm as well as [...]45 ACP.|$|R
50|$|The Model 7, first {{introduced}} in 1897, became the deluxe {{version of the}} basic No. 5 and was designed to please a greater {{cross section of the}} market. The biggest and most obvious difference was the wraparound space bar, which gave the machine a more solid and distinctive look. Blickensderfer also improved the paper scale, added black composite carriage knobs {{at both ends of the}} palten, added <b>adjustable</b> margin <b>stops</b> and a bell mechanism designed to be struck by a clapper attached to the inker arm indicating when the carriage was approaching the end of the typed line. The Blick 7 was also mounted on an oak base fitted with an attractive bentwood laminated oak case. About 63,000 Blick No. 7's were produced from 1897 until 1916.|$|R
5000|$|The GSP was {{introduced}} {{on the world}} market in 1968 and was chambered for [...]22 Long Rifle. At the end of 1971, Walther began offering the pistol in [...]32 S&W Long Wadcutter as well. Regardless of its original caliber, conversion units for the other caliber are available and easily interchangeable. The anatomical, adjustable walnut grips were also available, on order from Walther, for left-handed shooters. In 1988, Walther introduced a fully <b>adjustable</b> (for pull, <b>stop,</b> and angle) two-stage trigger that athletes could retrofit their pistols with.|$|R
50|$|Through the years, {{there have}} been several {{variations}} on the Model 686. The Model 686 Classic Hunter was introduced in 1988 and has a 6-inch barrel and an unfluted cylinder; the Model 686 Black Stainless was introduced in 1989 and has either a 4- or 6-inch barrel with a black finish, with production limited to 5000; the Model 686 National Security Special was introduced in 1992 and has a 3- or 4-inch barrel; the Model 686 Target Champion was introduced in 1992 and has a 6-inch match barrel, <b>adjustable</b> trigger <b>stop,</b> and walnut grips; the Model 686 Power Port was introduced in 1994 and has a ported 6-inch barrel; the Model 686 Plus was introduced in 1996 and has a 2.5-inch, 3-inch, 4-inch, or 6-inch barrel, adjustable sights, 7-shot cylinder, and Hogue rubber grips. As with all current Smith & Wesson revolvers, the 686 Plus now has a key lock integral to the frame of the gun.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1942 Daimler {{had also been}} working on an {{upgraded}} D-series engine that could run on either C2 or C3 fuel. The first of these, which appeared in late 1944, were a small series of DB 605DM, followed by the main production series, the DB 605DB/DC. These engines were fitted with an <b>adjustable</b> screw <b>stop</b> which allowed the use of either B4 fuel with MW-50, or C-3 fuel without MW-50, {{in which case the}} engine was designated DB 605DB, or the use of C-3 fuel with MW-50, in which case the engine was given the -DC suffix instead. In its DB-suffix form the engine generated 1,800 PS (1,775 hp) for take-off at 1.8 ata, while the DC was capable of 2,000 PS (1,973 hp) at 1.98 ata. If MW-50 was not available for use with the B4 fuel the throttle was limited to 1.45 ata for the entire flight. Thus, this series was ideally suited to catering for the chaotic fuel supply situation prevalent during the last months of the Third Reich. These engines were mainly used in the Bf 109G-10 and K-4 series.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a newly developed safety concept for application of robotic walking simulators {{based on the}} principle of programmable footplates in gait rehabilitation. Unlike robotic hand devices or exoskeleton robots for gait training on treadmills, which can be built relatively lightweight and require only small drives which can hardly do harm to the patient, a programmable footplate walking simulator with permanent foot fixture essentially needs to have powerful drives in order to carry and move the full body weight of the patient. The developed safety concept comprises several redundant algorithms and devices in the real-time robot control software, electrical emergency stop circuitry and machine mechanics. The mechanical core is a machine design offering maximum passive security by covering all moving parts (i. e. robot drives and linkages) and a newly developed foot safety release binding, which is mounted on each footplate. The release binding allows a safe re lease from the footplate in all directions in any degree of freedom in the sagittal plane. It is combined with an ankle goniometer which is equipped with <b>adjustable</b> emergency <b>stop</b> limit switches, thus ensuring that the allowed ankle range-of-motion is not exceeded...|$|R
40|$|A single {{degree of}} freedom {{mechanical}} spring-mass system was considered where {{the motion of the}} mass is constrained by an <b>adjustable</b> rigid impact <b>stop.</b> A model reference adaptive control algorithm combined with interspike interval techniques was used to consider the viability of identifying system parameters when impacts are present. The unmodified adaptive control algorithm destabilizes during vibro-impact motion, so three modified control algorithms were tested experimentally. The first, the gain reset, was found to be of limited use and system identification could not be successfully carried out. The second and third used a gain pause strategy. The second algorithm used acceleration triggering and represented an improvement on the gain reset method. The third approach used displacement triggering and was found to be partially successful in identifying system parameters in the presence of vibro-impact motion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSignificant {{changes have}} {{occurred}} recently in fixation methods following fracture or osteotomy {{in children and}} teenagers. Children have benefited the most from these advances. A child's growth is anatomically and physiologically ensured by the growth plate and periosteum. The {{need to keep the}} periosteum intact during trauma cases has led to the introduction of flexible intramedullary nailing. We will review the basic principles of this safe, universally adopted technique, and also describe available material, length and diameter options. The problems and the limitations of this method will be discussed extensively. In orthopedics, the desire to preserve the periosteum has led to the use of locking compression plates. Because of their low profile and high stability, they allow the micromovements essential for bone union. These new methods reduce the immobilization period and allow autonomy to be regained more quickly, which is especially important in children with neurological impairment. The need to preserve the growth plate, which is well known in pediatric surgery, is reviewed with the goal of summarizing current experimental data on standard fracture and osteotomy fixation methods. <b>Adjustable</b> block <b>stop</b> wires provide better control over compression. These provide an alternate means of fixation between K-wires and screws (now cannulated) and have contributed to the development of minimally invasive surgical techniques. The aim of this lecture is to provide a rationale for the distinct technical features of pediatric surgery, while emphasizing the close relationship between the physiology of growth, bone healing and technical advances...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA stopped-flow field-jump {{instrument}} {{and its use}} {{for the analysis of}} macromolecular structure changes during reactions is described. The operation of the new instrument is simple and reliable, owing to a new type of cell construction with electrodes directly integrated in a quartz cuvette: major advantages are the relatively low demand on sample quantities and a high time resolution. The stopped flow is characterized by a dead time of ∼ 0. 5 ms. Electric field pulses with field strengths up to 20 kV/cm and rise times in the nanosecond range are applied at <b>adjustable</b> times after <b>stop</b> of the flow. The time resolution of the optical detection is up to the nanosecond time range. The instrument may be used for the combination of stopped flow with temperature-jump and field-jump experiments. A particularly useful new application is the analysis of macromolecular reactions by electrooptical measurements, because electrooptical data provide information about structures. This is demonstrated for the intercalation of ethidium into double-helical DNA. The transients, measured at 313 nm, where the signal is exclusively due to ethidium bound to the DNA, demonstrate a relatively high negative dichroism at 0. 5 ms after mixing. The absolute value of this negative dichroism increases in the millisecond time range and approaches the equilibrium value within about a second. The dichroism decay time constants demonstrate a clear increase of the effective DNA length due to ethidium binding, already 0. 5 ms after mixing; a further increase to the equilibrium value is found in the millisecond time range. The analysis of these data demonstrate the existence of up to three relaxation processes, depending on the conditions of the experiments. The dichroism amplitudes, together with the decay time constants, indicate that all the reaction states found in the present investigation are complexes with insertion of ethidium residues between basepairs. Moreover, the data clearly show the degree of intercalation in the intermediate states, which is very useful information for the quantitative assignment of the mechanism...|$|R
