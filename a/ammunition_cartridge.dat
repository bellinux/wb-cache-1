Often the majority of these cartridges are given to the retiring individual, leaving him or her to decide to whom they are traded or distributed. This increases their perceived value as collectibles.|$|E
5000|$|A bullet button is {{a device}} used {{to remove a}} {{magazine}} in a semiautomatic rifle, replacing the magazine release with a block which forces the user to remove the magazine by using a tool as opposed {{to his or her}} finger.

The name came about due to a 1999 California State law which said that a [...] "bullet or <b>ammunition</b> <b>cartridge</b> is considered a tool." [...] In 2016, a bill to prohibit the sales of firearms with bullet buttons was approved by California state lawmakers in April 20 and later signed by governor Jerry Brown in July.|$|E

50|$|From May 1787, a {{detachment}} of four companies of marines, under Major Robert Ross, accompanied the First Fleet {{to protect a}} new colony at Botany Bay (New South Wales).

Ten thousand rounds of ammunition were also obtained when the Fleet called into Rio de Janeiro en route to Botany Bay. However, despite the Home Office receiving the request, the full resupply was never sent and consequently, after 12 months, the marines ended up in difficult circumstances.|$|E

5000|$|At first, {{the station}} also had freight loading and {{unloading}} facilities. One unique feature was the [...] "vínovod" [...] ("wine transport system"), which consisted of tubing from the station to the Palugyay family's wine cellars. Gravity flow drew wine from trains into barrels in the cellars. The station also had a ropeway conveyor to the Patrónka (cartridge factory) which produced <b>ammunition</b> <b>cartridges,</b> colloquially known as [...] "patróny". As passenger traffic increased, freight operations were progressively relocated to other stations in the city.|$|R

Barnaul began a process of retooling in 2009 to produce {{a new line of}} higher-grade ammunition to compete in the American and European markets. This was either due to their previous products being compared unfavorably or because Russian ammunition has a stigma of being poorly made and unreliable. The first CENTAUR brand ammunition was produced in 2013.|$|R
