40|$|A {{significant}} {{topic in}} American political discourse {{is that of}} law <b>and</b> <b>order.</b> Politicians, civic leaders, and policy makers often propose a hard-line towards crime so that “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” is maintained. In this essay, I contend that the discourse of “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” has taken on mythic properties in American political discourse, and that the media, in large part, {{has contributed to the}} creation of a “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” myth. The “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” rhetoric of J. Edgar Hoover, Estes Kaufaver, George C. Wallace, and Richard Nixon all have been greatly aided by a media presence that extends the topic of “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” beyond the realm of political discourse and into the realm of political myth. This essay discusses the influence of Hoover, Kefauver’s, Wallace’s, and Nixon’s “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” rhetoric, <b>and</b> points out the media coverage, in each of these cases, aided in creating a powerful cultural and political “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” myth...|$|R
