5|$|In November 2011, {{a lock of}} John Paul II's {{hair was}} brought to the cathedral after the Holy See granted the Diocese of Hong Kong <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> from the late pontiff. The diocese had earlier {{requested}} this, since they felt this would symbolically accomplish the Pope's longtime dream of visiting China. He had constantly stated his intent of visiting the country, but never did so due to the longstanding tensions and strained relations between China and the Holy See. Bishop John Tong Hon expressed his hope that the relic would be able to venerated by the Mainland Chinese faithful who visited Hong Kong, the only city on Chinese soil and the first city in Asia to house <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> of John Paul II. It is currently displayed in the same chapel as the bishops' crypt.|$|E

The date's accuracy was confirmed by Liang's study of the building which matched with known information about Tang buildings.|$|E

5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} {{the free exercise of}} those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes.

5|$|The Last Judgement was an {{especially}} appropriate subject for setting <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> from the Crown of Thorns.

5|$|The {{death of}} the Bulgarian tsar Simeon I in 927 {{severely}} weakened the Bulgarians, allowing the Byzantines {{to concentrate on the}} eastern front.

Kourkouas was especially celebrated for returning to Constantinople the venerated Mandylion, <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> purportedly imprinted with a portrait of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Aldwych is {{a closed}} {{station on the}} London Underground, located in the City of Westminster in Central London.

5|$|Geoffrey was {{a patron}} of scholarship, and {{employed}} scholars throughout his life, one of whom, Honorius of Kent, Geoffrey appointed Archdeacon of Richmond. Honorius was subsequently employed by Hubert Walter {{and wrote a}} legal work on canon law. The Leiden St Louis Psalter is a lavishly illuminated psalter made for the archbishop, probably in northern England in the 1190s, which passed {{into the hands of}} Blanche of Castile after Geoffrey's death, and, as religious manuscripts often were, was used to teach the future saint King Louis IX of France how to read, as recorded by a 14th-century inscription. After the king's death it passed through several royal owners, regarded as <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> of the saint, before reaching the University Library at Leiden in 1741.|$|E

He went to Rome in 1007 to receive his pallium—symbol of his status as an archbishop—from Pope John XVIII, but was robbed during his journey. While at Canterbury he {{promoted}} the cult of Dunstan, ordering {{the writing of the}} second Life of Dunstan, which Adelard of Ghent composed between 1006 and 1011.

In fact, each iteration of M-10 has existed in whole or part along a former or future alignment of US10.|$|E

5|$|The {{expressway}} {{portion of}} M-63 is <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> of a now revised plan of a freeway corridor through the St. Joseph–Benton Harbor area. The highway was significantly reconfigured in 2000–2002, with the overpass over the industrial access road to Whirlpool's warehouse in Benton Harbor and a rail line removed and rebuilt in late 2000 through early 2001, {{and one of}} the two grade-separated interchanges, at Klock Road, demolished and downgraded to an at-grade intersection in 2002. Today, there are only two overpasses over smaller roads existing on this stretch of expressway.|$|E
5|$|The {{liberty of}} being {{employed}} in silk factories starting in 1865 allowed some women to style themselves tzu-shu nii (never to marry) {{and live in}} communes with other women. Other Chinese called them sou-hei (self-combers) for adopting hairstyles of married women. These communes passed because of the Great Depression and were subsequently discouraged by the communist government for being <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> of feudal China. In contemporary Chinese society, tongzhi (same goal or spirit) is the term {{used to refer to}} homosexuals; most Chinese are reluctant to divide this classification further to identify lesbians.|$|E
5|$|Each Civilization in The Age of Kings has {{one or two}} special {{units that}} are {{exclusive}} to that Civilization. For instance, the Britons have access to longbowmen, an archery unit with increased range. These Civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but still follow the basic rock-paper-scissors model. The monk is {{a special kind of}} military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units. Monks are also used to collect relics; relics accumulate gold once held in the player's monastery—the more relics are captured, the faster the gold is accumulated. Collecting all relics on the map is one method by which a player can win a random map game, depending on the victory setting. Once a player has all in their monasteries, a timer is shown to all players. If an opposing player does not destroy a monastery holding <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> after the set time, then that player wins.|$|E
