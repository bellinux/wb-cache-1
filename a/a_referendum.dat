Brown said the Treaty differed on significant points from the Constitution and was no longer a constitution but an ordinary treaty, and as such did not require <b>a</b> <b>referendum.</b> He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E
