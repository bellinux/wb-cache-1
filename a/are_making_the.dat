25|$|The {{division}} of coagulation in two pathways is mainly artificial, it originates from laboratory tests in which clotting times were measured after the clotting was initiated by glass (intrinsic pathway) or by thromboplastin (a mix of tissue factor and phospholipids). In fact thrombin is present {{from the very}} beginning, already when platelets <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> plug. Thrombin has a large array of functions, not only the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the building block of a hemostatic plug. In addition, {{it is the most}} important platelet activator {{and on top of that}} it activates Factors VIII and V and their inhibitor protein C (in the presence of thrombomodulin), and it activates Factor XIII, which forms covalent bonds that crosslink the fibrin polymers that form from activated monomers.|$|E
25|$|Tectonic {{activity}} {{along the}} North Coast of British Columbia and Southeast Alaska {{is characterized by}} transform movements of the Queen Charlotte Fault, a plate boundary where the Pacific Plate skids by the North American Plate. As the Pacific Plate moves northward to the Aleutian subduction zone, it generates rifting in the North American continent. Magma rises along cracks created by the rifting, and eventually erupts on the surface to form a volcano. This geological process has, over time, created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, {{which is the most}} volcanically active area in Canada. However, most of the volcanoes have not been directly dated or have not been dated in sufficient detail to recognize how active they <b>are,</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> prediction of volcanic events difficult and volcanic hazards uncertain.|$|E
