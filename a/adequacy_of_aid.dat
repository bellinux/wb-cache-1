40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{historical}} origins of the international goal for rich countries to devote 0. 7 per cent of gross national income (GNI) to aid, in order to assess its present relevance. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews all the original documents, interviews decision makers of that era, and uses their same essential method to estimate a new goal with today's data. Findings – First, the target was calculated using a model which, applied to today's data, yields ludicrous results. Second, no government ever agreed in a UN forum to actually reach 0. 7 per cent – though many pledged to move toward it. Third, ODA/GNI per se does not constitute a meaningful metric for the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> flows. Research limitations/implications – Any further work on aid targets must be based on a country-by-country assessment of realistic funding opportunities. Practical implications – The 0. 7 per cent goal has no modern academic basis, has failed as a lobbying tool, and should be abandoned. Originality/value – Anyone who studies or works on the ways that rich countries can assist the development process must confront the 0. 7 per cent goal sooner or later. The paper shows for the first time that it arose from an economic model with no modern credibility, and that – contrary to conventional wisdom – none of the UN documents contains a promise to meet the goal.

40|$|The {{international}} {{goal for}} rich countries to devote 0. 7 % {{of their national}} income to development assistance has become a cause célèbre for aid activists and has been accepted in many official quarters as the legitimate target for aid budgets. The origins of the target, however, raise serious questions about its relevance. First, the 0. 7 % target was calculated using a series of assumptions that are no longer true, and justified by a model {{that is no longer}} considered credible. When we use essentially the same method used to arrive at 0. 7 % in the early 1960 s and apply today’s conditions, it yields an aid goal of just 0. 01 % of rich-country GDP for the poorest countries and negative aid flows to the developing world as a whole. We do not claim in any way that this is the ‘right’ amount of aid, but only that this exercise lays bare the folly of the initial method and the subsequent unreflective commitment to the 0. 7 % aid goal. Second, we document the fact that, despite frequent misinterpretation of UN documents, no government ever agreed in a UN forum to actually reach 0. 7 %—though many pledged to move toward it. Third, we argue that aid as a fraction of rich country income does not constitute a meaningful metric for the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> flows. It would be far better to estimate aid needs by starting on the recipient side with a meaningful model of how aid affects development. Although aid certainly has positive impacts in many circumstances, our quantitative understanding of this relationship is too poor to accurately conduct such a tally. The 0. 7 % target began life as a lobbying tool, and stretching it to become a functional target for real aid budgets across all donors is to exalt it beyond reason. That no longer makes any sense, if it ever did. International aid, development assistance, aid target...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to a legislative resolution, the State Council established a Student Financial Aid Study Advisory Committee composed {{of public and private}} college representatives and outside consultants to develop a comprehensive study <b>of</b> student financial <b>aid</b> programs in higher education in Virginia. This study makes available for the first time an inventory <b>of</b> financial <b>aid</b> currently available to students in Virginia colleges and universities. Divided into 4 parts, the study provides: 1) an evaluation of present student financial aid policies and practices; 2) a discussion <b>of</b> financial <b>aid</b> philosophy; 3) an evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>aid</b> programs; and 4) a proposal for broadening financial support to meet present and projected student financial aid needs. The conclusion is that Virginia faces a major challenge if it is to keep pace with other states in providing opportunities to attend college and if it is to meet the future need for a well-trained labor force. Tables and a bibliography are included. (DS...|$|R

Relevant tracers {{continue to be}} excellent, {{and there has been}} increasing number of antenatal visits. Recent progress in pregnancy outcomes however does not improve with equal pace: maternal mortality has been stagnant since over a decade, birth weight < 2, 500 g was higher than neighbouring countries, and stillbirth doubling that of developed nations. These pose the questions related to limitation of coverage indicators and need for assessing <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> antenatal care.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the conceptual model and to study the relationships between customer perceptions of the benefits of sales promotion, quality, <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> premium, and <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> information about the coverage of insurance services. The research model was tested with structural equation modeling (SEM) with a sample of 200 Slovenian users of insurance services. The results indicated that higher perceived benefits of sales promotion were associated with higher perceived quality of insurance services. In addition, higher perceived quality was associated with higher perceived <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> information about the coverage and the premium for insurance services. The study also found that higher perceived <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> premium was associated with higher perceived <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> information about the coverage of insurance services...|$|R

Historical variation in equity values and ownership correlates poorly with historical variation in the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> saving.
