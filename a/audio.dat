During the four-minute <b>audio</b> recording, Bale can be heard shouting and swearing at Hurlbut and threatening to quit the film if Hurlbut did it again and was not fired. Prior to releasing the <b>audio</b> on the internet, TMZ had reported on the incident on their website in July 2008.

5|$|DAB {{has also}} been marketed as having two major {{advantages}} over analogue radio broadcasting in that using MPEG-1 <b>Audio</b> Layer II lossy <b>audio</b> compression technology and more recently DAB+ using High-Efficiency Advanced <b>Audio</b> Coding, parts of the <b>audio</b> spectrum that cannot be heard by humans are discarded, meaning less data needs to be sent over the air. This, as well as multiplexing technology, allows a number of channels to be broadcast together on one frequency as opposed to one channel for analogue radio broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 2.0 {{increases}} the maximum TMDS clock to 600MHz (18.0Gbit/s).

This enables HDMI 2.0 to carry 4K video at 60Hz with 24bit/px color depth. Other features of HDMI 2.0 include support for the Rec. 2020 color space, up to 32 <b>audio</b> channels, up to 1536kHz <b>audio</b> sample frequency, dual video streams to multiple users on the same screen, up to four <b>audio</b> streams, 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, 25 fps 3D formats, support for the 21:9 aspect ratio, dynamic synchronization of video and <b>audio</b> streams, the HE-AAC and DRA <b>audio</b> standards, improved 3D capability, and additional CEC functions.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, {{analysis}} of an <b>audio</b> tape {{recording of the}} shooting made by freelance reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski appeared to indicate, according to forensic expert Philip Van Praag, that thirteen shots were fired, even though Sirhan's gun held only eight rounds. Van Praag states that the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible. The presence of more than eight shots on the tape was corroborated by forensic <b>audio</b> specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of <b>Audio</b> Engineering Associates in Pasadena, California, forensic <b>audio</b> and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen in Copenhagen, Denmark, and <b>audio</b> specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. Some other acoustic experts, however, have stated that no more than eight shots were recorded on the <b>audio</b> tape.|$|E

5|$|ARC is an <b>audio</b> link {{meant to}} replace other cables between the TV and the A/V {{receiver}} or speaker system.

A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of <b>audio</b> is handled by the other equipment. Without ARC, the <b>audio</b> output from the TV needs to be routed by another cable, typically TOS-Link or coax, into the speaker system.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound <b>audio.</b> In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of <b>audio,</b> with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This {{is far more than}} in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves <b>Audio</b> plugins to modify dialog and other <b>audio</b> in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E
