25|$|Community college {{students}} are more likely to be food insecure than those students at four-year colleges. African American and Latino {{college students}} are food insecure to greater extent than Asian and White college students. Three-fourths of college students who are food insecure receive some form of financial aid and the majority of these students are employed. It has been found that food insecurity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> level is far higher for students concentrated in mathematics, developmental writing, and reading. Food insecure {{students are more likely}} to consider dropping out of college and are less likely to stay on track toward obtaining their academic goals than those who are food secure.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Kamber {{was convicted}} of forgery while {{teaching}} at Prince George's Community College (PGCC). At the time, Kamber {{was president of the}} national Young Republicans' leadership training school in Chicago. Federal officials accused him of submitting a forged letter to his draft board in 1968. The letter had ostensibly been signed by the president of PGCC and attested that Kamber was a faculty member there. But PGCC president John Handley testified he had not seen the letter, had not authorized it and had not signed it. Kamber was acquitted of charges that he did not teach <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>college,</b> but convicted of forgery and sentenced to two years in prison.|$|E

25|$|While the {{evolution}} of paramedicine described above is focused largely on the US, many other countries followed a similar pattern, although often with significant variations. Canada, for example, attempted a pilot paramedic training program at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, in 1972. The program, which intended to upgrade the then mandatory 160 hours of training for ambulance attendants, {{was found to be}} too costly and premature. The program was abandoned after two years, and {{it was more than a}} decade before the legislative authority for its graduates to practice was put into place. An alternative program which provided 1,400 hours of training <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> level prior to commencing employment was then tried, and made mandatory in 1977, with formal certification examinations being introduced in 1978. Similar programs occurred at roughly the same time in Alberta and British Columbia, with other Canadian provinces gradually following, but with their own education and certification requirements. Advanced Care Paramedics were not introduced until 1984, when Toronto trained its first group internally, before the process spread across the country. By 2010 the Ontario system involved a two-year community college based program, including both hospital and field clinical components, prior to designation as a Primary Care Paramedic, although it is starting to head towards a university degree-based program (for example, the joint degree in paramedicine offered by Centennial College and the University of Toronto). Some services, such as Toronto Paramedic Services, continue to train advanced care paramedics internally.|$|E

2500|$|... "Witness" [...] is not {{the only}} episode to be altered from its {{original}} concept. [...] "Dichotic" [...] began, in its early stages, as a story about a news reporter who had the ability—thanks to kryptonite—to split himself in half. The reporter would create the news {{at the same time that}} he was filming it. Ken Biller and Mark Verheiden discussed a teaser that involved the reporter pushing someone out of a window and as the body plummeted to the ground the audience saw the same person reporting the news as it happened. The main story would focus on the reporter attempting to assassinate Lex Luthor, but it eventually evolved into what Biller refers to as [...] "a metaphor on trying to super-achieve at high school". In the revamped version, a high school student uses his ability to duplicate himself so that he can take classes in high school and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> at the same time, in an effort to win a LuthorCorp scholarship and go to the university of his dreams. With Jonathan Taylor Thomas playing the over-achieving student, the character of Ian Randall was also used to stir up the Lana-Clark-Chloe triangle. Beeman explains that a problem exists in developing new storylines involving the characters: [...] "We want the characters we're familiar with, and on the other , you have to search for ways to change them up." [...] Even the ending was altered during filming, as both copies of Ian were to fall over the edge of a bridge; then, as the two Ians fall they touch each other's fingers slowly fusing together before hitting the ground. The team was so impressed with Thomas's performance they opted to keep the character alive.|$|E

2500|$|The Association {{was founded}} in 1971 as the Association of Women Mathematicians, but the name was changed almost immediately. As {{reported}} in [...] "A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics: The Presidents' Perspectives", by Lenore Blum, [...] "As Judy Green remembers (and Chandler Davis, early AWM friend, concurs): 'The formal idea of women getting together and forming a caucus was first made publicly at a MAG [...] meeting in 1971 ... in Atlantic City. Joanne Darken, then an instructor at Temple University and now <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> of Philadelphia, stood up at the meeting and suggested that the women present remain and form a caucus. I {{have been able to}} document six women who remained: me (I was a graduate student at Maryland at the time), Joanne Darken, Mary [...] Gray (she was already at American University), Diane Laison (then an instructor at Temple), Gloria Olive (a Senior Lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand who was visiting the U.S. at the time) and Annie Selden...It's not absolutely clear what happened next, except that I've personally always thought that Mary was responsible for getting the whole thing organized ....'" [...] Mary W. Gray was the early organizer, placing an advertisement in the February 1971 Notices of the AMS, and writing the first issue of the AWM Newsletter that May. Early goals of the Association focused on equal pay for equal work, as well as equal consideration for admission to graduate school and support while there; for faculty appointments at all levels; for promotion and for tenure; for administrative appointments; and for government grants, positions on review and advisory panels and positions in professional organizations. The AWM holds an annual meeting at the Joint Mathematics Meetings. In 2011 the Association initiated a biennial Research Symposium during its 40th anniversary celebration 40 Years and Counting.|$|E

The data included enrollment data, responses from a survey instrument that i created, and data from the national survey of student engagement 2 ̆ 7 s (nsse) data warehouse. The enrollment data included the upper division enrollment in education programs at public institutions in florida. The survey instrument used open-ended questions and likert-scale items from the nsse. The survey 2 ̆ 7 s respondents were juniors and seniors (n= 140) from baccalaureate education programs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> three <b>community</b> <b>colleges.</b> Most students chose <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> for their upper division education because of location and cost. Almost three-fourths of the students who participated in this study reported that they would have attended another institution for their baccalaureate studies if <b>the</b> upper divisions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> did not exist.
