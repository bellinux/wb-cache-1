5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E

Warm regards from my entire family and our Bernhard.|$|E

Yeats appeared to have persuaded himself that Olivia and her cousin shared a flaw, writing, [...] "here is the same weakness I thought... Her beauty... dark and still, had the nobility of defeated things, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> it help but wring my heart. I took a fortnight to decide what I should do". He constructed a plan to reconcile his desire with what he believed to be her wickedness: he would ask that she leave her husband to live with him. Until then their friendship would remain platonic.|$|E

500|$|Houllier was {{disappointed}} with Liverpool's start and noticed his players {{struggled with the}} humidity. He nevertheless saw set-pieces {{as an opportunity to}} score goals from and felt the equaliser turned the final in his team's favour: [...] "Suddenly the confidence switches to the other camp. They're affected, they become a bit unsettled, and you keep going." [...] Houllier revealed he gave a frank assessment of the task facing his players before the match; although in his words Arsenal were [...] "...probably a bit better than us, probably more mature, more experienced, more ability in some areas," [...] dealing with setbacks would make the difference on the day. He dismissed accusations that Liverpool were boring, rather describing his team as difficult to beat. Owen, the match winner, felt he answered his critics by scoring left-footed: [...] "It's nice to prove people wrong when they say you haven't got a left foot. I {{was supposed to be the}} worst header and the worst player with my left foot in the league, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> an England player play when they haven't got a left foot.... It does go to show that I have improved and I am improving." ...|$|E
