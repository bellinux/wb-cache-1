5|$|George Hunt leased {{the castle}} in 1841 {{and it was}} turned into a private house under the {{supervision}} of the architect George Guillame. Hunt remained at Netley until 1857, by when the castle had an oriel window overlooking the sea, and the battlements had been blocked in to allow the construction of a second storey to the building. George Sherriff leased the castle between 1868 and 1873, building a stone wall <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of property.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} does demonstrate {{elements of}} Classical Revival architecture {{but they are}} minimal and concentrated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> entrance. Below the front entrance hood there are two stone pilasters and a stone lintel, as well as relief work adorning the pediment; leading to the front entrance are seven concrete stairs. The entire entry facade is a gable-front, temple style design and on the library's east wing there are stone-capped modified buttresses. Each of these elements demonstrates the Classical Revival style.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid sits {{near the}} front of the neck, lying against and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the larynx and trachea. The thyroid {{cartilage}} and cricoid cartilage lie just above the gland, below the Adam's apple. The isthmus extends from the second to third rings of the trachea, with the uppermost part of the lobes extending to the thyroid cartilage, and the lowermost around the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. The thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an outer layer. The outer layer is continuous with the pretracheal fascia, attaching the gland to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior suspensory ligament of thyroid gland also known as Berry's ligament. This causes the thyroid to move up and down with swallowing. The inner layer extrudes into the gland and forms the septae that divides the thyroid tissue into microscopic lobules. Typically four parathyroid glands, two on each side, lie on each side between the two layers of the capsule, {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes.|$|E

25|$|Early in December, {{thousands}} of students, faculty, and visitors gather <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> campus fountain {{for an annual}} Christmas carol sing and lighting ceremony, culminating in the illumination of tens of {{thousands of}} Christmas lights. On December 3, 2004, the ceremony broke the Guinness World Record for Christmas caroling with 7,514 carolers.|$|E
25|$|An {{extended}} {{terminal building}} {{was created by}} building a pre-fabricated metal structure <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the original Basil Spence building, hence screening much of its distinctive Brutalist style architecture from view, with the void between the two structures joined by a glass atrium and walkway. Spence's original concrete facade which once looked onto Caledonia Road now fronts the check-in desks. The original building can be seen more clearly from the rear, with the mock barrel-vaulted roof visible when airside.|$|E

25|$|Horses needed attendants: {{hitching}} a six-horse {{field artillery}} team, for example, required six men working {{for at least}} an hour. Horse health deteriorated after only ten days of even moderate load, requiring frequent refits; recuperation took months and the replacement horses, in turn, needed time to get along with their teammates and handlers. Good stables <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line were scarce, makeshift lodgings caused premature wear and disease. Refit of front-line horse units consumed eight to ten days, slowing down operations.|$|E
25|$|Surviving dust-jackets on {{the first}} edition are {{exceedingly}} rare. It is not known whether that is because of attrition or because some printings were not jacketed or because lots directed to some markets did not come with jackets. What is known is that jackets have been reported {{on more than one}} of the printings and most commonly {{on the first}} printing. The jacket is a medium blue field all <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> <b>front</b> announces the title in white, beneath which appears, in color and framed in red, Tolkien's illustration of Hobbiton. The reverse displays Tolkien's illustration of Smaug on his trove, also in color.|$|E
25|$|Hollybush was {{originally}} {{the home of}} the Whitney family, {{and it was the first}} of its kind in South Jersey. It set a certain precedent with its Italianate architectural style, and its interior decorations attest to this precedent. Two of these significantly unique features of the house are the trompe de l'oeil ceilings in the parlor as well as the Summit Room, and the painted glass archway above and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door. The stone that was used in construction of Hollybush was New Jersey Ironstone, a sedimentary type stone that is found in the low hills and ridges of South Jersey.|$|E

25|$|The new {{custom-built}} Imperial sedan {{was based}} on the Chrysler New Yorker. It shared the same trim, but had a canvas-covered roof and leather and broadcloth Imperial upholstery. These features were installed by Derham, on the all new postwar Chrysler sheetmetal. Early 1949 Imperial Crowns were actually leftover 1948s. The really new models didn't arrive until March, 1949. Their styling was sleeker than previous models, yet conservative. Fewer, but heavier bars were used in the cross-hatched grille. The upper and center horizontal pieces wrapped <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> fenders. Rocker panel moldings, rear fender stoneguards, full length lower window trim and horizontal chrome strips on the rear fenders, and from the headlights to about halfway across the front doors, were used to decorate the side body.|$|E
25|$|Chapeltoun (Chapleton, Chappleton, Chapeltown, etc.) Mains farm {{changes its}} name from simple Chapelton, which Laigh Chapelton now adopts {{as the site of}} the new mansion house, {{sometime}} between 1829 and 1858. This suggests that at this time Chapelton Mains was the home farm prior to the building of what is now Chapelhill House in around 1911, as judged from the OS maps. A small building appears near the site of Chapelburn Cottage from 1858. The area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the farm is referred to as 'Black Sawneys Park'; 'Sawney' being an English term for 'Alexander'. At one time it effectively meant a 'Scotsman', as {{with the use of the}} name 'Jock'. Another explanation is that the field had black sandy soil due to the river flooding onto the holm and creating rich fertile soil.|$|E
25|$|During the Vietnam War, the CH-46 {{was one of}} {{the prime}} US troop {{transport}} helicopters in the theatre, slotting between the smaller Bell UH-1 Iroquois and larger Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion. During the 1972 Easter Offensive, Sea Knights saw heavy use to convey US and South Vietnamese ground forces to and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines. CH-46 operations were plagued by major technical problems; the engines, being prone to foreign object damage (FOD) from debris being ingested when hovering close to the ground and subsequently suffering a compressor stall, had a lifespan as low as 85 flight hours; on 21 July 1966, all CH-46s were grounded until more efficient filters had been fitted. By the end of US military operations in Vietnam, over a hundred Sea Knights had been lost to enemy fire.|$|E

50|$|The {{cover is}} made with {{a single piece of}} vellum or {{alternative}} material, folded <b>around</b> <b>the</b> textblock, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and back covers being folded double. The quires are sewn onto cords such as alum-tawed thongs and the sewing supports would be laced into the vellum cover. The thongs would also often be used at the fore edge of the covers to create a closure or tie.|$|R
25|$|The {{concentration}} of troops {{at the front}} line on a forward slope, guaranteed that it would face the bulk of an artillery bombardment, directed by ground observers on clearly marked lines. Much of the new defence-building on the Somme was done first in the area north of Fricourt and work further south through Montauban to the river, had not been completed by 1 July. For nearly {{a year after the}} French offensive north of the Ancre, the area became a backwater and the divisions became known as the Sleeping Army. In May 1916, increased activity behind the British front line indicated that an offensive was being prepared. When Reserve Infantry Regiment 109 moved into the area of Mametz and Montauban in mid-June, the defences were seen to be poor and that there had been far less fighting in the sector than around La Boisselle and Ovillers. Telephone connexions were inadequate and there had been little stocking of supplies and ammunition <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line. By July, Reserve Infantry Regiment 23 had been brought up to Montauban, east of Reserve Infantry Regiment 109.|$|E

500|$|A giraffe {{has only}} two gaits: walking and galloping. Walking is done by moving the legs {{on one side of}} the body at the same time, then doing the same on the other side. When galloping, the hind legs move <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> legs before the latter move forward, and the tail will curl up. The animal relies on the forward and {{backward}} motions of its head and neck to maintain balance and the counter momentum while galloping. The giraffe can reach a sprint speed of up to , and can sustain [...] for several kilometres.|$|E

500|$|The {{building}} has a front projection measuring , which held the main entranceway and {{an office and}} sample room. The former office has walls and ceilings of quartered oak, and includes a stone fireplace and vault door. The former sample room has paneled mahogany walls and ceilings, a parquet floor, open bottle racks on walls, and two lockers of mahogany. The windows are polished plate glass with stained glass transoms. The tasting and sales rooms are still preserved in their original form. The projection also includes a [...] stone tower that extends one story above the roof and was built to hold a large water tank. A driveway wraps <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and back of the building, where it is nearly level with the third floor.|$|E
500|$|Prost uses {{a helmet}} design {{based on the}} three colours of the French flag, those being blue, white and red, along with his name along the side. During his early career however, Prost used a basic design of white all over with some blue detail around the visor (blue helmet with a white 180째 flipped Y and red lines in the lower branch of the flipped Y and in the upper branch, {{surrounding}} the top). During Prost's time at Renault, he used more blue details, most notably around the rear of his helmet. Prost's helmet changed in 1985, as his helmet now had the blue detail <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> surrounding the visor (with also a blue stripe on the side region, making the white area become a P) and a white ring with red lines surrounding the top (forming a white circle with a blue half {{in the rear of}} the top)[...] Prost kept a similar design for his entry at Ferrari and Williams.|$|E
500|$|The keep is two storeys high, {{built of}} ashlar Portland stone. Historic England {{considers}} it to form [...] "one {{of the best}} preserved and best known examples" [...] of the Henrician forts. In {{the centre of the}} ground floor is the octagonal great hall, now fitted with large Victorian windows, which would have originally providing living space for the garrison. Off the great hall are wings holding the gunners' quarters and the castle's kitchen, the latter equipped with a large, 16th-century fireplace. Running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the keep is the gun room. This was originally a two-storey gun battery with embrasures for five guns on the ground floor and four more above on the first floor, with {{the southern end of the}} ground floor subdivided into four barrack rooms. The ground-floor embrasures were designed with vents to allow the smoke from the guns to escape. Both the wooden roof that formed the first-floor gun platform and the internal wooden partitions have been dismantled, however, and the chamber is now open to the air. It now houses a variety of 18th and 19th century cannons.|$|E
50|$|The large steeply-pitched saddle back roof {{dominates the}} structure. The roofs are {{traditionally}} thatched, {{and with no}} internal roof trusses they provide a large internal space. Sharply projected triangular eaves and gables overlap all <b>around</b> <b>the</b> substructure. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> gable extends further than the rear gable and is finely carved and painted with motifs of suns, starts, cockerels, and geometric motifs in red, white, and black. The rear gable remains plain.|$|R
