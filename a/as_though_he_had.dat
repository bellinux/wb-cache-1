5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{nominations}} {{began the}} following day. Hardin felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been cheated and withdrew his candidacy, although some loyal delegates continued {{to vote for}} him. Delegate John Stockdale Rhea nominated Stone. Stone believed that his agreement with Goebel meant, with Hardin's withdrawal, Goebel would instruct his delegates to vote for Stone, maintaining a unified party. That understanding vanished when another delegate nominated Goebel. Stone was further incensed {{when all of the}} Louisville delegation voted for Goebel instead of being split between Stone and Goebel, as the two men had previously agreed. In retaliation, some Stone supporters began to back Hardin. Seeing the breakdown of the Stone-Goebel alliance, Hardin reversed his withdrawal. After numerous ballots, the convention was deadlocked on the night of June 24 with each candidate receiving about one-third of the votes. No deliberations were held on Sunday, June 25, and when the delegates reconvened on Monday, June 26, the hall was filled with police per Redwine's request. Rhea requested that the police be removed to prevent intimidation, but Redwine ruled the motion out of order. Another delegate appealed Redwine's decision, and, in violation of parliamentary rule, Redwine ruled the appeal out of order. Angered by Redwine's obviously biased rulings, delegates for Stone and Hardin then began trying to disrupt the convention by blowing horns, singing, yelling, and standing on chairs. Although voting was attempted, many delegates abstained because they were unable to hear and understand what was going on. When the voting—such as it was—ended, the chair announced that Goebel had a majority of the votes cast, but Goebel sent word to Redwine that he would only accept the nomination if he received an absolute majority of the delegates. Further attempts to vote were likewise disrupted, and the meeting adjourned for the day.|$|E

25|$|From March 1943, British Intelligence {{had been}} trying to find Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's {{headquarters}} in France. Part of the brief looked at creating a timetable for Rommel, to assess how easy it would be to kill him. Much <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been against the plan pre-D-Day, with manpower losses escalating Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery approved the plan post D-Day, even though they still didn't know where Rommel's base was. In a bizarre coincidence, on 9 June SAS Lieutenant General was heading for a meeting with a French Resistance unit. Resting in a barn, he was approached by a man who lived in La Roche-Guyon, asking for assurances that as Rommel's headquarters was in the village, that the Royal Air Force would not bomb them.|$|E

500|$|As a footballer, Loxton usually {{played as}} a forward, {{but was also}} used as a full-back and alternated between the two positions. He {{was known for his}} {{physical}} strength; another VFL player who had a reputation as an [...] "enforcer" [...] tried to bump him and later said that the collision made him feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> run into a goalpost. According to Robert Coleman, Loxton was [...] "competitive, pugnacious and outspoken, with a doglike loyalty to everyone and everything he served, whether it was his captain, his team, his party, his premier or his constituents." ...|$|E
500|$|Stanford put {{the game}} on ice in the fourth period when Pop {{introduced}} the bootlegger play, {{which was to be}} widely copied and still is in use. On the original bootlegger, Warner made use of Biff Hoffman's tremendous hands. Hoffman would take the pass from center and then fake to another back. Keeping the ball, he would hide it behind him and run <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> given it to a teammate. Sometimes defensive players would step out of Hoffman's path, thinking he was going to block. Hoffman [...] "bootlegged" [...] for the touchdown against California...|$|E

He plays <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ice water in his veins." [...] Crisler felt that [...] "great passers are born," [...] and the difference between a great and a merely good passer is in the eyes. Time noted that Chappuis had great field vision for his downfield receivers and for oncoming defenders. [...] "Like a good baseball catcher, he throws the ball off his right ear, with a snap motion. He throws what the coaches call a ‘heavy ball.’" [...] Another writer noted that Chappuis was [...] "endowed with a passer's sixth sense, ‘split vision,’" [...] and an ability to [...] "pick out his receiver after one glance over the field." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} songs Åkerfeldt wrote for Heritage {{were in the}} style of Watershed. After hearing the songs for the first time, Martín Méndez told Åkerfeldt that he would be {{disappointed}} if the album continued in that direction. Relieved that Méndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, Åkerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style. In the press release for Heritage, Mikael Åkerfeldt revealed that he felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been building to write the album since he was 19 years old. In a review for Allmusic, Thom Jurek called Heritage the band's most adventurous album, describing the songs as [...] "drenched in instrumental interludes, knotty key and chord changes, shifting time signatures, clean vocals, and a keyboard-heavy instrumentation that includes Mellotrons, Rhodes pianos, and Hammond organs".|$|E
500|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, Cruttwell enlisted in the Royal Berkshire Regiment and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. He fought in France and Belgium, until a severe leg wound in 1916 ended his front line military service. Apart from its physical effects, Cruttwell's experience in the trenches seemingly inflicted permanent psychological damage on his personality, replacing the general good manners of his youth with a short-tempered, impatient and bullying character. The novelist Evelyn Waugh, an undergraduate at Hertford in the 1920s, wrote later that [...] "It was <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never cleansed himself from the muck of the trenches". [...] In {{the latter part of the}} war, Cruttwell was employed in the military intelligence department at the War Office in London, before returning to Oxford in 1919. In 1922, he published a short history of his regiment's wartime exploits.|$|E
500|$|As the U.S. vice president, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace {{were invited}} to quite a few parties, where the legend of [...] "Silent Cal" [...] was born. It is from this time {{that most of the}} jokes and anecdotes {{involving}} Coolidge originate. Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private {{he was a man of}} few words and was commonly referred to as [...] "Silent Cal". A possibly apocryphal story has it that a matron, seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, [...] "I made a bet today that I could get more than two words out of you." [...] He replied, [...] "You lose." [...] Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, [...] "How can they tell?" [...] Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, [...] "Got to eat somewhere." [...] Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a leading Republican wit, underscored Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: [...] "When he wished he were elsewhere, he pursed his lips, folded his arms, and said nothing. He looked then precisely <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been weaned on a pickle." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{marriage}} {{was in the}} process of breaking down rapidly. Northrup and Hubbard had frequent rows and his violent behaviour towards her continued unabated. On one occasion, while Northrup was pregnant, Hubbard kicked her several times in the stomach in an apparent – though unsuccessful – attempt to induce an abortion. She recalled that [...] "with or without an argument, there'd be an upsurge of violence. The veins in his forehead would engorge" [...] and he would hit her [...] "out of the blue", breaking her eardrum in one attack. Despite this, she still [...] "felt so guilty about the fact that he was so psychologically damaged. I felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> given so much to our country and I couldn't even bring him peace of mind. I believed thoroughly that he was a man of great honor, had sacrificed his well being to the country ... It just never occurred to me he was a liar." [...] He told her that he didn't want to be married [...] "for I can buy my friends whenever I want them" [...] but he could not divorce either, as the stigma would hurt his reputation. Instead, he said, if Northrup really loved him she should kill herself.|$|E
500|$|Tallon had an {{understated}} style, {{which was}} without flourish or flamboyancy. He {{was known for}} his anticipation of the flight, length and spin of the ball. He was particularly regarded for his stumping efficiency and his ability to catch balls down the leg side. Tallon often stood up to the stumps for medium pace bowlers and he had a textbook stumping technique in which he lifted the bails without disturbing the stumps. Tallon's crouch was more pronounced than most other keepers and he rebounded upwards further and faster than others. He had a particularly smooth and graceful catching technique that left his hands undamaged from the ball's impact, the injury in England in 1948 being a notable exception that proved the rule. In recognising him as one of their five Cricketers of the Year in the 1949 Wisden, the Almanack noted that his hands resembled those of a violinist, while Bradman noted that all his [...] "fine, longer fingers were intact" [...] <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not played much cricket. According to his English counterpart Godfrey Evans, Tallon was the [...] "best and most nimble keeper ever" [...] while Australian team-mate Alan Davidson called him the [...] "Bradman of keepers". Due to financial reasons, Tallon could not afford new equipment and he used an outdated pair of iron-coated gloves for most of his career.|$|E
500|$|Paul Babeu, {{the sheriff}} of Pinal County, Arizona, {{appeared}} on The Political Cesspool on July 10, 2010 to discuss illegal immigration; during the interview, {{he referred to}} James Edwards as a [...] "great American". Less than two weeks later, Babeu's spokesman issued an apology, {{saying that he had}} not researched the show thoroughly enough before scheduling the interview and that Babeu has a policy of not conducting interviews with hate groups. Babeu himself said that he was [...] "hoodwinked" [...] into appearing on the show and that he rejects [...] "any hate or bigotry". Prior to the interview, cohost Eddie Miller said that [...] "Of all the people we’ve interviewed on this radio show, I would say the only people that came close to getting me this excited was Dr. David Duke." [...] Following Babeu's spokesman's apology, Edwards alleged that Babeu was aware of the show's true ideology prior to appearing on the show, saying: [...] "For Sheriff Babeu to change his mind and now regret coming on our show, for whatever reason, is his right. For him to act <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no idea of our ideology is a lie." [...] As a result of the controversy surrounding Babeu's appearance on the show, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate J. D. Hayworth asked his primary opponent, John McCain, to drop several campaign ads featuring McCain and Babeu. In 2011, another sheriff, Dennis Spruell of Montezuma County, Colorado, also apologized after appearing on the show without knowing its actual agenda.|$|E

5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, {{music critic}} Ronnie D.
