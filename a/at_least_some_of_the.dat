5|$|Radiocarbon dated {{samples from}} the cromlech show the tomb was {{accessed}} by many generations {{over a period of}} 300–800years, and that the human bones are the disarticulated remains (i.e., not complete skeletons) of at least 40individuals: male and female adults, adolescents, children, and infants.

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{legend of}} the jackalope, upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were building, {{may be related to}} similar stories in other cultures and other historical times. Researchers suggest that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tales of horned hares were inspired by sightings of rabbits infected with the Shope papilloma virus. It causes horn- and antler-like tumors to grow in various places on a rabbit's head and body.|$|E
5|$|These {{extension}} {{plans were}} {{rejected by the}} government in 2004, due to escalating costs. New plans were drawn up in 2007, with <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> money required for the construction of the line planned to come from the proposed Manchester Congestion Charge, which was overwhelmingly rejected by public vote in 2008.|$|E
5|$|After closure, {{the line}} was largely forgotten. Because it had been built on private land without an Act of Parliament, few records of it prior to the Oxford {{extension}} schemes exist in official archives. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rails remained in place in 1940, as records exist of their removal during the building of RAF Westcott. Other than the station buildings at Westcott and Quainton Road almost nothing survives of the tramway, {{although much of the}} route can still be traced by a double line of hedges. The former trackbed between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road is now a public footpath known as the Tramway Walk.|$|E

The documentary crew discovers that Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) has left <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negative comments, taking pleasure in Andy's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} {{was suggested}} by Brooks: Penda might have lost power {{at some point}} after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's fortunes were low at this time. Thus {{it may be that}} Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield. argues against the idea that Penda and Eowa were co-rulers, and favours the idea that Eowa was ruling Mercia from c. 635 until 642.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young man}} he married Rampanambonitany. Oral history {{provides}} two conflicting accounts of their marriage. According to one version, the couple had no children of their own, leading the king to adopt the eight daughters and five sons of his sister Rangorinimerina. In another version, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five sons and eight daughters issued from the king's marriage, and his son Rakotomavo was adopted from a woman called Rangorimanana. The remaining four sons were named Andriantoarana, Andriamohara, Ratsimanjaka and Andriampalimana. The names of only three of his eight daughters are preserved in the oral histories: Randriamizaza, Rahisatra and Rahira.|$|E

5|$|In Yellowstone's hot waters, {{bacteria}} form mats {{of bizarre}} shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria {{are some of}} the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other arthropods live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from sulfur. In 2005 researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder discovered that the sustenance for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diverse hyperthermophilic species is molecular hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{at what point}} among the extant fragments the division between books 1 and 2 fell, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aeolid families were covered in the second book. The families of Perieres, Deion and Sisyphus (in that order) were most likely found in the 2nd book because there {{does not appear to}} be enough room left in book 1 to accommodate them as a group after the children of Neleus and Pelias. It was once thought that the Ehoie of Atalanta opened the book, but recently published evidence casts doubt upon this view (see Book 3, below).|$|E
5|$|Musculoskeletal {{analysis}} showed significant gender lifestyle variation. Greater leg muscle development {{was found in}} males of the Parc Cwm cromlech, possibly the result of hunting or herding, confirming the sexual dimorphism found in previous analyses of the remains. In contrast, no such variation was noticeable in the remains found during excavations from other nearby sites, for example the Tinkinswood burial chamber, in the Vale of Glamorgan. The variation in musculoskeletal stress markers may indicate a mobile lifestyle for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> males analysed.|$|E

5|$|On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, {{asking her}} to take Climbié {{permanently}} because Manning did not want her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn {{on her face and}} a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed {{and he said that he}} hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.|$|E
5|$|The Legion spurred {{several million}} Roman Catholics across the U.S. {{to sign up}} for the boycott, {{allowing}} local religious leaders to determine which films to protest. Conservative Protestants tended to support much of the crackdown, particularly in the South, where anything relating to the state of race relations or miscegenation could not be portrayed. Although the Central Conference of American Rabbis joined in the protest, it was an uneasy alliance given the heavy presence of Jewish studio executives and producers, which, it was felt had inspired <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vitriol from the Catholic groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} those killed at Krečane were left unburied for two weeks. Some {{of the victims were}} not {{immediately}} killed, rather they took days to die and people living on the opposite bank of the Una River in Bosnia and Herzegovina claim that they heard cries for help for days after the killings took place. After two weeks, most of the bodies were bulldozed into a shallow grave {{on the bank of the}} river, and the rest thrown into the Una. The grave was located sufficiently close to the river to allow the current to wash <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bodies away.|$|E

5|$|To {{test this}} idea he {{surveyed}} hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but {{he planned to}} show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing {{that there was an}} astronomical intent to the orientation of <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two solstices, the two equinoxes and four cross-quarter days, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar. While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Another serious effect {{created by}} the oil-related {{industries}} has been the pollution around the Houston Ship Channel and in Galveston Bay. By the 1970s, these waterways {{were among the most}} polluted waters in the United States. Though industrial sources were major sources of pollution, urbanization around the bay also contributed significantly to pollution levels. In recent decades, most of the pollution in the bay is the result of storm run-off from various smaller commercial, agricultural, and residential sources, as opposed to the major industrial complexes. Conservation efforts in the mid to late 20th century by area industries and municipalities have helped to dramatically improve water quality in the bay reversing <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier damage to the ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 15 February, {{both the}} British and French forces raised their colours. Dance hoped to persuade Linois that his ships {{included}} some fully armed warships and he therefore ordered the brig Ganges {{and the four}} lead ships to hoist blue ensigns, {{while the rest of}} the convoy raised red ensigns. By the system of national flags then in use in British ships, this implied that the ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to the squadron of Admiral Rainier, while the others were merchant ships under their protection. Dance was unknowingly assisted by the information that had reached Linois at Batavia, which claimed that there were 23 merchant ships and the brig in the convoy. Dance had collected six additional ships during his journey, and the identity of these were unknown to the French, who assumed that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unidentified vessels must be warships, particularly as several vessels had been recently painted at Canton to resemble ships of the line.|$|E
