25|$|The 2002 Oregon gubernatorial {{election}} {{took place}} on November 5, 2002. Incumbent Democratic Governor of Oregon John Kitzhaber was unable to seek a third consecutive term as governor, therefore creating an open seat.

The campaign between Kulongoski and Mannix, who were joined by Libertarian nominee Tom Cox, was close <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the wire. Ultimately, Kulongoski eked out a narrow margin of victory over Mannix, which was slightly smaller than Cox's total vote share, allowing Kulongoski to win {{what would be the}} first of two terms as governor.|$|E
