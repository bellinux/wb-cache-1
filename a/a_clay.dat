5|$|<b>A</b> <b>clay</b> tablet {{found in}} ancient Iraq that {{promoted}} more advanced agricultural techniques is sometimes considered {{the first known}} example of public relations. Babylonian, Egyptian and Persian leaders created pyramids, obelisks and statues to promote their divine right to lead. Additionally, claims of magic or religious authority were used to persuade the public of a king or pharaoh's right to rule.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{generated}} during phreatic eruptions primarily {{consists of}} hydrothermally altered lithic and mineral fragments, commonly in <b>a</b> <b>clay</b> matrix.

5|$|Greeley, in his paper, {{initially}} {{supported the}} Whig program. As divisions between Clay and President Tyler became apparent, {{he supported the}} Kentucky senator and looked to <b>a</b> <b>Clay</b> nomination for president in 1844. However, when Clay was nominated by the Whigs, he was defeated by the Democrat, former Tennessee governor James K. Polk, though Greeley worked hard on Clay's behalf. Greeley had taken positions in opposition to slavery as editor of The New-Yorker in the late 1830s, opposing the annexation of the slaveholding Republic of Texas to the United States. In the 1840s, Greeley became an increasingly vocal opponent of the expansion of slavery.|$|E

5|$|In 1857, Rodin {{submitted}} <b>a</b> <b>clay</b> {{model of}} a companion to the École des Beaux-Arts {{in an attempt to}} win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Given that entrance requirements at the Grande École were not particularly high, the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving the Petite École in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.|$|E
5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make <b>a</b> <b>clay</b> model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northeast}} of Museum Gardens there are {{remains of the}} west corner of the fortifications that surrounded the Roman fort of Eboracum. The original defences, consisting of turf ramparts on a green wood foundation, were built by the Ninth Legion between 71 and 74AD. Later those were replaced by <b>a</b> <b>clay</b> mound with a turf front on a new oak foundation, and eventually wooden battlements were added, which were then replaced by limestone walls and towers. These stone defences {{are some of the}} few Roman remains that are visible above ground in York.|$|E

The following week he reached his second final on clay, at the Madrid Open after recording only his second and third victories over top 10 opposition on clay, against Raonic and Nishikori. In the final, he defeated Rafael Nadal in straight sets for his first Madrid title on clay, and first ever clay court Masters 1000 title. The win was Murray's first over Nadal, Federer or Djokovic since Wimbledon 2013, and his first over Nadal on <b>a</b> <b>clay</b> court.|$|E
5|$|Structure 86 is to {{the west}} of Structure 32, at {{the western edge of the}} West Group. The first phase of {{construction}} dates to the Early Classic, between 150 and 300 AD, when it took the form of a sunken patio, with stairways descending in the middle of its perimeter walls. At the centre of the patio were placed <b>a</b> <b>clay</b> altar and a stone, around which and across the rest of the patio were deposited an enormous number of offerings consisting of ceramic vessels, mostly from the Solano tradition.|$|E

5|$|Together {{with the}} north and south wall, the {{entrance}} of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with <b>a</b> <b>clay</b> pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.|$|E
5|$|At {{some time}} between his {{coronation}} and his death, Darius left a tri-lingual monumental relief on Mount Behistun, {{which was written}} in Elamite, Old Persian and Babylonian. The inscription begins with a brief autobiography including his ancestry and lineage. To aid the presentation of his ancestry, Darius wrote down {{the sequence of events}} that occurred after the death of Cyrus the Great. Darius mentions several times that he is the rightful king by the grace of Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian god. In addition, further texts and monuments from Persepolis have been found, as well as <b>a</b> <b>clay</b> tablet containing an Old Persian cuneiform of Darius from Gherla, Romania (Harmatta) and a letter from Darius to Gadates, preserved in a Greek text of the Roman period.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had {{developed}} a glassy material known as faience, which they treated {{as a type of}} artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials {{in the form of a}} paste over <b>a</b> <b>clay</b> core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.|$|E
