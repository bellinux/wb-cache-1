5|$|Four EEF {{infantry}} brigades of 10,000 rifles attacked four Ottoman regiments of 4,500 rifleswhich were {{reinforced by}} two divisions to over 8,000. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> {{to be carried}} out by well-prepared troops, with overwhelming artillery support and six Mark IV tanks. These <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> designed to keep the Gaza garrison of 8,000 riflemen supported by 116 guns in place after the capture of Beersheba and during preparations for the main EEF attacks on Hareira and Sheria.|$|E

5|$|The attacks {{also caused}} {{extensive}} damage to Japan's urban areas. Approximately 40percent {{of the urban}} area of the 66 cities subjected to area <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> destroyed. This included the loss of about 2.5million housing units, which rendered 8.5million people homeless. The urban area attacks reduced {{the morale of the}} Japanese population, and postwar surveys conducted by the USSBS found that air <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> {{the most important factor in}} convincing the Japanese that the war had been lost. During the final months of the war the raids also contributed to the deterioration of the Japanese social fabric. However, civilian morale did not collapse due to the bombing, and post-war investigations found that most Japanese had remained willing to continue the war if necessary.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} attacks had been {{successful}} and as Allied commanders began {{to believe that}} a breakthrough was possible further <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> made at Poelcappelle on 9 October and at Passchendaele on 12 October despite heavy rain that turned the ground into a muddy quagmire. Both <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> ultimately doomed to failure, with heavy casualties, as the attacks foundered in the mud and as the battle petered out, it was decided {{that it was time for}} the Australians to be withdrawn from the line. This was completed by 14 November 1917. Over the course of the eight weeks they had been involved in the fighting around Ypres, they had suffered 38,000 casualties.|$|E
5|$|The servers of LastPass were vulnerable, {{but due to}} {{additional}} encryption and forward secrecy, potential <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> not able to exploit this bug. However, LastPass recommended that its users change passwords for vulnerable websites.|$|E
5|$|A common example {{might be}} {{following}} unauthorized network intrusion. A specialist forensic examination {{into the nature}} and extent of the attack is performed as a damage limitation exercise. Both to establish the extent of any intrusion and in an attempt to identify the attacker. Such <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> commonly conducted over phone lines during the 1980s, but in the modern era are usually propagated over the Internet.|$|E
50|$|The Dinosaurs <b>Attack!</b> trading cards <b>were</b> {{created as}} a {{follow-up}} to the successful trading card series, Mars Attacks. Like Mars <b>Attacks,</b> Dinosaurs <b>Attack!</b> <b>was</b> intended as an homage and a parody of 1950s B-movies. While Mars <b>Attacks</b> <b>was</b> a parody of alien invasion movies, Dinosaurs <b>Attack!</b> <b>was</b> inspired by monster movies such as The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Godzilla.|$|R
30|$|Detecting {{multistage}} <b>attacks</b> <b>is</b> also {{handled by}} Ning et al, where prerequisites {{and consequences of}} <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> represented as predicates of first order logic [5]. Alerts that represent different stages of a single <b>attack</b> <b>are</b> fused together into hyperalerts. This concept diminishes the number of alerts to be analysed by the security team.|$|R

5|$|As {{a part of}} the North Korean {{build-up}} in the south, the untried NK 7th Division also arrived near Masan {{with another}} 10,000 men. The 7th Division occupied key ports to protect the 6th Division against possible amphibious landings in its rear. Eventually, though, the division was committed to combat in conjunction with other North Korean units. The simultaneous <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> hoped to overwhelm UN lines.|$|E
5|$|At the bridge, Frost's forces {{continued}} to hold but without supply or reinforcement their position was becoming weaker. The Germans—realising that infantry <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> unlikely to remove the stubborn defenders—began to systematically destroy the houses the British were in using tanks, artillery and mortars. In {{the absence of any}} Allied air cover, the Luftwaffe were able to make strafing runs on the British occupied houses as well.|$|E

Since then, most of the DoS <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> distributed in nature and they continue to grow in frequency, sophistication, and bandwidth.

5|$|During the Northern Seven Years' War, <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> {{launched}} on Sweden from Danish Halland in 1563, and Swedish counterattacks were launched against Danish provinces of Halland and Skåne in 1565 and 1569. In 1570 peace was finally agreed when the Swedish king withdrew the claims to Danish Skåne, Halland, Blekinge and Gotland, while the Danes withdrew their claims to Sweden as a whole.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, when Cibber first rose to be Rich's right-hand man at Drury Lane, his perceived opportunism and brash, thick-skinned personality gave rise to many barbs in print, especially against his patchwork plays. The early <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> mostly anonymous, but Daniel Defoe and Tom Brown are suggested as potential authors. Later, Jonathan Swift, John Dennis and Henry Fielding all lambasted Cibber in print. The most famous conflict Cibber had was with Alexander Pope.|$|E

This was the BPF's first large-scale night operation.|$|E
5|$|German Army {{headquarters}} {{wanted to}} capture the bridges over the Drava intact, and from 1 April had issued orders to the 2nd Army to conduct preliminary operations aimed at seizing the bridge at Barcs and the railway bridge northeast of Koprivnica by coup de main. As a result, limited objective <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> launched {{along the line of}} the Drava by the XLVI Motorised Corps, {{despite the fact that they}} were not expected to launch offensive operations until 10 April. During the day, the German Luftwaffe bombed and strafed Yugoslav positions and troops on the march, and by the evening it had become clear to the Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the border. XLVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Drava, including at Barcs. The local <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> sufficient to inflame dissent among the Croat troops of the 4th Army, who refused to resist Germans they considered their liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period.|$|E
