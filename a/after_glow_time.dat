40|$|The {{emission}} of light after the excitation source is switched off {{is known as}} phosphorescence. Phosphorescence occurs when suitable elements with active electronic configuration are doped into certain host materials. For an efficient phosphorescence emission (long <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> <b>time</b> and high intensity), both the dopant ion and the host material are critical. Strontium aluminates, such as SrAl 2 O 4, SrAl 4 O 7, SrAl 12 O 19, have gained attention {{for the last two}} decades due to their phosphorescence behavior upon doping with rare earth elements such as Eu, and Dy. These phosphorescent materials are superior to other materials of this kind as they have long after glow times with high quantum efficiency; they are easy to produce with alternating methods and are low cost materials. The focus of this thesis is on the different stoichiometric compounds of strontium aluminates with the dopants Eu 2 +, Dy 3 +, and boron. Eu 2 + introduces phosphorescence whereas Dy 3 + is used to increase the <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> <b>time.</b> Boron on the other hand improves the crystallinity, and also the <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> <b>time.</b> The general aim of this thesis is to develop materials with long after glow duration i. e more than one hour. A modified version of the Pechini process is proposed in order to accomplish the objective. The proposed procedure is one step ahead from the previous studies as it is an easy, lowtemperature and low-cost method. Moreover, by the proposed method, strontium aluminate compounds can be incorporated with up to 30 % boron without disturbing the crystal lattice and hence without lowering the crystallinity. These advantages are also verified experimentally...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Flame {{retardant}} fabrics {{have been}} broadly used for protective clothing, which have strictly requirements on both flame retardancy and thermal protection. Usually, domestic laundering {{will be carried}} out frequently to clean these protective garments. However, little research on the performance durability of this type of fabrics after domestic laundering has been reported. This paper selected fabrics of 8 types of cotton and its blend fibers, which were treated with flame retardants Pyrovatex CP, Proban, CFR- 201, SCJ- 968 respectively. The damaged length, after flame time, <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> <b>time,</b> TPP value, thermal resistance value, weight, thickness, air permeability and water vapor permeability (WVP) of the samples were measured before and after 15 cycles domestic laundering cycles. Results show that the flame retardancy of the 8 fabrics reduce with launderings as measured by the increase in damaged length and <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> <b>time.</b> The TPP increase probably resulted from the increase in the thickness and thermal resistance of the finished fabrics. Domestic laundering resulted in only a slight change in the comfort properties of the fabrics. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The flame {{characteristics}} of castor oil based foam {{and that of}} polyether foam impregnated with inorganic flame retardants (FR) were investigated. The polyether foams were impregnated with measured concentration of Antimony trioxide and Sodium bromide, Ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate, Diammonium hydrogen orthophosphate, and Castor oil containing zero flame retardant. Incorporating these flame retardants into polyurethane formulations gave variable flame characteristics such as ignition time, flame propagation rate, <b>after</b> <b>glow,</b> char rate, add-on and <b>glow</b> <b>time.</b> These properties were measured {{as a function of}} concentration and type of flame retardant incorporated into the formulation. Result showed that ignition time and Add-On showed significant increase in this sequence-Castor oil>Ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate> Diammonium hydrogen orthophosphate>Antimony trioxide/Sodium bromide, at all the different concentrations, while flame-propagation rate and After-glow decreased in the same sequence for all the FR used at different concentrations. However the %Char increased in a reverse order – Diammonium hydrogen orthophosphate>Ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate>Antimony trioxide/Sodium bromide>Castor oil. These results show that castor oil is an effective flame retardant compared to the inorganic flame-retardants...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} {{revealed that}} exposure of methane and/or steam to radiowave (RW) and microwave (MW) energy using copper and rhodium catalysts produced hydrogen gas. The feasible pathways of chemical reactions leading to its production are shown below; CH 4 + 2 H 2 O +MW or RW + catalyst → CO 2 + 4 H 2 4 H 2 O +MW orRW + catalyst → 2 O 2 + 4 H 2 The generation of hydrogen gas {{was true for}} both sources of energy whether separately or in combination. The amount of hydrogen produced using RW energy was however, greater by more than 53 % {{as compared to the}} output of hydrogen using MW energy. MW at 1, 145 W power using 18. 3 g rhodium catalyst yielded an average of 15, 000 ppm hydrogen. Using RW energy, the same quantity of rhodium catalyst net a very high yield of 542, 151 ppm hydrogen. Using 153. 3 g copper catalyst, RW produced an average amount of 30, 820 ppm hydrogen gas. The optimum conditions for the above reactions to move forward and yield the highest amount of hydrogen gas, were the following; methane average gas flow rates of 1. 0 ml/s, average steam flow rates of 5 g/s, radiowave coil <b>glow</b> <b>time</b> of 1 minute and /or greater, for microwave, time range of 4 to 5 minutes at a power of 500 to 600 W, for RW generator, 475 kHz and a coil <b>glow</b> <b>time</b> of 1 minute and higher.
