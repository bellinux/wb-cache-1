As the development and application of ergonomics in traffic engineering and road safety, perceptual markings appeared in Japan, America and Europe. Perceptual markings warn drivers of potential danger or inform drivers of road condition change by special figure, color, <b>alignment,</b> textile <b>or</b> their <b>combinations</b> that can offer drivers visual, tactile or aural sensations. This paper gives an overall introduction of perceptual markings and their typical application and practice, which can be referred by traffic practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{main goal}} of {{corporate}} mergers is to gain synergy effects through the <b>alignment,</b> integration, <b>or</b> <b>combination</b> of business processes. While business processes are typically handled differently among companies, {{many of them}} are variations of a common process like, e. g., procurement or invoicing. The first goal for process analysts when aligning business processes is thus to identify and seamlessly integrate overlapping process parts. To support this we present in this paper an approach that merges two business process models which are depicted as Event-Driven Process Chains into a single process model without restricting the behavior that was possible in both the original models. The resulting model can serve {{as a starting point for}} further process optimization. The approach has been implemented in the ProM process mining framework. Therefore, it can be used together with a wide range of other process mining and analysis techniques. Key words: EPC, process alignment, process model integration...|$|R
40|$|This model calculates {{an optimal}} {{investment}} {{plan for a}} highway corridor or number of corridors, subject to budget constraints. The available options include upgrading the current alignment, constructing a bypass highway over a different <b>alignment,</b> <b>or</b> various <b>combinations.</b> The budget constraints can be specified as a total budget restriction, or as an available budget each period. The highway system is described by K different road links. Each link consists of the current alignment which may be described by any number of sections, and a bypass section over a new alignment. The model finds the construction plan for each link that maximizes discounted benefits, subject to the financial constraints on the maintenance and capital expenditures. The problem is formulated as a large combinatorial optimization problem. A Lagrangian relaxation of the budget constraints is used, and the problem decomposes by link. A dynamic programming (DP) model is used to solve for the optimal expansion path for each link, given the dual variables. The sub-gradient dual optimization problem is a linear programming problem which is solved for the optimal dual variables. An application is presented based on the World Bank's Third National Highway Project in India, which is a US$ 1. 3 billion project for upgrading approximately 2000 km of the Indian National Highway System. The project was approved based on results from this model. ...|$|R

40|$|Degenerate codon {{libraries}} {{are frequently}} used in protein engineering and evolution studies but are often limited to targeting {{a small number}} of positions to adequately limit the search space. To mitigate this, codon degeneracy can be limited using heuristics or previous knowledge of the tar-geted positions. To automate design of libraries given a set of amino acid sequences, an algorithm (LibDesign) was devel-oped that generates a set of possible degenerate codon libraries, their resulting size, and their score relative to a user-defined scoring function. A gene library of a specified size can then be constructed that is representative of the given amino acid distribution or that includes specific sequences <b>or</b> <b>combinations</b> thereof. LibDesign provides a new tool for automated design of high-quality protein libraries that more effectively harness existing sequence– structure information derived from multiple sequence <b>alignment</b> <b>or</b> computational protein design data...|$|R
