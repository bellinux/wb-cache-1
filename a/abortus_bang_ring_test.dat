40|$|The {{present study}} was done to assess the {{microbiological}} quality and related health risks of raw milk sold in and around Hyderabad city. A total of 60 milk samples were collected from milk sellers on bicycle (15) and two wheelers (15), local dairy farms (10), small hotels (10) and tea stalls (10) in and around Hyderabad city from January to March, 2012. Quality and milk borne hazards were assessed with combination of tests to quantify the total bacteria, the pathogenic microbes such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Staphylococcus and the occurrence of brucellosis (<b>Abortus</b> <b>bang</b> <b>ring</b> <b>test).</b> Plate count agar for total bacterial count and specific media for the pathogenic microbes {{were used in the}} study. The average total bacterial count in all the samples was recorded as 162 colonies at 106 dilutions. 27, 21 and 33 samples gave positive results out of 60 samples for Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Staphylococcus respectively with mean count ranged from 103 to 104 CFU/ml. Out of 60 samples 15 samples (25 %) were positive for brucellosis. KEY WORDS: Microbiological quality-raw milk-public health significance-Hyderabad city...|$|E

40|$|It is a {{well known}} fact that the Bang {{bacterium}} when 6,rst isolated does not grow readily {{in the presence of}} air. The employment of B. subtilis as an agent in the production of partial anaerobiosis was found to be necessary in growing this organism until several generations have passed. A glass jar may be used from which the air ca,n be partly exhausted with a suction pump but we prefer in this laboratory the use of B. subtilis which is the cultural method of Nowak of Austria (1908). This method consists in lowering the pressure of oxygen to that necessary for the growth of the abortion bacterium by means of the Bacillus subtilis, allowing 1 sq. cm. of surface culture of the B. subtilis to each 15 cc. capacity of the sealed jar in which it is grown. The technique usually employed is to streak the contaminat-ing material over two or three Petri dishes in succession, as is ordinarily done in making streak dilutions. The plates are then incubated at 37 °C. for twenty-four hours in the air to allow contaminating organisms to develop. The colonies are then marked with a wax pencil or India ink and the plates transferred. to the Novy jar and incubated for three days, as indicated above. At the end of this time the transparent colonies of Bact. <b>abortus</b> (<b>Bang),</b> if present, may appear on the clear spaces. In our studies to determine the number of generations it takes to grow this organism in air, we incubated the plates in air for three days to give the Bact. <b>abortus</b> (<b>Bang)</b> ample time to grow. ...|$|R

The differences in antibody production also show an imperfect correlation with the differences in response in the anaphylactic reaction complex as previously determined by Lewis and Loomis. These studies suggest very strongly that the allergic irritability {{is one of the}} several inheritable characters which form a partial basis for the natural resistance to tuberculosis. The antibody-producing capacity is only satisfactorily defined when minimal or moderate amounts of antigen are used and this in single treatments. The irregularities in experimental result when repeated treatments or very large single treatments are used suggest that antibody production in the second or "acquired capacity" phase may rest on a somewhat different fundamental basis than the latent or potential natural capacity.

In this study, for the evaluation of the hoop properties using the central piece-inserted ring model of Arsene, we performed the <b>ring</b> tensile <b>tests</b> at several temperatures. From the <b>ring</b> tensile <b>tests</b> and numerical analysis the load-displacement conversion relationship of ring specimen (LCRR) was determined.

Numerical models are also established to simulate stress development and crack initiation/propagation in restrained concrete rings. Cracking age, position and propagation in various rings are obtained from numerical analyses that agree well with experimental results. Elliptical thin rings of certain geometry can shorten the <b>ring</b> <b>test</b> duration as desirable. In thin rings, crack initiation is caused by external restraint effect so that a crack occurs at the inner circumference and propagates towards the outer one. In thick rings, crack initiation is mainly due to the self-restraint effect so that a crack occurs at the outer circumference and propagates towards their inner one. Therefore, thick elliptical concrete rings do not necessarily crack earlier than circular ones as observed from experiment...|$|R

40|$|Several tests, {{devoted to}} the study of {{cracking}} due to autogenous and drying shrinkage, exist in the literature. They are generally not relevant for the study of massive structures for which thermal strains plays a key role. Therefore, an active <b>ring</b> <b>test</b> has been developed to study cracking due to restrained thermal shrinkage. This test is an evolution of the restrained shrinkage <b>ring</b> <b>test</b> which allows us to take into account both autogenous and thermal shrinkage. With this test, the early age cracking due to thermal restrained shrinkage (effect of the temperature rate), the influence of reinforcement and construction joints have been studied (Briffaut et al.

So, complementary tests have been performed to study each phenomenon separately and the <b>ring</b> <b>test</b> has been numerically simulated in order to identify coupling between creep and damage and to quantify the strength decrease due to construction joints. A good agreement between experimental and numerical results has been obtained for ring with reinforcement and construction joints.

For this reason, current guidance (e. g. "Guideline on determining the fate of {{veterinary medicinal products}} in manure" (EMA/CVMP/ERA/ 430327 / 2009) (EMA, 2011) stipulates experimental studies on transformation of VMPs and biocides in manure. Though, the documents only contain basic regulatory requirements, whereas an experimental test guideline is still missing, both on EU and OECD level. To allow for a consistent assessment of studies within the registration process, a harmonized internationally accepted and validated test method is needed. A draft test guideline was developed within a previous R&D-Project "Development of test guidance for transformation of veterinary pharmaceuticals and biocides in liquid manure" (FKZ 3710 67 422) (Hennecke et al., 2015).
