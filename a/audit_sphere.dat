There has been an emerging trend since the early 1980 ‟s to outsource functions which were considered non-core. These trends have now moved into the internal <b>audit</b> <b>sphere,</b> a function which was previously maintained in-house. With the outsourcing of Internal Audit Functions issues such as independence and the value adding approach of internal audit are brought into question. This paper explores {{similarities and differences between}} public sector internal auditing and its counterpart in the private sector in South Africa. Using survey data collected from a purposive mix of 72 organisations in the South African private and public sector, the degree of internal audit outsourcing, the rationales behind their outsourcing decisions, the types of internal audit services providers, the perceived status of in-house and the perception of Independence of outsourced Internal Audit Functions were investigated. Results from statistical analysis suggest that {{there was no significant difference}} in the consideration of outsourcing of Internal Audit Function by sector. The private sector was significantly more likely to consider internal audit a core activity when compared to the public sector while the public sector were more uncertain. No significant differences were observed between sectors with regards to interaction with external auditors in terms of coordination of areas of audit coverage and work schedule. Private companies were significantly more likely to have longer hours provided by interval service providers relative to outside providers when compared to the public sector. The biggest difference appears to be that private companies chose a big 4 accounting firm more often than in the government sector. Conversely the government sector had a higher frequency of choosing smaller accounting firms and specialised internal audit providers when compared to the private sector. The value of this research study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by means of bridging the gap between the theory and practice from a developing economy xvi and emerging market perspective, by highlighting the different perspectives of Internal Audit practice. Challenges that face this developing economy that are of particular interest when considering the sourcing arrangements of the Internal Audit Function, are events (political, social and economical) that have occurred in South Africa during the past 15 years. The public sector element is unique to other studies that were undertaken in South Africa...|$|E
