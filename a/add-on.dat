The <b>add-on</b> allows {{players to}} play only as The Soul Rangers and is hosted by a Soul Ranger calling himself Dr. Mastiff. The <b>add-on</b> was released because the creators {{found out that}} players enjoy causing damage as The Soul Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Retribution is {{the second}} of the two {{authorized}} <b>add-on</b> packs released for StarCraft. The <b>add-on</b> was developed by Stardock and published by WizardWorks. It was released for the PC in late 1998. The game is set during the second campaign in StarCraft, revolving around the acquisition of a crystal of immense power connected to the Xel'Naga. Divided into three campaigns, the player assumes the roles of a Protoss fleet executor, the commander of a Dominion task force and a Zerg cerebrate, all tasked with retrieving the crystal from a Dominion colony and getting it off the planet as quickly as possible. As with its predecessor, Retribution does not include any new gameplay features beyond its single player campaigns and an abundance of multiplayer levels. The <b>add-on</b> was not well received by reviewers, and instead was regarded as average but at least challenging. Retribution is not widely available, and Blizzard Entertainment offers no comment regarding support or the availability of Retribution despite authorizing the <b>add-on.</b>|$|E
5|$|StarCrafts success also {{inspired}} {{third-party developer}} Microstar Software to release an unauthorized <b>add-on,</b> entitled Stellar Forces, in May 1998. Blizzard Entertainment consequently {{filed a lawsuit}} against Microstar for selling the <b>add-on,</b> arguing that as the product was unauthorized and created using StarCrafts level editing software, it was a breach of the end user license agreement.|$|E

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this thesis is an {{analysis}} of open source platforms and their <b>add-ons</b> for online shopping in Czech market. The aim is to describe various open source platforms and chart available <b>add-ons,</b> such as shipping and logistics, connection with accounting systems, payment methods, price comparison and similar <b>add-ons,</b> which extend functionality of an e-shop.

50|$|Firefox 8 was {{released}} on November 8, 2011. Firefox 8 verified that users really wanted any previously installed <b>add-ons.</b> Upon installation, a dialog box prompted users to enable or disable the <b>add-ons.</b> <b>Add-ons</b> installed by third-party programs were disabled by default, but user-installed <b>add-ons</b> were enabled by default. Mozilla judged that third-party-installed <b>add-ons</b> were problematic, taking away user control, lagging behind on compatibility and security updates, slowing down Firefox startup and page loading time, and cluttering the interface with unused toolbars.|$|R
5|$|After Nintendo {{decided not}} to have Sony create an <b>add-on</b> for the Super Famicom/Super NES, they gave Philips {{permission}} to use their characters in games for Philips' CD-i.|$|E

Players can undertake an array of quests and progress through the in-game hierarchy and through the major plot of the game. Since its debut in 2002, five expansion packs have been released along with six <b>add-on</b> scenarios. Each expansion pack and <b>add-on</b> brings a new major storyline to the Final Fantasy XI world, along with numerous areas, quests, events and item rewards.|$|E

5|$|In May 1991, {{following}} an unsuccessful attempt with Sony {{to develop a}} CD-ROM-based <b>add-on</b> for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo signed a deal with Philips to develop the aforementioned <b>add-on.</b> However, witnessing the poor reception of the Sega Mega-CD, Nintendo no longer considered the <b>add-on</b> profitable, and the project was scrapped entirely. As part of dissolving the deal, Nintendo gave Philips the license to use five of their characters, including Mario, Luigi and Princess Toadstool, to be featured in their games for the CD-i. The games were given little time to be developed and little funding, and Nintendo only gave cursory input. Philips used the characters to create games for the CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on {{the look of the}} characters. Apart from Hotel Mario, the Mario characters were intended to be used in Super Mario's Wacky Worlds, but the game was cancelled with only some prototype versions being programmed. While Wacky Worlds was planned as a CD-i adaptation of the side-scrolling platformer Super Mario World, Hotel Mario was made into a puzzle game in which stage areas were restricted to a single screen. Unlike the Legend of Zelda-related games, the game was not developed by a third-party company, but by Philips' development team Fantasy Factory.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, 2009, Microsoft and Epic Games {{issued a}} joint press release announcing the Gears of War 2: All Fronts Collection, to be {{released}} on July 28, 2009. The All Fronts Collection was to be sold as a retail package, and would have included all add-ons released for Gears of War 2, a poster, and a strategy guide for the game. In response to complaints that the All Fronts Collection had identical pricing to the Dark Corners <b>add-on,</b> but significantly more content, {{as well as the}} All Fronts Collection retail package not being made available in certain regions, Epic Games adjusted the release plan; the All Fronts Collection was released digitally via Xbox Live and the Dark Corners <b>add-on</b> was reduced in price.|$|E
5|$|Opposing Force was {{received}} well by critics, many describing {{it as the}} new benchmark title for expansion packs, {{in a similar fashion}} to how Half-Life revolutionized the first-person shooter genre. Other reviewers, however, thought that the game still had many of the negative aspects of other expansion packs, although it was still regarded as an exceptional <b>add-on.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some utilities, such as FSUIPC, merely {{provide useful}} tweaks for the {{simulator}} to overcome design limitations or bugs, or {{to allow more}} extensive interfacing with other third-party <b>add-ons.</b> Sometimes certain <b>add-ons</b> require other utility <b>add-ons</b> {{in order to work}} correctly with the simulator.|$|R

5|$|The game's {{development}} spanned {{twelve years}} and four consoles, beginning in 1994 for the Super Famicom console and then transitioning to the Nintendo 64 and its 64DD <b>add-on</b> before being cancelled in 2000. Mother 3 restarted development in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance and was finally released in Japan on April 20, 2006.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the first two <b>add-on</b> packs, Blizzard Entertainment {{announced}} the official expansion pack to StarCraft, entitled Brood War. Most of the team at Blizzard Entertainment responsible for StarCraft returned to work on Brood War. Development on Brood War began shortly after StarCrafts release, and Blizzard Entertainment were assisted by members of Saffire Corporation, who were contracted for a variety of tasks consisting of programming and design for levels, visuals and audio effects.|$|E

5|$|As time passed, the {{releases}} of new CD-based consoles {{such as the}} 3DO Interactive Multiplayer rendered the Sega CD technically obsolete, reducing public interest in the <b>add-on.</b> In late 1993, {{less than a year}} after the system's launches in North America and Europe, the gaming media reported that Sega was no longer accepting in-house development proposals for the Mega-CD in Japan. In early 1995, Sega shifted its focus to the Sega Saturn and discontinued all advertising for Genesis hardware, including the Sega CD. Sega officially discontinued the <b>add-on</b> in the first quarter of 1996, saying that it needed to concentrate on fewer platforms and felt the Sega CD could not compete in the current marketplace due to its high price tag and outdated single-speed drive. The last two games scheduled to be released for the Sega CD, Myst and Brain Dead 13, were subsequently cancelled. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide, including 400,000 in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Bullfrog {{released}} the Populous: The Beginning— Undiscovered Worlds in 1999. The expansion was only made {{available in the}} UK and US.

5|$|Decay {{was not a}} {{critical}} success, but was received with some positivity by video game journalists. Many reviewers felt the game was fun to play through with a friend, but that its more puzzle-oriented gameplay somewhat detracted from the overall experience.

The PlayStation version was released in North America by Working Designs, who had also produced the English adaptation of the original game, in May 1999.|$|E
5|$|Just Cause 2 {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its gameplay, open-ended nature, stunts, world design and graphics and criticized its story, gunplay and mission design.
