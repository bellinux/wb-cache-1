5|$|In fact, Squall and {{the heroes}} do help Ultimecia start Time Compression, {{but they do}} so to confront her in her own time. After Squall and his party defeat Sorceress Adel, Adel {{transfers}} her power to Rinoa, then Ultimecia possesses Rinoa again, and Ellone uses her power to send their consciousness to the past, at which point Ultimecia starts Time Compression. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> heroes are able to travel to Ultimecia's distant future and defeat her. After the final battle, the defeated Ultimecia transfers her powers to Edea.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) lies {{unconscious}} {{in the sea}} after wrecking his raft. He {{is taken}} aboard a passenger ship, the Queen Anne, by its British crew members. When he is sent to meet the captain, Mulder tries to explain that the Queen Anne vanished in the Bermuda Triangle in 1939, and claims that it has reappeared in 1998. The crew dismisses Mulder's story and suspect he is a Nazi spy. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> Queen Anne is boarded by SS troops {{under the control of}} a Oberführer resembling The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), who sets the ship's course for Nazi Germany. The crew of the Queen Anne lock Mulder in the captain's quarters, where he listens to a radio broadcast announcing the start of World War II. Mulder realizes that the Queen Anne did not travel to 1998: he has traveled back to 1939.|$|E
5|$|Captain Rachel Garrett of the Enterprise-C and {{her crew}} learn they have {{traveled}} into the future. Garrett explains {{that they were}} responding to a distress call from the Klingon outpost on NarendraIII, and were attacked by Romulan starships. While his crew works to repair the Enterprise-C and tend to the crew's injuries, Picard and his command staff discuss {{whether or not the}} ship should return to the past. Commander Riker argues that their deaths would be meaningless, but Data suggests that it would be considered an honorable act by the Klingons. Picard discusses the situation with Garrett, who tells him that her crew will serve the Federation in the present. Picard quietly reveals to her that the Federation {{is on the verge of}} defeat and the presence of one ship will make no difference, but if the Enterprise-C were to return to the past they might prevent the war from ever starting. Garrett agrees and announces to her crew that they will return through the anomaly; <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> two ships are ambushed by a Klingon Bird of Prey. Garrett is killed, and her helmsman, Richard Castillo, takes command.|$|E

5|$|Several investors {{stepped forward}} with offers {{to buy the}} Buccaneers after Culverhouse's death, {{including}} Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, New York Yankees owner (and Tampa resident) George Steinbrenner, and Massachusetts developer Socrates Babacas. In response to the ensuing publicity, the trust administering Culverhouse's estate then issued a statement that the team was not for sale. They reversed their position two months later, as a poor early-season record led to declining fan support and revenues. The decision to sell the franchise came {{on the same day}} that Joy filed a $25 million claim against Hugh's estate. Hugh had paid $16 million for the franchise, which was now valued at $142 million. With Barnett Bank filing claims for $20.8 million against the Culverhouse estate, the trustees came very close to accepting Angelos' $200 million offer, which would have involved relocating the team to Baltimore, Maryland. Fearful of losing the team, civic leaders presented a proposal guaranteeing ticket sales of at least 55,000 for all home games for the next two years. The team was eventually sold to Palm Beach, Florida businessman Malcolm Glazer for $192 million, <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> largest price ever paid for a professional sports franchise.|$|E

In October 2011, seven months after the disaster the first assumption had been Y1.1 trillion. Since then, TEPCO received already Y1.5 biljoen finantial aid, but the cost tripled. Besides the compensation costs, TEPCO would need some Y10 trillion to dismantle the reactors and cleaning up the radioactive polluted areas.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{creature}}s of light (the Abbhasaras) who had curiosity and a greedy nature began to dive and taste the savory Earth's substance. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> creature found out that it tasted so delicious.

25|$|This twelve-day period used to {{be called}} the unbaptized days, during which the demonic forces of all kinds were {{considered}} to be more than usually active and dangerous. People were cautious not to attract their attention, and did not go out late at night. The latter precaution was especially because of the demons called karakondžula, imagined as heavy, squat, and ugly creatures. When a karakondžula found someone outdoors during the night of an unbaptized day, it would jump on his back, and make him carry it wherever it wanted. This torture would end only when roosters announced the dawn; <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> creature would release its victim and run away.|$|E
25|$|Angry, {{sometimes}} violent, protests {{continued in}} Bucharest {{for the next}} few months, peaking on November 18. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> pro-Ghenadie crowd attempted to storm into Senate and were met with excessive force by the Gendarmes, leading to a street battle in front of University quarters. The matter was only solved by a new National Liberal cabinet, presided upon by Petre S. Aurelian and having Vasile Lascăr as head of Internal Affairs. This new administration, formed around National Liberals who opposed Sturdza, was entirely dedicated to a new settlement in the Ghenadie affair. Lascăr, who took credit for the pacification, later claimed that the Conservatives had been stoking the fire of popular discontent without assuming the responsibilities.|$|E

25|$|This {{distribution}} can {{be illustrated}} as an urn model with bias. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We {{will say that}} the odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now we are taking n balls, one by one, {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball at a particular draw is equal to its proportion of the total weight of all balls that lie in the urn <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>The</b> number of red balls x1 that we get in this experiment is a random variable with Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E
25|$|Gandalf {{arrived in}} time to help order the defences of Minas Tirith. His {{presence}} was resented by Denethor, the Steward of Gondor; but after Denethor's son Faramir was gravely wounded in battle, Denethor sank into despair and madness. Together with Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth, Gandalf led the defenders during the siege of the city. When the forces of Mordor finally broke the main gate, Gandalf alone on Shadowfax confronted the Witch-king of Angmar, Lord of the Nazgûl. But <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> Rohirrim arrived, compelling the Witch-king to withdraw and engage them. Gandalf would have ridden to their aid, but he too was suddenly required elsewhere—to save Faramir from Denethor, who sought in desperation to burn himself and his son on a funeral pyre in Rath Dínen.|$|E
25|$|On 30 October 2011 the Japanese {{government}} {{took up the}} plan to increase the 30 members of {{the staff at the}} Japanese embassy in Kiev, Ukraine to 36. For the first time two nuclear experts and three interpreters will be stationed here. In order to learn from the experience of this country with the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe. In this way Japan hoped to build on good relations between the two countries, also because growing numbers of Japanese officials were visiting Ukraine <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>The</b> new staff was expected to gather information about handling a no-go zone, the removal of radioactive materials, and how to deal with internal exposure to radiation. People affected by the Chernobyl disaster would also be questioned. The embassy was equipped with dosimeters and protection outfits for field studies.
