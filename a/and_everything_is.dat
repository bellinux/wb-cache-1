25|$|According to Advaita Vedanta, liberation can be {{achieved}} while living, and is called Jivanmukti. The Atman-knowledge, that is the knowledge of true Self {{and its relationship to}} Brahman is central to this liberation in Advaita thought. Atman-knowledge, to Advaitins, is that state of full awareness, liberation and freedom which overcomes dualities at all levels, realizing the divine within oneself, the divine in others and all beings, the non-dual Oneness, that Brahman is in everything, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> Brahman.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} nirvana is also {{described}} in Buddhism as cessation of all afflictions, cessation of all actions, cessation of rebirths and suffering {{that are a}} consequence of afflictions and actions.

Nirvana is also described as identical to achieving sunyata (emptiness), {{where there is no}} essence or fundamental nature in anything, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> empty.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{decided to}} use a film {{in the public domain}} to avoid any rights issues. He looked through the Prelinger Archives to find a film which matched the mood he wanted for the Chroma Key album. One of the first films he found was the social {{guidance}} film Age 13. [...] "It was kind of rich for musical accompaniment and the cinematography <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> really beautiful, kind of surreal," [...] Moore said. The film served as Moore's main inspiration and source of audio samples.|$|E

500|$|A few texts such as Atharvashiras Upanishad mention Rudra, and assert all gods are Rudra, {{everyone}} <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> Rudra, and Rudra is {{the principle}} found in all things, their highest goal, the innermost essence of all reality that is visible or invisible. The Kaivalya Upanishad similarly, states Paul Deussen – a German Indologist and professor of Philosophy, describes the self-realized man as who [...] "feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all", who feels identity of his and everyone's consciousness with Shiva (highest Atman), who has found this highest Atman within, {{in the depths of}} his heart.|$|E

In a more dreamscape world, the colors are vibrant <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> 2D. The video won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R/Soul or Rap Music Video in 1987. While reviewing the video, Vanity Fair magazine said in 1986 that Jackson [...] "might be Michael's androgynous twin in the sweep of her arm, the accusatory glare in her eyes, the collapsing diagonals of her dancing".|$|E

[...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility.

2500|$|Baruch Spinoza {{offers a}} pantheist view of God. In his thought, God is {{everything}} <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> God. Thus, {{there can be}} conceived no substance but God.
