40|$|This thesis aims {{to explain}} the changes in German policy {{on the use of}} force the last ten years. As of October 2008 the Bundeswehr participated with 7. 200 {{soldiers}} in nine operations outside German territory. Varying both in intensity and mandate they range from blue helmet operations in Lebanon and Sudan, to EU operations on the Western Balkans and NATO operations in Afghanistan (BMVG, 2008). This is a scenario unconceivable across the political spectrum at the time of German unification, even unconstitutional until a landmark Federal Constitutional Court ruling in 1994. Undisputable, German policy on the use of force has changed profoundly. By relating these changes to regional dynamics, I examine the relations between Germany s legacy of the past and a new European security reality, or put more conceptually, I situate my analysis within the thematic framework of the relationship between European integration, security policy, and nation state identity. The more specific aim is to discuss how, and to what extent, the development of a European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) has influenced German policy on the use of force, in the period 1998 2007. While the focus is one of domestic change as a response to European level developments, I do not presuppose a view of nation states as passive <b>adaptators.</b> Rather contrary, German domestic factors are considered crucial. I further take other external factors into account, most importantly the role of NATO and critical junctures in the international system. In order to give a sound answer to the research question I apply a theory-rich model of Europeanisation, encompassing both rationalist and constructivist contributions. Together with the chosen methodology it is considered to enable an analysis of the extent and nature of the EUs influence. The argument presented is that the EU has been influential, and increasingly so, but that much of the change in the period are due to other factors. Europeanisation should be largely understood as one of strategic adaptation. After some time challenges towards German security identity can to a certain extent also be witnessed, whereas these concepts carry more weight in explaining why the effects of the EU have been limited...|$|R
50|$|Paracingulin plays also {{a role in}} {{the initial}} phase of {{junction}} assembly. Indeed, its depletion in the experimental model of “calcium switch”, which allows the study of Calcium-dependant junction formation, causes delayed tight junction assembly, correlating with a decrease in the Rac1 GTPase activity. The rod domain of the protein is critically involved in this Rac1-dependent regulation of junction assembly, as its overexpression mimicks the effect of paracingulin depletion; by the way, this also suggests that the head domain somehow prevents its action within the full-length protein. The phenotype can be rescued by an increase in Rac1 activity driven by overexpression of the GEF Tiam1, but not by increased RhoA activity. Indeed, paracingulin can interact with and thus recruit Tiam1 to the junction, allowing the local activation of Rac1 Both paracingulin depletion and overexpression experiments also led to the conclusion that it also interacts with and recruits SH3BP1, which is an inactivator of the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 involved in epithelial junction formation in association with the filamentous actin-capping protein CapZ, by controlling actin-driven membrane remodeling. Paracingulin thus really acts as an <b>adaptator</b> for Rho GTPase regulators at the apical junctional region, and possibly at other cellular sites, because of its extra-junctional localization. In addition, cingulin and paracingulin have similar dynamics, partially overlapping subcellular localizations, and distinct interactions with the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons.|$|E

40|$|Activation of the NF-kB pathway by the TNF-receptor Edar (Ectodysplasin receptor) and its {{downstream}} <b>adaptator</b> Edaradd (Edar-associated death domain) {{is essential}} for the development of hair follicles, teeth, exocrine glands and other ectodermal derivatives. Dysfunction of Edar signalling causes hypohidrotic/ anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (ED), a disorder characterized by sparse hair, lack of sweat glands and malformation of teeth. The Edar signalling pathway stimulates NF-kB transcription factors via an activation of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex. To gain further insight into the mechanism of IKK activation by Edar and Edaradd, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and isolated TAB 2 (TAK 1 -binding protein 2) as a binding partner of Edaradd. TAB 2 is an <b>adaptator</b> protein that brigdes TRAF 6 (TNF-receptor-associated factor 6) to TAK 1 (TGFb-activated kinase 1), allowing TAK 1 activation and subsequent IKK activation. Here, we show that endogenous and overexpressed TAB 2, TRAF 6 and TAK 1 co-immunoprecipitated with Edaradd in 293 cells. Moreover, we show that dominant negative forms of TAB 2, TRAF 6 and TAK 1 blocked the NF-kB activation induced by Edaradd. These results support the involvement of the TAB 2 /TRAF 6 /TAK 1 signalling complex in the Edar signal transduction pathway and have important implications for our understanding of NF-kB activation and EDs in human...|$|E

To {{have a better understanding of}} Nectin-based cell junctions, we looked for some new Nectins’ partners. We demonstrate that the scaffold molecule PICK- 1, involved in the clustering of junctional receptors in synaptic junctions, interacts directly with Nectins in a PSD- 95 /Dlg/ZO- 1 domain-dependent manner and is localised at adherens junctions in epithelial cells. Finally, we observed that protein interacting with C-kinase- 1 (PICK- 1) also interacts directly with the junctional adhesion molecules, and we suggest that PICK- 1 could be involved in the regulation of both adherens and tight junctions in epithelial cells...|$|E

Activation of an inducible form of Raf- 1 (Raf- 1 :ER) in HEK 293 cells induced massive apoptosis characterized by DNA degradation, loss of plasma membrane integrity and PARP cleavage. Cell death required MEK activity and protein synthesis and occurred via the death receptor pathway independently of the mitochondrial pathway. Accordingly, prolonged ERK stimulation activated caspase 8 and strongly potentiated Fas signaling. The death receptor <b>adaptator</b> FADD {{was found to be}} rapidly induced upon ERK activation. However using RNA interference and ectopic expression, we demonstrated that neither FADD nor Fas were necessary for caspase 8 activation and cell death.

It is now accepted that leptin is the afferent loop informing the hypothalamus {{about the state of}} fat stores, with hypothalamic efferents regulating appetite and energy expenditure. In addition, leptin has a role as a metabolic <b>adaptator</b> in overweight and fasting states. New and previously unsuspected neuroendocrine roles have emerged for leptin. In reproduction, leptin is implicated in fertility regulation, and it is a permissive factor for puberty. Relevant gender-based differences in leptin levels exist, with higher levels in women at birth, which persist throughout life. In adult life, there is experimental evidence that leptin is a permissive factor for the ovarian cycle, with a regulatory role exerted at the hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal levels, and with unexplained changes in pregnancy and postpartum. Leptin is present in human milk and {{may play a role in}} the adaptive responses of the newborn.

In B cells, coaggregation of the B cell receptor (BCR) and FcγRIIB {{leads to an}} inhibition of B cell activation. Inhibitory properties of FcγRIIB have been related to the recruitment of SHIP, an SH 2 domain-containing inositol 5 -phosphatase (referred to as SHIP 1), via ITIM phosphorylated FcγRIIB. Here, we demonstrate that the second SH 2 domain-containing inositol 5 -phosphatase SHIP 2 could also bind to the FcγRIIB ITIM. As a model, a FcγRIIB deficient B cell line (IIA 1. 6), transfected with a cDNA encoding either w. t. FcγRIIB 1 ' or FcγRIIB 1 ' whose ITIM tyrosine was mutated has been used. SHIP 2 tyrosine phosphorylation and association to the <b>adaptator</b> protein Shc were only found in transfectants expressing w. t. FcγRIIB 1 '.

Herein, this study aimed at assessing the anticancer properties of compounds inhibiting FZD 7 activity by disrupting its binding with the cytosolic Dishevelled (DVL) <b>adaptator.</b> METHODS: We have designed small interfering peptides (RHPDs) {{that are able to}} enter within cells and to competitively antagonize the binding of FZD 7 to the PDZ domain of DVL. Their anti-neoplastic properties were assessed in vitro on a panel of human HCC cell lines and in vivo on the SV 40 -TAg transgenic mouse model of HCC. RESULTS: We have shown that RHPDs decrease cell viability via apoptosis depending on their affinity for PDZ, with a therapeutic index between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. RHPD properties were linked to β-catenin degradation and PKCδ activation. In transgenic mice, intra-tumor injection of RHPDs inhibited HCC progression. CONCLUSIONS: We have completed a proof-of-concept showing that in vitro and in vivo the pharmacological inhibition of FZD 7 displays anti-cancerous properties against HCC. The mechanisms can involve β-catenin and PKCδ modulations. Further studies are warranted to design protocols showing the compatibility with systemic in vivo applications...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWeibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) are {{specific}} cigar-shaped granules that store von Willebrand factor (VWF) for its regulated secretion by endothelial cells. The first {{steps of the}} formation of these granules at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) specifically require VWF aggregation and an external scaffolding complex that contains the <b>adaptator</b> protein complex 1 (AP- 1) and clathrin. Discs large 1 (Dlg 1) is generally considered to be a modular scaffolding protein implicated in the control of cell polarity in a large variety of cells by specific recruiting of receptors, channels or signaling proteins to specialized zones of the plasma membrane. We propose here that in endothelial cells, Dlg 1 in a complex with AP- 1 and clathrin participates in the biogenesis of WPBs. Supporting data show that Dlg 1 colocalizes with microtubules, intermediate filaments and Golgi markers. Tandem mass spectrometry experiments led to the identification of clathrin as a Dlg 1 -interacting partner, interaction was confirmed by in situ proximity ligation assays. Furthermore, AP- 1 and VWF immunoprecipitate and colocalize with Dlg 1 in the juxta-nuclear zone. Finally, Dlg 1 depletion by siRNA duplexes disrupts TGN morphology and WPB formation. Our results provide the first evidence for an unexpected role of Dlg 1 in controlling the formation of specific secretory granules involved in VWF exocytosis in endothelial cells...|$|E

The TLR <b>adaptator</b> myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD 88) has been implicated in the Th 1 immune response associated with the resistant phenotype observed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice after infection with L. major. To investigate whether the MyD 88 pathway is differentially used by distinct substrains of parasites, MyD 88 (-/-) C 57 BL/ 6 mice were infected with two substrains of L. major, namely L. major LV 39 and L. major IR 75. MyD 88 (-/-) mice were susceptible to both substrains of L. major, although with different kinetics of infection. The mechanisms involved during the immune response associated with susceptibility of MyD 88 (-/-) mice to L. major is however, parasite substrain-dependent. Susceptibility of MyD 88 (-/-) mice infected with L. major IR 75 is a consequence of Th 2 immune-deviation, whereas susceptibility of MyD 88 (-/-) mice to infection with L. major LV 39 resulted from an impaired Th 1 response. Depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) partially restored IFN-gamma secretion and the Th 1 immune response in MyD 88 (-/-) mice infected with L. major LV 39, demonstrating a role of Treg activity in the development of an impaired Th 1 response in these mice...|$|E

We have previously shown that acrolein is a highly reactive and neurotoxic aldehyde and its toxicity involves the alteration of several redox-sensitive pathways. Recently, protein-conjugated acrolein in cerebrospinal fluid has been proposed as a biomarker to distinguish between MCI and AD. With growing evidence of the early involvement of oxidative stress in AD etiology, {{one would expect that}} a successful therapy should prevent brain oxidative damage. In this regard, several studies have demonstrated that polyphenol-rich extracts exert beneficial effect on {{cognitive impairment}} and oxidative stress. We have recently demonstrated the efficacy of an anthocyanin formulation (MAF 14001) against amyloid-β-induced oxidative stress. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the neuroprotective effect of MAF 14001 as a mixture of anthocyanins, a particular class of polyphenols, against acrolein-induced oxidative damage in SK-N-SH neuronal cells. Our results demonstrated that MAF 14001, from 5 μM, was able to efficiently protect SK-N-SH cells against acrolein-induced cell death. MAF 14001 was able to lower reactive oxygen species and protein carbonyl levels induced by acrolein. Moreover, MAF 1401 prevented glutathione depletion and positively modulated, in the presence of acrolein, some oxidative stress-sensitive pathways including the transcription factors NF-κB and Nrf 2, the proteins γ-GCS and GSK 3 β, and the protein <b>adaptator</b> p 66 Shc. Along with its proven protective effect against amyloid-β toxicity, these results demonstrate that MAF 14001 could target multiple mechanisms and could be a promising agent for AD prevention...|$|E

Industrial chicory, an important crop from northwestern Europe, accumulates an original combination of such compounds i. e. chlorogenic, isochlorogenic, caftaric and chicoric acids {{arising from the}} phenylpropanoid pathway. For a complete understanding of these biochemical pathways, analyses of gene expression using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) should be considered. Because cell cultures are a model of choice for secondary metabolism investigations, this study described {{for the first time}} the validation of reference genes for this system in chicory. Eighteen potential reference genes were obtained by mining expressed sequence tag databases of chicory for orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana genes currently used as reference genes. Twelve genes passed the qRT-PCR standard requirements and their expression stability across different samples was tested using three distinct softwares: geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. In cell cultures grown under various conditions, TIP 41 (TIP 41 like protein) was shown to be the most stable gene. Further validation of the proposed reference genes was done by normalization of expression levels of a group of genes of interest. In order to assess the potentiality of the proposed list of candidate reference genes, theses genes were in parallel tested on another experimental design i. e. chicory seedlings. In this case, the best reference gene identified was Clath (Clathrin <b>adaptator</b> complex subunit). The results highlight the importance of the use of properly validated reference genes to achieve relevant interpretation of qRT-PCR analyses.

40|$|Cell {{membranes}} contain sphingolipids and cholesterol, which cluster {{together in}} distinct domains called rafts. The outer-membrane leaflet of these peculiar membrane domains contains glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, while the inner leaflet contains proteins implicated in signalling, {{such as the}} acylated protein kinase p 56 (lck) and the palmitoylated <b>adaptator</b> LAT (linker for activation of T-cells). We present here an approach to study the lipid composition of rafts and its change upon T-cell activation. Our method is based on metabolic labelling of Jurkat T-cells with different precursors of glycerophospholipid synthesis, including glycerol and fatty acids with different lengths and degrees of saturation as well as phospholipid polar head groups. The results obtained indicate that lipid rafts isolated {{by the use of}} sucrose density-gradient centrifugation after Triton X- 100 extraction in the cold, besides sphingolipids and cholesterol, contain unambiguously all classes of glycerophospholipids: phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. Fatty acid labelling shows that lipid rafts are labelled preferentially with saturated fatty acids {{while the rest of the}} plasma membrane incorporates mostly long-chained polyunsaturated fatty acids. To see whether the raft composition as measured by metabolic labelling of phospholipids is involved in T-cell activation, we investigated the production of sn- 1, 2 -diacylglycerol (DAG) in CD 3 -activated cells. DAG production occurs within rafts, confirming previous demonstration of protein kinase C translocation into membrane microdomains. Our data demonstrate that raft disorganization by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin impairs both CD 3 -induced DAG production and changes in cytosolic Ca(2 +) concentration. These lines of evidence support the conclusion that the major events in T-cell activation occur within or due to lipid rafts...|$|E
40|$|Host {{resistance}} to the intracellular protozoan Leishmania major is highly dependent on IL- 12 production by APCs. Genetically resistant C 57 BL/ 6 mice develop IL- 12 -mediated Th 1 immune response dominated by IFN-gamma and exhibit only small cutaneous lesions that resolve spontaneously. In contrast, because of several genetic differences, BALB/c mice develop an IL- 4 -mediated Th 2 immune response and a chronic mutilating disease. Myeloid differentiation marker 88 (MyD 88) is an <b>adaptator</b> protein that links the IL- 1 /Toll-like receptor family to IL- 1 R-associated protein kinase. Toll-like receptors recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns and are crucially implicated in the induction of IL- 12 secretion by APC. The role of MyD 88 protein {{in the development of}} protective immune response against parasites is largely unknown. Following inoculation of L. major, MyD 88 (-/-) C 57 BL/ 6 mice presented large footpad lesions containing numerous infected cells and frequent mutilations. In response to soluble Leishmania Ag, cells from lesion-draining lymph node showed a typical Th 2 profile, similar to infected BALB/c mice. IL- 12 p 40 plasma level collapses in infected MyD 88 (-/-) mice compared with infected wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Importantly, administration of exogenous IL- 12 rescues L. major-infected MyD 88 (-/-) mice, demonstrating that the susceptibility of these mice is a direct consequence of IL- 12 deficiency. In conclusion, MyD 88 -dependent pathways appear essential {{for the development of the}} protective IL- 12 -mediated Th 1 response against the Leishmania major parasite. In absence of MyD 88 protein, infected mice develop a nonprotective Th 2 response. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Oriented {{migration}} {{is the basis}} of major cellular functions such as developmental morphogenesis, tissue repair and tumor metastasis. During cell migration, microtubules are temporarily captured and stabilized near the actin enriched leading by plus end tracking proteins (+TIPs) such as EB 1 and CLASP 2. As a result, proper cell orientation and vesicle transport to the extending cellular edge is ensured. MTs are constantly switching between phases of polymerization and depolymerization, known as dynamic instability. Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 2 (CRMP 2), is a cytosolic phosphoprotein that transports tubulin dimers to the growing +TIP of a MT and contribute the elongation of the tubulin filaments. CRMP 2 affinity for tubulin diminishes through its phosphorylation by several protein kinases such as Cdk 5 and GSK- 3 bwhich phosphorylates CRMP 2 on Ser 522 and Thr 509, Thr 514 and Ser 518 respectively. Other less frequent CRMP 2 phosphorylation events involve the residue Thr 555, which are targets of ROCK kinase. In this work, we specifically address the involvement of CRMP 2 during cell migration and adhesion using as a model the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A 549. We demonstrated that CRMP 2 co-localizes strongly with the microtubules in the lamella of migrating cells in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed that aberrant CRMP 2 phosphorylation affect tubulin polymerization rate and stability and how these processes modify the capture of microtubules in the membrane. We demonstrated {{for the first time that}} CRMP 2 is distributed in the plus end of the microtubules where interact with the protein EB 1, which regulates microtubule dinamycs. Likewise, we have described that CRMP 2 contributed in the anchoring of the microbules with the actin cytoskeleton through its interaction with the <b>adaptator</b> protein IQGAP 1. The aberrant CRMP 2 phosphorylation affected to these processes and reduced the adherence to different extracellular proteins matrix, especially over collagen. CRMP 2 has been reported that regulate traffic of recycling vesicles by its interaction with motor proteins in neurons. We have demonstrated that CRMP 2 interact with b 1 integrin in lung adenocarcinoma cells during its endocitosis and how the overexpression of phosphorylation mimetic mutants of CRMP 2 reduced the percentage of recycled b 1 integrin. These deficiencies in b 1 integrin recycling are correlated with less ability of migration in these mutants towards chemotactic gradients. In fact, these mutants showed a lower velocity and directness in their trajectories compared to control cells. Importantly, we observed that overexpression of phosphorylation mimetic mutants of CRMP 2 in Ser 522 switched from a filopodia driven cell migration to amoeboid movement in 3 D migration assays. In short, here and for the first time, we show CRMP 2 dynamic binding to tubulin during cell migration and demonstrate that altered phosphorylation of CRMP 2 affects MT polymerization in the front lamella and cell movement...|$|E
