Zambia, Malawi, Uganda and Tanzania achieved independence in the post-colonial era. This period also saw the break down of the Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland {{as well as the}} East African High Commission. Balkanization was a result of the movement towards a closed economy. Countries were adopting <b>antitrade</b> and anti-market policies. Tariff rates were 15% higher than OECD countries during the 1970s and 1980s. Furthermore, countries took approaches to subsidize their own local industries yet the market within the country was small-scale. Transport networks were fragmented; regulations on labor and capital flow were more regulated; prices were under control. Between 1960 and 1990, balkanization led to disastrous results. The GDP of these regions were 1/10 of OECD countries. Balkanization also resulted in what van de Valle called [...] "typically fairly overvalued exchanged rates" [...] in Africa. Balkanization contributed to what Bates, Chatsworth & Williamson claimed to be a lost decade in Africa.|$|E

Because the two tax systems may create quite different strategic incentives for the countries, the authors compare the equilibria in the tax-setting game played by the two countries under each system. They find that the tax credits system introduces an <b>antitrade</b> bias into the equilibrium, contrary to initial impressions, and that both capital exporting and capital importing countries will prefer the tax-deductions scheme to tax credits.

Australia's lacklustre economic growth performance {{in the first four}} decades following World War II was in part due to an <b>antitrade,</b> antiprimary sector bias in government assistance policies. This paper provides new annual estimates of the extent of those biases since 1946 and their gradual phase-out during the past two decades. In doing so it reveals that the timing of the sectoral assistance cuts was such as sometimes to improve but sometimes to worsen the distortions to incentives faced by farmers. Also, the changes increased the variation of assistance rates within agriculture during the 1950 s and 1960 s, reducing the welfare contribution of those programmes in that period. While the assistance pattern within agriculture appears not to have been strongly biased against exporters, its reform has coincided with a substantial increase in export orientation of many farm industries. The overall pattern for Australia is contrasted with that revealed by comparable new estimates for other high-income countries. Kym Anderson, Peter Lloyd and Donald MacLare...|$|E
40|$|Are {{most voters}} opposed to globalization? A {{growing body of}} {{empirical}} research, using data from available surveys of public opinion, suggests that antiglobalization sentiments are strong, especially among blue-collar workers. This article reports the findings from a survey experiment aimed at measuring the impact of issue framing on individuals stated attitudes toward international trade. Respondents given an <b>antitrade</b> introduction to the survey question, linking trade {{to the possibility of}} job losses, were 17 percent less likely to favor increasing trade with other countries than were those asked the same question without any introduction at all. Curiously, respondents who were given a protrade introduction to the question, suggesting that trade can lead to lower prices for consumers, were not more likely to express support for trade than those who received no introduction. In addition, the responses of less educated individuals were more sensitive to framing effects than those of highly educated individuals. Without measuring and taking these types of framing effects into account, opinion surveys offer unreliable guides to gauging the extent (and distribution) of opposition to trade among voters. Results from a second experiment reveal that knowledge of the endorsement of trade openness by economists mitigates framing effects and raises overall support for trade liberalization by a substantial degree.

40|$|The vehement {{defense of}} the African slave trade by Georgia and South Carolina in United States Congress during the trade's constitutionally {{protected}} period cannot be fully explained by a Lower South planter concern {{for the security of}} slavery. Honor and state character were critical considerations in shaping the arguments raised by Lower South representatives in defense of African importation. Accordingly, the debates were as much about honor and character as they were protection of slavery. Because of importation, <b>antitrade</b> congressmen attacked the Lower South's character as inconsistent with purported American ideals and republican values. Georgia and South Carolina representatives struggled to reconcile the trade with honorable conduct and the evolving American character by crafting constructions of republicanism, the United States Constitution, and American character that protected state reputation within the national community embodied by the Congress. The Lower South's proffered interpretations of republicanism, the Constitution, and American character sought to minimize the trade as an appropriate standard by which to judge South Carolina and Georgia. The trade was consistent with republican values as access to slaves was the only means by which the two states could develop their economies and thus gain sufficient economic independence to maintain their equality with the other states. Moreover, this productivity benefited the young nation as a whole through the export of its slave-based agricultural products to world markets. Lower South representatives argued that the region could not be disparaged morally for importation as the Constitution guaranteed that privilege. They saw anti-trade forces' attacks on moral grounds as an attempt to invest the Constitution with moral standards external to that document which were inappropriate to judging a member of the union by the federal government or other states. The rights provided by the Constitution were the only ones by which the region could be judged with regard. Georgia and South Carolina possessed an American character in spite of slave importation. Each had participated in the American Revolution and otherwise contributed to the country's well-being. Lower South representatives focused on patriotism and loyalty as the fundamental criteria by which the region should be judged...|$|E
40|$|Mo och Domsjö AB and Labour Organisations {{prior to}} 1940. Frans Kempe’s Labour Policy and the Domsjö Local Labour Union. Dissertation for the Licentiate of Philosophy at the University of Uppsala. Department of Economic History. In 1899 Frans Kempe, the {{director}} of Mo and Domsjö AB, put forward a suggestion as to how employers should meet the rising trade union movement within the forest industry. The aim of the proposals was to counteract trade unions and socialism {{as well as to}} avoid future labour conflicts. The dissertation covers the years 1898 - 1939. A short review is made of the years 1880 - 1897. The focus area is of the period prior to 1931. The aims and methods of the proposals are studied as well as the relationships between the Company and the labour organisations at the company’s plants especially the saw-mill in Domsjö and the pulp mills in Domsjö (Alfredshem) and Husum. The local labour union in Domsjö receives special attention. The development at the company’s plants is seen in the perspective of Kempe’s proposals. Other starting points are patriarchal terms in modern research and the trade union movements general march forward. The studies are interesting because the Company advocated “Gelbe Gewerkschaften - company unions” and in fact succeeded in establishing a few unions of that kind. The local labour union at Domsjö sawmill gradually came to take on a trade union-like character. Mo och Domsjö had established by the year 1882 a pension scheme at Domsjö sawmill based on the county governor Curry Treffenberg’s proposals for reform. Patriarchalism was otherwise limited in scope, aims and character up to 1898 afler which it was intensified. It was under the period 1898 - 1902 farreaching and planned. Frans Kempe’s labour policy was in agreement with the ideology of patriarchal welfarism. His proposals and actions can partially be interpreted {{as a result of the}} following things: a liberal ideology, a kind attitude towards workers and influence from the then present proposals in the social program at Höganäs. His proposals and actions are also influenced by Kempe’s despotic personal character. Kempe’s proposals and relationships within those plants being studied here are seen in a greater trade union perspective, comparisons were for example made between conditions in Västernorrland and conditions in the Örnsköldsvik area. Kempe’s proposals were very critically received by workers and newspapers in Västernorrland. His infringement of the workers right to organize themselves was especially disliked. As a result of this dissertation 10 local unions following Kempe’s regulations were discovered. His ideas were the basis for the lockout in Sundsvall 1899 and the struggle for the right to organize. Five local labour organizations existed for more then ten years. Three of them within the Örnsköldsvik area and two in southern Västerbotten. The larger companies instead joined the employers organisations in order to strengthen their position so as to negotiate with the trade unions. The proposal’s degree of sucess within Mo and Domsjö AB was good prior to 1918 - 1919. The trade unions established at Domsjö sawmill 1930 and at Alfredshem 1919 were quite late in a Västernorrland perspective. There were no open labour conflicts at Domsjö sawmill and at the pulp factories conflicts were extremely rare. The methods that were used were a ban on trade unions, dismissal or threat of dismissal and local labour unions. Another method of the <b>antitrade</b> union policy was the pension scheme. The methods used however did not include benefits in kind and housing benefits. These have been of the same character and size as within other sawmill industries. They have been appreciated during this time by workers at Domsjö and the local labour union guarded their interests. The Domsjö local labour union was in existence 1902 - 1939, which is unusually long for that type of organization. Studies show that wage levels were unusually high at the sawmill in Domsjö...|$|E
40|$|The omnipresent dematiaceous hyphomycete genus Alternaria is {{associated}} {{with a wide variety of}} substrates including seeds, plants, agricultural products, humans, soil and even the atmosphere. It includes saprophytic, endophytic and pathogenic species, among which multiple plant pathogens, post-harvest pathogens, and human pathogens (causative agents of phaeohyphomycosis and hypersensitivity reactions). Molecular studies reveal that the Alternaria complex comprises nine genera. Within this complex several genera are non-monophyletic and Alternaria species cluster into multiple distinct species clades, which are not always correlated with species-groups based on morphological characteristics. The most commonly reported species in literature and type species of the genus Alternaria, A. alternata, also comprises one such species-group. The small-spored Alternaria species within this group are mainly described based on morphology and / or host-specificity, but are difficult to distinguish based on molecular techniques alone. As A. alternata is considered as one of the most prolific producers of fungal allergens and is reported as pathogen on over 100 host plants, correct species identification is of utmost importance. The research presented in this thesis discusses the taxonomic status of Alternaria and its related genera, with a further focus on the two biggest and most important species complexes; the large-spored A. porri and small-spored A. alternata species complexes. With the phylogenies and classifications presented in this thesis, more robust and understandable taxonomy and nomenclature in Alternaria and allied genera within the Alternaria complex are created. Chapter 1 gives a general introduction to the genus Alternaria and related genera. The history of the genus and its economic importance as plant pathogen, post-harvest pathogen, causative agent of phaeohyphomycosis and common allergen causing hypersensitivity reactions are summarized. The introduction of the morphological species complexes, based on characters of the conidia, the pattern of chain formation, and the nature of the apical extensions of conidia are treated. Molecular studies recognise seven Alternaria species-groups within the Alternaria complex. Besides Alternaria, eight other genera are assigned to the Alternaria complex based on molecular and morphological studies. Chapter 2 focusses on the relationship of Alternaria and its closely related genera within the broader Alternaria complex. The phylogenetic lineages within the Alternaria complex are delineated based on nucleotide sequence data of parts of the 18 S nrDNA (SSU), 28 S nrDNA (LSU), the internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 and intervening 5. 8 S nrDNA (ITS), glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), RNA polymerase second largest subunit (RPB 2) and translation elongation factor 1 -alpha (TEF 1) gene regions. The phylogenetic data reveal a Stemphylium clade sister to Embellisia annulata and a big Alternaria clade. The Alternaria clade contains six monotypic lineages and 24 internal clades, which are treated as sections of Alternaria. In order to create a stable phylogenetic taxonomy, and supported by i) a well-supported phylogenetic node in multiple analyses, ii) a high-similarity of clades within Alternaria based on SSU, LSU and ITS data, and iii) variation in the clade order between the different gene phylogenies, 13 genera are placed into synonymy with Alternaria. Embellisia annulata is synonymized with Dendryphiella salina, and together with D. arenariae placed in the new genus Paradendryphiella. The sexual genera Clathrospora and Comoclathris, with asexual forms linked to Alternaria, cluster within the Pleosporaceae, as does Alternaria, but outside Alternaria s. str. The genus Alternariaster, described to accommodate Alternaria helianthi, clusters within the Leptosphaeriaceae. Chapter 3 describes the reappraisal of the genus Alternariaster. Alternaria helianthi, the causal agent of leaf spot on Helianthus annuus (sunflower) was segregated from Alternaria based on conidial morphology, and placed in the new genus Alternariaster. A multi-gene phylogeny of parts of the ITS, LSU, RPB 2 and GAPDH gene regions placed a fungal pathogen associated with leaf spot on Bidens sulphurea (yellow cosmos) in Brazil in close relation with Al. helianthi. Based on the close phylogenetic relation to Al. helianthi, but distinct morphological and pathogenicity characters, the fungal pathogen associated with leaf spot on B. sulphurea is newly described as Al. bidentis. Chapter 4 treats the Alternaria species which form the largest section of Alternaria, sect. Porri. This section contains almost all Alternaria species with medium to large conidia with long beaks, some of which are important plant pathogens. A multi-gene phylogeny on parts of the ITS, GAPDH, RPB 2, TEF 1 and Alternaria major allergen (Alt a 1) gene regions, supplemented with morphological and cultural studies, forms the basis for species recognition in this section. The polyphasic data reveal 63 species in sect. Porri, of which 10 are newly described, and 27 names are synonymized. Chapter 5 treats the small-spored Alternaria species, which reside in sect. Alternaria. A lot of confusion around the naming of species within this section exists, since the naming is mostly based on morphology and host-specificity, although the molecular variation is minimal. Whole genome sequencing, combined with transcriptome profiling and multi-gene sequencing of nine gene regions, SSU, LSU, ITS, GAPDH, RPB 2, TEF 1, Alt a 1, endopolygalacturonase (endoPG) and an anonymous gene region (OPA 10 - 2), is used to create a clear and stable species classification in this section. The nine sequenced Alternaria genomes range in size from 32. 0 - 39. 1 Mb. The number of repetitive sequences varies significantly, with a relative low percentage of repeats within sect. Alternaria. The genome identity within sect. Alternaria is high, compared to the genome identity for isolates from other sections to the A. alternata reference genome. Similarly, a relative low percentage of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed in genomic and transcriptomic sequences between isolates from sect. Alternaria, compared to the percentage of SNP’s found in isolates from different sections compared to the A. alternata reference genome. A set of core proteins was extracted from the genome and transcriptome data, and primers were designed on two eukaryotic orthologous group (KOG) protein loci with a relatively low degree of conservation within section Alternaria. The phylogenies from these two gene regions, KOG 1058 and KOG 1077, could not distinguish the described morphospecies within sect. Alternaria better than the phylogenies based on the nine commonly used gene regions for Alternaria. Based on genome and transcriptome comparisons and molecular phylogenies, Alternaria sect. Alternaria consists of only 11 phylogenetic species and one species complex. Thirty-five morphospecies are synonymized under A. alternata. The subclades that are formed by these isolates are incongruent between the different gene regions sequenced; no two genes show the same groupings for any of the over 100 isolates. A sequence-based identification guide is provided for the species which are now recognized in sect. Alternaria. None of the genes sequenced in this study can distinguish all of the species recognized here on its own. Chapter 6 investigates the molecular diversity of indoor Alternaria isolates in the USA, with the help of a phylogeographic / population genetic approach. Isolates collected throughout the USA were identified using ITS, GAPDH and endoPG gene sequencing, followed by genotyping and population genetic inference of the sect. Alternaria isolates and 37 reference isolates, using five microsatellite markers. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that 98 % (153 isolates) of the indoor isolates consisted of species from Alternaria sect. Alternaria. The remaining 2 % (three isolates) represented one sect. Infectoriae and two sect. Pseudoulocladium isolates. From the 153 isolates that belonged to sect. Alternaria, one could be assigned to A. burnsii, 15 to the A. arborescens species complex and the remaining 137 isolates were identified as A. alternata. Based on the microsatellite data, no specific indoor population could be distinguished. Population assignment analyses of the A. alternata isolates suggested that subpopulations did not exist within the sample, which we thus divided into four artificial subpopulations to represent four quadrants of the USA. Genotypic diversity was extremely high for all quadrants and a test for linkage disequilibrium suggested that A. alternata has a cryptic sexual cycle. The SouthWest-USA population displayed the highest level of uniqueness, based on private alleles. Intriguingly, the highest amount of gene flow, between SouthWest-USA and SouthEast-USA, correlated with the west-to-east movement of the <b>antitrade</b> winds. This suggests that indoor A. alternata isolates, although extremely diverse, have a continental distribution and high levels of gene flow over the continent. Chapter 7 discusses the data presented in this thesis. The implications of the performed studies are placed in a broader context, with a focus on the relation between morphology and the new species classification based on molecular tools and the use of genome data in contrast to multi-gene data...|$|E
