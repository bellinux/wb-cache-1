5|$|On 22 October the 18th (Eastern) Division of XVIII Corps {{attacked}} {{the east end}} of Polecappelle as XIV Corps to the north attacked with the 34th Division between the Watervlietbeek and Broenbeek streams and the 35th Division attacked northwards into Houthulst Forest. (The 35th Division was supported by a regiment of the French 1st Division on the left flank.) The attack was intended to push forward the left flank of the Fifth Army, to guard against a German counter-attack on the flank of the Canadian Corps, when it attacked Passchendaele. The artillery of the Second and Fifth armies conducted a bombardment to simulate a general attack as a deception. Poelcappelle was captured but the attack at the junction between the 34th and 35th divisions was repulsed. German counter-attacks pushed back the 35th Division in the centre but the French captured all their objectives. Attacking on ground cut up by bombardments <b>and</b> <b>soaked</b> by rain, the British had struggled to advance in places and lost the ability to move quickly to outflank pillboxes. The 35th Division infantry reached the fringes of Houthulst Forest but were pushed back in places after being outflanked in turn. German counter-attacks after 22 October, had an equal disadvantage and were costly failures. The German 4th Army was prevented from transferring troops away from the Fifth Army and from concentrating its artillery-fire on the Canadians as they prepared for the Second Battle of Passchendaele (26 October – 10 November 1917).|$|E

The aims of this {{research was}} to know the protein content, fat content, water content and ash content. This research was based on Completely Randomized Design with factorial pattern (two factors) with two repetitions. The first factor was the concentration of betle leaf juice (0 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 %) and the second factor was the soaking duration (0, 5, 15 and 15 hours). The results showed that increasing betle leaf juice <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> duration gave very significant effect (P< 0, 01) to increase protein content, to lower fat content and water content but no significant effect on ash content.

40|$|The {{effects of}} noncovalent bonding and {{mechanical}} interlocking of carbon nanotubes (CNT) coating on tensile and interfacial strength of glass fiber were investigated. CNT were coated over glass fiber {{by a simple}} dip coating method. Acid treated CNT were suspended in isopropanol solution containing Nafion as binding agent. To achieve uniform distribution of CNT over the glass fiber, an optimized dispersion process was developed by two parameters: CNT concentration <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time. CNT concentration was varied from 0. 4 to 2 [*]mg/mL <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time was varied from 1 to 180 [*]min. The provided micrographs demonstrated appropriate coating of CNT on glass fiber by use of CNT-Nafion mixture. The effects of CNT concentration <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time on coating layer were studied by performing single fiber tensile test and pull-out test. The obtained {{results showed that the}} optimum CNT concentration <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time were 1 [*]mg/mL and 60 [*]min, respectively, which led to significant improvement of tensile strength and interfacial shear stress. It was found that, at other concentrations <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> times, CNT agglomeration or acutely curly tubes appeared over the fiber surface which caused a reduction of nanotubes interaction on the glass fiber...|$|R
25|$|After {{the period}} of {{unsettled}} but drier weather in September, heavy rain began again on 4 October and affected {{the remainder of the}} campaign, working more to the advantage of the German defenders, being pushed back on to far less damaged ground. The British had to move their artillery forward into the area devastated by shellfire <b>and</b> <b>soaked</b> by the return of heavy rain, restricting the routes on which guns and ammunition could be moved, which presented German artillery with easier targets. In the next British attack on 9 October, after several days of rain, the German defence achieved a costly success, holding the approaches to Passchendaele village, which was the most tactically vital ground.|$|E
25|$|The Reds {{were aware}} of the {{oncoming}} offensive. For example, the newspaper Työmies wrote a day before how the Whites had gathered their troops in the Länkipohja area. In the night before the battle, a large number of civilians fled the village. The Reds had built their main defensive line to the Hirsikangas Hill, two kilometres north of Länkipohja. They had brought down a large number of trees, then piled the cut logs on the both sides of the road <b>and</b> <b>soaked</b> them with water. In the below zero temperature, the stacks of wood were now covered by thick ice. The structure extended more than 50 meters {{on both sides of the}} road. As the trees in the slopes were cut, the attacking Whites had to cross a wide open ground covered in deep snow.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{method of}} {{deployment}} of Greek fire, which sets it apart from similar substances, was its projection through a tube (siphōn), for use aboard ships or in sieges. Portable projectors (cheirosiphōnes) were also invented, reputedly by Emperor Leo VI. The Byzantine military manuals also mention that jars (chytrai or tzykalia) filled with Greek fire and caltrops wrapped with tow <b>and</b> <b>soaked</b> in the substance were thrown by catapults, while pivoting cranes (gerania) {{were employed to}} pour it upon enemy ships. The cheirosiphōnes especially were prescribed for use at land and in sieges, both against siege machines and against defenders on the walls, by several 10th-century military authors, and their use is depicted in the Poliorcetica of Hero of Byzantium. The Byzantine dromons usually had a siphōn installed on their prow under the forecastle, but additional devices could also on occasion be placed elsewhere on the ship. Thus in 941, when the Byzantines were facing the vastly more numerous Rus' fleet, siphōns were placed also amidships and even astern.|$|E

25|$|The {{staple foods}} then used by other American Indian tribes, corn and/or potatoes, would not grow without {{irrigation}} in the typically short three- to five-month wet season and nine- to seven-month dry seasons of California (see Mediterranean climate). Despite this, the natural abundance of California, {{and the environmental}} management techniques developed by California tribes over millennia, allowed for the highest population density in the Americas north of Mexico. Indians thrived by catching and eating deer, Tule elk, small game, fish, mollusks, grass seed, berries, insects, edible plants and roots, {{making it possible to}} sustain a subsistence hunter-gatherer economy without any agriculture. Without agriculture or migratory herds of animals or fish there are no known ways to support villages, towns or cities—small tribes and extended family groups are the typical hunter-gatherer grouping. A dietary staple for most Indian tribes in interior California was acorns, which were dried, shelled, ground to flour, roasted <b>and</b> <b>soaked</b> in water to leach out their tannin. The holes they ground into large rocks over centuries of use are still visible in many rocks today.|$|E

25|$|At its peak, the Ottoman Empire {{stretched}} from the Caucuses down to northern Africa {{and parts of}} the middle east. This long reach meant that many aspects of Ottoman culture, including the davul and other janissary instruments, were likely introduced {{to other parts of the}} world. In Africa, the indigenous population took the basic idea of the davul – that is, a two-headed cylindrical drum that produces a deep sound when struck – and both increased the size of the drum and changed the material from which it was made, leading to the development of the long drum. The long drum can be made a variety of different ways, but is most typically constructed from a hollowed out tree trunk. This is vastly different from the davul, which is made from a thick shell. Long drums were typically 2 meters in length and 50 centimeters in diameter, much larger than the Turkish drums on which they were based. The indigenous population also believed that the tree from which the long drum was made had to be in perfect shape. Once an appropriate tree was selected and the basic frame for the long drum was constructed, the Africans took cow hides <b>and</b> <b>soaked</b> them in boiling hot water, in order to stretch them out. Although the long drum was an improvement on the davul, both drums were nevertheless played in a similar fashion. Two distinct sticks were used on the two distinct sides of the drum itself. A notable difference between the two is that long drums, unlike davuls, were used primarily for religious purposes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fish oil was {{extracted}} from the viscera of African Catfish using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2). A Central Composite Design of Response Surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the SC-CO 2 extraction parameters. The oil yield (Y) as response variable was executed against the four independent variables, namely pressure, temperature, flow rate <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time. The oil yield varied with the linear, quadratic and interaction of pressure, temperature, flow rate <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time. Optimum points were observed within the variables of temperature from 35 °C to 80 °C, pressure from 10 MPa to 40 MPa, flow rate from 1 mL/min to 3 mL/min <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time from 1 h to 4 h.

25|$|Agrobacterium-mediated {{transformation}} {{is the easiest}} and most simple plant transformation. Plant tissue (often leaves) are cut into small pieces, e.g. 10x10mm, <b>and</b> <b>soaked</b> for 10 minutes in a fluid containing suspended Agrobacterium. The bacteria will attach {{to many of the}} plant cells exposed by the cut. The plant cells secrete wound-related phenolic compounds which in turn act to upregulate the virulence operon of the Agrobacterium. The virulence operon includes many genes that encode for proteins that are part of a Type IV secretion system that exports from the bacterium proteins and DNA (delineated by specific recognition motifs called border sequences and excised as a single strand from the virulence plasmid) into the plant cell through a structure called a pilus. The transferred DNA (called T-DNA) is piloted to the plant cell nucleus by nuclear localization signals present in the Agrobacterium protein VirD2, which is covalently attached {{to the end of the}} T-DNA at the Right border (RB). Exactly how the T-DNA is integrated into the host plant genomic DNA is an active area of plant biology research. Assuming that a selection marker (such as an antibiotic resistance gene) was included in the T-DNA, the transformed plant tissue can be cultured on selective media to produce shoots. The shoots are then transferred to a different medium to promote root formation. Once roots begin to grow from the transgenic shoot, the plants can be transferred to soil to complete a normal life cycle (make seeds). The seeds from this first plant (called the T1, for first transgenic generation) can be planted on a selective (containing an antibiotic), or if an herbicide resistance gene was used, could alternatively be planted in soil, then later treated with herbicide to kill wildtype segregants. Some plants species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana can be transformed by dipping the flowers or whole plant, into a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, typically strain C58 (C=Cherry, 58=1958, the year in which this particular strain of A. tumefaciens was isolated from a cherry tree in an orchard at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York). Though many plants remain recalcitrant to transformation by this method, research is ongoing that continues to add to the list the species that have been successfully modified in this manner.|$|E
