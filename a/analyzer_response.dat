A computer was used to evaluate parameters of the leaf CO 2 release rate to provide an estimate of the initial rate of postillumination CO 2 evolution and to produce maximal agreement between predicted and observed analyzer responses. In 21 % O 2, the decline in rate of CO 2 evolution upon darkening followed first order kinetics. Initial rates of CO 2 evolution following darkening were relatively independent of the prior ambient CO 2 concentrations. However, rates of photorespiration expressed as a fraction of net photosynthesis declined rapidly with increasing external CO 2 concentration at 21 % O 2. Under normal atmospheric conditions, photorespiration was 45 to 50 % of the net CO 2 fixation rate at 32 °C and high irradiance. The rapid initial CO 2 evolution observed upon darkening at 21 % O 2 was absent in 3 % O 2. Rates of photorespiration under normal atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 and O 2 as measured by the postillumination burst were highly dependent upon temperature (observed activation energy = 30. 1 kilocalories per mole).

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{methodology}} {{to estimate}} transport delay and time constant {{of the mass}} spectrometer (MS) has been discussed for some time, {{there appears to be}} a question whether an exponential first order function is an appropriate fit to the <b>analyzer</b> <b>response.</b> We investigated the response of our MS (Perkin-Elmer 1100) to step changes in O 2 and CO 2 from ambient air to 13 % and 5 %, respectively, and developed regression technique to estimate transport delay and time constant. Output from the MS coupled to the data acquisition system was sampled at 100 Hz with a PDP 11 / 10 computer system. Since the general form for a single time constant system with an initial and final values of I and F, with time delay, td, and time constant, τ, is y = F + (I - F) exp (- (t - td) /τ), data were regressed over time to the straight line transformation - In((y - F) / (I − F)) = t/τ − td/τ, where t is time and y the experimental data. This is a straight line with slope 1 /τ and vertical axis intercept of -td/τ. We find an excellent correlation between gas concentration data and the regression fit (r = 0. 99) from 10 to 95 % of the response interval, resulting in τ of 0. 03 s and transport delay of 0. 3 s for the Perkin-Elmer 1100 mass spectrometer.

However, infrared (IR) gas analysis has become the clinically preferred monitoring technique because it provides continuous data, is less expensive and more practical, and is readily available. We examined the accuracy of a modern IR analyzer (M-CAiOV compact gas IR analyzer (General Electric, Helsinki, Finland) by comparing its performance with GC. Methods To examine linearity, we analyzed 3 different concentrations of 3 different agents in O 2 : 0. 3, 0. 7, and 1. 2 % isoflurane; 0. 5, 1, and 2 % sevoflurane; and 1, 3, and 6 % desflurane. To {{examine the effect of}} carrier gas composition, we prepared mixtures of 1 % isoflurane, 1 or 2 % sevoflurane, or 6 % desflurane in 100 % O 2 (= O 2 group); 30 %O 2 + 70 %N 2 O (= N 2 O group), 28 %O 2 + 66 %N 2 O + 5 %CO 2 (= CO 2 group), or air. To examine consistency between analyzers, four different M-CAiOV analyzers were tested. Results The IR <b>analyzer</b> <b>response</b> in O 2 is linear over the concentration range studied: IR isoflurane % = - 0. 0256 + (1. 006 * GC %), R = 0. 998; IR sevoflurane % = - 0. 008 + (0. 946 * GC %), R = 0. 993; and IR desflurane % = 0. 256 + (0. 919 * GC %), R = 0. 998. The deviation from GC calculated as (100 *(IR-GC) /GC), in %) ranged from - 11 to 11 % for the medium and higher concentrations, and from - 20 to + 20 % for the lowest concentrations. No carrier gas effect could be detected. Individual modules differed in their accuracy (p = 0. 004), with differences between analyzers mounting up to 12 % of the medium and highest concentrations and up to 25 % of the lowest agent concentrations. Conclusion M-CAiOV compact gas IR analyzers are well compensated for carrier gas cross-sensitivity and are linear over the range of concentrations studied. IR and GC cannot be used interchangeably, because the deviations between GC and IR mount up to ± 20 %, and because individual analyzers differ unpredictably in their performance. </p...|$|E
40|$|A Hydrazine Vapor Area Monitor (HVAM) {{system is}} {{currently}} being field tested as a detector {{for the presence of}} hydrazine in ambient air. The MDA/Polymetron Hydrazine Analyzer has been incorporated within the HVAM system as the core detector. This analyzer is a three-electrode liquid analyzer typically used in boiler feed water applications. The HVAM system incorporates a dual-phase sample collection/transport method which simultaneously pulls ambient air samples containing hydrazine and a very dilute sulfuric acid solution (0. 0001 M) down a length of 1 / 4 inch outside diameter (OD) tubing from a remote site to the analyzer. The hydrazine-laden dilute acid stream is separated from the air and the pH is adjusted by addition of a dilute caustic solution to a pH greater than 10. 2 prior to analysis. Both the dilute acid and caustic used by the HVAM are continuously generated during system operation on an "as needed" basis by mixing a metered amount of concentrated acid/base with dilution water. All of the waste water generated by the analyzer is purified for reuse by Barnstead ion-exchange cartridges so that the entire system minimizes the generation of waste materials. The pumping of all liquid streams and mixing of the caustic solution and dilution water with the incoming sample are done by a single pump motor fitted with the appropriate mix of peristaltic pump heads. The signal to noise (S/N) ratio of the analyzer has been enhanced by adding a stirrer in the MDA liquid cell to provide mixing normally generated by the high liquid flow rate designed by the manufacturer. An onboard microprocessor continuously monitors liquid levels, sample vacuum, and liquid leak sensors, as well as handles communications and other system functions (such as shut down should system malfunctions or errors occur). The overall system response of the HVAM can be automatically checked at regular intervals by measuring the <b>analyzer</b> <b>response</b> to a metered amount of calibration standard injected into the dilute acid stream. The HVAM system provides two measurement ranges (threshold limit value (TLV) : 10 to 1000 parts per billion (ppb) /LEAK: 100 ppb to 10 parts per million (ppm)). The LEAK range is created by dilution of the sulfuric acid/hydrazine liquid sample with pure water. This dual range capability permits the analyzer to quantify ambient air samples whose hydrazine concentrations range from 10 ppb to as high as 10 ppm. The laboratory and field prototypes have demonstrated total system response times on the order of 10 to 12 minutes for samples ranging from 10 to 900 ppb in the lLV mode and is greater than 2 minutes for samples ranging from 100 to 1300 ppb in the LEAK mode. Service intervals of over 3 months have been demonstrated for continuous 24 hour/day, 7 day/week usage. The HVAM is made up of a purged cabinet that contains power supplies, RS 422 signal transmission capabilities, a UPS, an on-site warning system, and a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). The LRU includes all of the liquid flow system, the analyzer, the control/data system microprocessor and assorted flow and liquid-level sensors. The LRU is mounted on a track slide system so it can be serviced inplace or totally removed and quickly exchanged with another calibrated unit, thus minimizing analyzer downtime. Once an LRU is removed from an analyzer enclosure, it can be brought to a laboratory facility for complete calibration and periodic maintenance...|$|E
40|$|The postillumination {{transient}} of CO 2 {{exchange and}} its relation to photorespiration has been examined in leaf discs from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and maize (Zea mays). Studies of the transients observed by infrared gas analysis at 1, 21, and 43 % O 2 in an open system were extended using the nonsteady state model described previously (Peterson and Ferrandino 1984 Plant Physiol 76 : 976 - 978). Cumulative CO 2 exchange equivalents (i. e. nanomoles CO 2) versus time were derived from the <b>analyzer</b> <b>responses</b> of individual transients. In tobacco (C 3), subtraction of the time course of cumulative CO 2 exchange under photorespiratory conditions (21 or 43 % O 2) from that obtained under nonphotorespiratory conditions (1 % O 2) revealed the presence of an O 2 -dependent and CO 2 -reversible component within the first 60 seconds following darkening. This component was absent in maize (C 4) and at low external O 2 :CO 2 ratios (i. e. < 100) in tobacco. The size of the component in tobacco increased with net photosynthesis as irradiance was increased and was positively associated with inhibition of net photosynthesis by O 2. This relatively simple and rapid method of analysis of the transient is introduced to eliminate some uncertainties associated with estimation of photorespiration based on the maximal rate of postillumination CO 2 evolution.

Materials and methods: Seventeen eyes with PG were included consecutively. AS-OCT and ocular <b>response</b> <b>analyzer</b> measurements were taken before and 3 months after PI. Baseline morphology and change in morphology were analyzed by correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. The main parameters assessed were anterior-chamber (AC) angles and volume as well as corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor. Results: AC angles were found to have decreased significantly in each quadrant after PI (P< 0. 001), with the highest effect seen in the temporal quadrant, which decreased from 57. 0 °± 9. 6 ° to 44. 1 °± 5. 2 ° (± standard deviation). Mean AC volume decreased significantly from 213. 1 ± 36. 4 to 187. 0 ± 23. 4 mm 3 (P< 0. 001). CH and corneal resistance factor did not change after PI. CH was found to correlate with the preoperative superior and inferior angle width (Spearman&# 39;s rho 0. 553 and 0. 615, respectively, P< 0. 05). Biomechanical parameters showed no predictive value on the change of AC angles or volume. Conclusion: PI in eyes with PG results in a highly significant reduction in the AC angles and volume as visualized by AS-OCT, with the largest effect seen in the temporal quadrant. CH is strongly positively correlated with the superior and inferior preoperative AC angles, emphasizing the importance of the biomechanical properties of the cornea for glaucoma pathogenesis in PG, but corneal biomechanical properties cannot predict PI-related AC changes.

40|$|The spun packed {{cell volume}} (PCV, hematocrit) is a key {{measurement}} on which are based hematology instrument calibration, reference range determination, and assignment of values to calibrators/controls. In 2001, the International Council for Stan-dardization in Haematology (ICSH) recommended a Reference PCV method, which is fully traceable to the ICSH reference hemoglobin method. Because of its complexity, however, this method is impractical for occasional use in routine laboratories and is therefore intended primarily for use by manufacturers of capillary microhematocrit tubes, liquid calibrators, and multi-channel <b>analyzers.</b> In <b>response</b> {{to the need for}} a simpler method—accessible to all routine laboratories—the ICSH offers this “Surrogate Reference ” PCV procedure. It is traceable to the original ICSH Reference PCV method and is based on spun PCVs obtained using borosilicate capillary tubes with an already-known relationship to this reference procedure. This ICSH “Surro-gate Reference ” PCV method is substantially simpler, thus putting it within the reach of most routine hematology laboratories...|$|R
30|$|EIS of {{the running}} FC was {{performed}} using a frequency <b>response</b> <b>analyzer</b> (FRA) Solartron 1260, directly connected to the electronic load (RBL 488 - 50 - 150 - 800). EIS was performed in galvanostatic mode using an AC signal of amplitude 200 [*]mA. Impedance spectra were collected by sweeping frequencies between 100 [*]kHz and 0.005 [*]Hz. The amplitude of the sinusoidal potential signal was 10 [*]mV. Each scan contained about 100 data points. Five full spectra for each current density value were acquired, and the impedance spectrum finally used in the discussion {{was the result of}} an averaging procedure.|$|R
