In this paper we generalize this LR to a likelihood ratio LR(M 1, M 2) involving two possibly mixed traces M 1 and M 2, where the question is whether there is a donor in common to both traces. In case one of the traces is in fact a single genotype, then this likelihood ratio reduces to the usual LR(M, g).

DesignPublic health investigation. SettingTwo transplant hospitals and community interview with the deceased donor 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s family. PatientsThree transplant recipients and the organ donor. MeasurementsSpecimens were tested for microsporidia by using culture, immunofluorescent antibody, polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Donor medical records were reviewed and a questionnaire was developed to assess for microsporidial infection. ResultsKidneys and lungs were procured from the deceased donor and transplanted to 3 recipients who became ill with fever 7 to 10 weeks after the transplant. Results of urine culture, serologic, and polymerase chain reaction testing were positive for Encephalitozoon cuniculi of genotype III in each recipient; the organism was also identified in biopsy or autopsy specimens in all recipients. The donor had positive serologic test results for Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Surviving recipients received albendazole. Donor assessment did not identify factors for suspected Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection. LimitationInability to detect organism by culture or polymerase chain reaction in donor due to lack of autopsy specimens. ConclusionTransmission of microsporidiosis through organ transplantation is described.

In this work, we study the low-temperature PL of high-quality uncompensated Al-doped p-type 4 H-SiC and propose algorithms for determining the Al-doping concentration using the ratio of the Al-bound to free-exciton emission. We use three different cryogenic temperatures (2, 41, and 79 K) in order to cover the Al-doping range from mid 10 (14) cm(- 3) up to 10 (18) cm(- 3). The Al-bound exciton no-phonon lines and the strongest free-exciton replica are used as a measure of the bound-and free-exciton emissions at a given temperature, and clear linear relationships are obtained between their ratio and the Al-concentration at 2, 41, and 79 K. Since nitrogen is <b>a</b> <b>common</b> unintentional <b>donor</b> dopant in SiC, we also discuss the criteria allowing one to determine from the PL spectra whether a sample can be considered as uncompensated or not. Thus, the low-temperature PL provides a convenient non-destructive tool for the evaluation of the Al concentration in 4 H-SiC, which probes the concentration locally and, therefore, can also be used for mapping the doping homogeneity.

40|$|Organ transplantation, {{including}} of the heart, lung, kidney, liver, pancreas, {{and small}} bowel, {{is considered the}} therapy of choice for end-stage organ failure.

Water-soluble and biocompatible QDs are commercially available or can be synthesized in the laboratory using many available recipes from the literature. Apart from the semiconductor material composition, an important aspect of choosing the right QD for TR-FRET assays is the thickness of the QD coating, which will influence the photophysical properties and long-term stability as well as the donor-acceptor distance and FRET efficiency.
