Although Levski himself headed the organisation, he shared administrative responsibilities with assistants such as monk-turned-revolutionary Matey Preobrazhenski, the adventurous Dimitar Obshti, and the young Angel Kanchev.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{plot was}} {{inspired}} by a similar incident in which Johnson discovered <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> a bone in his backyard.

Swanberg dedicated the film to filmmaker Paul Mazursky.|$|E

A special Section T of NDRC was created, chaired by Tuve, with Parsons as special assistant to Bush and liaison between NDRC and BuOrd.|$|E
