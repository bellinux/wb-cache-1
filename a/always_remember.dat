500|$|At school, Ripley enjoyed drama lessons, {{spurred on by}} the {{positive}} remarks she received from her drama teacher Susan Ford. She said of Ford, [...] "When I was 15, {{one of the few}} people who said, 'Well done', was my drama teacher, and she was really brilliant. She was a powerful woman. Those women change your life. You <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> them. There was something about her. She basically made me feel very good about myself as a 15-year-old girl." [...] Abandoning her childhood ambition to become a nurse, Ripley decided to go into acting.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{falls in}} the winter and early spring, while summer is punctuated with widely scattered thunderstorms. The autumn is usually cool and dry. Due to the altitude and dryness of the atmosphere, vigorous radiative cooling occurs throughout the year, and exceptional daily temperature variances are not uncommon. Consequently, the nights range from very cool in the summer to extremely cold in the winter; therefore, visitors should <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> to bring along at least a jacket, even during the summer. Records indicate that the highest temperature ever recorded in the forest was [...] in 1978, while the coldest was [...] in 1972.|$|E

500|$|McCaw's debut {{international}} {{test was}} against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on 17 November 2001. His first {{touch of the}} game resulted in a knock-on when he was hit in a tackle and New Zealand were trailing the Irish 16–7 at half-time. In the second half the All Blacks recovered to win 40–29 and McCaw was named man of the match, receiving a standing ovation at the post-match function. A turning point came {{in the second half}} when McCaw was able to steal the ball from Ireland, which led to a try to left wing Jonah Lomu. After the match McCaw recalled the experience: [...] "it {{was a hell of a}} stadium to play at, a real rugby stadium, a big crowd – something I'll <b>always</b> <b>remember,</b> very special." ...|$|E

[...] Oxford's stroke and Olympic bronze medallist Tim Foster told his crew [...] "We'll <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> we lost the Boat Race, but don't forget we are still good rowers." [...] Cadoux-Hudson stated {{in an interview that}} there were two occasions where the blades clashed: [...] "Cambridge were being warned on one occasion and Oxford on the other, so I think it equalled out at the end.

500|$|Potemkin [...] "exuded both menace and welcome"; he was arrogant, {{demanding}} of his courtiers {{and very}} changeable in his moods but also fascinating, warm and kind. It was generally agreed among his female companions {{that he was}} [...] "amply endowed with 'sex appeal'". Louis Philippe, comte de Ségur described him as [...] "colossal like Russia", [...] "an inconceivable mixture of grandeur and pettiness, laziness and activity, bravery and timidity, ambition and insouciance". The internal contrast was evident throughout his life: he frequented both church and numerous orgies, for example. In Ségur's view, onlookers {{had a tendency to}} unjustly attribute to Catherine alone the successes of the period and to Potemkin the failures. An eccentric workaholic, Potemkin was vain and a great lover of jewelry (a taste he did not <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> to pay for), but he disliked sycophancy and was sensitive about his appearance, particularly his lost eye. He only agreed to having portraits made of him twice, in 1784 and again in 1791, both times by Johann Baptist von Lampi and from an angle which disguised his injury.|$|E
500|$|When {{he signed}} a {{professional}} football contract with the New York Giants, Timberlake stated {{that he intended to}} take ministerial training at Princeton Theological Seminary during the off-season. [...] He noted, [...] "I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete." [...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You want to quit football. [...] It is times like these when something happens to me. [...] I can't explain it. [...] I put my face in my hands and ask God to come into my heart and give me courage. He gives me peace." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. It featured an unusual amount of animation glitches because the animation studio in Korea was training {{a new group of}} animators, and this episode was one of their first efforts. Show runner Mike Reiss said he will <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> it as the episode [...] "that came back animated with a thousand mistakes in it and was just a complete and utter mess." [...] Reardon said there was [...] "literally a mistake in every other scene" [...] when the episode came back from Korea. Several scenes had to be re-animated in the United States because of these glitches, but according to Reardon, [...] "you can still see the lesser ones that got through, such as line quality problems particularly in the first act." [...] Though it aired in season three, [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] was produced during the previous season. It was recorded in spring 1991 when the previous season came to an end, and was scheduled to air in autumn that year. The staff therefore had more time to fix the glitches during the summer.|$|E

500|$|In the {{regional}} finals, Kentucky trailed top-seeded Duke by 12 {{in the second}} half, but battled back to force overtime. With 2.1 seconds left in overtime, Sean Woods hit a running bank shot to put Kentucky up one. Then, Duke's Christian Laettner caught a long inbounds pass, faked right, and hit {{a shot at the}} buzzer to give Duke the 104103 victory. The game, which ended Farmer's playing career, is widely {{regarded as one of the}} greatest college basketball games of all time. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski later recalled, [...] "The thing I'll <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> about that game is Richie Farmer's face as the ball went in. That, to me, helped me to have a better understanding of that game. ... To me, that was the deepest emotion that was on the court, the emotion that was on Richie Farmer's face." [...] Describing the impact of the game, Jerry Tipton wrote, [...] "On one fateful night, the Cats obliterated any lingering association with $1,000 packages and academic fraud. Alluring images of courage, honest effort and heartracing excitement became symbols of UK basketball." [...] Local media gave the seniors the nickname [...] "The Unforgettables". Collectively, they were voted as the Lexington Herald-Leaders 1992 Sportsmen of the Year.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{is portrayed as}} having created, or at least contributed to, his own reputation. When Gibbs tells Will that Sparrow escaped from a desert island by strapping two sea turtles together, Sparrow embellishes the story by claiming the rope was made from hair from his own back, while in reality, Sparrow escaped the island by bartering with rum traders. The video game [...] bases itself on these tall tales, including the sacking of Nassau port without firing a shot. Depp has likened pirates to rock stars in that their fame preceded them. Sparrow insists on being addressed as [...] "Captain" [...] and often gives the farewell, [...] "This is the day you will <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!" [...] which is sometimes humorously cut off. When Norrington accuses him of being the worst pirate he has ever heard of, Sparrow replies, [...] "But you have heard of me." [...] In a deleted scene from The Curse of the Black Pearl Sparrow ponders being [...] "the immortal Captain Jack Sparrow", and during At World's End he again is interested in immortality, although his father, Captain Teague, warns {{it can be a}} terrible curse. Sparrow ponders being [...] "Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate," [...] as the East India Trading Company purges piracy.|$|E
500|$|Yankee outfielder Bob Cerv {{recalled}} of the rivalry, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> {{the games}} when Pierce and Ford would lock up. Those were great ballgames – 2–1, 3–2. Usually, if they'd get beat, Mantle would {{hit a home}} run." [...] New York outfielder Hank Bauer noted, [...] "The guy who gave me the most problem – I know he gave 'em to me, and I think he gave 'em {{to most of us}} – was Billy Pierce." [...] Tommy Byrne, who pitched for the Yankees for most of his career from 1943 to 1957 but played for Chicago {{for the first half of}} the 1953 season, said, [...] "Pierce was sneaky fast, a good breaking ball. He was tough. For several years there he was right up there on a par with Ford." [...] Sportswriter Bill Madden recalled in 1982, [...] "Always it was Pierce against Whitey Ford and always, to me, that seemed like an unfair matchup. They were your classic 'stylish' left-handers, equal in guile and guts, but Ford had those howitzers of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron and Hank Bauer behind him, while Pierce came armed with popguns. Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and Minnie Miñoso supported him with hustle and chink singles and I always marveled at the fact that Pierce could duel Ford on even terms despite those odds." [...] Ironically, the Yankees tried to acquire Pierce in the early 1950s when Ford was in the military, but White Sox general manager Frank Lane proposed that New York give up Bauer, first baseman Joe Collins and second baseman Jerry Coleman in exchange for Pierce and outfielder Al Zarilla, and ended talks when Yankees GM George Weiss suggested the Yankees send minor leaguers instead.|$|E
