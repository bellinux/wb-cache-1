40|$|Currently, {{the main}} {{limitation}} in high-throughput microsatellite genotyping is the required manual editing of allele calls. Even though programs for automated allele calling {{have been available}} for several years, they have limited capability because accurate data could only be assured by manual inspection of the electropherograms for confirmation. Here we describe {{the development of a}} parametric approach to <b>allele</b> <b>call</b> quality control that eliminates much of the time required for manual editing of the data. This approach was implemented in an editing tool, Decode-GT, that works downstream of the allele calling program, TrueAllele (TA). Decode-GT reads the output data from TA, displays the underlying electropherograms for the genotypes, and sorts the allele calls into three categories: good, bad, and ambiguous. It discards the bad calls, accepts the good calls, and suggests that the user inspect the ambiguous calls, thereby reducing dependence on manual editing. For the categorization we use the following parameters: (1) the quality value for each <b>allele</b> <b>call</b> from TrueAllele; (2) the peak height of the alleles; and (3) the size of the peak shift needed to move peaks into the nearest bin. Here we report how we optimized the parameters such that the size of the ambiguous category was minimized, and both the number of miscalled genotypes in the good category and the useable genotypes in the bad category were negligible. This approach reduces the manual editing time and results in < 1 % miscalls...|$|E
40|$|Locus-specific {{brackets}} for reliable typing of Y-chromosome short {{tandem repeat}} markers Short tandem repeat (STR) loci, widely used as genetic markers in disease diagnostic studies and human identity applications, are traditionally genotyped through compar-ison of allele sizes to a sequenced allelic ladder. Allelic ladders permit a floating bin <b>allele</b> <b>calling</b> method to be utilized, which enables reliable <b>allele</b> <b>calling</b> across labora-tories, instrument platforms, and electrophoretic conditions. Precise sizing methods for STR <b>allele</b> <b>calling</b> involving fixed bins {{can also be}} used when a high degree of pre-cision has been demonstrated within an instrument platform and a set of electropho-retic conditions. An alternative method for reliable genotyping of STR markers, locus-specific brackets (LSBs), is introduced here. LSBs are artificial alleles created through molecular biology manipulations to be shorter or longer than alleles commonly seen in populations under investigation. The size and repeat number of measured alleles are interpolated between the two LSB products that are mixed with the polymerase chain reaction-amplified STR alleles. The advantages and limitations of the LSB approach are described along with a concordance study between the LSB typing approach and other STR typing methods. Complete agreement was observed with 162 samples studied at 5 Y-chromosome loci...|$|R

30|$|At {{the other}} end of the spectrum, {{targeted}} simplex SNP approaches, such as TaqMan and KASP-based genotyping, offer an alternative to fixed arrays for applications requiring a few, high-value markers across very large populations (Eathington et al. 2007; He et al. 2014; Semagn et al. 2014). These assays can be cost-effective for large sample sizes (1000  s- 10, 000  s) and are ideal when trait-predictive SNP markers are available for selection of large effect genes in breeding programs; however, their cost advantage is lost for applications involving small numbers of lines or requiring more than 100 – 200 genome-wide SNP markers. Thus, while no single genotyping system is ideal for all applications, the wide range of available genotyping platforms now offer solutions that can provide an optimal balance to meet the needs of different users, taking into account cost per sample, marker resolution, turnaround time, <b>allele</b> <b>call</b> rates, and data analysis requirements (Thomson 2014).|$|E

An AmpliSeq next generation sequencing panel was developed to facilitate comprehensive sequencing of the UMOD gene, covering exonic and regulatory regions.

Thus, when the heterozygote cluster is under represented, or completely absent (as is the case for inbred lines), the software cannot reliably identify cluster locations and boundaries, unless a large dataset is generated to “train” the algorithm.

The Xp breakpoint does not seem to affect a known or predicted gene. Moreover, a fusion transcript with the CALL gene could not be detected and no mutations were identified on the second <b>allele.</b> <b>CALL</b> is highly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system, like the mouse ortholog 'close homolog to L 1 ' (Chl 1). Chl 1 expression levels in the hippocampus of Chl 1 (+/-) mice were half of those obtained in wild-type littermates, reflecting a gene dosage effect. Timm staining and synaptophysin immunohistochemistry of the hippocampus showed focal groups of ectopic mossy fiber synapses in the lateral CA 3 region, outside the trajectory of the infra-pyramidal mossy fiber bundle in Chl 1 (-/-) and Chl 1 (+/-) mice. Behavioral assessment demonstrated mild alterations in the Chl 1 (-/-) animals. In the probe trial of the Morris Water Maze test, Chl 1 (-/-) mice displayed an altered exploratory pattern. In addition, these mice were significantly more sociable and less aggressive as demonstrated in social exploration tests. The Chl 1 (+/-) mice showed a phenotypic spectrum ranging from wild-type to knockout behavior. We hypothesize that a 50 % reduction of CALL expression in the developing brain results in cognitive deficits.

40|$|AbstractForensic {{scientists}} are currently investigating how to transition from capillary electrophoresis (CE) to massive parallel sequencing (MPS) {{for analysis of}} forensic DNA profiles. MPS offers several advantages over CE such as virtually unlimited multiplexy of loci, combining both short tandem repeat (STR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci, small amplicons without constraints of size separation, more discrimination power, deep mixture resolution and sample multiplexing. We present our bioinformatic framework My-Forensic-Loci-queries (MyFLq) for analysis of MPS forensic data. For <b>allele</b> <b>calling,</b> the framework uses a MySQL reference allele database with automatically determined regions of interest (ROIs) by a generic maximal flanking algorithm which {{makes it possible to}} use any STR or SNP forensic locus. Python scripts were designed to automatically make <b>allele</b> <b>calls</b> starting from raw MPS data. We also present a method to assess the usefulness and overall performance of a forensic locus with respect to MPS, as well as methods to estimate whether an unknown allele, which sequence is not present in the MySQL database, is in fact a new allele or a sequencing error. The MyFLq framework was applied to an Illumina MiSeq dataset of a forensic Illumina amplicon library, generated from multilocus STR polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on both single contributor samples and multiple person DNA mixtures. Although the multilocus PCR was not yet optimized for MPS in terms of amplicon length or locus selection, the results show excellent results for most loci. The results show a high signal-to-noise ratio, correct <b>allele</b> <b>calls,</b> and a low limit of detection for minor DNA contributors in mixed DNA samples. Technically, forensic MPS affords great promise for routine implementation in forensic genomics.

30|$|Therefore, {{there is}} a strong need to {{describe}} locus-specific genotyping profile characteristics using DNA from a high-quality source, which has been suggested in the literature to minimize genotyping errors related to <b>allele</b> <b>calling</b> (Matsumoto et al. 2004). This has also been indicated in the guidelines of the ISFG (Gill et al. 20062012). Thus, we describe {{for the first time the}} screening and genotyping profile characteristics of 39 microsatellite markers developed for the Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae), domestic cat (Felis catus), Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) and snow leopard using DNA from a high-quality source. Of these, 21 loci are being reported for the first time in the literature for the Bengal tiger. Based on our findings, we suggest a combination of highly polymorphic dinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat loci along with their genotyping profile characteristics for use in population genetic, forensic and non-invasive genetic sampling studies involving the Bengal tiger that will minimize <b>allele</b> <b>calling</b> errors by using locus-specific profile characteristics. Thus, the present study will provide better options in the selection and use of loci in population genetic and forensic studies carried out on Bengal tigers.|$|R
50|$|The set of alleles {{for a given}} {{organism}} {{is called}} its genotype, while the observable traits of the organism are called its phenotype. When organisms are heterozygous at a gene, often one <b>allele</b> is <b>called</b> dominant as its qualities dominate the phenotype of the organism, while the other <b>allele</b> is <b>called</b> recessive as its qualities recede and are not observed. Some alleles do not have complete dominance and instead have incomplete dominance by expressing an intermediate phenotype, or codominance by expressing both alleles at once.|$|R
5000|$|Less commonly, the {{presence}} of a single functional allele gives a phenotype that is not normal but less severe than that of the non-functional homozygote. This occurs when the functional allele is not haplo-sufficient. The terms haplo-insufficiency and incomplete dominance are typically applied to these cases. The intermediate interaction occurs where the heterozygous genotype produces a phenotype intermediate between the two homozygotes. Depending on which of the two homozygotes the heterozygote most resembles, one allele is said to show incomplete dominance over the other. For example, in humans the Hb gene locus is responsible for the Beta-chain protein (HBB) {{that is one of the}} two globin proteins that make up the blood pigment hemoglobin Many people are homozygous for an <b>allele</b> <b>called</b> HbA; some persons carry an alternative <b>allele</b> <b>called</b> HbS, either as homozygotes or heterozygotes. The hemoglobin molecules of HbS/HbS homozygotes undergo a change in shape that distorts the morphology of the red blood cells, and causes a severe, life-threatening form of anemia called sickle-cell anemia. Persons heterozygous HbA/HbS for this allele have a much less severe form of anemia called sickle-cell trait. Because the disease phenotype of HbA/HbS heterozygotes is more similar to but not identical to the HbA/HbA homozygote, the HbA allele is said to be incompletely dominant to the HbS allele.|$|R

Therefore, we analyzed polymorphic dinucleotide repeat loci (n[*]=[*] 23) and tetranucleotide repeat loci (n[*]=[*] 11) separately to determine the level of allelic diversity, which has a strong significant role in individual identification. The number of alleles per locus at polymorphic dinucleotide repeat loci (n[*]=[*] 23) ranged from 2 to 7 (average 3.347), the average observed and expected heterozygosities for these loci were 0.641 and 0.552, respectively, and the mean PIC value was 0.485 (Table  1). The number of alleles per locus at polymorphic tetranucleotide repeat loci (n[*]=[*] 11) ranged from 2 to 4 (average 3.272), the average observed and expected heterozygosities for these loci were 0.590 and 0.539, respectively, and the mean PIC value was 0.475 (Table  1). Our study clearly indicates that the polymorphic dinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat loci show more or less the same genetic diversity and other characteristics. Besides, there has been a choice of using tetranucleotide over dinucleotide loci to minimize problems of <b>allele</b> <b>calling</b> (Cullingham et al. 2010).

However, the conventional manual genotyping technique is cumbersome and time-consuming and entails many risks for errors, thus hindering its implementation and dissemination. We describe here a new approach using the QIAxcel system, an automated high-throughput capillary electrophoresis system that also carries out <b>allele</b> <b>calling.</b> This automated method was assessed on 1, 824 amplicons from 82 TB isolates and tested with sets of markers of 15 or 24 loci.

In sum, this new automated method facilitates MIRU-VNTR genotyping and provides reliable results. Therefore, it is well suited for field genotyping.

Abnormalities of the neurofilament network constitute a common finding of many neurological disorders. For instance depositions of neurofilament aggregates in the perikarya and axons of motor neurons are observed in most amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases, sporadic and familial. The impact of such accumulation of neurofilaments on the course of motor neuron disease remains to be fully elucidated. In order to investigate the role of neurofilaments in motor neuron disease, transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) were used as an animal model of familial ALS. Increasing the perikaryal neurofilament content in these mutant SOD 1 mice slowed down the motor neuron disease progression and increased their life span by up to 65 %. To date, this approach constitutes {{the most efficient way}} to increase the life span of mutant SOD 1 mice. Moreover, increasing the axonal neurofilament content in mutant SOD 1 mice by human neurofilament-light subunit (hNF-L) overexpression demonstrated that axonal neurofilaments do not constitute an exacerbating factor in the neurodegeneration caused by mutant SOD 1. The pathogenicity of human neurofilament-heavy (hNF-H) proteins expressed in transgenic mice was also investigated. Two alleles of the NF-H gene are present in the normal human population. Expression of both alleles in transgenic mice provoked motor neuron dysfunction. The adverse property of NF-H overexpression is the result of an improper stoichiometry between the NF-L and the NF-H subunits. Restoration of an adequate stoichiometry, via the co-expression of NF-L and NF-H subunits, rescued mice from the motor neuron dysfunction.

We show that combining microsatellite data sets can provide new insights on the origin and geographical distribution of genetic diversity and admixture in cattle, which will facilitate global management of this livestock species. comparison of population genetic parameters from different studies and breeds has proven difficult. Often different genotyping methods have been employed, preventing standardization of microsatellite <b>allele</b> <b>calling.</b> In other cases different sets of markers have been genotyped, providing differing estimates of population genetic parameters.

30|$|When using {{different}} loci in studies involving samples {{that have been}} obtained non-invasively, the researcher is keen to know the error rates and amplification success rate. We tested {{the applicability of the}} recommended panel with noninvasive samples (scat) and blood from the same individuals and estimated the frequency of occurrence of genotyping error rates. The values of the mean genotyping error rates were low and considerable for non-invasive genetic studies (allele dropout, 0.004 [*]±[*] 0.002 SD; false allele, 0.004 [*]±[*] 0.002 SD and scoring error, 0.006 [*]±[*] 0.003 SD). These relatively low error rates {{may be due to the}} use of locus-specific profile characteristics, which leads to correct decisions in <b>allele</b> <b>calling.</b> We also did not observe any change or discrepancy in the genetic data compared with the data generated from blood samples.|$|R
