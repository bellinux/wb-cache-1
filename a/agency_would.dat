Legislation {{which would have}} been voted on in November 2010 would have seen the introduction of a national universities regulator; however, this was delayed until 2011 following criticisms from the hig{{her education}} sector. It was also announced by her government that legislation to establish the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards <b>Agency</b> <b>would</b> also be introduced early 2011.|$|E
5|$|Four {{months after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Agency had produced no coordinated estimate of the situation in Korea. Smith created a new Office of National Estimates (ONE) under the direction of William L. Langer, the Harvard historian who had led the Research and Analysis branch of the wartime Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Langer's staff created procedures that were followed for the next two decades. Smith stepped up efforts to obtain economic, psychological, and photographic intelligence. By December 1, Smith had formed a Directorate for Administration. The <b>Agency</b> <b>would</b> ultimately be divided by function into three directorates: Administration, Plans, and Intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The Phase 2 {{budget was}} {{originally}} $1.5 billion, {{which would be}} used to start construction of the tunnels; the MTA reduced the amount of money allocated in the budget, projecting that the <b>agency</b> <b>would</b> not be able to start construction {{by the end of the}} 5-year cycle in 2019. Although the MTA previously expressed concerns about funding the Capital Program, a spokesman stated that the reduction in funding was a result of uncertain timing and not money problems. The delay had upset politicians and residents of East Harlem, who objected to the 3-to-4-year delay.|$|E

5|$|GO Transit {{also went}} through three major reconfigurations. In January 1997, the {{province}} {{announced it would}} transfer funding responsibility for GO Transit to GTHA municipalities. The Greater Toronto Services Board, composed of regional municipality chairs, city mayors and municipal councillors, was created as a municipal agency in January 1999, and GO Transit was transferred as an arm of this agency in August 1999. However, then-Premier Mike Harris announced the province would re-assume funding responsibility for GO Transit two years later, and this was completed with {{the abolition of the}} Greater Toronto Services Board on January 1, 2002. The Greater Toronto Transportation Authority was created in 2006, with the responsibilities of co-ordinating, planning, financing and developing integrated transit in the GTHA. This <b>agency</b> <b>would</b> then become merged with GO Transit in 2009 under the name Metrolinx. GO Transit would continue as an operating division alongside two other major initiatives: the Union Pearson Express and Presto card.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{hoped that}} a new, {{permanent}} <b>agency</b> <b>would</b> be created {{to take over}} the responsibilities of the wartime Manhattan Project in 1945, but passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 through Congress took much longer than expected, and involved considerable debate about the proper role of the military with respect to the development, production and control of nuclear weapons. The act that was signed by President Harry S. Truman on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), {{to take over the}} functions and assets of the Manhattan Project, but the commissioners were not appointed until October, and AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, the Military Appropriation Act of 1946 gave the Manhattan Project $72.4 million for research and development, and $19 million for housing and utilities at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, Franken {{proposed}} a financial reform legislation {{amendment that would}} create a board to select which credit rating <b>agency</b> <b>would</b> evaluate a given security. Currently any company issuing a security may select the company that evaluates the security. The amendment was passed; however, the financial industry lobbied to have Franken's amendment removed from the final bill. Negotiations between the Senate and House, whose version of financial reform did not include such a provision, resulted in the amendment's being watered down to require only {{a series of studies}} being done upon the issue for two years. After the studies, if the Securities and Exchange Commission has not implemented another solution to the conflict of interest problem, Franken's solution would go into effect.|$|E

5|$|On 1November1975, Lockheed and Northrop {{were each}} awarded $1.5-million {{contracts}} {{to proceed with}} Phase 1 of XST. During a four-month period, the two companies were each required to construct full-scale wooden mock-ups, which would then be evaluated at the USAF's Radar Target Scatter (RATSCAT) test facility at White Sands, New Mexico. To test the design's radar returns, Lockheed erected a $187,000 specially built pole upon which the model would be perched. In March1976, a Lockheed model {{was transferred to the}} range before being tested; the following month Lockheed was pronounced the winner because the Northrop XST had a much higher side hemisphere RCS. DARPA, having realized the progress accumulated throughout the study, urged the Northrop team to remain together. The <b>agency</b> <b>would</b> later initiate the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX), which evolved into the Tacit Blue and, ultimately, the B-2 bomber.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity for about 36hours, Francisco began weakening, after the eye lost definition due to building wind shear. By October21, the eye became ragged and cloud-filled while the overall satellite {{presentation of the}} storm became elongated. That day, the typhoon entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which gave Francisco the local name Urduja; the <b>agency</b> <b>would</b> cease issuing advisories on October23. Conditions generally remained favorable, allowing the eye to remain distinct despite a great reduction in the sustained winds. Dry air began affecting the tropical cyclone late on October22, cutting off the flow of moist air, and water temperatures cooled along the storm's track. As a result, the eye dissipated and the convection weakened. An approaching trough from the Korean peninsula weakened the ridge to the north, slowing the typhoon and allowing it to turn north and northeast on October24. Francisco weakened below typhoon status after passing 210km (130mi) southeast of Okinawa. The storm began interacting with the approaching cold front while it passed south of Japan, moving around the subtropical ridge. With increasing wind shear, the circulation became exposed from the convection, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on October25, declaring that Francisco was becoming extratropical. On the next day, Francisco completed its extratropical transition, but dissipated later on October26, to the southeast of Japan.|$|E
5|$|During the 30th {{session of}} the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in November 1997, a {{proposal}} was put forward by Hong Kong to give Asian typhoons local names and to stop using the European and American names {{that had been used}} since 1945. The committee's Training and Research Coordination Group was subsequently tasked to consult with members and work out the details of the scheme in order to present a list of names for approval at the 31st session. During August 1998, the group met and decided that each member of the committee would be invited to contribute ten names to the list and that five principles would be followed for the selection of names. It was also agreed that each name would have to be approved by each member and that a single objection would be enough to veto a name. A list of 140 names was subsequently drawn up and submitted to the Typhoon Committee's 32nd session, who after a lengthy discussion approved the list and decided to implement it on January 1, 2000. It was also decided that the Japan Meteorological <b>Agency</b> <b>would</b> name the systems rather than the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E

Transport Minister Collenette {{announced that a}} new <b>agency</b> <b>would</b> take over {{the responsibilities of the}} Harbour Commission, but without as many politician members on its board. The new <b>agency</b> <b>would</b> operate the airport, contrary to the wishes of Toronto City Council, which wished to keep the airport under city control. City Council voted to appeal to the Senate of the Parliament of Canada to try to block the legislation creating the new Toronto Port Authority. According to Councillor Olivia Chow, the new <b>agency</b> <b>would</b> get the Harbour Commission's $20 million in reserves, operate independently, while the City of Toronto would have to subsidize any losses.|$|E
25|$|The Cross-River Partnership, a {{consortium}} of local authorities, private sector organisations and voluntary bodies, recommended {{the creation of a}} public body to co-ordinate and promote river services.
