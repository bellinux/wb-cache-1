5|$|A {{network of}} roads {{developed}} in the Lowlands in this period. Drover's roads, between the Highlands and north-east England, had become established {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century and a series of military roads were built and maintained as a response to the Jacobite Risings in the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, but a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged. This was the beginning of a process that would create <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> rectangular fields and carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting roads. There was an attempt improve agriculture, resulting in new crops, techniques and enclosures began to displace the run rig system and free pasture.|$|E
5|$|While all the cathedrals are impressive, some, {{because of}} their location, are highly {{significant}} landmarks and landscape elements. Among these is Chichester, which can be seen for many miles across <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> open fields {{and is the only}} one of England’s cathedrals that is visible from the sea. The grey spire of Norwich rises serenely from its surrounding city, to be a focus of the Norwich School of landscape painters. Ely, on a small hill, dominates the rural countryside and its appearance in times of flood causes it to be known as The Ship of the Fens. The three spires of Lichfield are known as The Ladies of the Vale. The “exquisite tower” of Worcester is seen best across the River Severn. Lincoln with its vast façade and three towers, the tallest being over 80 metres (270ft), rises majestically from a steep hill above the town. Salisbury Cathedral with its “faultless spire” constitutes one of the iconic views of England, made famous by the landscape painter John Constable. In the north of England, Durham makes a “spectacular” view as it sits dramatically on its steep rocky peninsula above the River Wear, “half Church of God, half castle ‘gainst the Scots”.|$|E

25|$|Moraine State Park {{is named}} for the glacial moraines that cover its land. The moraines were formed at the {{conclusion}} of the Last glacial period, a time when glaciers covered much of North America. A tongue of the glacier reached into Pennsylvania and, as the ice receded, left deposits of gravel, sand and clay. These created <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> gently rolling hills.|$|E

Its 2,500 trees and shrubs were all labelled, and arranged around the perimeter alphabetically, from A for Acer (maple trees) to Z for Zanthoxylum (American toothache trees).|$|E

25|$|Arizona is {{well known}} for its desert Basin and Range region in the state's {{southern}} portions, which is rich in <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> xerophyte plants such as the cactus. This region's topography was shaped by prehistoric volcanism, followed by the cooling-off and related subsidence. Its climate has exceptionally hot summers and mild winters. The state is less well known for its pine-covered north-central portion of the high country of the Colorado Plateau (see Arizona Mountains forests).|$|E
25|$|Some {{versions}} of the anthropic principle are only interesting if the range of physical constants that allow certain kinds of life are unlikely in <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> possible universes. But Lee Smolin assumes that conditions for carbon based life are similar to conditions for black hole creation, which would change the a priori distribution of universes such that universes containing life would be likely. In Smolin vs. Susskind: The Anthropic Principle the string theorist Leonard Susskind disagrees about some assumptions in Lee Smolin's theory, while Smolin defends his theory.|$|E
25|$|Like the statue, {{the basin}} or kanbutsuban {{is the largest}} of its type known. The {{exterior}} has incised images of human figures, animals real and imaginary, birds, and butterflies, set against <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> flowers, grasses, shrubs, trees, mountain peaks, clouds, and pagodas. Images of hermits with banners riding on birds, barbarians in foreign garb astride Chinese lions, and hunters chasing tigers are similar to motifs found on metalwork in Tōdai-ji's celebrated repository the Shōsōin. Much of this decoration is secular rather than Buddhist in inspiration. Like the statue, the basin shows the influence of contemporary Tang China.|$|E
