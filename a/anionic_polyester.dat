In {{order to make}} APU products more competitive, anionic diols and dimethylopropanic acid (DMPA) were introduced into the macromoleculars of APU. The particle sizes of the APU dispersions have been reduced from 0. 7 ~ 3 µm to 0. 05 ~ 0. 6 µm, and the storage stability has been prolonged from 6 months to 12 months. It is efficient to prepare the self-emulsifiable APU dispersions by applying <b>anionic</b> <b>polyester</b> diols and using triethanolamine (TEOA) as a neutralization agent...|$|E
