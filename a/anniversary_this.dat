John Nathan-Turner decided close to transmission that a more suitable conclusion should be given to the final episode as it was possibly {{going to be the last}} ever. Accordingly, Andrew Cartmel wrote a short, melancholic closing monologue for Sylvester McCoy, which McCoy recorded on 23 November 1989 – by coincidence, the show's twenty-sixth <b>anniversary.</b> <b>This</b> was dubbed over the closing scene as the Doctor and his companion Ace walked off into the distance, apparently to further adventures.|$|E
