5|$|Although Sarah {{implied that}} she had {{encouraged}} the escape {{for the safety of}} Princess Anne, {{it is more likely that}} she was protecting herself and her husband. If James succeeded in defeating Prince William of Orange in battle he might imprison and even execute Lord and Lady Churchill for treason, whereas it was unlikely he would condemn his daughter to <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fate.</b> But James fled to France in December 1688 rather than confront the invading army, allowing William to take over his throne.|$|E

Each man was issued their personal weapons and ammunition as well as up to nine hand grenades and four Bren gun magazines. Each platoon also had a 2-inch mortar and a radio. Just before the men boarded the gliders, codewords were issued. 'Ham' indicated the canal bridge was captured and 'Jam' the river bridge.

5|$|On {{the western}} side of Ise Bay, in Mie Prefecture, 1,233people were killed, with {{approximately}} 5,500others sustaining injuries. Approximately 95%of Nagashima was submerged underwater.

The towns of Kamezaki and Kamiyoshi were also wiped out by the flood inundation. Further inland, in Nagano Prefecture, strong winds unroofed numerous homes.

5|$|During {{the years}} of Mexican control, the bay was put off limits to {{settlement}} by the authorities. An empresario granted in 1828 allowed Irish and Mexican immigration.

But Lamar soon met <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fate,</b> after being burnt to the ground during the American Civil War. The city of Aransas, which was founded on San Jose Island around the same time as Lamar, was also destroyed in the fighting. During the war, the bay was a strategically significant waterway for the transfer of freight, due to its protection from Gulf seas by barrier islands.|$|E

5|$|At the Opéra-Comique, {{after its}} 1883 revival, Carmen was always {{presented}} in the dialogue version with minimal musical embellishments. By 1888, {{the year of the}} 50th anniversary of Bizet's birth, the opera had been performed there 330 times; by 1938, his centenary year, the total of performances at the theatre had reached 2,271. However, outside France the practice of using recitatives remained the norm for many years; the Carl Rosa Opera Company's 1947 London production, and Walter Felsenstein's 1949 staging at the Berlin Komische Oper, are among the first known instances in which the dialogue version was used other than in France. Neither of these innovations led to much change in practice; a similar experiment was tried at Covent Garden in 1953 but hurriedly withdrawn, and the first American production with spoken dialogue, in Colorado in 1953, met with <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Croatia is {{inhabited}} {{mostly by}} Croats (89.6%), while minorities include Serbs (4.5%) and 21 other ethnicities (less than 1% each) recognised by the Constitution of Croatia.

After Austria-Hungary's collapse, the Hungarian population declined, while the German-speaking population was forced out or fled during the last part of and after World War II, and <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fate</b> was suffered by the Italian population. The late 19th century and the 20th century were marked by large scale economic migrations abroad. The 1940s and the 1950s in Yugoslavia were marked by internal migrations in Yugoslavia, as well as by urbanisation. The most recent significant migrations came {{as a result of the}} Croatian War of Independence when hundreds of thousands were displaced.|$|E

A number of major notables from other parts of Palestine were rounded up as well, including the religious leaders Sheikh Abdullah al-Fahum of Nazareth and Sheikh Said al-Sa'di of az-Zeeb.

5|$|Patton {{personally}} pinned a Silver Star on Leclerc, {{and brought}} with him another six Silver Stars and 25 Bronze Star Medals for {{other members of the}} 2e DB. Patton then gave Leclerc his next objective: the town of Baccarat and the bridge there over the Meurthe River. The bridge was captured before the Germans could destroy it. Haislip's XV Corps was transferred to the Seventh United States Army on 29 September, and Leclerc feared that 2e DB would be transferred to Général d'armée Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's French First Army. Leclerc regarded the First Army as being full of traitors who had supported Vichy France. Moreover, de Lattre had sacked Général de division Edgard de Larminat for Gaullist sentiments, and Leclerc had good reason to fear that he might meet <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Polish {{literature}} faced <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fate</b> in territories annexed by Germany, {{where the}} sale of Polish books was forbidden. The public destruction of Polish books {{was not limited to}} those seized from libraries, but also included those books that were confiscated from private homes. The last Polish book titles not already proscribed were withdrawn in 1943; even Polish prayer books were confiscated. Soon after the occupation began, most libraries were closed; in Kraków, about 80% of the libraries were closed immediately, while the remainder saw their collections decimated by censors. The occupying powers destroyed Polish book collections, including the Sejm and Senate Library, the Przedziecki Estate Library, the Zamoyski Estate Library, the Central Military Library, and the Rapperswil Collection. In 1941, the last remaining Polish public library in the German-occupied territories was closed in Warsaw. During the war, Warsaw libraries lost about a million volumes, or 30% of their collections. More than 80% of these losses were the direct result of purges rather than wartime conflict. Overall, it is estimated that about 10million volumes from state-owned libraries and institutions perished during the war.|$|E
