The crew are often sent games by developers or studios ahead of their release date for them to play and review.

40|$|Srinivasa Ramanujan was a {{brilliant}} mathematician, considered by George Hardy {{to be in the}} same class as Euler, Gauss, and Jacobi. His short life, marred by illness and tragic educational events, was unique in the history of mathematics. Mathematical discoveries are still being gleaned from his personal notebooks. Paper was a hard commodity to come by so his notebooks were a cluttered mix of pen over pencil mathematical hieroglyphics. The following highlights Ramanujan’s life in connection with Hardy, his work with ellipses, and his work with the partition function. Biographical Sketch of Ramanujan and His Connection to Godfrey Hardy If there is only one thing to learn from Srinivasa Ramanujan, both Hardy (1940) and Kanigel (1991) would agree that as math educators we should <b>always</b> be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for math genius and know what to do in order to nurture that genius. Hardy argued that Ramanujan’s mathematical genius was grossly mishandled during his prime years of intellectual cultivation by the defunct education system of India at the time. Ramanujan was born in 1887 surrounded by a very normal Indian world. He was raised in southern India in a relatively poor family. His education at the lower levels was for the most part normal, except for the unusual growth he had in mathematics. Before Ramanujan was 10 years old Hardy (1940) states, “he rediscovered Euler’s theorems fo...|$|R

50|$|Broadcast 28 November 1990, this {{instalment}} {{investigates the}} ways in which those animals that live in social groups interact with each other. The solitary eagle is contrasted with whooper swans landing in Scotland after a 1,600-kilometre journey from Iceland. Once arrived, they must battle for territory with those already there, and pairs or families are usually victorious. Attenborough uses a group of farmyard chickens to demonstrate a pecking order. Caciques are shown cooperating to deter predators, despite their fights amongst themselves to establish a pecking order. A pride of lions is shown co-operating to subdue a buffalo. Afterwards, each animal peacefully awaits its turn at the carcass. Baboons live in troops of up to 150, and their complex dominance hierarchy is examined in detail. Vampire bats display reciprocal altruism by regurgitating blood for any neighbour that has missed out on a night's feeding. Dwarf mongooses live in family groups of around a dozen. While some look for food or sleep, others are <b>always</b> posted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for predators and quickly raise the alarm if necessary. Meanwhile, some of the most extreme co-operation is demonstrated by the underground naked mole-rat, whose 80-strong clusters are divided into workers (who tunnel perpetually), soldiers (who only act when danger threatens), and a single queen for breeding. Leafcutter ants are shown transporting their food deep below ground: it has to be planted in a special fungus to convert its indigestible cellulose into something edible, and each stage of the operation is carried out by a different caste of individuals.|$|R

Gale came almost to believe what he had heard claimed by desert travelers--that the choya was alive and leaped at man or beast. Certain it was when Gale passed one, {{if he did not}} put all attention to avoiding it, he was hooked through his chaps and held by barbed thorns. The pain was almost unendurable.

40|$|Dear Friends, The {{debate of}} whether Stem Cell Therapy is a hype or hope has been raging {{for quite some}} time and has been rekindled in the current year. Stem Cell Scientists have been {{particularly}} enthused by the bold standard taken by Barack Obama in passing an Executive Order that lifted <b>the</b> ban <b>on</b> federal funding of Research on Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) lines created after August 9, 2001. With the lifting of the ban more money is expected to be poured into ESC and Stem Cell Research in general and this augurs well for this emerging science. This is hope. Amariglio et al have reported the occurrence of a multifocal brain tumor in a boy with ataxia telengectasia four years after he was treated with intracerebella and intrathecal injection of human fetal neural stem cells. Molecular and Cytogenetic studies showed that the tumor was of non host origin raising the possibility of it being derived from transplanted neural stem cell. This is the first report of a donor-derived brain tumor in neural stem cell therapy and opens a Pandora’s Box of questions about the safety of such therapies. This signifies the hype surrounding the therapy. However controversies are a part of any emerging science. Our goals should be to march forward conducting our research under strict ethical principles and rigorous oversight, ironing out even minor flaws, <b>always</b> being <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for adverse events and identifying ways and means of preventing their occurrence in future. JSRM has been in receipt of six articles, which speaks well for the interest people have for stem cell science in general and our journal in particular. The articles we have received for this edition of JSRM cover all aspects necessary for a science. Rosen et al have described the percentage variation of adipose stromal cells isolated from two different inbred mouse strains and Bhonde et al have reported the existence of multipotent stem cells in human fallopian tube. If cells can be identified, isolated they need suitable media for expansion and delivery. Dr. H. N. Madhavan et al article describes the use of such a medium (Mebiol Gel) for transplanting corneal limbal stem cells. Even if cells are ready for delivery, we should first have suitable animal models to test them and the article Garikipati Venkata Naga Srikanth et al is a good article describing are such animal model, {{that can be used to}} testing efficacy of stem cell. Aoyama et al article on using cell therapy for avascular osteonecrosis of femoral head reiterates the fact that stem cell therapy has a potential to cure a wide range of diseases and encourages all of us to continue in our guest to take stem cell therapy to treat hither to untreatable diseases. The article by Senthil Kumar Pazhanisamy et al highlights the fact that our current understanding of genome instabilities is limited. It is my personal opinion that with a better understanding of genome organization (which may take several years) we can possibly predict the occurrence of tumorogenesis and reject such stem cells obtained at source from possible use in therapy. So that we would have no more cases of tumors post stem cell therapy Happy reading! Yours sincerely,The Editorial team...|$|R
