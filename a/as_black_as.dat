5|$|Samsulbahri (sometimes spelled Sjamsulbahri; {{abbreviated}} Samsu) is {{the primary}} male protagonist. He is described as having skin the colour of langsat, with eyes <b>as</b> <b>black</b> <b>as</b> ink; however, from afar he can be confused with a Dutchman. These physical attributes have been described by Keith Foulcher, a lecturer of Indonesian language and literature at the University of Sydney, as indicating Samsu's mimicry and collaborationist nature. His good looks are also seen as a physical manifestation of his moral and kind nature.|$|E

For John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter, a kingdom to raise his family, and a queen for a new wife, as the creature cannot raise the dead.|$|E

25|$|Conversely, {{there has}} been no {{consistent}} colour or design of the club's away strips. Since the start of the new millennium, the club have most regularly had red kits of varying design; for example, the 2004–2005 away strip consisted of vertical red and black lines, whereas the 2016–17 kit was mostly red, with four horizontal lines of red, white and black across the chest. However, away kit designs have not been exclusively red, with the club having also had kits of purple, blue and yellow, as well <b>as</b> <b>black,</b> <b>as</b> was the case during the 2005–06 season.|$|E

His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have set us to thinking, had it not been that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We can look back now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.|$|E

In a July 2008 interview with Juan José Delaney in an Argentine paper, La Nacíón, Banville was asked if his books had been translated into Irish. He replied that nobody would translate them and that he was often referred to pejoratively as a West Brit.|$|E
