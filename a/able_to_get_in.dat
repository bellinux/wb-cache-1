5|$|Oliphant {{took the}} {{initiative}} himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed. Oliphant also travelled to Berkley to with meet with Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium, Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant, George B. Pegram, and Arthur Compton to relay the details which Oliphant had directed to Lawrence. Oliphant was not only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> touch with Lawrence, but he met with Conant and Bush to inform them of the significant data the MAUD had discovered. Oliphant’s ability to inform the Americans led to Oliphant convincing Lawrence, Lawrence convincing Compton, and then Kistiakowsky convincing Conant {{to move forward with}} nuclear weapons. These actions from Oliphant resulted in Bush taking this report directly to the president.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{production}} model was the F-94A, which entered operational service in May 1950. Its armament was four 0.50in (12.7mm) M3 Browning machine guns {{mounted in the}} fuselage with the muzzles exiting just behind the radome. Two 165US Gallon (1,204 litre) drop tanks, as carried by the F-80 and T-33, could be carried beneath the wingtips. Alternatively, these could be replaced by 1,000lb (454kg) bombs, giving the aircraft a secondary fighter bomber role. 109 were produced. The F-94A was in operational service for only a brief time as it was originally built, and was not received well by its aircrews. Primarily, {{this was due to}} the unreliability of its J33 engine, which caused many ground aborts and was deemed by the crews to be unsafe. The aircraft was judged as unstable and hard to maneuver at high altitude by its pilots. The pilot and radar operator found that the cockpit was too narrow for them to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> and out of the aircraft quickly during alerts and scrambles. The clearance for the ejection seats was too small, resulting in several tragic accidents during emergency ejections.|$|E

Although wanting to remain faithful to the original versions of the songs covered, Patton wished to avoid simply mimicking the original recordings, stating [...] "this is a record of covers, and I believe firmly that you have to make them your own.

Later in the match, up the ramp area, Cena threw JBL face first through a television monitor.

As a result, Cena retained the WWE Championship. Despite the match being over, Cena then hit JBL with the exhaust pipe. Because of the amount of blood Cena lost, the pay-per-view was rated TV-MA on WWE Network On Demand.|$|E

500|$|The only {{artillery}} {{support for}} the troops making these tentative advances was from the navy. Finding targets difficult to spot, and in fear of hitting their own troops, the big guns of the battleships and cruisers concentrated fire on the flanks of the beaches. The destroyers were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> closer, and from 08:00 began engaging their own targets. At 09:50, two minutes after the [...] destroyed a 75mm gun position in WN-74, the destroyers were ordered to get as close in as possible. Some approached within 1,000 yards (900m) several times, scraping bottom and risking running aground. An engineer who had landed in the first wave at Fox Red, watching the Frankford steaming in towards shore, thought she had been badly hit and was being beached. Instead, she turned parallel {{to the beach and}} cruised westwards, guns blazing at targets of opportunity. Thinking she would turn back out to sea, the engineer soon saw that she had instead begun backing up, guns still firing. At one point, gunners aboard the Frankford saw an immobilized tank at the water's edge, still firing. Watching the fall of its shot, they followed up with a salvo of their own. In this manner, the tank acted as the ship's fire control party for several minutes.|$|E
