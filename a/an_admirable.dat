5|$|Fitzgerald's {{goal was}} to produce a {{literary}} work which would truly prove himself as a writer, and Gatsby {{did not have the}} commercial success of his two previous novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later. Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> female character. According to his own ledger, now made available online by University of South Carolina's Thomas Cooper library, he earned only $2,000 from the book. Although 1926 brought Owen Davis's stage adaption and the Paramount-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye. For several years afterward, the general public believed The Great Gatsby to be nothing more than a nostalgic period piece.|$|E
25|$|Henry Sully, {{writing in}} Paris in 1717, {{described}} the anchor escapement as <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> invention of which Dr. Hooke, formerly professor of geometry in Gresham College at London, was the inventor. William Derham also attributes it to Hooke.|$|E
25|$|What <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> {{county is}} Madagascar! {{it is the}} veritable promised land for naturalists. It is there that Nature seems to have retired as into a special sanctuary, to work there on other models than those to which she enslaved herself in other countries.|$|E

The critical consensus states, [...] "A surfeit of ideas contributes to Margaret's excessive run time, but Anna Paquin does <b>a</b> <b>admirable</b> job of guiding viewers through emotional hell." [...] The film also holds a score of 61 out of 100 on Metacritic (based on 27 critics), indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews." ...|$|R
25|$|This {{passage from}} the Memoirs of a Cavalier, {{ascribed}} to Daniel Defoe, though not contemporary evidence, is <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> summary {{of the character of}} the Civil War. Even when in the end a regular professional army developed, the original decision-compelling spirit permeated the whole organisation as was seen when pitched against regular professional continental troops at the Battle of the Dunes during the Interregnum.|$|E

Known to be patient, temperate, dedicated, with {{a strong sense of}} willingness and devotion; the Koolie is not naturally aggressive but can demonstrate dominance. They show an untiring enthusiasm for work and <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> hardiness when the job or circumstance requires.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} also announced a 50% {{increase in the}} amount of food stamps for the most vulnerable groups (including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children) was announced. A small number of community councils were also created. In addition, a limited land reform programme was carried out that leased and sold land to small farmers, and land plots were granted to hundreds of farmers. The {{government also}} had <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> record in housing provision, while measures were also taken to protect consumers from illegal and unfair business practices.|$|E

25|$|Mason's {{locomotives}} were genuinely handsome without ornaments. His {{influence was}} exerted over all locomotive builders {{at the time}} and later. In 1856 he built two locomotives for the Cairo and Alexandria Railroad of Egypt in which a commentator said that the engines' excellence was due to the accuracy of execution attained by <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> set of tools and a skillful set of workmen. Opinion by master mechanics was that they were the easiest engines to keep in repair. In 1871, the Mason Bogie was introduced.|$|E
25|$|Shriver was <b>an</b> <b>admirable,</b> principled, and {{conscientious}} man who {{respected the}} dignity and sanctity of human life, and he also {{happened to be a}} contemporary and in-law of Kennedy. Not only did Shriver represent a “link” with JFK, but he represented a particular culture of white ethnic Catholic Democratic politics that has been gradually disappearing for the last fifty years. A pro-life Catholic, Shriver had been {{a founding member of the}} America First Committee, and more famously he was also on the 1972 antiwar ticket with George McGovern. In short, he represented much of what was good in the Democratic Party of his time.|$|E
25|$|Summaries of Jean's {{time as the}} Queen's {{representative}} emerged by mid-2010; Jean {{was regarded}} as having fulfilled the role in <b>an</b> <b>admirable,</b> though not perfect, fashion. It was noted that she used the office, her speaking abilities, and photogenic nature to Canada's advantage, promoting freedom, human rights, and urban youth, and to bring attention to socio-economic problems in the country's north. She was commended for her dedication to the arts, Aboriginal Canadians, the Armed Forces, and her outreach to Haiti following the earthquake there, but critiqued for specific incidents, such as referring to herself as Canada's head of state and making public comments that skirted the political. Her ability to personally connect with those she met was also noted, {{as well as her}} frequent displays of emotion; commentators dubbed her the empathizer-in-chief.|$|E

25|$|S. L. Bhyrappa, {{a charismatic}} young writer, {{first came to}} {{attention}} in the 1960s with his first novel Dharmasri, although it was his Vamsavriksha ("Family Tree", 1966) that {{put him in the}} spotlight as one of Kannada's most popular novelists. It is a story of a respected scholar, Srinivasa Srotri, his family and their long-held values. The protagonist's young and widowed daughter-in-law wishes to remarry, putting his family tradition at risk. Bhyrappa's best novel of the period was Grihabhanga ("Breaking of a Home", 1970), a story of a woman surviving under tragic circumstances. The characters in the story are rustic and often use vulgar language. His other important novel is Parva, a major work in Kannada fiction acclaimed as <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> attempt at recreating life on the sub-continent {{during the time of the}} epic Mahabharata.|$|E
25|$|It {{is in the}} {{introduction}} and the narrative that Lysias is seen at his best. In his greatest extant speechthat Against Eratosthenesand also in the fragmentary Olympiacus, he has pathos and fire; but these were not characteristic qualities of his work. In Cicero's judgment (De Orat. iii. 7, 28) Demosthenes was peculiarly distinguished by force (vis), Aeschines by resonance (sonitus); Hypereides by acuteness (acumen); Isocrates by sweetness (suavitas); the distinction which he assigns to Lysias is subtilitas, an Attic refinementwhich, as he elsewhere says (Brutus, 16, 64) is often joined to <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> vigour (lacerti). Nor was it oratory alone to which Lysias rendered service; his work had an important effect on all subsequent Greek prose, by showing how perfect elegance could be joined to plainness. Here, in his artistic use of familiar idiom, he might fairly be called the Euripides of Attic prose. His style has attracted interest from modern readers, because it is employed in describing scenes from the everyday life of Athens.|$|E
25|$|In New Zealand {{there are}} 520 clubs, 141,726 {{registered}} players and 2309 referees. In colonial New Zealand, rugby football served to hold {{loyalty to the}} Crown within the emigrant population, whilst introducing British culture to the Māori population. It was the New Zealand Natives' Rugby Tour of 1888/89 showed that New Zealand could compete with other nations, something they had trouble doing in another traditional sport, cricket. Similarly, the 1905-06 tour, in which the All Blacks went very close to a clean sweep tour (one loss against Wales), helped {{to create a sense}} of national pride around the All Blacks, as they appeared physically superior and pulled off <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> performance on their British tour. It is also thought that this saw the emergence of the Kiwi as a national symbol. Rugby dominates New Zealand's sports media. Being the unofficial national winter sport of New Zealand, Rugby attracts large sporting attendances and viewership. As many as 5000 people have turned out to watch All Black training sessions, while the final of 2011 Rugby World Cup was the single most watched television event in New Zealand history. There is a pay TV channel dedicated to rugby in New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|England won {{the first}} Test by a convincing ten wicket margin after Bedser took 11 wickets on debut and Hardstaff scored 205 not out. On {{each of the first}} two days the gates were closed about noon, when the crowds {{numbered}} nearly 30,000. Around 15,000 were present on the third day, on which the match finished at half past one. India won the toss and batted first but, with heavy rain having fallen, this proved anything but an advantage as the ground was wet throughout the first day to make run-scoring difficult. With the weather improving on the day {{prior to the start of}} the Test, the MCC predicted a start in accordance to the scheduled time of 11:30. Wisden says that Bedser maintained <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> length at fast-medium pace, using swerve or spin to turn the ball appreciably from the sodden turf. Hardstaff's innings was one of great concentration and gave him his highest score in Test cricket after five and a quarter hours batting. He had great support from Gibb in a stand of 182 for the fifth wicket and some useful tailend contributions, especially by Smailes. India began the third day only 66 behind with six wickets in hand but Bedser and Wright caused a collapse which left England needing only 48 to win.|$|E
25|$|Episode two: Abdul and Liz - The {{couple in}} episode two, Abdul and Liz, {{have been married}} for eight years. During their married life, their dress sense has become almost {{identical}} and both dress in practical outdoor wear. Their clothing is so similar that they have to write on initials in order to differentiate between their own items. Liz feels that she does not have the knowledge about fashion to dress smartly and loathes clothes shopping. Abdul contacted the show originally, fearing that their clothing has a negative impact on their self-confidence and social life, but Liz however feels {{that they do not have}} a problem. For dinner parties, Abdul is keen to dress smarter, but feels obliged to dress down to match a more casual Liz. Liz has a demanding job, often coping with a sixty-hour week. Soon into Woodall and Constantine's arrival, they discover that Abdul and Liz sleep in separate beds, so as not to disturb each other. When the couple are revealed behind the silhouette screen, Woodall and Constantine see <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> figure on Liz that has been hidden by her unflattering clothing. In the makeover, Trinny dresses Liz in a fitted trouser suit and waistcoat to accentuate her figure. To give Abdul more youth, Susannah fitts him with a tailored suit and purple shirt.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSpace Weather, Environment and Societies, by J. Lilensten and J. Bornarel, {{attempts}} to bring space weather into the limelight {{as a new}} science and as a phenomenon with increasingly serious impacts on civilization. The {{main part of the}} book consists of two chapters that describe the physics of the Sun and of the Earth, followed by a third and concluding chapter that contains a summary of space weather effects on technical systems. <b>As</b> <b>admirable</b> as the goal of this book is, it never quite strikes a consistent chord in terms of content, organization, accuracy, or readability. Originally in French, and translated into English presumably by the authors and several cited English translation readers, the book nonetheless contains many English usage errors, which further mar its message...|$|R

500|$|Entertainment Weekly critic Thom Geier {{suggested}} that the ending was underdeveloped, but that the play was well-executed: [...] "Akhtar packs a lot into his scenes, {{in terms of both}} coincidence-heavy personal drama and talky disquisitions on religion and politics, but he usually manages to pull back from the edge of too-muchness. There is <b>an</b> <b>admirable</b> restraint to director Kimberly Senior's well-paced scenes. Mandvi, best known for his comedy, has a surprisingly commanding stage presence and captures the full range of his character's internal conflicts." ...|$|E
