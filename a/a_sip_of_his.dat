[...] On a hot summer day, she once asked a workman for <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cider. [...] When he refused, the broke her clay pipe in two and told the worker that the same thing would happen to his neck. [...] She {{also said that the}} Nanhattan Street house he was working on would burn to the ground, which it did years later.|$|E
60|$|Here, {{the little}} gentleman paused, {{and took a}} long pull at his brandy-and-water. Mr. Watkins Tottle took <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his,</b> stirred the fire, and assumed an air of {{profound}} attention.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Kybird hesitated {{and took}} <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> gin and water. Then he {{regarded}} {{the wife of}} his bosom with a calculating glance which at once excited that lady's easily kindled wrath.|$|E

50|$|An impromptu celebration {{breaks out}} when amateur brewmaster Verdeschi {{introduces}} the Command Centre staff to his latest concoction. Unfortunately, {{he has more}} enthusiasm than skill, and the critics are not kind; after <b>a</b> single <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> beer, <b>an</b> impish Maya transforms into Mister Hyde. The party is interrupted by a call from Logan and his assistant, Carla Cross, to indoctrinate them {{to life in the}} 22nd century. As Earth's environment was devastated by runaway pollution in the 21st century, humanity now resides exclusively in enormous, domed 'metro-complexes'. With the outside atmosphere rendered unbreathable, 'nature' is now simulacra produced by a personal tele-sensual system.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Cranley, taking <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soda water. He {{had dealt}} two cards, when {{his hands were}} {{suddenly}} grasped as in two vices, and cramped to the table. Barton had bent over from behind and caught him by the wrists.|$|E
6000|$|To oblige him, we at last took <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> [...] "arva tee," [...] {{and found}} it very crude, and strong as Lucifer. Curious to know whence it was obtained, we {{questioned}} him; when, lighting up with pleasure, he seized the taper, and led us outside the hut, bidding us follow.|$|E
5000|$|One {{of those}} places where you could take <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> native air was Russicum with the Russian church, with family icons and {{expensive}} Slavic rites. Brailovsky were parishioners of the church. Years later, Archpriest Alexander Sipyagin who knew Leonid Mikhailovich wrote in his obituary: [...] "Here, {{and especially in the}} Church of St. Anthony, the late felt like at home".|$|E
6000|$|... "The Captain" [...] took scant notice <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{comings and}} goings. He {{did not attempt}} to help him off with his coat, nor did he make an effort to add another log to the fire. He sat silent and {{practically}} motionless, save when from time to time he took <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mug <b>of</b> ale. But whenever the new-comer came within <b>his</b> immediate circle <b>of</b> vision he shot a glance at the latter's elegant attire--the well-cut coat, the striped waistcoat, the boots of fine leather--the glance was quick and comprehensive and full of scorn, a flash that lasted only an instant and was at once veiled again by the droop of the flaccid lids which hid the pale, keen eyes.|$|R
50|$|Farwell {{loses his}} canteen, and DeCruz offers him <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> water from <b>his</b> canteen, {{for the price}} of one gold bar. When the fee goes up to two bars, Farwell strikes DeCruz with a gold brick, killing him. Farwell {{continues}} to a highway, gradually discarding gold bars as their weight becomes increasingly burdensome. Finally, weak and dehydrated, he collapses. Farwell offers his last gold bar to a man in a futuristic car that has driven up, in exchange for water and a ride to the nearest town; but he dies a few moments later.|$|R

[...] {{cried the}} lieutenant-governor, who had overheard the {{foregoing}} discussion, and felt himself high enough in station {{to play a}} little with his dignity. [...] "I will take the matter into my own hands. It is time that the good Colonel came forth to greet his friends; else we shall be apt to suspect that he has taken <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> too much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Canary wine, in his extreme deliberation which cask it were best to broach in honor of the day! But since he is so much behindhand, I will give him a remembrancer myself!" ...|$|R

50|$|Up in {{the tank}} room, Del enters and finds Rodney hiding. Del {{explains}} {{to him that he}} knows Rodney has been smoking drugs, where the smell wafted through the air ducts. After offering food and scotch, Del comes clean and tells Rodney about Blossom, as well as the whole Peckham Pouncer story. Del promises to make it up to Rodney by taking him out for a big meal after giving him a shower, but Rodney informs him, as his older brother is taking <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> scotch and water, that {{he is not going to}} stand under the water after what he is been doing in it, causing Del to spit out his scotch and water in horror.|$|E
50|$|This subversive {{approach}} was also applied to God (first name Nigel), {{who makes the}} occasional appearance, originally played by David Swift, then in series 7 by Timothy West. God is usually portrayed as being quick-tempered and vengeful; in the series he says he created the universe accidentally, when he was messing about with some matter and energy. He put it down to have <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> drink and then, kaboom! he had a universe on his hands. Life on Earth was created for a bet, as Earth was dull viewing; God, {{for a bit of}} fun, sprinkled some mutating bacteria into the oceans and ran a book with the other Angels to see which one would evolve into a creature that would develop a language first; the Angel Gabriel's bacteria were doing very well until they randomly mutated into carrots, {{and it was one of}} the Seraphim whose bacteria eventually became Homo sapiens. God seems rather annoyed that things 'got out of hand'. In later series, we learn that God also has a mobile phone (although only the Angel Gabriel is supposed to have the number), and that God sends e-mails, but refuses to read any that he receives as he once got taken in by a scam from Nigeria.|$|E
60|$|The {{journey from}} Liverpool to London, {{like all other}} English journeys, is short. This {{is due to the}} fact that England is a small country: it {{contains}} only 50,000 square miles, whereas the United States, as every one knows, contains three and a half billion. I mentioned this fact to an English fellow passenger on the train, together with a provisional estimate of the American corn crop for 1922: but he only drew his rug about <b>his</b> knees, took <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> brandy from <b>his</b> travelling flask, and sank into a state resembling death. I contented myself with jotting down an impression of incivility and paid no further attention to my fellow traveller other than to read the labels on his lug gage and to peruse the headings <b>of</b> <b>his</b> newspaper by peeping over his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Mainwaring's {{mother and}} Eliza Cooper {{had always been}} {{intimate}} friends, and the coming and going {{of the young man}} during <b>his</b> leave <b>of</b> absence were looked upon in the house as quite a matter of course. Half a dozen times a week he would drop in to execute some little commission for the ladies, or, if Captain Cooper was at home, to smoke a pipe of tobacco with him, to <b>sip</b> <b>a</b> dram <b>of</b> <b>his</b> famous old Jamaica rum, or to play a rubber of checkers of an evening. It is not likely that either of the older people was the least aware of the real cause <b>of</b> <b>his</b> visits; still less did they suspect that any passages of sentiment had passed between the young people.|$|R
60|$|Nor even {{in after}} years, {{nor in the}} light of that which {{afterwards}} occurred, could Barnaby repeat all that was said to him upon that occasion, for what with the pounding and beating <b>of</b> <b>his</b> aching head, and what with the wonder of what he had seen, he was altogether in the dark as to the greater part of what the other told him. That other began by saying that Barnaby, instead of being sorry that he was William Brand's grandson, might thank God for it; that he (Barnaby) had been watched and cared for for twenty years in more ways than he would ever know; that Sir John Malyoe had been watched also for all that while, and that it was a vastly strange thing that Sir John Malyoe's debts in England and Barnaby's coming of age should have brought them so together in Jamaica--though, after all, it was all for the best, as Barnaby himself should presently see, and thank God for that also. For now all the debts against that villain Jack Malyoe were settled in full, principal and interest, to the last penny, and Barnaby was to enjoy it the most of all. Here the fellow took <b>a</b> very comfortable <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grog, and then went on to say with a very cunning and knowing wink of the eye that Barnaby was not the only passenger aboard, but that there was another in whose company he would be glad enough, no doubt, to finish the balance of the voyage he was now upon. So now, if Barnaby was sufficiently composed, he should be introduced to that other passenger. Thereupon, without waiting for a reply, he incontinently arose and, putting away the bottle of rum and the glasses, went across the saloon--Barnaby watching him all the while like a man in a dream--and opened the door of a cabin like that which Barnaby had occupied a little while before. He was gone only for a moment, for almost immediately he came out again ushering a lady before him.|$|R
40|$|On a café terrace {{across from}} a plank of sand, the Atlantic’s {{powerful}} waves stroke the African shoreline. Mahjoud Khachai, an unemployed journalist in his early forties, leans forward away from the low back of a plastic outdoor chair on the café terrace where we are sitting. “I’m {{going to tell you}}, ” he says, “I’m going to tell you where we are. We are on the Edge. ” He rests his arms on the table that is littered with an ashtray, emptied glasses of coca cola, and half full cups of espresso. “We are on the Edge. I’ll tell you this fact. This is Morocco. We Moroccans are at the forefront of Africans and Arabs. This is not to be debated. What is to be investigated is why. ” He stops speaking to take <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> espresso, sets the cup down in a brief elegant motion and returns his hands to an open fold on the table. “This is the question: Why?… ” He pauses again and looks across the table in a pointed gesture of certainty and announces with a light smile, “I’m going to tell you…. ” As Mahjoud and I talk the hum of the Atlantic’s tide drifts across the sand. We speak at the shoreline- that point at which fluidity and groundedness encounter one...|$|E
