5000|$|According to Reuters correspondents, the {{situation}} in Somalia may {{not be easy to}} change as many actors derive benefits from the lack of a strong central authority, including some politicians, power brokers, militants, pirate kingpins, smugglers, traders, financiers and aid contractors. Attempts at reform have consequently often been sabotaged. However, British Foreign Minister William Hague indicated that the time was ripe for international collaboration on Somalia since there were [...] "glimmers of hope" [...] in the lead-up to the meeting, among which Hague cited the ousting of militants from the capital Mogadishu, a successful anti-terrorism policy, progress on the piracy issue, and the chance to establish a more broad-based, representative federal government after the <b>interim</b> administration's <b>mandate</b> ends in August.|$|R
40|$|<b>Mandating</b> <b>interim</b> {{reporting}} is lively discussed in Europe, {{especially since the}} European Union has set up mandatory quarterly reporting on the agenda. By examining the Swiss stock market, in which interim reporting became mandatory in 1997, we find that tightening disclosure frequency by <b>mandating</b> <b>interim</b> financial reports has a very limited and thus not convincing impact on information asymmetry. We suspect that firms that did not provide interim reports {{on a voluntary basis}} prior to the new rules potentially anticipated the insignificance of a greater information environment in their specific situation and thus reasonably chose not to publish costly interim reports. Further analysis supports this hypothesis and documents that firms affected by the new rules did not experience an enhancement in their information environment simply because they have already been characterized by lower information asymmetry before the regulation became effective. They thus obviously chose other disclosure channels possibly more appropriate in their specific situation in order to decrease information asymmetry. The question whether firms should really be obliged to provide financial interim reports must therefore be further challenged by asking for the objectives of the regulation. If the main objective is decreasing information asymmetry, our results suggest that regulation partly fails...|$|R

From the central province of Shoa, Menelik set off to subjugate and incorporate ‘the lands and people of the South, East and West into an empire.’ He did this with the help of Ras Gobena's Shewan Oromo militia, began expanding his kingdom to the south and east, expanding into areas that had not been held since the invasion of Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, and other areas that had never been under his rule, resulting in the borders of Ethiopia of today. Menelik had signed the Treaty of Wichale with Italy in May 1889, in which Italy would recognize Ethiopia’s sovereignty so long as Italy could control a small area of northern Tigray (part of modern Eritrea). In return Italy, was to provide Menelik with arms and support him as emperor. The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to further expand their territorial claims. Italy began a state funded program of resettlement for landless Italians in Eritrea, which increased tensions between the Eritrean peasants and the Italians. This conflict erupted in the Battle of Adwa on 1 March 1896, in which Italy’s colonial forces were defeated by the Ethiopians.|$|R
40|$|IntroductionThe 2007 <b>Interim</b> Rule <b>mandated</b> {{changes to}} food {{packages}} in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) for implementation by 2009. The 2014 Final Rule required additional changes, including increasing the cash value voucher for {{fruits and vegetables}} from $ 6 to $ 8 for children by June 2014, and allowing only low-fat (1 %) or nonfat milk for mothers and children aged 2 to 4 years by October 2014. This study evaluated {{the effect of the}} 2014 Final Rule changes on the food environment of small and mid-sized WIC-authorized grocery stores. MethodsWe analyzed secondary data using a natural experimental design to compare the percentage of shelf space for low-fat and nonfat milk and the number of fresh fruit and vegetable varieties in stock before and after the changes. We collected observational data on 18 small and mid-sized WIC-authorized grocery stores in Nashville, Tennessee, using the Nutrition Environment Measures in Store tool in March 2014 and February 2016. ResultsThe mean percentage of shelf space occupied by low-fat and nonfat milk increased from 2. 5 % to 14. 4 % (P =. 003), primarily because of an increase in the proportion of low-fat milk (P =. 001). The mean number of fresh fruit and vegetable varieties increased from 24. 3 to 27. 7 (P =. 01), with a significant increase for vegetables (P =. 008) but not fruit. ConclusionAvailability of low-fat milk and variety of fresh vegetables increased after the Final Rule changes in the observed stores. Future research should examine outcomes in other cities.
