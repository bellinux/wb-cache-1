5|$|That {{starting}} field position proved <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> the Virginia Tech defense, {{which only}} allowed 200total {{yards in the}} game. Tech linebacker Vince Hall led the Hokies and all defensive players with 13tackles in the game. Tech recorded one interception during the game, courtesy of Brenden Hill, who also made threetackles. Georgia's offensive line, despite starting only six scholarship offensive linemen, allowed just twosacks to the Virginia Tech defense. Chris Ellis and Noland Burchette each earned a single sack, accounting for a loss of 15totalyards.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{indicated that}} they believed both sides' criticism would prove ultimately impotent and that the negative publicity would prove <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> the film's box office. Nonetheless, the film trilogy has not been continued, prompting actor Sam Elliott to blame censorship and the Catholic Church.|$|E

25|$|The {{opening of}} the Nathu La pass on 6 July 2006, {{connecting}} Lhasa, Tibet, to India, was billed as <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> Sikkim's economy. Trade through the pass remains hampered by Sikkim's limited infrastructure and government restrictions in both India and China, though the volume of traded goods has been steadily increasing.|$|E
25|$|Anchorage at Valletta was <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> career officers, but the {{conditions}} for conscripted sailors, locked in the holds or engaged in hard work, were atrocious. The crew of Alexander Nevsky openly revolted and was promptly suppressed by Geiden. He court-martialled sixteen men for hard work in Siberia; in January–March 1828 they were locked on board the Azov and then sent back to Russia. Azovs own records bear only a slight hint of sailors' discontentment.|$|E
25|$|Upon victory, {{the gods}} {{retreated to the}} city of Yu-Shan to oversee from on high, and granted the Exalted the Creation-Ruling Mandate as <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> their service to the new order. The {{surrendered}} Primordials were banished to/became the Hell known as Malfeas, the Demon City. Now they are half-remembered only as the Yozis: ill-understood and impersonal cosmic deities whose continued worship is reckoned among the highest of heresies. The slain Primordials are known as the Neverborn, quiescent monsters whose impossible ending resulted {{in the formation of the}} Underworld.|$|E

50|$|From {{a modest}} start, {{the school has}} grown big enough to reach the horizon through the {{goodwill}} and generosity of the wider Indian expatriate community.

25|$|North Carolina {{was hard}} {{hit by the}} Great Depression, but the New Deal {{programs}} of Franklin D. Roosevelt for cotton and tobacco significantly helped the farmers. After World War II, the state's economy grew rapidly, highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in the Piedmont. Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill form the Research Triangle, a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research. In the 1990s, Charlotte became a major regional and national banking center.

25|$|In March 2014, The New York Times {{reported}} that economic fallout from Snowden's leaks had been <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> foreign companies, {{to the detriment}} of U.S. firms. Daniel Castro, a senior analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, predicted that the United States cloud computing industry could lose $35 billion by 2016. Matthias Kunisch, a German software executive who switched from U.S. cloud computing providers to Deutsche Telekom, said that due to Snowden his customers thought American companies had connections to the NSA. Security analysts estimated that U.S. tech companies had since Snowden collectively spent millions and possibly billions of dollars adding state-of-the-art encryption features to consumer services and to the cables that link data centers.|$|E
25|$|Albania {{entered an}} {{orbit around the}} Soviet Union, and in September 1948 Moscow stepped in to {{compensate}} for Albania's loss of Yugoslav aid. The shift proved to be <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> Albania because Moscow had far more to offer than hard-strapped Belgrade. The fact that the Soviet Union had no common border with Albania also appealed to the Albanian regime because it {{made it more difficult}} for Moscow to exert pressure on Tirana. In November at the First Party Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor (APL), the former Albanian Communist Party renamed at Stalin's suggestion, Hoxha pinned the blame for the country's woes on Yugoslavia and Xoxe. Hoxha had Xoxe sacked as internal affairs minister in October, replacing him with Shehu. After a secret trial in May 1949, Xoxe was executed. The subsequent anti-Titoist purges in Albania brought the liquidation of 14 members of the party's 31 person Central Committee and 32 of the 109 People's Assembly deputies. Overall, the party expelled about 25% of its membership. Yugoslavia responded with a propaganda counterattack, canceled its treaty of friendship with Albania, and in 1950 withdrew its diplomatic mission from Tirana.|$|E

500|$|In {{her essay}} [...] "Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas: The Gift of the Muppets", Catherine Edwards {{describes}} The Land of Gorch sketches {{as a critical}} flop, but interprets this as <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> Muppet fans, since {{the failure of the}} skits resulted in Henson's next venture, The Muppet Show.|$|E
500|$|The {{presence}} of Pittsburgh Reduction Company (later Alcoa) provided <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> development. On Thanksgiving Day 1888, {{with the help}} of Alfred E.

500|$|In 1906, L.A. Nadeau of the Northern Pacific Railroad {{predicted}} a railroad {{link to the}} ocean would allow gold miners to bring in heavy equipment and process large amounts of low-grade ore. [...] "Not only will {{the cost of living}} be cheaper to the miner, but {{he will be able to}} get his heavy machinery at a price low enough to enable him to work a vast quantity of low-grade ground, which cannot be touched under present conditions." [...] Eight years after that remark, the U.S. Congress appropriated $35 million for construction of the Alaska Railroad system. News of the appropriation set off celebrations among Fairbanks residents who hoped its construction would prove <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> the local economy.|$|E

5000|$|Outside the Internet, the {{response}} was less positive. Larry Irving, {{the assistant secretary of}} commerce, said that a lack of safeguards would [...] "slow down the growth of what is likely to be <b>a</b> major <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> consumers and business".

500|$|In 1994, Hamburg University in Germany gave Kaspersky's {{software}} {{first place}} in a competitive analysis of antivirus software. This led to more business for Kaspersky from European and American companies. Kaspersky Lab was founded three years later by Kaspersky, his wife and Kaspersky's friend. Natalya, who pushed Eugene to start the company, was the CEO, while Eugene {{was the head of}} research. The following year, the CIH virus (AKA the Chernobyl virus) created <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> Kaspersky's anti-virus products, which Kaspersky said was the only software at the time that could cleanse the virus. According to Wired, [...] "their software was advanced for the time." [...] For example, it was the first software to monitor viruses in an isolated quarantine.|$|E
500|$|Leaving {{exhausted}} lands, {{his family}} joined the westward migration out of Virginia and settled near what developed as Louisville, Kentucky, on the Ohio River. Taylor {{grew up in}} a small woodland cabin before his family moved to a brick house with increased prosperity. The rapid growth of Louisville was <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> Taylor's father, who came to own [...] throughout Kentucky by the start of the 19th century; he held 26 slaves to cultivate the most developed portion of his holdings. There were no formal schools on the Kentucky frontier, and Taylor had a sporadic formal education. A schoolmaster recalled Taylor as a quick learner. His early letters show a weak grasp of spelling and grammar, and his handwriting was later described as [...] "that of a near illiterate".|$|E

A contract was signed on February 14, 1912, designating Norwich as the home of the Thermos Plant. In return, Thermos would include the city's name in the company's advertisements. Thermos would even mark the products produced in Norwich with [...] "Made in Norwich". Allyn L. Brown acted as attorney and provided counsel for the deal. [...] The construction of the plant was <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> Norwich, which helped the employment of the area after the decline of the textile industry. The operations expanded into nearby Taftville, operating until they were phased out and shut down in 1988.|$|E

40|$|The new WIC {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} package will create a $ 500 million market annually for produce. Even if 10 % of these benefits were spent at farmers markets, it would provide <b>a</b> big <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> access to local food and to small farmers.

500|$|Mythily Ramachandran of Gulf News {{praised the}} film's humour and performances: [...] "The anger and hatred one often {{associates}} with a revenge tale is missing"; humour takes over, {{and the film}} [...] "busts the notion that revenge tales must be laden with gore and violence". According to Deepa Gauri of the Khaleej Times, Maheshinte Prathikaram is <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> a Malayalam cinema with an [...] "identity crisis".

Raj Vikram of Metromatinee.com also gave a positive review: [...] "There {{is not a single}} scene in the film which appears cooked up ... He [...] must be commended for being sure-footed about what he intended to portray". Vikram praised the performances by Faasil and the supporting cast, the [...] "magnificent camera" [...] and the [...] "songs which seamlessly and melodiously merge with the narrative", concluding that it [...] "is a movie that is true to itself.

In March 1932, Cole accepted an invitation from the Lord Mayor of Melbourne to serve as Deputy Chairman of the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race from England to Australia, to celebrate Melbourne's Centenary. Provision of the RAAF's radio facilities and technicians was considered <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> contestants, though Cole later recorded that his role involved [...] "twenty months' hard work, without pay... with loads of scurrilous and other criticism". Promoted to group captain in January 1935, he became the inaugural commanding officer (CO) of Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, on 20April 1936. The new headquarters, which had been formed from elements of two of the base's lodger units, No.3 Squadron and No.2 Aircraft Depot, supplanted an earlier arrangement where the CO of No.3 Squadron had doubled as the station commander. Cole was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Coronation Honours of 11May 1937, and attended the Imperial Defence College in London the following year. He returned to RAAF Station Laverton as CO in February 1939, taking over from Group Captain Henry Wrigley.|$|E

50|$|Critics {{oppose the}} treaty {{on the grounds}} that it will weaken European {{consumer}} rights, including those concerning food safety, and that tariffs are already very low.

The deal also includes a controversial investor-state dispute settlement mechanism. In contrast to its popularity among Canadians, the agreement has prompted protests in a number of European countries.|$|R
