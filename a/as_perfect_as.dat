25|$|Aside {{from the}} rise of Marxism, E. Screpanti and S. Zamagni point to a {{different}} 'external' reason for marginalism's success, which is its successful response to the Long Depression and the resurgence of class conflict in all developed capitalist economies after the 1848-1870 period of social peace. Marginalism, Screpanti and Zamagni argue, offered a theory {{of the free market}} <b>as</b> <b>perfect,</b> <b>as</b> performing optimal allocation of resources, while it allowed economists to blame any adverse effects of laissez-faire economics on the interference of workers' coalitions in the proper functioning of the market.|$|E

In 1998, lonely New Yorker Wally Winthrop is obsessed with King Edward VIII's abdication of the British throne for the woman he loved, American divorcée Wallis Simpson.

Weaving back and forth in time, W.E. intertwines Wally's journey of discovery in New York with the story of Wallis and Edward, from the early days of their romance to the unraveling of their lives in the decades that followed.|$|E

If you find his motive, you find the murderer". Kaner argues that this logic is {{more in line with}} what Mulder has subscribed to throughout the series.

To do so, she works heavily with Kristoff, Sven and Olaf to make this a reality. Upon making sure that her surprise party in the palace courtyard is ready, she leaves Kristoff in charge while she goes to get Anna. However, Elsa starts to come down with a cold as she leads Anna on a treasure hunt to find all the gifts that have been made for her. Without realizing it, each sneeze she makes creates small snowmen called [...] "snowgies", which create trouble for Kristoff, Sven and Olaf. As Anna notices Elsa's cold getting worse, she tries in vain to get Elsa to stop exerting herself, even taking medicine from Oaken in case Elsa gets sicker. Unfortunately, Elsa's cold cause her to become very tired and behave in a seemingly intoxicated-like manner, and she nearly falls from Arendelle's clock tower only for Anna to save her. Upon finally admitting to Anna that she is indeed sick after the previous incident, she allows Anna to escort her home feeling she has ruined everything, and finds that the party has gone off successfully for Anna (as well as discovering her snowgie creations), and still slightly intoxicated, she ends the party by accidentally sneezing into the birthday bugle horn, which inadvertently sends a gigantic snowball {{all the way to the}} Southern Isles and hits the now-demoted Hans, causing him to fall into a pile of horse manure. Afterwards, Anna tells a now bed-ridden Elsa that she has given her the best birthday ever by letting her take care of her.|$|E

The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up—first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was <b>as</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>as</b> possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them.
