50|$|The first superdeformed {{states to}} be {{observed}} were the fission isomers, low-spin states of elements in the <b>actinide</b> and lanthanide <b>series.</b> The strong force decays much faster than the Coulomb force, which becomes stronger when nucleons are greater than 2.5 femtometers apart. For this reason, these elements undergo spontaneous fission. In the late 1980s, high-spin superdeformed rotational bands were observed in {{other regions of the}} periodic table.

However, this resemblance in not unique to lutetium and lawrencium, but is common among all the late lanthanides and actinides.|$|E

For example, the half-life of 256No is almost three seconds, {{but that of}} 258No is only 1.2milliseconds. This shows that at nobelium, the mutual repulsion of protons poses a limit to the region of long-lived nuclei in the <b>actinide</b> <b>series.</b> The even-odd nobelium isotopes mostly continue to have longer half-lives as their mass numbers increase, with {{a dip in the}} trend at 257No.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the many}} {{different}} and unknown radioactive half-lives in the experiment's results showed that several nuclear reactions were occurring, Fermi's group could not prove that element 93 was being created unless they could isolate it chemically. They and many other scientists attempted to accomplish this, including Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner who were among the best radiochemists {{in the world at}} the time and supporters of Fermi's claim, but they all failed. Much later, it was determined that the main reason for this failure was because the predictions of element 93's chemical properties were based on a periodic table which lacked the <b>actinide</b> <b>series.</b> This arrangement placed protactinium below tantalum, uranium below tungsten, and further suggested that element 93, at that point referred to as eka-rhenium, should be similar to the group 7 elements, including manganese and rhenium. Thorium, protactinium, and uranium, with their dominant oxidation states of +4, +5, and +6 respectively, fooled scientists into thinking they belonged below hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten, rather than below the lanthanide series, which was at the time viewed as a fluke, and whose members all have dominant +3 states; neptunium, on the other hand, has a much weaker, more unstable +7 state, with +4 and +5 being the most stable. Upon finding that plutonium and the other transuranic elements also have dominant +3 and +4 states, along with the discovery of the f-block, the <b>actinide</b> <b>series</b> was firmly established.|$|E

40|$|Atomic scale {{simulations}} {{have been}} performed investigating various phenomena governing nuclear fuel performance during reactor operation and during post irradiation storage or disposal. Following a review {{of some of the}} key features of irradiated nuclear fuel, such as fission product distribution, two key factors were identified as the focus for this investigation: i) the role of uranium dioxide non-stoichiometry and ii) the effect of temperature. The former has been carried out using a previous pair potential model, whilst a new many-body potential was developed to enable temperature effects to be studied over the full range of temperatures of interest. Secondary oxide precipitates are known to exist in irradiated nuclear fuel with Ba, Sr and Zr precipitating to form the perovskite (Ba,Sr) ZrO 3 grey phase. The binary BaO, SrO and ZrO 2 may also be formed. The precipitation enthalpies of these oxides were predicted as a function of hyper-stoichiometry. Additionally, CrUO 4 can also precipitate from Cr-doped UO 2 +x. The possibility of fission product segregation to the phases from UO 2 or UO 2 +x was also investigated with a broad range of species preferring segregation from stoichiometric UO 2. The role of defect cluster configuration on vacancy mediated uranium migration was investigated for UO 2 and UO 2 +x. In both cases the lowest enthalpy migration pathway involved reconfiguration of the cluster to a metastable configuration. Furthermore, there were {{a very large number of}} alternative pathways that had similar migration enthalpies, especially for UO 2 +x. A new potential model was developed that uses a novel approach to include many-body interactions in the description of the <b>actinide</b> oxide <b>series.</b> This represents a significant improvement on previous models in the ability to describe the thermal expansion, specific heat capacity and elastic properties of CeO 2, ThO 2, UO 2, NpO 2, PuO 2, AmO 2 and CmO 2 from 300 to 3000 K. Using the new model the thermal expansion, specific heat capacity, oxygen diffusivity and thermal conductivity of the mixed oxides (UxTh 1 -x) O 2 and (UxPu 1 -x) O 2 were predicted. Enhanced oxygen diffusion and a degradation in thermal conductivity were predicted in terms of the non-uniform cation sublattice. Open Acces...|$|R

I present a detailed optical study of compounds from the 3 main categories of the periodic system: iron <b>series,</b> <b>actinides</b> and rare earth elements represented by Fe, U and Gd atoms. In FeGe, with Tc= 280 K, I find a moderate mass enhancement below 100 meV, indicating the formation of heavy electrons.

5|$|The <b>actinide</b> <b>series</b> derives {{its name}} from the first element in the series, actinium. The {{informal}} chemical symbol An is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide. All but one of the actinides are f-block elements, with the exception being either actinium or lawrencium. The series mostly corresponds to the filling of the 5f electron shell, although actinium and thorium lack any f-electrons, and curium and lawrencium have the same number as the preceding element. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence. They all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties. While actinium and the late actinides (from americium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry, with neptunium and plutonium occupying an intermediate position.|$|E
40|$|The {{transuranic}} metals, neptunium and plutonium, {{are strong}} alpha emitters {{and have to}} be handled under special conditions to safeguard the health of those working with them. The most common method of containing these metals is to use glove boxes but in certain circumstances it is possible to encapsulate specimens for experimental purposes. The relative merits of the use of glove boxes and sealed capsules for cryogenic experiments are discussed in this thesis. A further consequence of the high alpha activity of these metals is their property of self heating. This self heat {{is a result of the}} absorption by the crystal lattice of the kinetic energies of the alpha particle and the recoil nucleus. At room temperature this has little or no effect on the physical properties of these metals but at low temperatures it is possible for the defects produced in the lattice to remain in equilibrium with their surroundings. The resistivities of alpha and delta stabilised plutonium, neptunium and uranium 233 are found to increase when these metals are held at low temperatures for long periods of time. Little work on the self-irradiation of uranium 233 and neptunium has been undertaken because of their low self heats and the consequent long self-irradiation times necessary to cause a significant increase in their low temperature resistivities. The storage and annealing of defects in alpha and delta stabilised plutonium have however been studied in considerable detail. The resistivity of alpha plutonium has an extremely anomalous temperature dependence. As the temperature falls from room temperature the resistivity first rises slowly to a maximum at ~  195 °K, then drops sharply as the temperature is further lowered to zero. Its residual resistivity is high and very sensitive to small impurity concentrations. It is found that over a period of about 5, 000 hours at ~  5 °K the resistivity of alpha plutonium increases from between ~  20 and ~  5 μΩ cm. to approximately 140 - 145 μΩ cm.; some 15 - 20 μΩ cm. lower than the value of the resistivity maximum and ~  105 °K. Furthermore the additional resistivity caused by self-irradiation at ~  5 °K does not obey Matthiessen's rule and it is found that after long periods of self-irradiation at ~  5 °K the resistivity measured at ~  77 °K has decreased by about 15 - 20 μΩ cm. More detailed investigation of the increase in resistivity during self-irradiation at ~  5 °K shows that the additional resistivity decreases steadily with increase in temperature, becoming zero at ~  55 °K and then negative above ~  55 °K. In contrast, self-irradiation at ~  77 °K causes an increase in the resistivity both at ~  5 °K and ~  77 °K. The resistivity of delta stabilised plutonium also increases when held at low temperatures for long periods of time. The initial rate of resistivity increase is however much lower than that of alpha plutonium and is found to be dependent on the concentration of aluminium used to stabilise the delta phase. Although the resistivity of delta stabilised plutonium increases initially at a lower rate than alpha plutonium it does not saturate so quickly and eventually rises to values considerably in excess of that of its original resistivity maximum. The additional resistivity produced in alpha plutonium is found to anneal in two distinct stages. The first stage is centred about 80 °K and analysis shows that the activation energy of the recovery process is approximately 0. 2 eV. At 90 °K the anneal is found to be characterised by second order reaction kinetics but it is difficult to analyse simply anneals carried out at ~  77 °K. The second annealing stage in alpha plutonium is centred at ~  160 °K and gradual annealing occurs up to room temperature where all but a few percent of the original resistivity increase have annealed. It is found that annealing in delta stabilised plutonium sets in at a lower temperature than in alpha plutonium, that the first annealing stage in delta plutonium is enhanced at the expense of the second stage and that a larger percentage of the resistivity increase remained unannealed after warming to room temperature. None of the theories proposed to explain the low temperature properties of plutonium has as yet gained universal acceptance and it is therefore difficult to give an unequivocal explanation of the results presented in this thesis. The various theories of the low temperature properties of plutonium are reviewed and discussed and it is shown that the behaviour of alpha and delta stabilised plutonium during self-irradiation may be best explained by assuming that they are both anti-ferromagnetic at low temperatures. Such an assumption is not unreasonable in view of the close similarity between the <b>actinide</b> and lanthanide <b>series</b> of metals. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} {{heat of the}} transuranic metals, plutonium and neptunium, has been measured below room temperature. Both these metals are strong α-emitters and are extremely toxic. As a consequence {{they have to be}} handled under special conditions, and the usual methods are either by containment in glove boxes or by encapsulation. The latter method has been adopted here and developed such that the calorimeter formed the encapsulation, and the canned specimens could then be handled in an inactive cryostat. A further consequence of the high α-activity of these metals is their property of 'self-heating', which makes the determination of their {{specific heat}} by the conventional continuous-heating method impossible. The magnitude of the self-heat, particularly of plutonium, meant that a continuous heating method had to be evolved which could deal with the inevitable high rates of rise of temperature. A cryostat and measuring system were constructed and developed such that the specific heat could still be determined with reasonable accuracy. A control system was also developed in order that an adiabatic technique could be employed. The self-heat is temperature independent and was utilised as a constant power supply to the calorimeter. A review of the literature values of the half-lives and decay energies of the various radioactive isotopes present in any sample of a transuranic metal, is given since the calculation of the self heat is critically dependent of these quantities. The specific heat (C P) of α-plutonium was not found to exhibit the large and irreproducible peaks which characterised the early work of Sandenaw. C P followed a smooth 'sigmoid' curve, except for a small 'excess' between 40 – 70 °K the magnitude of the excess (~  2. 5 – 3 %) was not sufficient to produce a maximum on C P. C P values were generally high, rising to a value of 7. 86 cals. /mole/deg. at 300 °K, and analysis of the data gave an electronic coefficient (γ) of 38 × 10 − 4 cals. /mole/deg. 2 and Debye theta (θ D) values between 150 and 170 °K in the temperature range ~  14 – 300 °K. Further analysis and separation of the excess, yielded a contribution to the specific heat which had the typical λ-shape of a magnetic transition, though the energy and entropy involved were extremely small. One of the main theories proposed to explain the unusual low temperature properties of plutonium {{is that there is a}} paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition at ~  60 °K, and the present specific heat work would indicate that this is not an unreasonable hypothesis. Lack of affirmative evidence from neutron diffraction experiments however has necessitated a review and discussion of the alternative theories proposed, and also a comparison with the known antiferromagnetic α-manganese, to which many parallels exist. Short term self-irradiation experiments were carried out on α-plutonium. The magnitude of the energy stored by the defects produced by storage at low temperatures, and the temperature range in which this annealed out, were found to give satisfactory agreement with the theoretical estimates and the self-irradiation damage effects previously observed on the electrical resistivity. The specific neat of α-neptunium was found to be a smooth curve throughout the range of measurement of ~  7. 5 – 300 °K, and the values of γ = 34 × 10 − 4 cals. /mole/deg. 2 and θ 0 = 187. 5 °K resulted from analysis of the low temperature region. No evidence of any magnetic phenomena which must always be in mind in view of the close similarities between the <b>actinide</b> and lanthanide <b>series</b> of metals, was seen on α-neptunium in keeping with the bulk of the other known properties. Neptunium however is still only available in very limited quantities and in a state of purity that is by no means high (~  99 %). In view of the large electronic coefficients observed in plutonium and neptunium, a discussion is given on the baud structures of the actinides in relation to their electronic properties. The analyses of the specific beat dats are dependent in the first place on a reduction of C P to C V. Lack of sufficient data on the expansion coefficients (α L) of plutonium and neptunium, led to the measurement of α L for these two metals in the temperature range 20 – 300 °K. A simple push-rod dilatometer technique was used, and expansion coefficients of ~  45 × 10 − 6 /deg. for α-Pu and ~  20 × 10 − 6 /deg. for α-Np were found. The Grüneisen gamma values were ~  2. 6 for α-Pu and ~  1. 8 for α-Np respectively. The development of reactor fuel materials has caused a great deal of interest to be centred on the carbides of uranium and plutonium. Since no previous specific heat determination had been carried out below roots temperature on PuC, this was investigated down to ~  12. 5 °K. Other low properties of this metallic carbide had again suggested antiferromagnetic behaviour below 100 °K. No evidence in support of this was found on the specific heat results though an extremely high density of states at the Fermi surface is suggested. The standard thermodynamic functions of plutonium, neptunium and plutonium monocarbide have been calculated and are tabulated in the appendices. </p...|$|R
5|$|A thorium atom has 90 electrons, {{of which}} four are valence electrons. Three atomic orbitals are {{theoretically}} {{available for the}} valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s. Despite thorium's position in the f-block of the periodic table, it has an anomalous 6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, {{even more so than}} the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. Such unusual behaviour is due to relativistic effects, which become stronger {{near the bottom of the}} periodic table, specifically the relativistic spin–orbit interaction. The closeness in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener cerium, for which +4 is the highest possible state but +3 also plays an important role and is more stable. Thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the <b>actinide</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare nobelium's chemical behavior to that of terbium, californium, and fermium. All four elements were reacted with chlorine and the resulting chlorides were deposited along a tube, along which they were carried by a gas. It {{was found that the}} nobelium chloride produced was strongly adsorbed on solid surfaces, proving that it was not very volatile, like the chlorides of the other three investigated elements. However, both NoCl2 and NoCl3 were expected to exhibit nonvolatile behavior and hence this experiment was inconclusive as to what the preferred oxidation state of nobelium was. Determination of nobelium's favoring of the +2 state had to wait until the next year, when cation-exchange chromatography and coprecipitation {{experiments were}} carried out on around fifty thousand 255No atoms, finding that it behaved differently from the other actinides and more like the divalent alkaline earth metals. This proved that in aqueous solution, nobelium is most stable in the divalent state when strong oxidizers are absent. Later experimentation in 1974 showed that nobelium eluted with the alkaline earth metals, between Ca2+ and Sr2+. Nobelium is the only f-block element for which the +2 state is the most common and stable one in aqueous solution. This occurs because of the large energy gap between the 5f and 6d orbitals {{at the end of the}} <b>actinide</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lawrencium is {{the final}} member of the <b>actinide</b> <b>series</b> and is {{sometimes}} {{considered to be a}} group 3 element, along with scandium, yttrium, and lutetium, as its filled f-shell is expected to make it resemble the 7th-period transition metals. In the periodic table, it is located {{to the right of the}} actinide nobelium, to the left of the 6d transition metal rutherfordium, and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties. Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.58), similar to its lighter congener lutetium, though this is not yet known experimentally. The enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352kJ·mol−1, close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 6d electrons delocalized, a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization, bulk modulus, and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium. Specifically, lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent, silvery metal, easily oxidized by air, steam, and acids, and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent metallic radius of 171pm. It is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15.6 to 16.6g·cm−3. It is also predicted to have a melting point of around 1900K (1627°C), not far from the value for lutetium (1925K).|$|E
5|$|The {{lanthanides}} and actinides, in {{the metallic}} state, can exist as either divalent (such as europium and ytterbium) or trivalent (most other lanthanides) metals. The former have fn+1s2 configurations, whereas the latter have fnd1s2 configurations. In 1975, Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted {{values for the}} cohesive energies (enthalpies of crystallization) of the metallic lanthanides and actinides, both as divalent and trivalent metals. The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the 5f136d17s2 configuration over the 5f147s2 configuration for nobelium {{was not enough to}} compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d, as is true also for the very late actinides: thus einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals, although for nobelium this prediction has not yet been confirmed. The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the <b>actinide</b> <b>series</b> concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons, which increases with increasing atomic number: an effect of this is that nobelium is predominantly divalent instead of trivalent, unlike all the other lanthanides and actinides. In 1986, nobelium metal was estimated to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 126kJ·mol−1, a value close to the values for einsteinium, fermium, and mendelevium and supporting the theory that nobelium would form a divalent metal. Like the other divalent late actinides (except the once again trivalent lawrencium), metallic nobelium should assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure. Divalent nobelium metal should have a metallic radius of around 197pm. Nobelium's melting point has been predicted to be 827°C, the same value as that estimated for the neighboring element mendelevium. Its density is predicted to be around 9.9±0.4g·cm−3.|$|E
