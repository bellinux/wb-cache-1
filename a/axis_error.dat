50|$|One of {{the initial}} {{adjustment}} overlooked by many new users is the lenses vertical parallax, that must {{not be confused with}} the horizontal parallax (set manually by the left rocker button). Although the lenses should be perfectly aligned, by design, there is a small vertical <b>axis</b> <b>error</b> inherent for each camera body. This error implies that all pictures (and videos as well) taken with a wrong vertical parallax are harder to look at, because one eye is looking up while the other is looking down. To effectively correct this optical discrepancy, the camera offers a vertical parallax correction in its menu system: MENU/SET/OPT AXIS CONTROL. The best way to use this adjustment is to zoom at maximum, take a picture, then analyse it with a software stereoscopic player(using row or column interlaced view) to obtain the subject at the same vertical level.|$|E
40|$|Background: Compensatory ocular counter-torsion (COCT) is {{supposed}} to maintain the eyes aligned with the visual environment following head tilt. Because of some recent controversies the functional capacity of this phenomenon was defined according {{to the extent of}} induced astigmatic <b>axis</b> <b>error</b> following head tilt. Materials and Methods: Objective autorefractometry was performed on 70 eyes with a regular astigmatism of ≥ 2 D at vertical, right head tilt and left head tilt positions of 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° and 25 °. Astigmatic <b>axis</b> <b>error</b> was calculated according to the difference between the defined axis at each tilted head position and the defined axis at the vertical head position. A tiltometer was used for this purpose to show the angle of head tilt without disturbing the process of refractometry. Results: The mean astigmatic <b>axis</b> <b>error</b> was 3. 2 ° ± 1. 5 ° and 18. 4 ° ± 4. 2 ° at the head tilt angles of 5 ° and 25 ° respectively. The mean percentage of tilt angle compensation by COCT was 36 % and 26 % at the head tilt angles of 5 ° and 25 ° respectively. There was a direct relation between the head tilt angle and the induced astigmatic <b>axis</b> <b>error</b> (ANOVA, P < 0. 001, 95 % of confidence interval [CI]). Astigmatic <b>axis</b> <b>error</b> values at right head tilt were significantly lower than their corresponding values at left head tilt (ANOVA, P = 0. 04 95 % CI). Conclusion: Any minimal angle of head tilt may cause erroneous measurement of astigmatic axis and should be avoided during refraction.

40|$|To {{maximise}} {{productivity and}} reduce scrap in high-value, low-volume production, five-axis machine tool (5 A-MT) motion accuracy must be verified quickly and reliably. Numerous metrology instruments {{have been developed}} to measure errors arising from geometric imperfections within and between machine tool axes (amongst other sources). One example is the TMBB, which is becoming an increasingly popular instrument to measure both linear and rotary <b>axis</b> <b>errors.</b> This research proposes new TMBB measurement technique to rapidly, accurately and reliably measure all position-independent rotary <b>axis</b> <b>errors</b> in a 5 A-MT. In this research two literature reviews have been conducted. The findings informed the subsequent development of a virtual machine tool (VMT). This VMT was used to capture the effects of rotary and linear <b>axis</b> position-independent geometric <b>errors,</b> and apparatus set-up errors on a variety of candidate measurement routines. This new knowledge then informed the design of an experimental methodology to capture specific phenomena that were observed within the VMT on a commercial 5 A-MT. Finally, statistical analysis of experimental measurements facilitated a quantification of the repeatability, strengths and limitations of the final testing method concept. The major contribution of this research is the development of a single set-up testing procedure to identify all 5 A-MT rotary <b>axis</b> location <b>errors,</b> whilst remaining robust in the presence of set-up and linear <b>axis</b> location <b>errors.</b> Additionally, a novel variance-based sensitivity analysis approach was used to design testing procedures. By considering the effects of extraneous error sources (set-up and linear location) in the design and validation phases, an added robustness was introduced. Furthermore, this research marks the first usage of Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis in conjunction with rotary axis TMBB testing. Experimental evidence has shown that the proposed corrections for set-up and linear <b>axis</b> <b>errors</b> are highly effective and completely indispensable in rotary axis testing of this kind. However, further development of the single set-up method is necessary, as geometric errors cannot always be measured identically at different testing locations. This has highlighted the importance of considering the influences on 5 A-MT component errors on testing results, as the machine tool axes cannot necessarily be modelled as straight lines...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} 5 -axis {{machining process}} requires a recurrent metrological calibration and controller based compensation {{of the machine}} axes to capacitate a sustained machining accuracy. However the metrological identification of the geometrical axis errors still necessitates a huge time and device related effort. Consequently the goal of current research work {{is to reduce the}} necessary metrological effort without decreasing the achievable improvement of the machining accuracy. This paper deals with an approach for systematic analyses of the <b>axis</b> <b>error</b> impact on the overall 5 -axis machining accuracy. The bases for the analyses are mathematical models that represent the transformation of the single axis errors on the overall three-dimensional machining accuracy. Within systematic analyses the impact of each single <b>axis</b> <b>error</b> can be evaluated independent of the error amount but in consideration of the axis configuration, the machine size as well as further parameters like tool and work piece size. The results show that the specific impact depends particularly on the machine size and the axis configuration.

This approach also gives the chance to realise a quick check calibration procedure by exploiting the developed mathematical models and the information about inferior and superior errors...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} provide actual {{information}} and attractive presentation, three-dimensional (3 D) information has been widely used for many purposes especially for documentation, management and analysis. As a non-contact 3 D sensor, terrestrial laser scanners (TLSs) have the cap{{ability to provide}} dense of 3 D data (point clouds) with speed and accuracy. However, similar to other optical and electronic sensors, data obtained from TLSs can be impaired by errors coming from different sources. In order to ensure the high quality of the data, a calibration routine is crucial for TLSs to make it suitable for accurate 3 D applications (e. g. industrial measurement, reverse engineering and monitoring). There are two calibration approaches available: 1) component, and 2) system calibration. Due to the requirement of special laboratories and tools to perform component calibration, the task cannot be carried out by most TLSs users. In contrast, system calibration only requires a room with appropriate targets. Through self-calibration, this study involved a system calibration for Faro Photon 120 scanner in a laboratory with dimensions of 15. 5 m x 9 m x 3 m and 138 well-distributed planar targets. Four calibration parameters were derived from well-known error sources of geodetic instruments.

The predictions started from an initial con-dition or members of a set of initial conditions, obtained in a reanalysis experiment. The predictions represent the transition from straight to meander of the Kuroshio path, and the results have been analyzed according to previously proposed mecha-nisms of the transition with eddy propagation and interaction acting as a trigger of the meander and self-sustained oscillation. The reanalysis shows that the meander evolves due to eddy activity. Simulation (no assimilation) shows no meander state, even with the same atmospheric forcing as the prediction.

However, the motor acceleration and braking processes can cause tripods to twist or tilt.

Typical scenarios such as "face change " and "set of angles " were simulated with a Leica TCA 2003 robot tacheometer. All measuring scenarios showed systematic horizontal twisting and tilting of the tripod, whereby tilting occurred to a considerably greater extent. It was shown that the twisting and tilting of the tripod remained in the position in which the direction measurements were taken, and that the order of magnitude of the tripod movements was dependent on the position of the instrument. The residual horizontal twisting of the tripod causes a change in direction of the line of sight and thus an error in orientation.
