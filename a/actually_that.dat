5|$|Accounts differ as to {{the cause}} of death; one version stated that he died by poison only and another view claimed he died by a self-inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule. Contemporary historians have {{rejected}} these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions. One eyewitness stated that Hitler's corpse showed signs of having been shot through the mouth, but this has been proven unlikely. There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments that were recovered. In 2009, American researchers performed DNA tests on a skull that Soviet officials had long believed to be that of Hitler. The tests and examination revealed that the skull was <b>actually</b> <b>that</b> of a woman less than 40 years old. The recovered jaw fragments were not tested.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Adam becomes {{friends with}} Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), who {{continuously}} hears a baby crying and finds things supposedly left for her by Sabrina, who is dead. The housekeeper Estella Munoz (Anne Betancourt) is blamed and arrested; however, Adam was secretly gaslighting Ashley. Adam dresses as Sabrina, scares Ashley and she falls down a staircase, {{causing her to}} miscarry her child, whose father is Victor. Adam then blackmails her doctor, Charles Taylor, into telling her that her child was still alive. Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman) is appointed to investigate Adam, who seduces him to divert his attention from Adam's criminal activity. Heather discovers Adam's affair with Rafe and ends her relationship with Adam. Ashley is admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where a pregnant Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) is also staying. Sharon goes into labor and Adam steals her daughter, Faith, and passes her off as Ashley’s child. Sharon believes her child had died, and guilt-ridden, Adam pursues a relationship with Sharon and they elope, but she leaves him when she remembers elements that contradict her losing her child. A note from a dying Charles Taylor saying that Ashley had miscarried and Faith is really Sharon and Nicholas’ daughter is found. Adam is jailed again, but gets the insane Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk) to help him escape to attend a masquerade ball, where he unsuccessfully begs Sharon for forgiveness. An explosion at the ball occurs and a burned corpse is positively identified as Adam. Nicholas is arrested for Adam's murder. The corpse is <b>actually</b> <b>that</b> of Richard Hightower, to whom Adam had donated bone marrow and carries Adam's DNA. Adam meets up with Skye Lockhart (Laura Stone) and they plot a confidence trick together, but Adam still dreams of Sharon.|$|E

500|$|Maes {{maintains}} that, {{regardless of}} what he was writing, Tchaikovsky's main concern was how his music impacted his listeners on an aesthetic level, at specific moments in the piece and on a cumulative level once the music had finished. What his listeners experienced on an emotional or visceral level became an end in itself. Tchaikovsky's focus on pleasing his audience might be considered closer to that of Mendelssohn or Mozart. Considering that he lived and worked in what was probably the last 19th century feudal nation, the statement is not <b>actually</b> <b>that</b> surprising. And yet, even when writing so-called 'programme music, for example his Romeo and Juliet fantasy overture, he cast it in sonata form. [...] His use of stylized 18th-century melodies and patriotic themes was geared toward the values of Russian aristocracy. He was aided in this by Ivan Vsevolozhsky, who commissioned The Sleeping Beauty from Tchaikovsky and the libretto for The Queen of Spades from Modest with their use of 18th century settings stipulated firmly. Tchaikovsky also used the polonaise frequently, the dance being a musical code for the Romanov dynasty and a symbol of Russian patriotism. Using it in the finale of a work could assure its success with Russian listeners.|$|E

The Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away, but the animals are wary of her and rush off to find the dwarfs. Faking a potential heart attack, the Queen tricks Snow White bringing her into the cottage to rest. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the poisoned apple under the pretense that it is a magic apple that grants wishes. As Snow White falls asleep the Queen proclaims that she is now the fairest of the land. The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder over them, but before she can do so, lightning strikes the cliff, causing her to fall to her death.|$|E
500|$|Just over a {{fifth of}} all {{terminal}} passengers are travelling on domestic routes only, whilst half are travelling between the UK {{and the rest of}} the European Union (EU). Of the latter, travel between the UK and Spain, France, Germany and Italy account for around half, with Spain almost matching the other three combined in terms of passenger numbers. Outside of the EU, the United States, the Far East, Switzerland and the Middle East together account for just over half of all passengers flying between the UK {{and the rest of the}} world, with the USA exceeding the other three combined in terms of passenger numbers. Air travel is the most popular mode of transport for visitors both to and from the UK. In 2005 it was used for 80 per cent of all visits by UK residents travelling overseas and by 74 per cent of all inbound visits. Just over a quarter of all passengers are travelling on business. The advent of no-frills carriers has had a significant effect on passenger travel profiles, with strong growth in business travel from regional airports, and increasing inbound traffic generated for the purposes of non-UK residents visiting friends and relatives based in the UK.
