25|$|The {{front-wheel drive}} Medallion used the 2.2L I4 engine that also powered the European Renault 25. It was mounted in a {{longitudinal}} (front-back) configuration, driving {{the front wheels}} through either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed computer-controlled automatic. The longitudinal engine placement is unusual for a front-wheel drive car, as the transverse engine layout is typically more space-efficient. It {{was one of a}} few cars with this layout, which helps reduce torque steering. The gearbox is centrally mounted resulting in equal-length <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> In Europe, Renault 21 versions with engine displacements below 2L had transverse engines, just like smaller models such as the Renault 9. Higher-end R 21 versions with engines of 2L or more, retained the longitudinal layout of the previous Renault 20 and 30 series. The longitudinally mounted versions had a shorter wheelbase than the European transverse versions. Product plans also called for a four-wheel drive Medallion to be imported in late-1988.|$|E

40|$|<b>Axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> are {{of prime}} {{importance}} concerning {{safety in the}} transportation industry and railway in particular. Design rules for <b>axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> are mainly based on endurance curves for the material used according to the established standards and procedures. Recently, the knowledge of fatigue crack growth under typical loading conditions of <b>axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> with rotating bending and steady torsion is being object of research and industrial studies in order to apply damage tolerance concepts, mainly for maintenance purposes. The effect of a steady torsion on fatigue crack growth under rotating bending is focused in this paper. While <b>axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> in the transportation industry are traditionally designed on steels, the need for weight reduction due to fuel economy and eco-design constraints, lightweight materials must be considered for these applications. In this study, fatigue crack growth on rotating bending <b>axles</b> and <b>shafts</b> with or without an applied steady torsion is presented. Fracture mechanics approaches are {{used to analyze the}} results based on Stress Intensity Factors developed for bending and torsion in shafts and show fatigue crack growth retardation when steady torsion is applied. Fractographic observations using SEM are presented and helped to explain the fatigue crack growth retardation observed when steady torsion is applied to rotating bending. Results are compared for the same loading conditions on steels and relevant differences on fatigue crack growth are commented...|$|R
50|$|On {{cars and}} trucks, several senses {{of the word}} axle occur in casual usage, {{referring}} to the shaft itself, its housing, or simply any transverse pair of wheels. Strictly speaking, a shaft which rotates with the wheel, being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it, is called an <b>axle</b> or <b>axle</b> <b>shaft.</b> However, in looser usage, an entire assembly including the surrounding axle housing (typically a casting) is also called an axle.|$|R
5000|$|The first Dana 70 {{front axle}} {{was used in}} 1958 by Dodge in the W300, in both 4.88 and 5.87 ratios. International started using Dana 70 front axles in the late 1960s. Both {{companies}} used Dana 70 front axles until the mid-1970s (Dodge W300 pickup up until 1978, discontinued in 1979). All of these Dana 70 front axles were closed knuckle, with king pins and had a GAWR of 6000 lbs. Like the rear Dana 70 axles, the Dana 70 front axle started out with 23 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> {{and then went to}} 35 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> While these axles were being manufactured, Dana offered a [...] "Power-Lok" [...] limited slip differential for some of these axles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{aimed to}} solve the {{problems}} that traffic detector which was used in china, can't satisfies the multifunction and high-accuracy needs of the domestic traffic survey and traffic volume measurement. We designed a traffic detection system based on laser and piezoelectric technologies,which is made up of laser speed sensor, laser scanning sensor, piezoelectric <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> sensor, data acquisition unit, software system and server, and their application was discussed in detail. The working principles of laser speed sensor, laser scanning sensor, piezoelectric <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> sensor were presented, and the detection parameters of the system were put forward. The whole structure and data processing flow of software system were also pointed out. Through test verification, the multifunction and high-accuracy characteristics of the system were verified. This traffic detection system has great significance for enhancing the research level of the domestic traffic survey and traffic volume measurement.

40|$|X-ray {{line profile}} {{analysis}} Abstract. Surface rolling is a cold-working technology for hardening {{the surface of}} components made from steel or ductile cast iron. This process is able to increase the hardness of surfaces and to improve fatigue properties, so it is usually used on <b>axles</b> (<b>shafts)</b> of railway car wheels. In this paper the influence of surface strengthening technology on the microstructure of the material of railway car wheel axles is studied by micro hardness tests, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray line profile analysis...|$|R

50|$|The 2009 Liberty was {{relatively}} unchanged from the 2008 models {{with the exception}} of stiffer rear <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> and retuned springs, shocks, anti-roll bars, steering gear valve, low rollback brake calipers and a revised brake pedal ratio. The six-speed manual transmission was dropped, and the four-speed automatic was now standard.|$|E
50|$|In 1957, the {{lightweight}} Goggomobil used a similar suspension design to the Scarab. Much simpler though, the Goggomobil had bare drive shafts that also acted as the suspension links, with suspension forces {{passing through the}} inboard Hooke joints. The swing <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> were only carried by the trailing radius rods, rather than an axle casing, and the long struts were shortened to a simple coilover shock absorber.|$|E
50|$|A later {{variant of}} the trunk engine re-visited the return {{connecting}} rod layout as the vibrating lever or half-trunk engine. This was a paired engine with two short-stroke trunk engines facing outwards. Their connecting rods from the pistons led to upright 'vibrating levers' that could rock back and forth. These levers rotated a short <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> with further levers on it that in turn drove another pair of connecting rods and a shared central crankshaft. These complex engines were {{the invention of the}} Swedish-American engineer John Ericsson and were little used outside these two countries.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> of {{fork lift}} failed at {{operation}} within 296 h of service. The shaft transmits torque from discrepancy to wheel through planetary gear arrangement. A section of fractured <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> made of induction-hardened steel was analyzed {{to determine the}} root cause of the failure. Optical microscopies as well as field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM) along with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were carried out to characterize the microstructure. Hardness profile throughout the cross-section was evaluated by micro-hardness measurements. Chemical analysis indicated that the shaft was made of 42 CrMo 4 steel grade as per specification. Microstructural analysis and micro-hardness profile revealed that the shaft was improperly heat treated resulting in a brittle case, where crack was found to initiate from the case in a brittle mode in contrast to ductile mode within the core. This behaviour was related to differences in microstructure, which was observed to be martensitic within the case with a micro-hardness equivalent to 735 HV, and a mixture of non-homogeneous structure of pearlite and ferrite within the core with a hardness of 210 HV. The analysis suggests that the fracture initiated from the martensitic case as brittle mode due to improper heat treatment process (high hardness). Moreover the inclusions along the hot working direction i. e. in the longitudinal axis made the component more susceptible to failure...|$|R

50|$|Although {{a widely}} used system, {{this system is}} not as {{efficient}} as a system with locking hubs. A CAD system spins the <b>axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> spider gears, and side gears in the carrier during normal driving. Locking hubs disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving. Not as efficient as locking hubs, a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the axle completely locked in.|$|E
