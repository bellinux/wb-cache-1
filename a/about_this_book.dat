500|$|Stead won {{the annual}} Newbery Medal {{recognizing}} When You Reach Me as the year's [...] "most distinguished contribution to American literature for children". The judges chose the novel {{for making the}} small details important to the plot. Chairwoman of the Newbery committee Katie O'Dell felt that [...] "Every scene, every nuance, every word is vital both to character development and the progression of the mystery that really is going to engage readers and satisfy them". The committee was [...] "very excited <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> because it is exceptionally conceived, finely crafted and highly original".|$|E
500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the blurb {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't really need the whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too much <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>book.</b> It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the blurb, particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The blurb won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E

Its object is to expound those administrative powers which, in our dual form of representative government, are sovereign within their several spheres of action.....A written Constitution is a political grammar to whose rules administrative laws must conform, in order to give them judicial validity.....The government of forty four independent States, dwelling in harmonious relations under a supervisory Federal sovereignty, would seem, therefore, to justify the treatment of Legislation as a ...|$|E
2500|$|Lucas's {{standing}} {{as a literary}} critic was probably at its highest in the 1930s [...] [...] "In three respects," [...] the Times Literary Supplement noted in 1934, [...] "Lucas rises pre-eminent from the crowd of contemporary critics: in his care for style, for dignity and grace in his method of presentment: in his learning {{in the literature of}} several languages: and in the balance, the sanity of his judgment." [...] Post-war, reviewers were often more hostile. Many post-war reviews amounted to reprisals by the Leavisite camp: [...] "There is an air of breezy Bloomsbury superficiality and cultural omniscience <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> that is distressing," [...] wrote one. [...] "His is the type of over-cultivated fuddy-duddy mind that has done – and is doing – great damage to our whole culture in general and to literary appreciation in particular." [...] Probably because, psychoanalytic literary criticism aside, Lucas scorned most new trends – he described the critical theory of the 1950s as [...] "largely pseudo-scientific bubble-blowing" [...] – his criticism has long been out of fashion and is mostly out of print.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{packaged}} as a gatefold sleeve designed {{and illustrated by}} Roger Dean, who had also designed the art for Fragile, Close to the Edge (1972), and the band's first live album, Yessongs (1973). Each of them carried a loose narrative thread that Dean did not continue for Tales from Topographic Oceans. The album's design was discussed during an in-depth conversation Dean and Anderson had in 1973 during the band's flight from London to Tokyo via Anchorage, Alaska, during the Close to the Edge tour. Prior to the flight, Dean had completed the front cover to The View Over Atlantis (1969) by John Mitchell, and [...] "the wives and girlfriends made a cake ... and we all had some.

2500|$|For {{more than}} half a century Sir Neville Cardus was the undisputed king of cricket writing. His style {{influenced}} more than one generation of cricket writers. Moorhouse was no exception. Of course, he had a few things in common with the great Cardus: they both came from North-West England, Cardus from Manchester, Moorhouse from Bolton, both spent a considerable amount of their professional career at the Manchester Guardian, and most importantly, both greatly loved the game of cricket. [...] The greatest thing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> is that Moorhouse covers the matches as a cricket writer, not as a cricket reporter, and the difference can be enormous. Following the style of the great man, Moorhouse cares less about the statistics (although the scorecards are provided in details at the end of every match report). Instead, in the spirit of Cardus, he gives characters to the players, describes the scenario, talks about the past heroes of cricket, and even talks about his own emotions. He starts “The Roses Match” recollecting his family connection with the Red Roses. Wherever he goes, he tries to fathom the spirit of the particular match. Thus, this book describes the spirit of the game more than anything else.|$|E
2500|$|Glass Wings has {{received}} several primarily negative reviews from English-speaking audiences. Writing for IGN, A.E. Sparrow comments that the [...] "stunning artwork will captivate" [...] readers, {{but that the}} book suffers from [...] "muddled dialogue" [...] and sound-effect balloons that intrude on the book's flow. Julie Rosato of Mania praises the art of Glass Wings, though she notes that the [...] "crammed pages {{made it hard to}} enjoy the character detail and almost impossible to appreciate the various emotional dynamics." [...] She criticizes the Tsubaki plotline as [...] "disjointed" [...] and the conflicts as [...] "un-relatable" [...] because of the [...] "fantastical-horror angle". She states that [...] "too much <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> moves too fast, and with too little emotional impact", leaving the reader without concern for the characters, and therefore unaffected by the stories' tragic ends. School Library Journals John Leighton states that [...] "the artwork is overdone with each figure too stylized and each article of clothing bejeweled to the max." [...] He concludes that Glass Wings [...] "has promise but never really takes off." [...] Wilma Jandoc and Jason S. Yadao, writing for Honolulu Star-Bulletin, noted it [...] "offers such a visual overload that it's easy to lose track of what's happening" [...] and that it [...] "is difficult to discern the flow of action". Its bleak endings was cited as [...] "even more difficult to digest".|$|E

Christmas Eve in the dimly-lighted (there was a gas-strike on) front parlour, where the flickering fire-light threw strange shadows on the highly coloured wall-paper, while without, in the wild street, the storm raged pitilessly, and the wind, like some unquiet spirit, flew, moaning, across the square, and passed, wailing with a troubled cry, round by the milk-shop.|$|E
