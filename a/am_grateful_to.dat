That year, Kazakh ambassador Erlan Idrissov, after viewing the film, called {{parts of the}} film funny and wrote that the film had [...] "placed Kazakhstan on the map". By 2012, Kazakh Foreign Minister Yerzhan Kazykhanov attributed a great rise in tourism to his countrywith visas issued rising ten timesto the film, saying [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> 'Borat' for helping attract tourists to Kazakhstan." ...|$|E
500|$|Billingsley's {{generosity}} was {{not confined}} {{to those who were}} always at the club. [...] He received the following letter in 1955: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> you for your thoughtful kindness in sending me such a generous selection of attractive neckties. At the same time may I once again thank you for the cigars that you regularly send to the White House." [...] It was signed by Dwight D. Eisenhower. During World War II, three bomber planes were christened with the name of the Stork Club. [...] Billingsley commissioned Tiffany & Co. to produce sterling silver Stork Club logo Victory pins as gifts for their crew members. Patrons were not always on the receiving end; Billingsley's writings claimed that one of his waiters received a $20,000 tip. [...] A bartender received a new Cadillac from a grateful patron, and a headwaiter received a $10,000 tip from tennis star Fred Perry. It was necessary for Billingsley to give the expensive gifts and to provide some or all of a celebrity's Stork Club services for free to bring the stars to the club and keep them coming back. The notables were what brought {{people from all over the}} country in all walks of life to visit the Stork Club.|$|E

500|$|When the 2000 Republican National Convention {{began in}} Philadelphia {{at the end}} of July, McCain took his Straight Talk Express to meet with his delegates and {{supporters}} before formally releasing them to Bush. [...] There were tears from McCain, his wife Cindy, and some of the campaign staff and delegates. [...] Many of McCain's supporters were vocally unhappy with his words of support for Bush, and the Times wrote that, [...] "Politics as usual with its compromises, cruelties and emotional costs — caught up with Senator John McCain this weekend." [...] McCain made a point of having Cindy McCain head the Arizona delegation at the convention, not his antagonist Governor Hull. [...] On August 1, the second night of the convention, McCain delivered a speech in praise of Bush, in particular trying to solidify Bush's national security and foreign policy credentials. In it, McCain connected his family to Bush's, making reference to former President George H. W. Bush's combat service as a naval aviator in the Pacific Theater of World War II under Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., McCain's grandfather. [...] He said directly of the nominee, [...] "I support him. I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> him. And I am proud of him." [...] The Almanac of American Politics called it [...] "a moving, elegiac speech that ended as if in a minor key." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Karnataka {{government}} also banned {{the use of}} endosulfan with immediate effect. Briefing presspersons after the State Cabinet meeting, Minister for Higher Education V.S. Acharya said the Cabinet discussed {{the harmful effects of}} endosulfan on the health of farmers and people living in rural areas. The government will now invoke the provisions of the Insecticides Act, 1968 (a Central act) and write a letter to the Union Government about the ban. Minister for Energy, and Food and Civil Supplies Shobha Karandlaje, who has been spearheading a movement seeking a ban on endosulfan, said, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Chief Minister B.S.

2500|$|Busch's {{employment}} with Penske Racing terminated on December 5, 2011. [...] Although {{most observers}} of the sport believe he was fired, Busch claimed in a public statement that the parting was [...] "mutual": [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Penske Racing for six very productive years. Together we won a lot of races– 16 in all. ... Coming to a mutual agreement to go our separate ways is a positive step for me." [...] In contrast, the Charlotte Observer reported several sources confirming team owner Roger Penske decided that Busch's altercation at Homestead-Miami Speedway {{was the last straw}} in his stormy tenure with the team but chose to defer the announcement until after Champion's Week. He was replaced in the No.22 by A. J. Allmendinger.|$|E
2500|$|The {{companion}} {{book for}} a series of interviews between mythologist Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers, The Power of Myth, was created under her direction prior to her death. The book's editor, Betty Sue Flowers, writes in the Editor's Note to The Power of Myth: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>grateful...</b> <b>to</b> Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, the Doubleday editor, whose interest in the books of Joseph Campbell was the prime mover in the publication of this book." [...] A year after her death in 1994, Moyers dedicated the companion book for his PBS series, The Language of Life as follows: [...] "To Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. As you sail on to Ithaka." [...] Ithaka was a reference to the C.P. Cavafy poem that Maurice Tempelsman read at her funeral.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Simon {{received}} {{the first annual}} Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Named in honor of George and Ira Gershwin, this new award recognizes the profound and positive effect of popular music on the world's culture. On being notified of the honor, Simon said, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> be {{the recipient of the}} Gershwin Prize and doubly honored to be the first. I look forward to spending an evening in the company of artists I admire at the award ceremony in May. I can think of a few who have expressed my words and music far better than I. I'm excited at the prospect of that happening again. It's a songwriter's dream come true." [...] Among the performers who paid tribute to Simon were Stevie Wonder, Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Lyle Lovett, James Taylor, Dianne Reeves, Marc Anthony, Yolanda Adams, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The event was professionally filmed and broadcast and is now available as Paul Simon and Friends.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1990s, Blackwell {{remained}} active in performances with opera companies throughout the United States and Europe. Most notably, in 1994 Blackwell replaced Kathleen Battle as Marie in La fille du régiment at the Metropolitan Opera {{for the entire}} run when Battle was fired from the production for unprofessional conduct. This has inevitably caused critics to compare the two singers, and indeed both women have played {{many of the same}} roles and share a similar vocal quality. In a 2003 interview Blackwell said, [...] "Kathleen has been very supportive and very good to me over my career. Mattiwilda Dobbs, Reri Grist and Kathy were basically the predecessors for me and I really <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> those women, especially with my particular fach. I mean, singing Aïda or Leonora is one thing, but the lyric repertory roles are not star vehicles. It just doesn't happen and I think these women have really helped in that respect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his final}} {{departure}} from Rideau Hall as governor general, Massey retired to Batterwood House, {{in the village}} of Canton, near Port Hope, Ontario. For his service to the Crown, he was awarded from the Queen the Royal Victorian Chain, making him the second non-royal or non-head of state, the first Canadian, and one of the only two Canadians to have ever received the honour. Just prior {{to the end of his}} time as governor general, the Queen wrote to Massey: [...] "I wish to send you my congratulations and my sincere thanks for the manner in which you have discharged [...] duties. I know that as my personal representative you have always sought to maintain the right relationship between the Crown and the people of Canada. I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> you for this because I regard it as the most important function among the many duties of the appointment which you have held with such distinction." [...] The Queen had wanted to appoint Massey as a Knight of the Order of the Garter, but Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, after consulting the rest of Cabinet, advised the Queen against conferring the honour.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2016, {{a planned}} concert in London was {{cancelled}} due to travel restrictions {{imposed on the}} artist, while other European dates suffered the same fate. On October 14, 2016, Yasiin Bey posted a video to Facebook where he announced that he's still planning to retire: [...] "I'm retiring for real this year, this week. With the 17th anniversary of Black on Both Sides being released, I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> have had the career that I {{have been able to}} enjoy." [...] He also announced one last concert which he will be live streaming from Cape Town, South Africa. In November 2016, he was granted the ability to leave but not reenter South Africa and was put on [...] "South Africa's 'undesirable persons' list." [...] He said he would perform one show in Harlem and three in Washington D.C. after leaving South Africa. He announced Dec 99th, his final album would be released on December 9. He released three singles from it [...] “Local Time,” [...] “N.A.W.” and “Seaside Panic Room.” On December 5, 2016, he announced the title of two albums, Negus in Natural Person and As Promised, the latter of which is a collaboration with Southern hip hop producer Mannie Fresh, initially titled OMFGOD. His claims of retirement seem questionable as he has played a show as recently as Wednesday September 13, 2017, at the Fox Theater in Oakland as part of Black Star.|$|E
