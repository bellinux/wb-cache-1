5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.|$|E

5|$|Despite his successes {{during the}} Druze revolt, the authorities, {{with whom he}} <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tense relationship, grew wary of his {{strength}} and subsequently arrested him in a nighttime raid. He was sent to Istanbul by sea and from there {{he was sent to}} serve a prison sentence at the Widin fortress on the Danube River. Aqil was apparently loaned some money from the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who had accompanied him on the ship ride to Istanbul, and Aqil used those funds to purchase a fake passport. With the passport and a disguise, he and an Albanian inmate named Hasan Agha escaped Widin in 1854 and reached Salonica. From there, Aqil departed to Anatolia and then Aleppo. Aqil resumed his Bedouin lifestyle of raiding and nomadic dwelling.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the lion}} too has <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> close {{association}} with Iranian kingship. The garments and throne decorations of the Achaemenid kings were embroidered with lion motifs. The crown of the half-Persian Seleucid king Antiochus I was {{adorned with a}} lion. In the investiture inscription of Ardashir I at Naqsh-e Rustam, the breast armour of the king is decorated with lions. Further, in some Iranian dialects the word for king (shah) is pronounced as sher, homonymous with the word for lion. Islamic, Turkish, and Mongol influences also stressed the symbolic association of the lion and royalty. The earliest evidence {{for the use of}} a lion on a standard comes from the Shahnameh, which noted that the feudal house of Godarz (presumably a family of Parthian or Sassanid times) adopted a golden lion for its devices.|$|E

5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} has <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 porpoises {{per year to}} catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna {{has been known to}} follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E
5|$|The square has <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> park in its centre, {{which was}} {{originally}} Lammas land. The park's fortunes have varied over the centuries, reaching near dilapidation in {{the mid-19th century}} after changing ownership several times. It was restored {{under the direction of}} Albert Grant, which included the construction of four new statues and a fountain of William Shakespeare. The square was extensively refurbished and remodelled for the 2012 London Olympics, costing more than £15m and taking over 17 months to complete.|$|E

5|$|York's {{location}} on the River Ouse and in {{the centre of the}} Vale of York means that it has <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> significant position in the nation's transport system. The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the River Ouse and the River Foss. The Ouse was originally a tidal river, accessible to seagoing ships of the time. Today both of these rivers remain navigable, although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence. A lock at Naburn on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal.|$|E

Wanting to get away she is happy when Rosemary Daniels (Joy Chambers) then sees Jane's potential and tries to get her to work for her in New York for the Daniels Corporation, but Jane later decides she is not willing to leave her friends and family behind. Her next love interest is Mark Granger (Colin Handley) who proposes to her on 25 December 1988. While she accepts, the engagement does not last as Mark's mother (Mary Ward) takes an instant dislike towards Jane. Tony Romeo (Nick Carrafa) later tries to pass Jane off as his fiance to his mother, when his mother arrives Jane is furious with Tony and reveals the truth when she finds out he also pursuing Sally Wells (Rowena Mohr).|$|E
5|$|Justinian's {{rule was}} not universally popular; {{early in his}} reign he nearly lost his throne during the Nika riots, and a {{conspiracy}} against the emperor's life by dissatisfied businessmen was discovered as late as 562. Justinian {{was struck by the}} plague in the early 540s but recovered. Theodora died in 548 at a relatively young age, possibly of cancer; Justinian outlived her by nearly twenty years. Justinian, who had <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> keen interest in theological matters and actively participated in debates on Christian doctrine, became even more devoted to religion during the later years of his life. When he died on 14 November 565, he left no children, though his wife Theodora had given birth to a stillborn son several years into his reign. He was succeeded by Justin II, who was the son of his sister Vigilantia and married to Sophia, the niece of Empress Theodora. Justinian's body was entombed in a specially built mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles until it was desecrated and robbed during the pillage of the city in 1204 by the Latin States of the Fourth Crusade.|$|E

5|$|Walt Disney, {{the creator}} of the {{concepts}} for Disneyland and the Disneyland Railroad, <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> strong fondness for trains. As a young boy, he wanted to become a train engineer like his father's cousin, Mike Martin, who told him stories about his experiences driving main-line trains on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. As a teenager, he obtained a news butcher job on the Missouri Pacific Railway, selling various products to train passengers, including newspapers, candy, and cigars. Many years later, after co-founding the Walt Disney Company with his older brother Roy O. Disney, he started playing polo. Fractured vertebrae and other injuries led him to abandon the sport on the advice of his doctor, who recommended a calmer recreational activity. Starting in late 1947, he developed an interest in model trains after purchasing several Lionel train sets.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Bay {{generally}} {{stands between}} , and is always bay in colour. Bright bay horses (bays {{with a more}} reddish tint than normal) are the most preferred by breeders, followed by ordinary bay, dark bay and then light bay. This preference for brighter shades of bay was originally stated in the official breed standard, although this stipulation has since been removed. In some bloodlines of the breed, light, grayish hairs in the mane and tail are known as a characteristic of pure blood. White markings, except for a small star on the forehead, render the horse inadmissible to the stud book. Horses {{are expected to have}} complete black points, including completely black lower legs. Legs that are red below the knees and hocks are considered faulty in colour, although they do not disqualify a horse from registry. The occasional red legs that appear in the breed are thought to come from chestnut Thoroughbred stallions that were crossed into Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire Coach Horse bloodlines at some points in the history of both breeds. The uniformity in colour is encouraged as it makes creating matching driving teams and pairs very easy. When the breed was first developed, the horses almost <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> countershaded dorsal stripe, but these disappeared with the outcrossings of the 18th century.|$|E
