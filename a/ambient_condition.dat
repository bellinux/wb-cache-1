40|$|The <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> such as air quality, noise, music, temperature, {{lighting}} and colour, in open-plan offices {{and their impact}} on employees are important for managements to recognize because open-plan offices {{are becoming more and more}} common in Swedish companies' office design today (Aronsson, 2005). For students, who will soon be entering the work force, it is important to understand how the characteristics of the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> can influence employee behaviour/satisfaction. To have a working knowledge of what kinds of effects the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> can have is likely to increase one's chances of becoming a satisfied employee. An employee that is aware of the importance of creating a servicescape (the attributes of the physical surrounding) that meets its needs and desires is likely to enhance its satisfaction in the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions.</b> A great number of managements may not be aware of the risks of working in an open-plan office where the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> are not satisfying the employees; ergonomic issues as well as heart diseases are the most serious results (Evans and Johnson, 2000, pp. 780 - 782). This leads to the problem formulation of this thesis: "How can management improve employee satisfaction in an open-plan office through the characteristics of a servicescape's ambient conditions?”. Four main theories are included in the Theoretical Framework to provide a deep understanding for the reader about the complexity of problems that comes with working in an open-plan office. The Bitner theory and the research compiled by Sundstrom discuss <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> and their impacts on employees' behaviour/satisfaction. Evans and Johnson’s theory discusses how stress is related to low-intensity noise. The final main theory, Person-Environment Fit, upholds the importance of a servicescape that fits employees’ needs and desires. The <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> influence employee behaviours in numerous ways (Davis, 1984, pp. 271) and at Sogeti’s open-plan office several <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> are studied through an observation conducted during April 17 th 2007 and a questionnaire with 15 closed questions. The outcomes of the observation and the questionnaire are analysed and concrete proposals are created for the Sogeti management to act upon in order to improve the characteristics of their open-plan office’s <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> and thereby improve employee satisfaction. One of the concrete proposals to how Sogeti may improve the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> in their open-plan office is to introduce a survey that should be handed out to the employees three or four times a year. The purpose of the survey is to define employees’ perceptions of the different <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions.</b> Based on the outcomes from the survey, employees’ needs and desires of the servicescape, the ambient conditions’ characteristics, can be improved. Also, some examples of actions geared towards reducing the level of noise in the Sogeti open-plan office are to use ear phones when listening to music and to leave the open-plan office when conducting phone calls. The concrete proposals developed based on the Sogeti employees’ perceptions of the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> in the open-plan office are outcomes of this thesis that may serve as a tool for the Sogeti management to improve the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> of their servicescape and thereby increase employee satisfaction...|$|R

50|$|The trend {{with the}} {{development}} in electrodes and amplifiers has been reducing its size for better transportability, as well as making them implantable on the skin for prolonged recording of the signals. Preamplifiers, head-stage amplifiers stay the same except {{that they should have}} different form-factors. They should be lightweight, waterproof, not scratching skin or scalp from parts that they need to mount themselves, and they should dissipate heat well. Heat dissipation is a big issue, because extra heat may cause in the temperature of nearby tissue to rise, potentially causing a change in the physiology of the tissue. One of the solutions to dissipate heat is the usage of the Peltier device. Peltier device, uses Peltier effect or thermoelectric effect to create a heat flux between the two different types of materials. A Peltier device actively pumps the heat {{from one side to the}} other side of the device, consuming electrical energy. Conventional cooling using compressed gases would not be a feasible option for cooling down an individual integrated circuit, because it needs many other devices to operate such as evaporator, compressor and condenser. Overall, a compressor-based system is more for a large-scale cooling jobs, and is not viable for small-scale system like bioamplifiers. The passive cooling, like heat sink and fan, only limits the rise of temperature above the <b>ambient</b> <b>condition,</b> while Peltier devices can actively pull heat right out of a thermal load, just like compressor-based cooling systems. Also, Peltier devices can be manufactured at sizes well below 8 mm square, therefore they can be integrated to the bioamplifiers without making them to lose mobility.|$|E
