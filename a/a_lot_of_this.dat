5|$|The Basingstoke Canal {{started at}} a canal basin, roughly where the cinema in Festival Place is located. From there the canal ran {{alongside}} the River Loddon following {{the line of}} Eastrop Way. The old canal route passes under the perimeter ring road and then follows a long loop partly on an embankment to pass over small streams and water meadows towards Old Basing, where the route goes around the now ruined palace of Basing House and then through and around {{the eastern edge of}} Old Basing. It followed another loop to go over small streams near the Hatch public house (<b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> section was built over when constructing the M3) and headed across fields on an embankment towards Mapledurwell. The section of the canal from Up Nately to the western entrance of the Greywell Tunnel still exists and is a nature reserve; there is water in the canal and the canal towpath can be walked. A permissive footpath at the western entrance to the tunnel allows walkers to access public footpaths to get to the eastern entrance of the tunnel. The limit of navigation is about 500m east of the Greywell Tunnel. The renovated sections of the canal can then be navigated east towards West Byfleet where it joins the Wey Navigation, which itself can be navigated to the River Thames at Weybridge.|$|E

According to archaeological evidence, the Indus Valley culture existed at the site from the proto-Harappan age (3500BC - 2500BC) to the Harappan age (2500BC - 1750BC).

25|$|Despite an {{official}} ban on drug dealing by the American Mafia, the Italian Gambino brothers were {{heavily involved in}} international heroin trafficking out of Bensonhurst. The Cherry Hill Gambinos were the ultimate recipients of the heroin that was brought in by the Inzerillo-Gambino-Spatola-Di Maggio clan from Sicily. They smuggled an estimated US$600 million worth of heroin into the U.S. every year. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> money {{was sent back to}} Italy to be invested in legitimate businesses.

25|$|Substances {{containing}} {{natural radioactivity}} {{are known as}} NORM (Naturally occurring radioactive material). After human processing that exposes or concentrates this natural radioactivity (such as mining bringing coal to the surface or burning it to produce concentrated ash), it becomes technologically enhanced {{naturally occurring radioactive material}} (TENORM). <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> waste is alpha particle-emitting matter from the decay chains of uranium and thorium. The main source of radiation in the human body is potassium-40 (40K), typically 17 milligrams in the body at a time and 0.4 milligrams/day intake. Most rocks, due to their components, have a low level of radioactivity. Usually ranging from 1 millisievert (mSv) to 13mSv annually depending on location, average radiation exposure from natural radioisotopes is 2.0mSv per person a year worldwide. This makes up the majority of typical total dosage (with mean annual exposure from other sources amounting to 0.6mSv from medical tests averaged over the whole populace, 0.4mSv from cosmic rays, 0.005mSv from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing, 0.005mSv occupational exposure, 0.002mSv from the Chernobyl disaster, and 0.0002mSv from the nuclear fuel cycle).|$|E

25|$|The {{forest reserve}} was set aside as a {{national}} park in 1929, officially declared Riding Mountain National Park on May 30, 1933. The park opened to visitors on July 26 of that year, with Manitoba Lieutenant-Governor James D. McGregor unveiling a cairn and giving a speech at a dedication ceremony. In attendance were Manitoba Premier John Bracken, Minister of Natural Resources J. S. McDiarmid, and Thomas G. Murphy, Minister of the Interior. According to the Winnipeg Evening Tribune, over one thousand vehicles were registered at various park entrances and over four thousand people had been admitted inside the park forty-five minutes after McGregor arrived. Ten thousand people in total attended the ceremony, where the Clear Lake site was designated Wasagaming. Much of the public infrastructure in Riding Mountain National Park was created during the 1930s by labourers participating in Canada's great depression relief programs. In total there were ten relief camps supervised by James Wardle. Funding for these relief programs {{was provided by the}} 1930 Unemployment Relief Act and the 1934 Public Works Construction Act. In 1932 most relief workers were British and over half were from Winnipeg. At this time the -storey interpretive centre and several other buildings were built of log, many featuring a rustic architectural style. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> early construction survives to this day.|$|E

500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like."

I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time.

Bevin pointed out that Heyburn once worked for McConnell, who supported his nomination to the bench by President George H. W. Bush. Later in the month, Bevin told The Janet Mefford Show, [...] "If it's all right to have same-sex marriages, why not define a marriage– because {{at the end of the}} day, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ends up being taxes and who can visit who in the hospital and there's other repercussions and things that come with it– so a person may want to define themselves as being married to one of their children so that they can then in fact pass on certain things to that child financially and otherwise." [...] Critics charged that Bevin was suggesting that the legalization of same-sex marriage could lead to the acceptance of incestuous relationships; a Bevin spokesperson responded, [...] " [...] sees no comparison between gay marriage and incest. He was discussing the implications of the legal rights related to this issue such as hospital visitations and benefits. To imply otherwise is ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of Hill's lyrics {{dealt with}} motherhood, the Fugees, reminiscence, love, heartbreak, and God. Commenting on the album's gospel content, Hill stated [...] "Gospel music is music {{inspired}} by the gospels. In a huge respect, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> music {{turned out to be}} just that. During this album, I turned to the Bible and wrote songs that I drew comfort from." [...] Several of the album's songs, such as [...] "Lost Ones," [...] "Superstar," [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] and [...] "Forgive Them Father" [...] were widely speculated as direct attacks at Fugee members Wyclef and Pras. [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] was originally intended for a different artist, however, Hill decided to keep it after it was completed, due to its personal content. Although {{a large portion of the}} album's love songs would turn out to be bitter from Hill's previous relationship, [...] "Nothing Even Matters," [...] a duet performed by Hill and R singer D'Angelo, showcased a brighter, more intimate perspective on the subject. The song was inspired by Hill's relationship with Rohan Marley. Speaking about [...] "Nothing Even Matters"' lyrics, Hill remarked: [...] "I wanted to make a love song, á la Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway, and give people a humanistic approach to love again without all the physicality and overt sexuality." ...|$|E

Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode more of a mixed to positive review, noting the lack of darkness in the episode.

[...] I do think having a muse in my life like the woman I'm with now helped.... I think there's also a lot of humor on this album, which is something we haven't touched on before, except maybe on Shake Your Money Maker, which was a lighter time and a lighter mood."
