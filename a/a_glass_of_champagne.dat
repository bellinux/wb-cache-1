5|$|On the October 27 {{episode of}} Raw, after John Cena, the #1 {{contender}} for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, rejected an offer to join the Authority, Triple H announced a Traditional Survivor Series tag team elimination match, with a team representing the Authority facing a team captained by Cena. On the November 3 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon announced that if Team Authority loses at Survivor Series, the Authority will be ousted from power. During the match, Triple H {{tried to get the}} last member of Team Cena, Dolph Ziggler, eliminated by attacking two referees and placing Seth Rollins (who was also the final member of Team Authority) on top of Ziggler and calling crooked referee Scott Armstrong into the ring to make the count, however the debuting Sting came out and attacked Armstrong and Triple H, giving Team Cena the win and thus disbanding The Authority. Stephanie and Triple H appeared on the episode of Raw after Survivor Series stating that without them the company would be driven to the ground. They were then escorted out of the arena by the returning Daniel Bryan and only to be insulted by Mr.McMahon for letting him down and the McMahon family before exiting the arena. On the December 29 episode of Raw, The Authority was brought back in power by John Cena, and she and her husband entered and stepped on the entrance ramp celebrating their return with <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> and a kiss. Stephanie and Triple H then proceeded to fire Erick Rowan, Ryback and Dolph Ziggler.|$|E
25|$|The {{race has}} {{finished}} since 1975 with laps of the Champs-Élysées. This stage rarely challenges the leader {{because it is}} flat and the leader usually has {{too much time in}} hand to be denied. But in 1987, Pedro Delgado broke away on the Champs to challenge the 40-second lead held by Stephen Roche. He and Roche finished in the peloton and Roche won the Tour. In modern times, there tends to be a gentlemen's agreement: while the points classification is still contended if possible, the overall classification is not fought over; because of this, {{it is not uncommon for}} the de facto winner of the overall classification to ride into Paris holding <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b>|$|E
500|$|The last {{scene in}} the film was {{arranged}} for {{the last day of}} filming. Initially, the language was supposed to be more somber and classical, but Meyer made some last minute changes. Flinn said that Meyer [...] "was in an optimistic mood", and the director suggested that Kirk quote Peter Pan for the last lines: [...] "Second star to the right, and straight on till morning." [...] Emotions ran high as the last shots of the cast were captured; Shatner said, [...] "By the time we finished the last scene, which extended longer than we expected, {{there was a sense of}} irritation. We raised <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne,</b> but everybody was actually a little antsy." ...|$|E

500|$|The book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first {{printed in}} Vogue in 1959, and {{included}} in Is there a Nutmeg in the House in 2000: [...] "If I had my way – and I shan't – my Christmas Day {{eating and drinking}} would consist of an omelette and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich with <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> on a tray in bed in the evening." [...] The pattern of the book follows that of earlier ones, with recipes interspersed with more discursive essays on subjects such as avocado pears, persimmons, historical menus, and Christmas hampers, and extracts from prose by writers whom David admired, including Sybille Bedford and George Eliot.|$|E
500|$|The last of {{the books}} planned by David was Elizabeth David's Christmas (2003). She and Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as the}} 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out the author's papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. The Christmas recipes David had most often been asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page work. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks. The book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first printed in Vogue in 1959, and included in Is there a Nutmeg in the House in 2000: [...] "If I had my way—and I shan't—my Christmas Day eating and drinking would consist of an omelette and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich with <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> on a tray in bed in the evening." ...|$|E

5000|$|Champagne Pool is a {{prominent}} geothermal feature within the Waiotapu geothermal {{area in the}} North Island of New Zealand.

40|$|International audienceIn <b>a</b> single <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> about <b>a</b> million bubbles {{nucleate}} on {{the wall}} and rise towards the surface. When these bubbles reach the surface and rupture, they project a multitude of tiny droplets {{in the form of a}} particular aerosol holding a concentrate of wine aromas. Based on the model experiment of a single bubble bursting in idealized champagnes, the key features <b>of</b> the <b>champagne</b> aerosol are identified. In particular, we show that film drops, critical in sea spray for example, are here nonexistent. We then demonstrate that compared to a still wine, champagne fizz drastically enhances the transfer of liquid into the atmosphere. There, conditions on bubble radius and wine viscosity that optimize aerosol evaporation are provided. These results pave the way towards the fine tuning of flavor release during sparkling wine tasting, a major issue for the sparkling wine industry...|$|R

40|$|Strange {{as it may}} seem, the gray, oppressive USSR {{was founded}} on a fairy tale. It {{was built on the}} twentieth-century magic called “the planned economy,” which was going to gush forth an {{abundance}} of good things that the lands of capitalism could never match. And just for a little while, in the heady years of the late 1950 s, the magic seemed to be working. Red Plenty is about that moment in history, and how it came, and how it went away; about the brief era when, under the rash leadership of Khrushchev, the Soviet Union looked forward to a future of rich communists and envious capitalists, when Moscow would out-glitter Manhattan and every Lada would be better engineered than a Porsche. It’s about the scientists who did their genuinely brilliant best to make the dream come true, to give the tyranny its happy ending. Red Plenty is history, it’s fiction, it’s as ambitious as Sputnik, as uncompromising as an Aeroflot flight attendant, and as different from what you were expecting as <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> Soviet <b>champagne...</b>|$|R
