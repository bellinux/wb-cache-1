5|$|After denying rumors for decades, in 2004 McElhenny {{confirmed}} {{that he received}} improper financial benefits from the University of Washington during his time there, which included a $300 monthly check. Per NCAA rules, the most a college can offer an athlete is <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>job</b> and a scholarship covering boarding and tuition. A popular (albeit usually jocular) spin on the rumor was that McElhenny essentially took a pay cut {{when he left the}} university to play for the 49ers. This was not entirely untrue; all payments accounted for, including legitimate ones, McElhenny claimed he and his wife received a combined $10,000 a year while at Washington—with the 49ers, his rookie salary was worth $7,000.|$|E

Also in May 2015, Gillum, in partnership with several local and national organizations, orchestrated the Tallahassee Future Leaders Academy (TFLA), <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>jobs</b> program which employed over 100 youths throughout city government. Gillum summarized the importance of a program like the TFLA in a July Op-ed, in which he highlighted how similar <b>summer</b> <b>jobs</b> programs from around the country have been shown to reduce arrests for violent crime, reduce youth mortality rates, and increase the likelihood of college attendance.|$|R
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hobbs played cricket {{whenever}} he could. His first games were {{played in the}} streets near his house. He was educated at a primary school affiliated with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's, and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys' School, a fee-paying establishment; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful at sports. He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew's choir team and the York Street school team, and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College. In his final year at York Street, to supplement the family budget, Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house. On leaving school in 1895, he worked as an errand boy until his father's connections at the university secured him <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>job</b> as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Aged 16, Hobbs became an apprentice gas fitter, and practised cricket on Parker's Piece, an open area of common land in Cambridge, in his spare time. He played for various local clubs but did not initially stand out as a cricketer: although better than most other Cambridge batsmen, no coaches or major teams approached him, and his batting gave little indication of the success which came later.|$|E
25|$|As of July 2010, only Sandra Dowling {{had been}} {{successfully}} prosecuted. Indicted on 25 felony counts, Dowling eventually {{pleaded guilty to}} patronage for giving <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>job</b> to her daughter, a single class-2 misdemeanor which was not among the original counts, although {{as part of the}} plea bargain she also agreed to recuse herself from the Maricopa County Regional School District.

25|$|According to Fitzpatrick, in 1963 while {{a teenage}} student at Gormanston College he worked <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>job</b> at the Marine Hotel pub in Kilkee, the remote town of his mother's birth. One morning Che Guevara walked in with two Cubans and ordered an Irish whiskey. Fitzpatrick {{immediately}} recognized {{him because of}} his interest in the Cuban Revolution. Knowing about the Irish diaspora and history in Argentina, Fitzpatrick asked Che vaguely about his roots. Che told Fitzpatrick that his grandmother was Irish and that his great-grandmother, Isabel, was from Galway, with other family being from Cork.|$|E
25|$|William found {{a stable}} parsonage at the St. Thomas A. M. E. Zion in 1910, where Robeson would {{fill in for}} his father during sermons when he was called away. In 1912, Robeson {{attended}} Somerville High School in Somerville, New Jersey, where he performed in Julius Caesar and Othello, sang in the chorus, and excelled in football, basketball, baseball and track. His athletic dominance elicited racial taunts which he ignored. Prior to his graduation, he won a statewide academic contest for a scholarship to Rutgers. He took <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>job</b> as a waiter in Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island, where he befriended Fritz Pollard, later {{to be the first}} African-American coach in the National Football League.|$|E
25|$|He {{was sent}} to Shattuck Military Academy, where his father had studied before him. Brando excelled at theatre and did well in the school. In his final year (1943), he was put on {{probation}} for being insubordinate to a visiting army colonel during maneuvers. He was confined to his room, but sneaked into town and was caught. The faculty voted to expel him, though he {{was supported by the}} students, who thought expulsion was too harsh. He was invited back for the following year, but decided instead to drop out of high school. Brando worked as a ditch-digger as <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>job</b> arranged by his father. He tried to enlist in the Army, but his induction physical revealed that a football injury he had sustained at Shattuck had left him with a trick knee. He was classified 4-F and not inducted.|$|E

He felt a tightening in his chest and his cameraman drove him to a local firehouse. Firefighters transported Johnson to the hospital where doctors informed him that he had {{suffered a}} near-fatal heart attack. He was 42 years old. Chronicling his recovery, he authored the book Heart to Heart featuring the recovery and comeback stories of 11 young heart attack survivors.

2500|$|By the 1960s {{many farmers}} {{were working in}} winter in [...] "town" [...] — not Qu'Appelle, whose {{commercial}} vitality had by now entirely lapsed, but certainly Fort Qu'Appelle and indeed Regina — and winter social activities in the former rural communities had entirely lapsed. Farming had become <b>a</b> part-time <b>summer</b> <b>job</b> for farmers, who previously would have regarded farming as their principal occupation and wintertime jobs as a distraction.|$|R

25|$|Hobbs {{was educated}} at a primary school {{affiliated}} with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's. In 1891, {{he moved to}} York Street Boys' School, where in contrast to his previous school, his family had to pay fees for him to attend. He later wrote {{that he was a}} poor scholar but was more successful at sports. Both he and his mother later recounted that he was rarely in trouble at home or school, except when carrying out practical jokes. He was also heavily involved in St Matthew's Church, and {{was a member of the}} church choir. Although his first appearance in a cricket match was as a last minute substitute playing for Jesus College choir, he played regularly for the St Matthew's choir team, which he went on to captain, and the York Street school team. He was also a founder member of a team called the Ivy Club which played on Parker's Piece. During holidays, he helped his father at work on the Jesus College ground.

500|$|Wolters was tireless in {{his efforts}} on behalf of Speer and his family {{to such an extent that}} his son, Fritz, later {{expressed}} feelings of neglect. [...] For Speer's fiftieth birthday in March 1955, Wolters gathered letters from many of Speer's friends and wartime associates, and saw to it that they made their way inside the walls of Spandau in time for Speer's birthday. [...] Wolters gave Speer's son Albert <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>job</b> in his Düsseldorf office and a place to stay—in fact, Wolters hosted all six of the Speer children at one time or another.

500|$|After {{graduating from}} the Baltimore City College high school in 1926, Wheeler entered Johns Hopkins University with a {{scholarship}} {{from the state of}} Maryland. He published his first scientific paper in 1930, as part of <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>job</b> at the National Bureau of Standards. He earned his doctorate in 1933. His dissertation research work, carried out under the supervision of Karl Herzfeld, was on the [...] "Theory of the Dispersion and Absorption of Helium". He received a National Research Council fellowship, which he used to study under Gregory Breit at New York University in 1933 and 1934, and then in Copenhagen under Niels Bohr in 1934 and 1935. In a 1934 paper, Breit and Wheeler introduced the Breit–Wheeler process, a mechanism by which photons can be potentially transformed into matter in the form of electron-positron pairs.|$|E
500|$|After graduating, Stebbins split {{his time}} between <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>job</b> as a naturalist at Lassen Volcanic National Park and {{pursuing}} graduate school at UCLA. Over {{the next few years}} he also obtained teaching credentials in junior college, high school, and elementary education. Stebbins initially planned to study birds, with an eye towards roadrunners, but felt the field of ornithology was too crowded, while herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians, offered more opportunities for new research. Cowles became his graduate advisor. The main focus of Stebbins' graduate research was the biology of fringe-toed lizards, a group of sand-dwelling lizards of the American Southwest. For his master's degree (completed in 1942) he studied the anatomical structure of the nasal passages of the lizards, documenting in detail the looped, horseshoe-shaped structure of the nasal passages that functions as a u-trap, preventing sand grains from being inhaled while the lizards lay buried at the sand's surface. His Ph.D dissertation (completed in 1943) further explored the anatomical, behavioral, and physiological adaptations of the lizards. During this time he also published on the behavior of the sidewinder rattlesnake, and, with his father, produced two field guides to birds, providing illustrations to his father's text. Their first book, What Bird is That?, was pressed in the family garage. Stebbins considered his father [...] "a pioneer of sorts in the extensive use of drawings in teaching natural history," [...] a tradition he later strove to continue in his own works.|$|E

Her best friend {{from the age of}} 13 was fellow lifelong Sheffield resident and Frecheville student Joanne Catherall. By early 1981 she was calling herself 'Susanne Sulley', a familiar amalgamation of her two first names, a nickname by which she had been casually known at school.

After his discharge from the Navy, Andrus moved to Orofino in North Central Idaho, where he worked in the timber industry in a variety of jobs at a sawmill his father co-owned. After the sawmill closed, Andrus switched to the insurance industry in 1963, and moved his family down the Clearwater River to Lewiston in 1966.|$|R
500|$|Jay Weinberg {{appeared}} {{at a number}} of shows on the first, North American leg, drumming on anywhere from four songs to half the show. [...] He had been a fan of heavy metal music for much of his life, and in playing with Springsteen he integrated a polyrhythmic approach influenced by metal bands such as Lamb of God, Mastodon, and Slipknot with the E Street drumming style derived from big bands and early rock and roll. [...] He received a very positive reaction from both audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band, with his vigorous, long-hair-flying style inviting comparisons to Dave Grohl and his potential for replacing his father drawing allusions to Wally Pipp. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote, [...] "All hail Jay Weinberg. ... With [...] the band’s chemistry was slightly unsettled for the better. ... His fills during 'Radio Nowhere' kicked the song, and the concert, into a higher gear, and galvanized a band that was starting to pace itself." [...] Jay Weinberg said [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>job</b> that anybody would want," [...] while Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able {{to go out in the}} audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] Jay Weinberg played his first full show on May 14 at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York, as Max Weinberg was in California to prepare test runs for The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien start. [...] Springsteen said of the occasion, “This is the first night in 35 years that somebody else sat at the drums.” Overall, Modern Drummer magazine's editor said that a college freshman playing on one of the year's biggest rock tours was [...] "certainly a unique story". [...] For the final Meadowlands Arena shows of the first leg, Jay Weinberg did the first but his father took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the impact of}} the Summer Career Exploration Program (SCEP), <b>a</b> privately funded <b>summer</b> <b>jobs</b> program for low-income teens, P/PV examined the lives of over 1700 applicants. These youth were randomly assigned to participate or to not participate in SCEP in the summer of 1999, and their outcomes were compared at four and twelve months after program application. Researchers found that implementation was strong, but program impacts were less impressive. While SCEPs participants got <b>summer</b> <b>jobs</b> at <b>a</b> substantially higher rate (92 %) than the control group (62 %), the programs ability to translate this large and immediate summer employment impact into intermediate gains (in terms of future plans, college enrollment, work success, sense of self-efficacy or reduced criminal activity) proved to be negligible. Although impacts were short lived, the report concludes that SCEP and similar programs have an important place in the larger mosaic of supports, programs and opportunities for young people...|$|R
5000|$|During the 1992 season, it was {{revealed}} that several Huskies players had received improper benefits. Among them, starting quarterback Billy Joe Hobert had received a series of loans totaling $50,000 made by a friend's father-in-law. While this was not an institutional violation (Hobert was deemed ineligible as a result, but the program was not punished), this was {{the first of a series}} of investigative reports by the Seattle Times and Los Angeles Times that eventually led to the Pacific-10 Conference and NCAA investigations. These led to charges that Washington exhibited [...] "lack of institutional control" [...] over its handling of recruiting funds for on-campus visits, in which player hosts allegedly kept money or gave it to recruits, and turned in false expense forms (amounts cited in the report were $80). It was also charged that a booster ran <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>jobs</b> program that employed more than 50 Husky athletes since the 1970s that either paid for work that was not performed or were not given enough work to merit their salaries. The Huskies received sanctions from both the NCAA and Pacific-10 Conference, though notably James and the coaching staff were not specifically cited as having broken any rules. James resigned from his head coaching position on August 22, 1993, in protest of what he considered unfair sanctions against his team. James later clarified that he was protesting what he felt was a betrayal by then University President William Gerberding, who, against James' wishes, argued in favor of altering the penalties against the program from a two-year TV revenue ban and one-year bowl ban, to a one-year TV revenue ban and two-year bowl ban.|$|R
