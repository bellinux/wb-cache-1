Da Matta moved back into first {{place on the}} next lap, but Gidley reclaimed the position four laps later. Tracy slowed on the backstraight on lap 64 and drove to pit road to retire {{with a loss of}} engine power. On the 72nd lap, Vasser took over the lead from Papis. Franchitti lost engine power after leaving turn one and drove down the backstraight to retire, necessitating the second caution. All drivers chose to make pit stops under caution. The race resumed on lap 80 with da Matta passing Castroneves to move back into first place. Da Matta fell to fourth after he was passed by Vasser around the outside of turn one and Castroneves moved into second five laps later. Papis retook the first position on lap 86. Castroneves pulled off the track at turn four and stopped at the pit road exit to retire with an engine failure on the following lap. Mears moved into the lead on lap 87, but lost it to Papis two laps later. Da Matta and Papis traded the first position over laps 91 to 98. Tagliani took over the lead on the 99th lap.|$|E
25|$|Older {{designs of}} ferroresonant {{transformers}} had an output with high harmonic content, {{leading to a}} distorted output waveform.

25|$|As Mk. I {{arrived in}} the field, a number of {{improvements}} in the basic electronics were introduced. These were collected together to form the Mk. I* version. The differences between the Mk. I and Mk. I* were primarily in details. It was found that in certain orientations of the transmitter and receiver, the small antenna used to trigger the time base would see too small a signal to work. This {{was replaced by a}} cable between the two cabins, which was known as cable locking. Certain details of the RF stages on the receiver improved signal-to-noise ratio, <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> was added to correct for differences in generators, and a new system was introduced that replaced the complex grounding system for the potentiometer with an electronic version. A more major change was the introduction of anti-jamming features.|$|E

2500|$|The ferroresonant transformer, ferroresonant {{regulator}} or constant-voltage transformer {{is a type}} of saturating transformer used as <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator.</b> These transformers use a {{tank circuit}} composed of a high-voltage resonant winding and a capacitor to produce a nearly constant average output voltage with a varying input current or varying load. The circuit has a primary on one side of a magnet shunt and the tuned circuit coil and secondary on the other side. [...] The regulation is due to magnetic saturation in the section around the secondary.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the {{alternating}} {{nature of}} the input AC sine wave, the process of rectification alone produces a DC current that, though unidirectional, consists of pulses of current. [...] Many applications of rectifiers, such as power supplies for radio, television and computer equipment, require a steady constant DC current (as would be produced by a battery).

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} the design, fabrication, and {{test of a}} CMOS active clamp circuit. The active clamp is <b>a</b> linear <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator,</b> with <b>a</b> <b>voltage</b> deadband to allow for voltage ripple, {{that is designed to}} operate in parallel with <b>a</b> switchmode <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator.</b> Its specific function is to sink or source large transient currents to microprocessor loads, thus allowing operation with very small output capacitance. Laboratory tests on a prototype IC exhibit stable behavior with negligible overshoot with only 47 microfarads of output capacitance with loads of about nine amperes. Output impedances of 2 – 3 m are achieved. Index Terms—Active clamp, linear regulator, VRM. I...|$|R
40|$|An {{ultra-low}} area, current efficient <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> {{appropriate for}} distributed point-of-load voltage regulation in high performance integrated circuits (ICs) {{is described in}} this paper. The proposed <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> is <b>a</b> hybrid combination of <b>a</b> switching <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> and <b>a</b> linear <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator.</b> The <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> can supply over 100 mA current while generating 0. 9 volts from a 1. 2 input voltage. The current efficiency exceeds 99 % while the load regulation to a step current ranges between 40 ns and 60 ns. No output capacitor is required to ensure stability. Hence, the required on-chip area is as small as 0. 026 mm 2 for the proposed <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> which is approximately four to six times smaller than area efficient low dropout regulators. The proposed circuit therefore provides a means for distributing multiple local power supplies across an integrated circuit, maintaining high current efficiency and small area...|$|R

Other changes were made later in 1939 when a simplified design of pitot tube was introduced and the [...] "rod" [...] aerial mast was replaced by a streamlined, tapered design. To improve protection for the pilot and fuel tanks a thick laminated glass bulletproof plate was fitted to the curved, one piece windscreen and a 3mm thick cover of light alloy, capable of deflecting small calibre rounds, was fitted {{over the top of the}} two fuel tanks. From about mid-1940, 73 pounds (33kg) of armoured steel plating was provided in the form of head and back protection on the seat bulkhead and covering the forward face of the glycol header tank.
