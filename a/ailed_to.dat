2500|$|Rains filed a {{supplemental}} motion arguing that Judge Clay {{should take a}} second look at a ruling that barred the defense attorney from presenting evidence about Grant's criminal background, as well as a ruling that barred him from presenting evidence that Mehserle told a fellow officer just before the shooting incident that he planned to use his Taser on Grant. He protested that [...] "Both rulings amount to grave errors under longstanding and never-questioned California authorities" [...] and alleged that they [...] "substantially interfere with Mehserle's federal due process right to defend against the murder charge." [...] Rains <b>ailed</b> <b>to</b> convince Judge Clay to remove District Attorney Tom Orloff's office from the case. Rains claimed Orloff violated his client's rights because he ordered two Oakland police officers to try to interview Mehserle after he was arrested, even though Orloff knew Mehserle had an attorney. Judge Clay said Orloff's actions did not prove a bias nor did it meet the requirements necessary for him to be removed from the case.|$|E
40|$|A {{few decades}} back, {{research}} in pragmatics overly relied on H. P. Grice's cooperative principle and conversational maxims: quality, quantity, relation and manner. His theory emerged in 1975, {{as part of}} his work entitled Logic and conversation, and was righfully appealing and thought to be reasonable in almost every sense of the word. However, the theory itself <b>ailed</b> <b>to</b> account for a very ordinary phenomenon of human interactions, which began to attract a lot of attention from the linguistic community relatively recently.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} in evaluation as {{a new form of}} environmental governance stems from two developments: the movement towards New Public Management, and the search for new policy instruments for managing complexity, uncertainty and plurality of values in the pursuit of sustainable development. The former holds increasing accountability as the main purpose of evaluation, while the latter stresses the importance of learning. These approaches are often considered as mutually exclusive, but recent literature has underlined their complementary roles in policy making. This article examines to what extent the OECD Environmental Performance Review (EPR) programme has succeeded in combining the objectives of learning and accountability within a single evaluation framework. he EPRs have been relatively successful in avoiding the negative side-effects often associated with traditional performance measurement, but have usually <b>ailed</b> <b>to</b> generate broad debate.

40|$|Objective: The purpose ofthe {{study was}} to {{determine}} whether the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) would discriminate between outpatient adolescents with major depressive disorder and normal adolescent comparison subjects. Method: Depressed patients were accepted into the study only if they fulfilled the Research Diagnostic Criteria for major depressive disorder. The depressed subjects (N= 44) and the normal subjects (N= 38) were studied in the same environment and under the same conditions. The subjects received 1 mg ofdexamethasone at I 1 : 00 p. m. The next day, blood for determining plasma cortisol concentrations was drawn through an indwell-ing catheter every 60 minutes from 8 : 00 a. m. until 1 1 p. m. Results: After dexamethasone, the cortisol levels of the adolescents with major depressive disorder and the normal subjects were not significantly different. Only six (14 %) ofthe depressed subjects and one (3 %) ofthe normal subjects showed evidence of nonsuppression (cortisol value greater than 5 pg/dl). Analyses of subgroups of the depressed patients based on suicidal tendencies and endogenous subtype also I <b>ailed</b> <b>to</b> reveal significant differences in cortisol values.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the doctrine of abuse of process in Canadian criminal law {{in the light of}} two recent events, the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Amato c. R. and the adoption of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The consideration of Amato v. R. in the firts part of the article shows that the majority of judges of the Supreme Court support the existence of the doctrine of abuse of law, and their reasons for this are examined. The effects of the Charter upon such a doctrine is demonstrated in the second part. The American experience is cited, showing the interrelationship of the U. S. Constitution and the doctrine of abuse of process. This is followed by a comparative table of Canadian cases in which the procedure was halted either because of the doctrine or by virtue of the Charter, particularly s.   24 (1) which permits judges to stay proceedings for reasons of infringement or denial of guaranteed rights or freedoms. The article concludes that the doctrine has not been superceded by the Charter, but rather that it plays an important role par <b>ailed</b> <b>to</b> it : the former protects the integrity of the legal process while the latter safeguards the rights of the individual...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an algorithm for the automatic segmentation and representation of surface structures and non-uniformities {{in an industrial}} setting. The automatic image processing and analysis algorithm is developed {{as part of a}} complete on-line web characterization system of a papermaking process at the wet end. The goal is to: (1) link certain types of structures {{on the surface of the}} web to known machine parameter values, and (2) find the connection between detected structures at the beginning of the line and defects seen on the final product. Images of the pulp mixture (slurry), carried by a fast moving table, are obtained using a stroboscopic light and a CCD camera. This characterization algorithm succeeded where conventional contrast and edge detection techniques failed due to a poorly controlled environment. The images obtained have poor contrast and contain noise caused by a variety of sources. After a number of enhancement steps, conventional segmentation methods still f <b>ailed</b> <b>to</b> detect any structures and are consequently discarded. Techniques tried include the Canny edge detector, the Sobel, Roberts, and Prewitt's filters, as well as zero crossings. The facet model algorithm, is then applied to the images with various parameter settings and is found to be successful in detecting the various topographic characteristics of the surface of the slurry. Pertinent topographic elements are retained and a filtered image computed. Carefully tailored morphological operators are then applied to detect and segment regions of interest. Those regions are then selected according to their size, elongation, and orientation. Their bounding rectangles are computed and represented. Also addressed in this paper are aspects of the real time implementation of this algorithm for on-line use. The algorithm is tested on over 500 images of slurry and is found to segment and characterize nonuniformities on all 500 images...|$|E
40|$|In Garcetti v. Ceballos, the Supreme Court denied {{constitutional}} protection to a deputy prosecutor named Richard Ceballos. In reaching its decision, the Court {{pointed to the}} plethora of statutory protections that were available to government whistleblowers. A closer examination of these statutory alternatives reveals {{that they will not}} protect Ceballos. This is the paradox of statutory protection in labor and employment law-more sometimes is less for vulnerable workers. This Article places the Garcetti case in the historical trajectory of worker protection—from no protection to statutory protection. This Article argues for a move toward constitutional and international protection rather than statutory protection for several reasons. First, as shown by the Garcetti case, courts can sometimes use the existence of statutory protections as a reason to deny protection in a particular case. Second, the statutory rights that have been provided in the past have <b>ailed</b> <b>to</b> adequately protect whistleblowers, as shown by several recent studies. Finally, legislation to protect government whistleblowers is inherently limited {{by the fact that the}} very people creating the legislation are likely to be the targets of the whistleblowing. Thus, there is a built-in incentive to weaken statutory protection for whistleblowers. After decisions like Garcetti, it may seem hard to argue for a greater reliance on constitutional rights to protect whistleblowers. This Article argues for constitutional rights because of the importance they hold in our legal system, and because whistleblowing is the kind of core political speech that the First Amendment is supposed to protect. Thus, this Article applies progressive constitutionalist ideas to both Garcetti and the protection of whistleblowers generally, as a way to break down the distinctions between employees that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision creates. In this Article, the author argues, for several reasons, that even in the face of a decision like Garcetti courts should not be dismissed as a strategy for protecting whistleblowers. First, the Garcetti decision can be limited to its unique facts through further litigation. Second, I argue for judicial protection of whistleblowers because there is nothing in the Constitution that suggests whistleblowers should not be covered. Finally, while whistleblowing is still protected for most employees, it is important to maintain {{constitutional protection}} for public employees because of the important political values that government whistleblowing embodies...|$|E

40|$|Ail is a 17 -kDa protein of Yersinia enterocolitica {{previously}} {{identified on}} the basis of its ability to confer upon Escherichia coli the phenotype of attachment and invasion of cultured epithelial cells. Here we report an examination of the contribution of <b>ail</b> <b>to</b> the pathogenicity of Y. enterocolitica. A low-copy-number ail plasmid that promoted serum resistance in E. coli HB 101 was constructed. The serum resistance phenotype conferred by <b>ail</b> <b>to</b> E. coli was affected by the growth phase of the culture as well as by the gene copy number. In contrast, the copy number of ail (and the relative quantity of <b>Ail)</b> was found <b>to</b> have little effect on the amount of Ail-promoted invasion of cultured epithelial cells. An ail mutant of Y. enterocolitica was constructed and characterized in vitro. This mutant produced no detectable Ail and had a reduced ability to invade CHO cells. Serum resistance of Y. enterocolitica was Ail dependent and was affected by growth phase and ail copy number. The phenotype of the ail mutant was examined in vivo by using a murine model for infection. The ail mutant phenotype was identical to that of the wild-type strain in oral 50 % lethal dose studies and early colonization of Peyer's patches as well as in kinetic studies. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of Ail produced by bacteria growing in vivo at 48 h postinfection indicated that ail was expressed at this time point. Thus, our findings confirm that <b>Ail</b> contributes <b>to</b> the serum resistance and invasion phenotypes of Y. enterocolitica in vitro and indicate that Ail is not required to establish an infection or to cause systemic infection of BALB/c or DBA/ 2 mice...|$|R
