50|$|The {{shape of}} the {{arachnoid}} does not follow the convolutions of {{the surface of the}} brain and so looks like a loosely fitting sac. In particular, in the region of the brain a large number of fine filaments called arachnoid trabeculae pass from the arachnoid through the subarachnoid space to blend with the tissue of the pia mater. The arachnoid is composed of <b>an</b> <b>outermost</b> <b>portion</b> (arachnoid barrier cell layer) with tightly packed cells and no extracellular collagen; that is why it is considered to represent an effective morphological and physiological meningeal barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid and subarachnoid space and the blood circulation in the dura.|$|E
40|$|Human spinal dura and arachnoid, {{obtained}} during neurosurgical operations, {{were studied}} by transmission electron microscopy. The ultrastructure of spinal meninges largely conformed to the morphology of the cranial meninges, but some minor differences were detected. The dura {{was composed of}} an outermost loosely arranged fibroelastic layer, a middle basically fibrous portion and an innermost cellular layer (dural border cell layer). The dural border cell layer was characterised by multiple interdigitating cell processes, no extracellular collagen, significant extracellular spaces and few cell junctions. Paravascular vesiculated nerve profiles were encountered within the fibroadipose epidural tissue. The arachnoid was composed of <b>an</b> <b>outermost</b> <b>portion</b> (arachnoid barrier cell layer), presenting tightly packed cells, numerous tight junctions and no extracellular collagen. In view of its numerous tight junctions, the arachnoid barrier cell layer is considered to represent an effective morphological and physiological meningeal barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space and the blood circulation in the dura. The arachnoid barrier layer was always characterised by a distinct continuous basal lamina on its inner surface towards the innermost collagenous portion of the arachnoid (arachnoid reticular cell layer). The interweaving arachnoid trabecular cells within this layer possessed numerous mitochondria and were anchored to the inner surface of the arachnoid barrier cell layer by desmosomes. An additional layer of flattened branching cells was demonstrated along the inner surface of the arachnoid reticular cell layer and assumed to be an "arachnoid border cell layer'. Morphological {{data suggest that the}} dura and arachnoid closely adhere at spinal levels in man without any naturally occurring "subdural space'. However, structurally, the dural border cell layer forms a weak cell layer at the dura-arachnoid continuum that is easily disrupted. The creation of an artifactual subdural space at spinal levels is discussed...|$|E

50|$|While {{there are}} many methods of {{detecting}} fake precious metals, there are realistically only two options available for verifying the marked fineness of metal as being reasonably accurate: assaying the metal (which requires destroying it), or using X-ray fluorescence (XRF). XRF will only measure the <b>outermost</b> <b>portion</b> of the piece of metal, so it may get fooled by thick plating.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{hydrothermal}} treatment {{was employed to}} introduce Mg or Ca {{onto the surface of}} titanium. With this treatment, a divalent cation-rich surface to the <b>outermost</b> <b>portion</b> of titanium substrata is easily generated, with minimal surface topographical alteration [18]. Because a rougher surface impairs the adhesion of both epithelial cells and fibroblasts of oral origin [12], this treatment may be advantageous in improving oral soft tissue cell adhesion to titanium implants.|$|R
50|$|To monitor brain {{activity}} {{during the same}} period, Libet used an electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG uses small electrodes placed at various points on the scalp that measure neuronal activity in the cortex, the <b>outermost</b> <b>portion</b> of the brain, which is associated with higher cognition. The transmission of electrical signals across regions of the cortex causes differences in measured voltage across EEG electrodes. These differences in voltage reflect changes in neuronal activity in specific areas of the cortex.|$|R

Cavite was well fortified, and directly opposite its fort, on the mainland, was a heavy mortar battery. Between the arsenal and the city was a Krupp battery, at what {{was known as the}} Luneta Fort, while further toward the sea, extending from Cavite to the <b>outermost</b> <b>portion</b> of Limbones Point, were shore-batteries,—formidable forts, so it had been given out by the Spanish government, such as would render the city of Manila impregnable.|$|R

40|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{can alter the}} composition of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) layer of the outer membrane as a response to different growth conditions and external stimuli. These alterations can, for example, promote attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. The changes occur in the outermost layer of the cell and may consequently influence interactions between bacterial cells and surrounding host tissue, as well as other surfaces. Microscopic analyses, fractionation of bacterial cells, or other traditional microbiological assays have previously been used to study these alterations. These methods can, however, be time consuming and do not always give detailed chemical information about the bacterial cell surface. We here present an analytical method that provides chemical information on the <b>outermost</b> <b>portion</b> of bacterial cells with respect to protein, peptidoglycan, lipid, and polysaccharide content. The method involves cryo-x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses of the <b>outermost</b> <b>portion</b> (within ∼ 10 nm of the surface) of intact bacterial cells followed by a multivariate curve resolution analysis of carbon spectra. It {{can be used as a}} tool for characterizing and monitoring variations in the chemical composition of bacterial cell walls or of isolated outer membrane vesicles, variations that result from e. g. mutations or external stimuli. The method enabled us to predict accurately the alterations in polysaccharide content and surface chemistries of a set of well characterized Escherichia coli LPS mutants. The described approach may moreover be applied to monitor surface chemical composition of other biological samples...|$|R

The mechanism and time of this event are inferred from the abundances and distribution of volatiles in the atmosphere, hydrosphere and crust, and from meteorite studies, and geophysical and astronomical observations. This event is linked to the melting of the earth during accretion which resulted in the concentration of U, Th, K and Pb in the <b>outermost</b> <b>portion</b> of the earth and in virtually complete expulsion of nonradiogenic Ar, Ne and Kr from its interior...|$|R

Centrifugal force acts on tension/torsion strap and biases tip nose-up. Airstream turns tip nose-down, other torques cause tip to "weathervane" to intermediate angular position resulting in net lift. Reduces fluctuations in lift, with two effects: flapwise vibratory loads on blade and vibratory loads on pitch-control mechanism reduced; negative lift produced by advancing fixed tip eliminated, reducing power required to achieve same overall lift. Applies to tilt rotors and tail rotors as well...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} load {{alleviation}} capabilities of an articulated tip device, where the <b>outermost</b> <b>portion</b> {{of the blade}} can rotate {{with respect to the}} rest of the blade. Passive, semi-passive and active solutions are developed for the tip rotation. In the passive and semi-passive configurations tip pitching is mainly driven by aerodynamic loads, while for the active case the rotation is obtained with an actuator commanded by a feedback control law. Each configuration is analyzed and tested using a high-fidelity aeroservoelastic simulation environment, by considering standard operative conditions as well as fault situations. The potential benefits of the proposed blade tip concepts are discussed in terms of performance and robustness...|$|R
5000|$|Ballistic foam {{is placed}} in the dry bays to provide a barrier between the spark and the fuel. As bullets or {{shrapnel}} penetrate the mold line skin surrounding the <b>outermost</b> <b>portions</b> of the dry bay, the ballistic foam deprives sparks of oxygen. Thus when the article punctures the fuel tank, a fire is not started. Not only does the foam displace oxygen, but all gases, including explosive vapors which could magnify the destructive effects of ballistic attack. Dry bays, voids, may also contain “onboard ignition sources” like hot surfaces and electrical sparks which benefit both from a lack of gases and the fire-retardant nature of the foam.|$|R

50|$|The Sabre {{dance is}} the name given to pitch-up, a {{particularly}} dangerous behaviour of swept wings, which became apparent during {{the development of the}} USAF F-100 Super Sabre. When a swept wing starts to stall, the <b>outermost</b> <b>portions</b> tend to stall first. Since these portions are behind the center of lift, the overall lift force moves forward, pitching the nose of the aircraft upwards. This leads to a higher angle of attack and causes more of the wing to stall, which exacerbates the problem. The pilot often loses control, with fatal results at low altitude because there was insufficient time for the pilot to regain control or eject before hitting the ground. A large number of aircraft were lost to this phenomenon during landing, which left aircraft tumbling onto the runway, often in flames.|$|R
50|$|Three of the {{aesthetic}} knots (the St Andrew, Cavendish, and Grantchester) have the same symmetry and balance values as {{at least one other}} knot in their class; in this case, they appear to have been selected based on how evenly they distribute the unbalanced portions throughout the knot. This can be readily seen when one views these knots as combinations of two smaller knots, as the balance values of each component add up to the balance value of the final knot. In unbalanced knots where the balance value is odd, it is broken up so that the more unbalanced portion of the two is placed towards the beginning of the knot. This is probably intended to help the <b>outermost</b> <b>portion</b> of the knot keep its shape and remain tight.|$|R
