5|$|Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's {{population}} has declined, mainly {{due to the}} loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan <b>areas,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as the national housing crisis that began in 2008. While much of the state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most. Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind Cleveland and Youngstown. Despite this, Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors such as healthcare and education.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of South Bend declined after 1960, {{when it had}} a peak {{population of}} 132,445. This was chiefly due to migration to suburban <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as the demise of Studebaker and other heavy industry. Today, the largest industries in South Bend are health care, education, small business, and tourism. Remaining large corporations include Crowe Horwath, Honeywell, and AM General.|$|E

5|$|The shrub {{grows on}} sandy soils in {{seasonally}} wet lowland <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as hills and dunes. It regenerates after bushfire by resprouting from its underground lignotuber. Pollinators include honeyeaters, particularly the western spinebill, which can access the nectar with its long curved bill, and the silvereye, which punctures the flower tube. The most commonly cultivated Adenanthos species in Australia, {{it has a}} long flowering period and attracts honeyeaters to the garden. It is harvested for the cut flower industry.|$|E
5|$|There is a Cockney {{derivative}} called Estuary English, {{heavily influenced}} by Cockney and which is named after the Thames Estuary area where the movement of East Londoners to south Essex {{and to a lesser}} extent parts on north Kent led it to be widely spoken in those <b>areas.</b> <b>As</b> <b>well</b> as the concentration of speakers around the estuary the form of speech can be heard less commonly in various other places around the Home Counties.|$|E
5|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of weather map that depicts positions for high and low-pressure <b>areas,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval. They show temperature gradients, which can be useful in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can be useful in determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{is home to}} {{a fairly}} wide variety of animal species. Several hoofed mammals call the {{mountain}} home: mountain goats, Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, and mule deer. Large carnivores include cougar, black bear, coyote, bobcat, and the Cascade mountain fox, an endemic subspecies of the red fox. There have also been sightings of wolverine and unconfirmed reports of wolves. Many small mammals also make Adams their home. Squirrels and chipmunks are numerous throughout the forest. Douglas squirrels, least chipmunks, and Townsend's chipmunks live throughout the forest with golden-mantled ground squirrels and California ground squirrels occupying drier <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> These squirrels are preyed upon by the elusive and secretive pine martens that also call Adams their home. Hoary marmots and pikas make their home on open rocky areas at any altitude while the elusive snowshoe hare lives throughout the forest.|$|E
5|$|Gildredge Park {{is a large}} open park {{located between}} the town centre and Old Town; it is very popular with {{families}} and has a children's playground, cafe, tennis courts, disc golf course (target) and bowls lawns. The smaller, adjoining, Manor Gardens combines both lawns and shady <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as a rose garden. Until 2005, Manor Gardens was {{the home of the}} Towner Gallery. This gallery incorporated a permanent exhibition of local art and historical items, plus temporary art exhibitions of regional and national significance. It was relocated to a new, Â£8.6million purpose-built facility adjacent to the Congress Theatre, Devonshire Park which opened on 4 April 2009.|$|E
5|$|Precipitation falls {{throughout}} the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these <b>areas,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas. Munster, in the south, records the least snow whereas Ulster, in the north, records the most.|$|E

5|$|The {{coastline}} supplies many crustaceans, sea bass, monkfish and herring. Normandy has {{top quality}} seafood, such as scallops and sole, while Brittany has {{a supply of}} lobster, crayfish and mussels. Normandy {{is home to a}} large population of apple trees; apples are often used in dishes, as well as cider and Calvados. The northern areas of this region, especially Nord, grow ample amounts of wheat, sugar beets and chicory. Thick stews are found often in these northern <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> The produce of these northern regions is also considered some {{of the best in the}} country, including cauliflower and artichokes. Buckwheat grows widely in Brittany as well and is used in the region's galettes, called jalet, which is where this dish originated.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} 516 student clubs and {{organizations}} at Texas Tech. Many students participate in Greek Life. Texas Tech Greek Life includes 11 Panhellenic Sororities and 24 InterFraternity Council Fraternities, {{as well as}} groups in the NPHC and Multicultural Greek Council. The Student Union Building, located centrally on campus, is the hub of daily student activity. It houses restaurants, coffee shops, a book store, meeting rooms, lecture halls, movie rooms, and study <b>areas,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as the offices and meeting rooms of several student organizations and the Student Government Association. Directly adjacent to the Student Union Building is the School of Music, home of the Texas Tech Goin' Band from Raiderland. The 450-member band, which was awarded the Sudler Trophy in 1999, performs at all home football games and at various other events.|$|E
5|$|Though the M32 {{has a small}} traffic flow, {{it is one of}} {{the most}} {{congested}} motorways in the region as it connects a number of key <b>areas.</b> <b>As</b> <b>well</b> as providing one of the few high-quality routes into the centre of Bristol, it is the only significant link from the M4 to the A4174 Bristol Ring Road. Parts of the M32 are reaching the end of their intended lifespan, leading to reduced speed limits and occasional closures for remedial work. Local residents have criticised the M32, complaining that it has severed communities and has an unacceptable noise level.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Lupit first {{affected}} Pohnpei with tropical storm-force winds, {{and later}} it {{damaged or destroyed}} about 200homes in Chuuk State. There, high waves flooded roads and homes, while high winds damaged crops. Damage was heaviest in Yap State, mostly in the small Ulithi atoll and Fais Island. On both islands, the typhoon contaminated the water supply and wrecked crops. Rainfall reached 263mm (10.35in) on Ulithi, and gusts reached 158km/h (98mph). Throughout the FSM, damage totaled about $1.7million, although there were no deaths. The damage prompted the FSM government to declare two states as disaster <b>areas,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as a disaster declaration from the United States federal government. While Lupit was becoming extratropical, it became the first typhoon in December to threaten Japan in 13years. There, the storm dropped rainfall that resulted in mudslides and flight cancellations.|$|E
5|$|Urban red foxes {{are most}} active at dusk and dawn, {{doing most of}} their hunting and {{scavenging}} at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, {{but they can be}} caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as on the edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, {{the grey}} currawong is {{generally}} sedentary, {{although it is}} a winter visitor in the southeastern corner of Australia. Comparatively little studied, much of its behaviour and habits is poorly known. Omnivorous, it has a diet that includes a variety of berries, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. Less arboreal than the pied currawong, the grey currawong spends more time foraging on the ground. It builds nests high in trees, which has limited the study of its breeding habits. Unlike its more common relative, it has adapted poorly to human impact and has declined in much of its range. The habitat includes all kinds of forested <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as scrubland in dryer parts of the country.|$|E

5|$|An early Italian humanist {{who came}} to Poland in the mid-15th century was Filippo Buonaccorsi. Many Italian artists came to Poland with Bona Sforza of Milan, when she married King Sigismund I the Old in 1518. This was {{supported}} by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both <b>areas,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as by newly established universities. The Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the Golden Age of Polish culture. Ruled by the Jagiellon dynasty, the Kingdom of Poland (from 1569 known as the PolishâLithuanian Commonwealth) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. The multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth {{thanks in part to}} a century without major wars â aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands. The Reformation spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the Polish Brethren), while living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (szlachta) who gained dominance in the new political system of Golden Liberty. The Polish Renaissance architecture has three periods of development.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Australians {{were far}} more circumspect. The nation's {{involvement}} cost more than 60,000 Australian lives and many more were left unable to work {{as a result of their}} injuries. The impact of the war was felt in many other <b>areas</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> Financially it was very costly, while the effect on the social and political landscape was considerable and threatened to cause serious divides in the nation's social fabric. Conscription was possibly the most contentious issue and ultimately, despite having conscription for home service, Australia was one of only two combatants not to use conscripts in the fighting. Nevertheless, for many Australians the nation's involvement in World War I and the Gallipoli campaign was seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of the Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war and Anzac Day is commemorated as a national holiday.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor's Office {{investigated}} Borislav PeleviÄ, {{a former}} SDG member {{and a member}} of the Serbian National Assembly. The investigation was ultimately dropped due to lack of evidence. In 2012, former SDG member SrÄan GoluboviÄ was arrested in Belgrade at the request of the Prosecutor's Office. GoluboviÄ was charged with an indictment listing the names of 78 victims. Clint Williamson, the lead prosecutor, said that other members of the SDG could not be identified because their faces had been covered with masks. As of October 2014, closing arguments had been concluded in the trial of KaradÅ¾iÄ, the former President of Republika Srpska, for the massacre, and other crimes against humanity committed in Bijeljina, among other <b>areas,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as for the genocide at Srebrenica.
