5|$|The album {{comprises}} four songs, all instrumental, and {{was recorded}} in two days. Much of the album’s material had existed in the band’s live repertoire before – in particular the album's title track had been released in an early form on the band's 2008 live album Live at Roadburn – <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was created during the recording sessions and rehearsals. Despite the band's preference for analog tape, the title track had to be recorded digitally to accommodate its length.|$|E
5|$|Four Hungarian-built gate stock {{motor cars}} {{were used as}} ballast motor cars, and were {{numbered}} L13 to L16. The final one was stored in 1955, {{in the hope that}} it would be restored and preserved, but by 1960, the project appeared to be too costly, and so the gate end of the car was cut off, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was scrapped. After refurbishment, the gate was displayed at the London Transport Museum. A further four Hungarian motor cars from the Piccadilly line were used as pilot motor cars during the reconstruction of the Hampstead line in 1922, and were numbered L17 to L20. Once a spur between the Hampstead line and the Piccadilly line at Kings Cross station was opened on 27 March 1927, it became much easier to transfer ballast motor cars between lines. The 14 departmental vehicles which were operational in 1934 continued to be used until 1953, by which time their age made maintenance very difficult. They were replaced {{over the next two years}} and scrapped.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} crashed {{at about}} 04:47local time (CDT, 09:47UTC) while making a localizer non-precision approach to runway 18 at Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport. It clipped trees and struck ground three times uphill. The fuselage broke apart, with the nose {{coming to rest}} about [...] away from the initial point of impact, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> about [...] further down towards the runway and about [...] from its edge and catching fire.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 June 1893, {{the fleet}} was on {{exercises}} when Tryon's flagship, HMS Victoria, sank following a bizarre order from him which brought it in collision with the flagship {{of his second}} in command, Rear Admiral Sir Albert Markham. Tryon went down with his ship, his last reported words being [...] "It is all my fault". Tryon was considered by many of his contemporaries to be a supremely competent yet radical officer, but with a strong and sometimes overbearing personality. This manner was felt to be a contributory cause to the accident. For instance, an article in Society Journal Talk in July 1893 (following the accident) said, [...] "Much {{has been said about}} George Tryon's charm of manner, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but in truth he was, at any rate when officially engaged, a very brusque and dictatorial man. Unfortunately he was a 'viewy' man too, a man of theories..." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the album}} {{ready to be}} mixed, Yello decided to try the new digital mixing process instead of the {{standard}} analogue process, and in August 1984 they visited Hartmann Digital Studio in Nuremberg where engineer Tom Thiel began mixing the album. However, Yello abruptly cancelled the sessions after just ten days, unhappy {{with the sound of}} the album. Meier explained that the duo felt that the songs were losing their soul, saying, [...] "Getting technically more experienced was leading us onto a slick perfectionist track. We even went to a German digital studio to do the most perfect remixes on a digital machine with the SSL Desk <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> And we had to learn, a difficult process for us, that perfection is just a way to escape from having nothing to say... With Stella we were being dragged down by an excess of perfection." [...] Blank later said, [...] "All the balances were wrong and the dynamic was lost, so I did lots of remixes again in Zurich to save this album". The group returned to their studios in Zurich and Blank started the process of remixing the tracks himself, with the exception of [...] "Desert Inn" [...] which he felt was acceptable as it was, [...] "Blue Nabou" [...] which the duo had already decided would not appear on the album and hence there was no urgency to improve it, and [...] "Angel No" [...] because Blank did not have time to mix it to the standard that he wanted. With the delay in mixing, the album's provisional release date of 1 October 1984 could not be met, and in order to avoid being lost among the Christmas releases, a new release date in January 1985 was set.|$|E
