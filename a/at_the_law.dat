5|$|Approximately 30 {{people from}} Briarcliff Manor {{served in the}} Korean War. John Kelvin Koelsch, who lived in Scarborough and {{attended}} the Scarborough School, died in a Korean prison camp after three months in captivity. Briarcliff Manor celebrated its semicentennial celebration from October 10–12, 1952, publishing {{a book about the}} village and its history; that year, the Crossroads neighborhood of 84 houses was completed. In 1953, Todd Elementary School opened to free space <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> Park grade school for middle- and high-school students. The Putnam Division was discontinued in 1958, and the following year the village library reopened in the former train station. The village's first corporate facility (part of Philips Laboratory) opened in 1960. In 1964 the new Village Hall opened, replacing the Municipal Building. The present high school opened in 1971 to ease the large enrollment at the grade-school building, and the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society was founded from the village's 75th anniversary committee, in 1974. Pace University bought Briarcliff College in 1977 as a satellite of the school's Pleasantville campus. Also in 1977, the village celebrated its 75th anniversary. Events included a motorcade of fifteen old racing cars participating in a loop around the route of Briarcliff Manor's 1934 road race.|$|E

Closer to the epicenter, several instances of damage were aligned with the highest observed intensity. The structural effects to the gas station's walls and roof at Casa de Fruta, the beam damage {{on the second floor of}} the Ford's department store in Gilroy, and the caved-in roof from the fallen parapet <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> office in Hollister were all considered by the United States Geological Survey to be consistent with intensity VII (Very strong) shaking.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Todd Elementary School {{opened to}} free space <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> Park grade school.

The village's first corporate facility (part of Philips Research) opened in 1960. In 1964 the new Village Hall opened, replacing the Municipal Building. The present high school opened in 1971 to ease the large enrollment at the grade-school building. In 1980, Pace University began leasing the middle-school building, and the middle school was moved to {{a portion of the}} new high-school building. The grade-school building was demolished in 1996, and a retirement home was built on its site the following year. The village celebrated its centennial in 2002, which involved celebratory events. A two-story addition to the village library was built in 2009, and the original portion was renovated to become the village's community center in 2016.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the Free Expression Policy Project {{assisted}} 33 academics {{specializing in}} journalism, with filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted {{the sale of}} violent video games to youths.

In 2006 the organization, in collaboration with the Brennan Center for Justice, released a report on the inefficiency of Internet filtering. The 87-page report concluded that academic-based censorship of material on the Internet was far too broad and harmed free expression of ideas. The FEPP became independent from both the National Coalition Against Censorship and the Brennan Center for Justice in 2007.|$|E
