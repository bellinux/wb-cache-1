40|$|Recently, a few {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial {{direct current}} stimulation (tDCS) {{studies have shown that}} the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) plays a causal role in moral reasoning especially in cases of <b>accidental</b> <b>harms</b> or failed attempted harms. The profile of results across studies is however not entirely consistent: sometimes the stimulation affects predominantly failed attempted harms while sometimes the stimulation affects predominantly <b>accidental</b> <b>harms.</b> We argue that such discrepancy could reflect different functional contributions of the rTPJ in moral judgments and that the chosen design parameters or stimulation method may differentially bring to light one or the other functional role of the rTPJ. In the current study, we found that tDCS specifically affected <b>accidental</b> <b>harms</b> but not failed attempted harms. Low cathodal stimulation of the rTPJ led to a marginally significant increase in the severity of judgments of <b>accidental</b> <b>harms</b> (Experiment 1) while higher cathodal current intensity led to a highly significant decrease in the severity of judgments of <b>accidental</b> <b>harms</b> (Experiment 2). Our pattern of results in the context of our experimental design can best be explained by a causal role of the rTPJ in processing the mitigating circumstances which reduce a protagonist’s moral responsibility. We discuss these results in relation to the idea that the rTPJ may play multiple roles in moral cognition and in relation to methodological aspects related to the use of tDCS...|$|R
40|$|Intentional harms are {{typically}} {{judged to be}} less forgivable than <b>accidental</b> <b>harms.</b> This difference depends on mental state reasoning (i. e., reasoning about beliefs and intentions), supported {{by a group of}} brain regions, the ‘theory of mind’ network. Prior research has found that (i) interfering with activity in this network can shift moral judgments away from reliance on mental state information, and (ii) high-functioning individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) rely significantly less on mental state information to make moral judgments than matched neurotypical (NT) participants. Across three experiments, we find using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) that, in NT adults, (i) one key region of the ToM network, the RTPJ, shows reliable and distinct spatial patterns of responses across voxels for intentional versus <b>accidental</b> <b>harms,</b> and (ii) individual differences in this neural pattern predict individual differences in moral judgment. By contrast, (iii) in ASD adults, the difference between intentional and <b>accidental</b> <b>harms</b> is not encoded in the voxel-wise pattern in the RTPJ or any other region, and (iv) higher symptom severity scores are predictive of diminished pattern discriminability.

40|$|High-functioning autism (ASD) is {{characterized}} by real-life difficulties in social interaction; however, these individuals often succeed on laboratory tests that require an understanding of another person's beliefs and intentions. This paradox suggests a theory of mind (ToM) deficit in adults with ASD {{that has yet to}} be demonstrated in an experimental task eliciting ToM judgments. We tested whether ASD adults would show atypical moral judgments when they need to consider both the intentions (based on ToM) and outcomes of a person's actions. In experiment 1, ASD and neurotypical (NT) participants performed a ToM task designed to test false belief understanding. In experiment 2, the same ASD participants and a new group of NT participants judged the moral permissibility of actions, in a 2 (intention: neutral/negative) × 2 (outcome: neutral/negative) design. Though there was no difference between groups on the false belief task, there was a selective difference in the moral judgment task for judgments of <b>accidental</b> <b>harms,</b> but not neutral acts, attempted harms, or intentional harms. Unlike the NT group, which judged <b>accidental</b> <b>harms</b> less morally wrong than attempted harms, the ASD group did not reliably judge <b>accidental</b> and attempted <b>harms</b> as morally different. In judging <b>accidental</b> <b>harms,</b> ASD participants appeared to show an underreliance on information about a person's innocent intention and, as a direct result, an overreliance on the action's negative outcome. These findings reveal impairments in integrating mental state information (e. g., beliefs, intentions) for moral judgment.

40|$|Intentional harms are {{typically}} {{judged to be}} morally worse than <b>accidental</b> <b>harms.</b> Distinguishing between intentional harms and accidents depends on the capacity for mental state reasoning (i. e., reasoning about beliefs and intentions), which {{is supported by a}} group of brain regions including the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ). Prior research has found that interfering with activity in RTPJ can impair mental state reasoning for moral judgment and that high-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorders make moral judgments based less on intent information than neurotypical participants. Three experiments, using multivoxel pattern analysis, find that (i) in neurotypical adults, the RTPJ shows reliable and distinct spatial patterns of responses across voxels for intentional vs. <b>accidental</b> <b>harms,</b> and (ii) individual differences in this neural pattern predict differences in participants’ moral judgments. These effects are specific to RTPJ. By contrast, (iii) this distinction was absent in adults with autism spectrum disorders.

40|$|Morality plays a {{vital role}} in our social life. A vast body of {{research}} has suggested that moral judgments rely on cognitive processes mediated by the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), an area thought to be involved in belief attribution. Here we assessed the role of the rTPJ in moral judgments directly by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) - a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that, by applying a weak current to the scalp, allows modulating cortical excitability of the area being stimulated. Participants were randomly and equally assigned to receive anodal stimulation (to increase cortical excitability), cathodal stimulation (to decrease cortical excitability), or sham (placebo) stimulation over the rTPJ before completing a moral judgment task. Participants read stories in which protagonists produced either a negative or a neutral outcome based on either a negative or a neutral belief that they were causing harm or no harm, respectively. Results revealed a selective group difference when judging the moral permissibility of <b>accidental</b> <b>harms</b> (belief neutral, outcome negative), but not intentional harms (belief negative, outcome negative), attempted harms (belief negative, outcome neutral), or neutral acts (belief neutral, outcome neutral). Specifically, participants who received anodal stimulation assigned less blame to <b>accidental</b> <b>harms</b> compared to participants who received cathodal or sham stimulation. These results are consistent with previous findings showing that the degree of rTPJ activation reflects reliance on the agent's innocent intention. Crucially, our findings provide direct evidence supporting the critical role of the rTPJ in mediating belief attribution for moral judgment...|$|R

40|$|Typically, adults give {{a primary}} role to the agent’s {{intention}} to harm when performing a moral judgment of <b>accidental</b> <b>harm.</b> By contrast, children often focus on outcomes, underestimating the actor’s mental states when judging someone for his action, {{and rely on}} what we suppose to be intuitive and emotional processes. The present study explored the processes involved {{in the development of}} the capacity to integrate agents’ intentions into their moral judgment of <b>accidental</b> <b>harm</b> in 5 to 8 year old children. This was done by the use of different metacognitive trainings reinforcing different abilities involved in moral judgments (mentalising abilities, executive abilities or no reinforcement), similar to a paradigm previously used in the field of deductive logic.

40|$|According to {{the most}} recent draft of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Intentional Torts to Persons, the {{intentional}} torts protect the rightholder’s interests differently from negligence-based rules and strict liability, placing them into a distinct substantive category. This conceptualization, however, does not provide courts with adequate guidance on how to formulate the element of intent. Different formulations can protect the rightholder’s interests differently from negligence and strict liability, so something else must determine the appropriate way to formulate the element of intent. The draft Restatement’s reasoning can be easily extended to provide a more useful conceptualization of the intentional torts. The practice of tort law involves the enforcement of behavioral norms, and so the substantive categories of tort law should correspond to normatively distinguishable categories of behavior. For tort purposes, three different paradigmatic forms of social behavior are relevant: aggressive interactions; interactions of mutual advantage; and the remaining nonaggressive, risk-creating interactions that are not motivated by an expectation of mutual benefit. Within this normative framework, the category of intentional torts is defined by aggressive interactions, which involve intentional harms that are normatively different from <b>accidental</b> <b>harms.</b> The intentional torts accordingly protect different interests in a distinctive manner as per the rationale in the draft Restatement. This normative framework straightforwardly explains a number of established rules while also resolving two questions of intent that have vexed courts and commentators. Difficult issues of intent involve hard questions about how the conduct is best categorized for tort purposes. Once the categories have been conceptualized in behavioral terms, the element of intent has a clear substantive purpose: it determines whether or not an interaction is aggressive and properly governed by the intentional torts...|$|R
40|$|Background: Moral {{judgment}} {{has been}} proposed {{to rely on a}} distributed brain network. This function is impaired in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a condition involving damage to some regions of this network. However, no studies have investigated moral judgment in bvFTD via structural neuroimaging. Methods: We compared the performance of 21 bvFTD patients and 19 controls on a moral judgment task involving scenarios that discriminate between the contributions of intentions and outcomes. Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess (a) the atrophy pattern in bvFTD patients, (b) associations between gray matter (GM) volume and moral judgments, and (c) structural differences between bvFTD subgroups (patients with relatively preserved moral judgment and patients with severer moral judgment impairments). Results: Patients judged attempted harm as more permissible and <b>accidental</b> <b>harm</b> as less permissible than controls. The groups' performance on <b>accidental</b> <b>harm</b> was associated with GM volume in the precuneus. In controls, it was al- so associated with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Also, both groups' performance on attempted harm was associated with GM volume in the temporoparietal junction. Patients exhibiting worse performance displayed smaller GM volumes in the precuneus and temporal pole. Conclusions: Results suggest that moral judgment abnormalities in bvFTD are associated with impaired integration of intentions and outcomes, which depends on an extended brain network. In bvFTD, moral judgment seems to critically depend on areas beyond the VMPFC. 12 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Social life is {{inherently}} risky. Who should bear {{the costs of}} <b>accidental</b> <b>harm?</b> That issue has been traditionally addressed in tort legal doctrine under the concept of breach of the negligence standard of care. Trial courts provide juries with instructions that, put roughly, direct the jury {{to decide whether the}} defendant’s conduct fell below what a reasonably prudent person would have done if in the defendant’s circumstances. Without further judicial direction on that issue, the jury effectively has excessive discretion in rendering a verdict. Such discretion, opens the door for at least two kinds of potential injustice. Juries could treat like cases differently, and juries can easily ignore or fail to give due consideration to a society’s diverse, irreconcilable, and competing conceptions of the good as to what constitutes reasonable prudence. To mitigate such, I have created “democratic standard theory. ” I claim that a theory based on the overarching moral and political commitments of the Kantian tradition can only specify what constitutes negligent breach if it incorporates, as facts, the actual values of the individuals subject to the risk at issue. Since individuals’ comprehensive conceptions of the good conflict, majority rule, constrained by constitutional essentials, should determine what constitutes breach of the negligence standard of care. Thus, in each dispute over negligence in tort, democratic standard theory sets the stakes of negligent risk, especially the costs of <b>accidental</b> <b>harm,</b> in accordance with the values of as many as possible of the individuals locally affected by the particular kind of act at issue. ...|$|E

Participants evaluated agents who produced a harmful, helpful, or neutral outcome, based on a harmful, helpful, or neutral intention; participants made blame and praise judgments. In the right temporo-parietal junction (right TPJ), and, to a lesser extent, the left TPJ and medial prefrontal cortex, the neural response reflected an interaction between belief and outcome factors, for both blame and praise judgments: The response in these regions was highest when participants delivered a negative moral judgment, i. e., assigned blame or withheld praise, based solely on the agent's intent (attempted <b>harm,</b> <b>accidental</b> help).
