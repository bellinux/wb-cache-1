40|$|Abstract The phosphoinositide 3 -kinases (PI 3 K/Akt) {{dependent}} {{signaling pathway}} {{plays an important}} role in cardiac function, specifically cardiac contractility. We have reported that sepsis decreases myocardial Akt activation, which correlates with cardiac dysfunction in sepsis. We also reported that preventing sepsis induced changes in myocardial Akt activation ameliorates cardiovascular dysfunction. In this study we investigated the role of PI 3 K/Akt on cardiomyocyte function by examining the role of PI 3 K/Akt-dependent signaling on [Ca 2 +] i, Ca 2 + transients and membrane Ca 2 + current, I Ca, in cultured murine HL- 1 cardiomyocytes. LY 294002 (1 – 20 [*]μM), a specific PI 3 K inhibitor, dramatically decreased HL- 1 [Ca 2 +] i, Ca 2 + transients <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ca.</b> We also examined the effect of PI 3 K isoform specific inhibitors, i. e. α (PI 3 -kinase α inhibitor 2; 2 – 8 [*]nM); β (TGX- 221; 100 [*]nM) and γ (AS- 252424; 100 [*]nM), to determine the contribution of specific isoforms to HL- 1 [Ca 2 +] i regulation. Pharmacologic inhibition of each of the individual PI 3 K isoforms significantly decreased [Ca 2 +] i, and inhibited Ca 2 + transients. Triciribine (1 – 20 [*]μM), which inhibits AKT downstream of the PI 3 K pathway, also inhibited [Ca 2 +] i, and Ca 2 + transients <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ca.</b> We conclude that the PI 3 K/Akt pathway is required for normal maintenance of [Ca 2 +] i in HL- 1 cardiomyocytes. Thus, myocardial PI 3 K/Akt-PKB signaling sustains [Ca 2 +] i required for excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyoctyes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{cellular}} calcium (Ca 2 +) handling {{are thought}} to underlie the altered contraction that occurs during cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Recent work has highlighted the importance of t-tubules in the control of intracellular Ca 2 +. The present study was performed to investigate whether changes {{in the distribution of}} I Ca between the surface and t-tubule membranes might contribute to the altered Ca 2 + handling observed during compensated hypertrophy in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Experiments were performed on ventricular myocytes isolated from 5 -month-old SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats. Osmotic shock using formamide was used to disrupt the t-tubular system and the whole-cell patch clamp technique used to monitor I Ca in the presence and absence of t-tubules. Membrane capacitance <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> were greater in control SHR than WKY myocytes; following detubulation, cell capacitance <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> both decreased and were no longer significantly different in the two cell types. The density of I Ca was not significantly different in control SHR and WKY cells or in detubulated myocytes from the two species. These data suggest that the distribution of I Ca is unchanged in SHR myocytes compared to WKY controls; I Ca density in the t-tubules was 1. 2 -fold greater than in the sarcolemma in both strains. These data also imply that the increase in surface area in SHR myocytes is due principally to an increase in t-tubular area, which is accompanied by an approximately equivalent increase in I Ca, so that the density of I Ca at the cell surface and in the t-tubules remains the same. These changes would be expected to retain cell function and synchronicity of Ca 2 + release in the SHR at this stage of compensated hypertrophy...|$|E
40|$|Voltage-dependent ionic {{currents}} {{were recorded}} from squid giant fiber lobe neurons using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. When {{applied to the}} bathing solution, methadone was found to block IK, I Na <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ca.</b> Both I Na <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> were reduced without apparent change in kinetics and exhibited IC(50) 's of 50 - 100 and 250 - 500 mu M, respectively, at + 10 mV. In contrast, IK was reduced in a time-dependent manner that is well fit by a simple model of open channel block (K(D) = 32 +/- or 2 mu M, + 60 mV, 10 degrees Celsius). The mechanism of I(K) block was examined in detail and involves a direct action of methadone, a tertiary amine, on K channels rather than an opioid receptor-mediated pathway. The kinetics of I(K) block resemble those reported for internally applied long chain quaternary ammonium (QA) compounds; and recovery from I(K) block is QA-like in its slow time course and strong dependence on holding potential. A quaternary derivative of methadone (N-methyl- methadone) only reproduced the effects of methadone on I(K) when included in the pipette solution; this compound was without effect when applied externally. I(K) block thus appears to involve diffusion of methadone into the cytoplasm and occlusion of the open K channel at the internal QA blocking site by the protonated form of the drug. This proposed mode of action {{is supported by the}} pH and voltage dependence of block {{as well as by the}} observation that high external K+ speeds the rate of drug dissociation. In addition, the effect of methadone on I(K) evoked during prolonged (300 ms) depolarizations suggests that methadone block may interfere with endogenous K+ channel inactivation. The effects of temperature, methadone stereoisomers, and the methadone- like drugs propoxyphene and nor-propoxyphene on IK block were examined. Methadone was also found to block I(K) in GH 3 cells and in chick myoblasts...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{indirect}} evidence, a {{role for}} synaptically released copper and zinc as modulators of neuronal activity has been proposed. To test this proposal directly, we studied the effect of copper, zinc, and other divalent cations on voltage-dependent currents in dissociated toad olfactory neurons and on their firing rate induced by small depolarizing currents. Divalent cations in the nanomolar range sped up the activation kinetics and increased the amplitude of the inward sodium current. In the micromolar range, they caused a dose dependent inhibition of the inward Na+ and Ca 2 + currents (I Na <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ca)</b> and reduced de amplitude of the Ca 2 +-dependent K+ outward current (I Ca-K). On the other hand, the firing rate of olfactory neurons increased when exposed to nanomolar concentration of divalent cations and decreased when exposed to micromolar concentrations. This biphasic effect of divalent cations on neuronal excitability {{may be explained by}} the interaction of these ions with high and low affinity sites in voltage-gated channels. Our results support the idea that these ions are normal modulators of neuronal excitabilit...|$|E
40|$|Various {{types of}} neurons exhibit {{subthreshold}} resonance oscillation (preferred frequency response) to fluctuating sinusoidal input currents. This phenomenon {{is well known}} to influence the synaptic plasticity and frequency of neural network oscillation. This study evaluates the resonant properties of pacemaker pyloric dilator (PD) neurons in the central pattern generator network through mathematical modeling. From the pharmacological point of view, calcium currents cannot be blocked in PD neurons without removing the calcium-dependent potassium current. Thus, the effects of calcium I Ca and calcium-dependent potassium I KCa currents on resonant properties remain unclear. By taking advantage of Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of neuron and its equivalent RLC circuit, we {{examine the effects of}} changing resting membrane potential and those ionic currents on the resonance. Results show that changing the resting membrane potential influences the amplitude and frequency of resonance so that the strength of resonance (Q-value) increases by both depolarization and hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. Moreover, hyperpolarization-activated inward current I h <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> (in association with I KCa) are dominant factors on resonant properties at hyperpolarized and depolarized potentials, respectively. Through mathematical analysis, results indicate that I h and I KCa affect the resonant properties of PD neurons. However, I Ca only has an amplifying effect on the resonance amplitude of these neurons...|$|E

The present study was designed to investigate ion channels in undifferentiated rat MSCs. It was found that three types of outward currents were present in rat MSCs, including a small portion of Ca 2 +-activated K + channel (I KCa) sensitive to inhibition by iberiotoxin and/or clotromazole, a delayed rectifier K + current (IK DR), and a transient outward K + current (I to). In addition, tetrodotoxin (TTX) -sensitive sodium current (I Na. TTX) and nifedipine-sensitive L-type Ca 2 + current (I Ca. L) were found in a small population of rat MSCs. Moreover, reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction revealed the molecular evidence of mRNA for the functional ionic currents, including Slo and KCNN 4 for I KCa; Kv 1. 4 for I to; Kv 1. 2 and Kv 2. 1 for IK DR; SCN 2 a 1 for I Na.

No information is available about the effect of CO and/or smoking on postnatal maturation of the heart. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of prenatal exposure to CO on cellular electrophysiological maturation in male Wistar rats. Methods and Results-The patch-clamp technique was used to measure action potential (AP) and ionic currents (Ito <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ca.</b> L) from rat ventricular myocytes. During growth, AP duration measured at - 20 and - 50 mV (APD- 20 and APD- 50) decreased progressively in both groups; the process was significantly delayed in rats exposed prenatally to 150 ppm CO: At 4 weeks, APD- 20 and APD - 50 were 89. 5 ± 18. 2 and 147. 7 ± 24. 5 ms in CO (n= 13) and 35. 6 ± 4. 5 and 77. 8 ± 8. 3 ms in control rats (Ctr; n= 14; P< 0. 01 and P< 0. 05, respectively) and normalized at 8 weeks. At 4 weeks, the density of ICa. L was significantly higher (21. 3 ± 1. 6 pA/pF, n= 17, versus 15. 9 ± 1. 6 pA/pF, n= 22; P< 0. 05) and the density of I to significantly lower (9. 6 ± 1. 5, n= 22, versus 15. 2 ± 2. 2 pA/pF, n= 19; P< 0. 01) in CO than in Ctr and normalized thereafter.

40|$|Four tobacco cultivars (Nicotiana tabacum L.), {{known to}} differ {{with respect to}} their drought resistance, were {{subjected}} to a slowly intensifying drought stress (control level: ψPD=ca. − 0. 5 MPa; and severe stress level: ψPD=ca. − 2. 5 MPa), and rewatered under controlled environmental conditions in programmable growth rooms. Drought stress-induced changes in the fast-phase chlorophyll fluorescence induction kinetics during the stress and recovery periods were monitored with a shutterless fluorescence measuring system with a time resolution of 10 μs (Plant Efficiency Analyser by Hansatech Instr., UK). Although chlorophyll fluorescence transients are excellent probes for measuring the effects of stress on the PSII photo-chemistry, in this article we evaluate their practical applicability in screening for drought resistance. During the entire drought stress and recovery period, the fluorescence transients followed a regular pattern of 0 -J-I-P [...] T, with two intermediate inflections J (ca. 2 ms) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> (<b>ca.</b> 20 ms) appearing between the Fo and Fm levels.

In the interpretation of the results, however, care is expressed not to attempt to correlate changes observed in individual transient components with possible physiological causes, since these individual fluorescence parameters are influenced by an array of interacting physico-chemical and metabolic factors.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the contribution of}} the intracellular calcium (<b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +)) transient to acetylcholine (ACh) -mediated reduction of pacemaker frequency and cAMP content in rabbit sinoatrial nodal (SAN) cells. Action potentials (whole cell perforated patch clamp) <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transients (Indo- 1 fluorescence) were recorded from single isolated rabbit SAN cells, whereas intracellular cAMP content was measured in SAN cell suspensions using a cAMP assay (LANCE((R))). Our data show that the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient, like the hyperpolarization-activated "funny current" (<b>I</b> (f)) <b>and</b> the ACh-sensitive potassium current (I (K,ACh)), is an important determinant of ACh-mediated pacemaker slowing. When <b>I</b> (f) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> (K,ACh) were both inhibited, by cesium (2 mM) and tertiapin (100 nM), respectively, 1 micro M ACh was still able to reduce pacemaker frequency by 72 %. In these <b>I</b> (f) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> (K,ACh) -inhibited SAN cells, good correlations were found between the ACh-mediated change in interbeat interval and the ACh-mediated change in <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient decay (r (2) = 0. 98) <b>and</b> slow diastolic <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) rise (r (2) = 0. 73). Inhibition of the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient by ryanodine (3 microM) or BAPTA-AM (5 microM) facilitated ACh-mediated pacemaker slowing. Furthermore, ACh depressed the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient and reduced the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2 +) content, all in a concentration-dependent fashion. At 1 microM ACh, the spontaneous activity <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient were abolished, but completely recovered when cAMP production was stimulated by forskolin (10 microM) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> (K,ACh) was inhibited by tertiapin (100 nM). Also, inhibition of the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient by ryanodine (3 microM) or BAPTA-AM (25 microM) exaggerated the ACh-mediated inhibition of cAMP content, indicating that <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) affects cAMP production in SAN cells.

The data were subjected to a classical multiple regression analysis with care to avoid the possibility of chance correlation or collinearity. The ACE technique was also used to allow for nonlinearity. A number of statistically significant equations were derived, which were mostly consistent with previous studies. While the ESP-based charges gave the best equations, the improvement was not sufficient to convincingly exclude the other methods. This is the first study which evidenced by means of QSAR calculations isozyme-specific features of the two isozymes <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> II, in their interaction with sulfonamide inhibitors...|$|R
30|$|Radiolabeling of rat {{and human}} RBCs by {{specific}} enzyme-inhibitor approach was first reported in 1991 by Singh et al. with 123 I- or 125 I-labeled p- iodobenzenesulfonamide targeting carbonic anhydrase <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II (<b>CA</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II), a metalloenzyme found in RBCs [13, 14]. The authors {{found that the}} activity associated with RBCs decreased to about 50 % of the injected dose (ID) at 24 h post injection (p.i.) in rats, whereas more than 88 % of the ID remained associated with RBCs at 24 h p.i. in human volunteers. Fluorine- 18 has appealing characteristics as a radionuclide for PET as large batches (> 500 GBq) of fluorine- 18 can be produced by current cyclotrons, and the half-life of 110 min allows distribution from the production site to multiple remote PET sites.|$|R
40|$|The {{carbonic}} anhydrase isozymes (<b>CA</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> II) of the pig-tailed macaque, Macaca nemestrina, {{have been}} chosen to study the regulation of enzyme levels in red blood cells. Two quantitative variants of <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> that are ideal for studies of enzyme regulation exist in this species. One variant {{is one of four}} known electrophoretic types of <b>CA</b> <b>I,</b> designated <b>CA</b> Ia, which is present at levels about 30 % of those of the other electrophoretic types. The other is a deficiency variant of <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> which, in homozygotes, reduces the product of the <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> locus about 5000 -fold and reduces the product of the CA II locus by about 60 %. -[14 C]Serine was used to study the biosynthesis of <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> II isozymes in the reticulocytes of animals carrying these <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> variants. Specific radioactivity and total incorporation data from bone marrow erythroid cells, and peripheral blood reticulocytes indicate that the reduced CA Ia concentration is probably the result of degradation. This degradation appears to occur for only a short time before the reticulocytes enter the peripheral blood. It was not possible to determine whether the 5000 -fold reduction of <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> in the <b>CA</b> I-deficient animals is due to reduced transcription, reduced translation, or degradation. The effect of the CA I-deficiency mutation on the synthesis of CA II was also studied. For each dose of CA I-deficiency gene, {{there appears to be a}} 30 % reduction in the rate of -[14 C]serine incorporation into CA II, thereby accounting for the reduced CA II concentration in CA I-deficient animals...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} potent inhibitors of human {{carbonic}} anhydrase (<b>CA)</b> isoforms <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II has been prepared via a direct, chemoselective sulfochlorination {{of a range}} of 1, 3 -oxazolyl benzenes and thiophenes, followed by primary sulfonamide synthesis. The latter functionality is a known zinc-binding group (ZBG) responsible for anchoring the inhibitors to the CA's zinc metal ion. The compound's periphery as well as the overall scaffold geometry was designed to enable optimal interactions with the two distinct sides of the enzyme's active site, one of which is lined with hydrophobic residues and while the other is predominantly hydrophilic. As a result, several compounds inhibiting the therapeutically important cytosolic <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> II in picomolar range have been identified. These compounds {{are one of the most}} potent CA inhibitors identified to-date. Not only the remarkable (> 10   000 -fold), cytosolic <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> II selectivity vs. the membrane-bound CA IX and CA XII isoforms, but also the pronounced CA II/I selectivity observed in some cases, allow considering this series as a set of isoform-selective chemical biology tools and promising starting points for drug candidate development...|$|R

40|$|Studies were {{undertaken}} on {{the heat}} denaturation and proteolytic degradation by [alpha]-chymotrypsin {{of the normal}} red cell carbonic anhydrase isozyme, CA II, and two electrophoretic variants of carbonic anhydrase <b>I,</b> <b>CA</b> Ia <b>and</b> CA Ib, of the pigtail macaque. The heat degradation results showed a difference of about 40 -fold in the rate constants between CA Ia and CA Ib, {{which is due to}} the marked thermostability of CA Ib compared to CA Ia. The enthalpies and entropies of activation were calculated from the heat denaturation constants. These values were compared, on enthalpy-entropy compensation plots, with those values previously determined for the human <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> II isozymes. They were highly correlated and clearly fell into two distinct clusters, separated by about 200 kJ mol- 1; one group comprising the macaque <b>and</b> human <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> isozymes <b>and</b> the other the CA II isozymes. The proteolytic degradation results showed that CA Ia is degraded about 2. 5 times more rapidly than CA Ib by [alpha]-chymotrypsin. Thus, the characteristic 3 / 1 ratio of CA Ib/CA Ia in mature red cells could be accounted for by the greater susceptibility of CA Ia to degradation at some stage in red cell development...|$|R

Together with the widths of the Na <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> II lines, the Na I/H column-density ratios determine limits on {{the temperature of the}} absorbing gas, while the Ca II/H ratios establish limits on its calcium depletion. If the electron density is about 0. 02 per cu cm in the absorbing regions, two of the seven temperatures are between 3200 K and 6000 K, while three others exceed lower limits ranging from 1400 K to 6500 A.

40|$|Cancer is {{the second}} {{leading cause of death}} and gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer type worldwide. Investigation of autoantibodies in cancer {{patients}} has been a popular research area in recent years. The aim of the current study was to investigate carbonic anhydrase <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II (<b>CA</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II) autoantibodies in the plasma of subjects with gastric cancer based on the information and considerations of autoimmune relation of gastric cancer. Anti-CA <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II antibody levels were investigated by ELISA in plasma samples of fifty two patients with gastric cancer and thirty five healthy peers. Anti-CA <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II antibody titers of the gastric cancer group were significantly higher compared with the control group (p = 0. 004, p = 0. 0001, respectively). Plasma anti-CA I levels of the metastatic group were lower than the non-metastatic group and this difference was found statistically significant (p < 0. 05), but there was no statistical difference between plasma anti-CA II levels of the groups. <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II autoantibody titers in patients with gastric cancer were found higher compared to healthy subjects and the results suggest that these autoantibodies may be involved in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer...|$|R
40|$|Heat-inactivation {{studies were}} carried out on the two primary {{erythrocyte}} carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes, <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> II, and the secondary isoenzyme of <b>CA</b> <b>I,</b> <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> (+ 1). In addition, two genetic variants of human isoenzyme <b>CA</b> <b>I,</b> <b>CA</b> <b>Id</b> Michigan (100 Thr→Lys) and CA If London (102 Glu→Lys), and one variant of isoenzyme CA II, CA IIh (251 Asn→Asp), were similarly analysed. The first-order rate constants and Arrhenius plots for these six enzyme forms showed that (1) isoenzyme CA II is more heat-stable than <b>CA</b> <b>I,</b> (2) isoenzyme <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> (+ 1) is less heat-stable than <b>CA</b> <b>I,</b> (3) the variants CA IIh and CA If London are less heat-stable than the normal enzymes, <b>and</b> (4) isoenzyme <b>CA</b> <b>Id</b> Michigan is more heat-stable than normal <b>CA</b> <b>I.</b> From the values of the slopes of the Arrhenius plots, the energy of activation (Ea) for each isoenzyme and isoenzyme variant was determined, and the following thermodynamic activation parameters were calculated at 55 °C: the free energy of activation (ΔG‡), the activation enthalpy (ΔH‡) and the activation entropy (ΔS‡). The ΔG‡ for the enzymes shows a relative constancy with compensating variation in ΔH‡ and ΔS‡. When the values for ΔH‡ are plotted against ΔS‡, an increase in ΔH‡ involves a concomitant increase in ΔS‡...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} gf-values for 107 {{lines in}} 34 multiplets of <b>Ca</b> <b>I</b> between [lambda] 2990 and [lambda] 6720 have been {{derived from the}} photographic photometry of absorption lines excited in an electric furnace. All the lines arise from low terms whose excitation potentials range from 0. 0 to 3. 0 e. v. A brief discussion of the method used for making the measurements is given, together with an outline of the theoretical relationships which are required to reduce the measurements to relative gf-values. The various components of the experimental apparatus are described in some detail. In the second part, some preliminary studies have been made on the pressure broadening of Fe <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> <b>I</b> absorption lines in electric furnace spectrograms. By using relative gf-values for lines of these elements, empirical curves of growth have been constructed from which the collisional damping constants {{for some of the}} lines are derived. The experimental damping constants are compared with those calculated from the available theories of pressure broadening. The results indicate that observations of broadened absorption lines in furnace spectra may prove useful in determining collisional damping constants for many lines of astrophysical interest...|$|R
