5|$|Although American {{officials}} {{at the highest levels}} of the intelligence community (e.g. CIA Director William Colby) were certain that the South Vietnamese government would collapse, everyone in the U.S. government underestimated the speed of the North Vietnamese advance during the 1975 Spring Offensive and how quickly South Vietnam's <b>Army</b> <b>would</b> collapse.|$|E
5|$|Even though Steuart {{had fought}} bravely under {{extremely}} difficult conditions, {{neither he nor}} any other officer was cited by Johnson in his report. Gettysburg marked the high-water mark of the Confederacy; thereafter Lee's <b>army</b> <b>would</b> retreat until its final surrender to General Grant at Appomattox Court House.|$|E
5|$|Phase I: The {{army was}} derived from {{obligatory}} annual military service levied on the citizenry, {{as part of their}} duty to the state. During this period, the Roman <b>army</b> <b>would</b> wage seasonal campaigns against largely local adversaries.|$|E
50|$|By the mid 4th century, the Roman {{military}} {{was divided into}} frontier armies {{under the command of}} the provincial duces and permanent field armies under the command of the emperor, the magistri peditum, magistri equitum, or comites. The frontier <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> patrol the borders and oppose small-scale raids. They may have driven off medium-scale attacks without the support of the field armies. The frontier <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> later be known as limitanei or ripenses. The field <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> respond to larger-scale attacks, would fight against rival emperors, and would conduct any large-scale attacks into neighboring countries. The field <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> later be known as comitatenses or palatini. The first known written reference to ripenses was in 325 and the first to limitanei was not until 363.|$|R

5|$|After {{the renewed}} failure, Sapountzakis was {{relieved}} of his command {{and replaced by}} Crown Prince Constantine. Constantine now proceeded to carefully marshal his forces, bringing up more men and artillery. The Crown Prince formulated a new plan, whereby his <b>army</b> <b>would</b> feign an attack on Bizani from the southeast, while the main effort would be actually directed on the fortress area's southwestern flank.|$|E
5|$|During August 2016, it was {{announced}} that 650 soldiers of the British <b>Army</b> <b>would</b> be deployed on an enduring basis in Eastern Europe, mainly in Estonia with some also being deployed to Poland. This British deployment forms part of a four-battle group (four-battalion) deployment by various allies, NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, one each spread from Poland (the Poland-deployed battle group mostly led by the U.S.) to Estonia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the morning}} of 12 May, King Leopold III, General van Overstraeten, Édouard Daladier, General Alphonse Georges (commander of the First Allied army Group, {{comprising}} the BEF, French 1st, 2nd, 7th and 9th Armies), General Gaston Billotte (coordinator of the Allied Armies) and General Henry Royds Pownall, Gort's chief of staff, met for a military conference near Mons. It was agreed the Belgian <b>Army</b> <b>would</b> man the Antwerp–Leuven line, while its allies took up the responsibility of defending the extreme {{north and south of}} the country.|$|E

25|$|On 8 May 1944, Beneš {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Soviet leaders stipulating that Czechoslovak territory liberated by Soviet <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> be placed under Czechoslovak civilian control.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the example}} of Mozambique, the Zambian and Botswana governments {{permitted}} guerrillas to establish bases from which they could threaten and infiltrate Rhodesia. Van der Byl told a newspaper reporter that {{this had to be}} expected. As infiltration grew, he declared at the beginning of July that the Rhodesian <b>Army</b> <b>would</b> not hesitate to bomb and destroy villages that harboured guerillas.|$|E
5|$|Glubb {{nevertheless}} {{knew that}} the Israeli <b>army</b> <b>would</b> sooner or later be stronger than his {{and that he had}} to prevent the strengthening of the Harel and Etzioni brigades to secure East Jerusalem. He redeployed his strength on 23 May to reinforce the blockade. The Iraqi army, at that time seconded by tanks, relieved the Legion units in northern Samaria and these were redeployed towards the Jerusalem sector. The 2nd Regiment of the Legion moved to Latrun. A full Jordanian brigade was placed in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, before Soviet forces {{attempted}} to invade Finland, the Party Secretary of Leningrad Andrei Zhdanov commissioned a celebratory piece from Shostakovich, entitled Suite on Finnish Themes {{to be performed}} as the marching bands of the Red <b>Army</b> <b>would</b> be parading through the Finnish capital Helsinki. The Winter War was a bitter experience for the Red Army, the parade never happened, and Shostakovich would never lay claim to the authorship of this work. It was not performed until 2001.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very rough}} {{estimate}} of the Christian army, composed of aristocratic <b>armies,</b> <b>would</b> give the figure of 1,500 knights and 15,000 footmen, divided among the following: ...|$|R
25|$|On 3 December, Paisley {{claimed that}} the Third Force had 15,000–20,000 members. James Prior, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, replied that private <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> not be tolerated.|$|R
50|$|The other prong of the {{communist}} pincer movement included the 20th Army, the 27th Army, 30th Army, and the 31st Army of {{the communist}} IX Corps {{and a part of}} communist Artillery Column. Two <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> attack from Nanxun and Wujiang, toward Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha regions near/in Pudong, helping the communist X Corps to blockade the Wusong after approaching Gaoqiao. Another two <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> group at the regions south of Songjiang and east of Jiaxing, taking Qingpu when the situation permitted, and then attack the city from the east, south and west.|$|R
5|$|On 1 April, Alexander {{addressed}} the Sénat conservateur. Long docile to Napoleon, under Talleyrand's prodding {{it had turned}} against him. Alexander told the Sénat that the Allies were fighting against Napoleon, not France, and {{they were prepared to}} offer honorable peace terms if Napoleon were removed from power. The next day, the Sénat passed the Acte de déchéance de l'Empereur ("Emperor's Demise Act"), which declared Napoleon deposed. Napoleon had advanced as far as Fontainebleau when he learned that Paris was lost. When Napoleon proposed the army march on the capital, his senior officers and marshals mutinied. On 4 April, led by Ney, they confronted Napoleon. Napoleon asserted the <b>army</b> <b>would</b> follow him, and Ney replied the <b>army</b> <b>would</b> follow its generals. While the ordinary soldiers and regimental officers wanted to fight on, without any senior officers or marshals any prospective invasion of Paris would have been impossible. Bowing to the inevitable, on 4 April Napoleon abdicated in favour of his son, with Marie Louise as regent. However, the Allies refused to accept this under prodding from Alexander, who feared that Napoleon might find an excuse to retake the throne. Napoleon was then forced to announce his unconditional abdication only two days later.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 636, {{the final}} day of the battle, Khalid put into action a simple but bold plan of attack. With his massed cavalry force he {{intended}} to drive the Byzantine cavalry entirely off the battlefield so that the infantry, which formed the bulk of the imperial <b>army,</b> <b>would</b> be left without cavalry support and thus would be exposed when attacked from the flanks and rear.|$|E
5|$|Scholarly {{consideration}} of the likely outcome of invasion, including the 1974 Royal Military Academy Sandhurst war game, agree that while German forces {{would have been able}} to land and gain a significant beachhead, intervention of the Royal Navy would have been decisive and, even with the most optimistic assumptions, the German <b>army</b> <b>would</b> not have penetrated further than GHQ Line and would have been defeated.|$|E
60|$|On {{the part}} of the French, on the other hand, there was great indignation, and for some time it was feared that the <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> come to open blows.|$|R
50|$|The {{commander}} of the Milanese army was the condottiero Francesco Sforza, who later, {{with the help of}} the same Venetian <b>armies,</b> <b>would</b> conquer Milan and establish himself as its duke.|$|R
50|$|She {{was said}} to be a fair and {{beautiful}} maiden worth defending and protecting at all costs. Villages and <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> often shout her name before entering battle representing what they were fighting for.|$|R
5|$|While Middleton {{was helping}} LSU recover from this {{traumatic}} ordeal, {{he was also}} {{keeping an eye on}} events in Europe. In July 1940 he wrote a letter to General George Marshall asking if his services were needed by the Army as the United States was making preparations for war. Marshall replied that as much as the <b>Army</b> <b>would</b> like to have Middleton back in uniform, all the Army could do would be to place him in some training role, which would not effectively use his battle experience.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Confederates would march on Gettysburg {{from the west}} {{on the morning of}} July 1, Buford laid out his {{defenses}} on three ridges west of the town: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge. These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small cavalry division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town at Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Buford understood that if the Confederates could gain control of these heights, Meade's <b>army</b> <b>would</b> have difficulty dislodging them.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Joint Research and Development Committee with Spaatz, Devers took an {{interest}} in the development of helicopters, taking rides in different machines. He met with Larry Bell, the founder of Bell Aircraft. Bell's company was in a poor financial situation, and he was hoping that the <b>Army</b> <b>would</b> buy fifty of his new Bell 47 helicopters. Devers was impressed with the aircraft, and agreed to do so, although for $25,000 each rather than the $35,000 Bell was asking for, and found the money from Army Ground Forces funds. The Bell H-13 Sioux would go on {{to become one of the}} world's most recognizable helicopters.|$|E
50|$|Operation Barbarossa was {{the largest}} attack in history. On 3 August 1940, Hitler wanted to attack Russia. He planned on mobilizing armies for two offenses. In the north, the <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> head toward the Baltic States and Moscow. Then, Special Operations would secure the Baku Oil Fields. In the south, <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> attack Kiev and Dnieper. There would also be 650,000 men in Bulgaria to fight off the allies who {{would come to the}} aid of Russia. In total, the eastern front would have spanned over 1,000 miles. In this attack, there would be 186 total German {{divisions}} including 19 panzer units, 3,000,000 men, 750,000 horses, 600,000 cars, 7,200 guns, 3,000 tanks, and 1,800 planes.|$|R
5|$|Khalid, sensing Heraclius' plan, {{feared that}} the Muslim <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> indeed be {{isolated}} and destroyed. In a council of war he suggested that Abu Ubaidah draw all the Muslim armies to one place so as to fight a decisive battle with the Byzantines.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{principle}} behind these tactics was to disrupt their enemies' resources while increasing Roman resources. Without a regular supply of food, water, and other commodities, <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> begin to starve or dehydrate, resulting to low morale or killing of fellow soldiers.|$|R
5|$|As a result, the Army Material Command (AMC) {{conducted}} a study {{to determine if the}} development objectives were feasible and also established a program office for the Fire-support Aerial System (FAS). AMC recommended to narrow the competition to compound helicopters, as they were considered the only helicopter configuration at the time capable of being developed to meet the objectives. In March 1964, the Secretary of the Army advised DDRE that modification of existing aircraft would not approach the required performance of the FAS program; the <b>Army</b> <b>would</b> continue using the armed UH-1B until development of the FAS could proceed.|$|E
5|$|As the US X Corps {{was pushing}} towards the reservoir, the Chinese {{formulated}} their strategy, {{based on their}} experiences in the Chinese Civil War. Working from the assumption that only a light UN presence {{would be at the}} reservoir, the Chinese 9th Corps Army was first to destroy the UN garrisons at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni, then push towards Hagaru-ri. Believing the bulk of the US X Corps would move to rescue the destroyed units, the 9th <b>Army</b> <b>would</b> then block and trap the main UN forces on the road between Hagaru-ri and Hungnam. The 9th Army initially committed eight divisions for the battle, with most of the forces concentrated at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni.|$|E
5|$|By April, {{resistance}} against the Third Army was tapering off, and the forces' main efforts turned to managing some 400,000 German prisoners of war. On April 14, 1945 Patton {{was promoted to}} general, a promotion long advocated by Stimson in recognition of Patton's battle accomplishments during 1944. Later that month, Patton, Bradley and Eisenhower toured the Merkers salt mine {{as well as the}} Ohrdruf concentration camp, and seeing the conditions of the camp firsthand caused Patton great disgust. Third Army was ordered toward Bavaria and Czechoslovakia, anticipating a last stand by Nazi German forces there. He was reportedly appalled to learn the Red <b>Army</b> <b>would</b> take Berlin, feeling the Soviet Union was a threat to the U.S. army's advance to Pilsen, but was stopped by Eisenhower from reaching Prague before V-E Day on May 8 {{and the end of the}} war in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Chernyakhovsky's plan {{involved}} {{using the}} 5th and 11th Guards Armies to break open the German defensive lines, before pushing through exploitation {{forces from the}} 2nd Guards Tank Corps and 28th Army. The 31st and 39th <b>Armies</b> <b>would</b> advance on the flanks of the main force.|$|R
5000|$|In its heyday, {{the area}} {{established}} {{a reputation for}} being rough and lawless. During the American Civil War, deserters from both the Union and Confederate <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> wander there, hoping that such an isolated location would be the last place military authorities would look for them.|$|R
5000|$|Collapse seemed imminent. Stalin, unmoved, reiterated his {{demand to}} Timoshenko that Smolensk {{should not be}} {{surrendered}} and called the [...] "evacuation attitude" [...] of the front line commanders of the besieged armies criminally [...] "treasonous". Rather than retreat, Timoshenko's <b>armies</b> <b>would</b> stand their ground and attempt to recapture Smolensk.|$|R
