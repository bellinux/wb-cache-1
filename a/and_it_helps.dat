5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
25|$|The poem is of {{interest}} to those interested {{in the history of}} women, as well as revolutionary politics, and {{is an example of the}} British backlash against the ideals of the French Revolution; it is representative of the strategic conflation of women writers with revolutionary ideals during this period; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> illuminate the obstacles faced by women writers at the end of the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|White wine is {{regularly}} {{used as an}} ingredient. Its acidity balances well with fat taking away excess heaviness. This acidity also refines the meat or fish <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> {{to break down the}} fibres of the meat to make it tender. The role of white wine {{is similar to that of}} lemon juice used under the same conditions: once verjuice also fulfilled this function. The vinegar combines acidity with a burning sensation that gives recipes where it is used a bittersweet side characteristic.|$|E

25|$|The {{audience}} {{of a typical}} concert will have some understanding of Carnatic music. It is also typical to see the audience tapping out the tala {{in sync with the}} artist's performance. As and when the artist exhibits creativity, the audience acknowledge it by clapping their hands. With experienced artists, towards the middle of the concert, requests start flowing in.

25|$|Following the openers is the No. 3 or one-drop batsman. His {{job is to}} {{take over}} from the openers and {{typically}} play a careful and prolonged innings, effectively tying up {{one end of the}} batting. This brings in some stability in the batting, as new batsmen find it difficult to settle down <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> to have a settled batsman at the other end. The best batsman of the team is usually put at number 3 or 4, to protect him from the difficulties of batting against the best bowlers on a fresh pitch and to allow him to play a long innings.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} step, the molded {{component}} and core are both demolded and the core is melted-out from the molding. This {{is done in}} a hot bath, via induction heating, or {{through a combination of}} the two. Hot baths usually use a tub filled with glycol or Lutron, which is a phenol-based liquid. The bath temperature is slightly higher than that of the core alloy’s melting point, but not so high that it damages the molding. In typical commercial applications the parts are dipped into the hot bath via an overhead conveyor. The advantage to using a hot bath is that it is simpler than induction heating <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> cure thermoset moldings. The disadvantage is that it is uneconomically slow at a cycle time of 60 to 90 minutes and it poses environmental cleanup issues. Typically the hot bath solution needs cleaning or replacement every year or every half year when used in combination with induction heating.|$|E

They commented saying, [...] "this is {{basically}} what the Juiceman's been doing for 20 years — self-producing albums of bellowing bass, eerie synths, and shouted slogans.
