500|$|I'm {{trying to}} {{understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself.|$|E
500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] began a four-week {{break for}} the series, though the {{producers}} initially thought this gap would commence with the following episode. They were pleased that the switch did not cause issues, with Pinkner noting that [...] "we’re sort of in a zone of episodes where each one is amazing and each one either turns the story or resolves something important or there’s a cliffhanger– several episodes where each one is pretty awesome in itself and {{is also important to}} the overall patchwork of the season. We were very happy this ended up being one before we went on <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break.</b> I think the fans are going to be well satisfied to come back and watch the next one as well." ...|$|E
500|$|An Inconvenient Truth was {{scored by}} Michael Brook with an {{accompanying}} theme song played during the end credits by Melissa Etheridge. Brook {{explained that he}} wanted to bring out the emotion expressed in the film: [...] "...in Inconvenient Truth, there's a lot of information and it's kind of a lecture, in a way, and very well organized and very well presented, but it's a lot to absorb. And the director, Guggenheim, wanted to have – sort of give people <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> {{every once in a while}} and say, okay, you don't have to absorb this information, you can just sort of – and it was more the personal side of Al Gore's life or how it connected to the theme of the film. And that's when there's music." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{lifted her}} head from him, relinquishingly. With <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>breaking</b> away, he moved out of bed, and was taking his clothes. She {{stretched}} out her hand to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why was {{he called}} Click?" [...] I asked to tide over <b>an</b> uneasy <b>little</b> <b>break</b> in the conversation. The {{two men were}} staring at each other very fixedly.|$|R
6000|$|When at {{last they}} fell quiet, then the Men of the Mountains began wailing again for their lost comrades. They sit with their eyes shut, resting on their long narrow hands, their faces to the wall, and sing through their noses. First one takes up a high lamentable note, then another, and so on, faster and faster, {{for all the world}} like a faint and distant wind in the hills, until all the voices clash together, [...] "Tish--naehr!" [...] Then, in <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> <b>breaks</b> out the shrillest in solo again, and so they {{continue}} till they weary.|$|R
500|$|Only days later, Carey began posting {{irregular}} voice {{notes and}} messages on her official website: [...] "I'm {{trying to understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself." [...] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|While it was {{reported}} in April 2009 that Mortensen had, at least temporarily, retired from film acting, Mortensen said he was misquoted. In a 2012 interview, he denied that he ever said he was retiring, only that he didn't have [...] "plans to do another movie" [...] {{at the time and}} that he was [...] "taking <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> now. I don’t have anything lined up.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2013, {{at the age}} of 26 {{and eight}} months after being married, Blumenherst {{announced}} that she would take a leave from professional golf {{to spend more time with}} her husband. She said: [...] "I don’t want to say I’m retiring, because you never know what will happen. Maybe I’ll decide in a couple years to come back, and this will just be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break,</b> you never know." [...] The couple has two sons, William David, born in November 2014, and Charles Alexander, born in December 2016.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no. I don't mind running <b>a</b> <b>little</b> risk of <b>breaking</b> my neck, but {{not here}} on the Rock. I would rather get into ten scrapes, on board the frigate, than one here." ...|$|R
50|$|The Che channel {{declares}} {{this new}} season starts on January 23, 2017 after <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>break</b> has been lasting. Old car owners are offered to visit website of the Che Channel (link) and applied at {{it to take}} part, a car owner must add his car picture and after {{to be waiting for}} when Yury Sidorenko, The «Utilizator» host, ringing you up.|$|R
500|$|In June 2013, May {{signed for}} Conference South side Ebbsfleet United. On joining Ebbsfleet, May said — [...] "It's all {{exciting}} stuff; Steve Brown showed {{an interest in}} signing {{me as soon as}} he knew he would be manager of Ebbsfleet. I’m currently enjoying <b>a</b> nice <b>little</b> <b>break</b> from football but I’m itching to lace my boots up and get back on the pitch". He eventually left the club in January 2015.|$|R
60|$|Philippa {{laughed at}} him quietly. There was just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> in her voice, however.|$|E
60|$|Her voice {{died away}} with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break,</b> {{and there was}} silence. Soon she spoke again.|$|E
6000|$|The {{stranger}} made <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break,</b> and Wanhope asked, [...] "Could {{you make}} out what she screamed, or was it quite inarticulate?" ...|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{names for}} the spitball are spitter, mud ball, shine ball, supersinker, {{vaseline}} ball (because originally, Vaseline was used to give the ball <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more <b>break),</b> and emery ball, although technically, an emery ball is one where the ball has been abraded {{in much the same}} way that the original cut ball had been physically cut (an emery ball is also known as a scuff ball).|$|R
60|$|Cook {{was entirely}} pacified, {{and talked about}} roast chicken, and {{presently}} the little sisters were sitting up in their beds, each in her wrapper, being fed by turns with delicately-buttered slices, Mary standing between like a mother-bird feeding her young, and pleased to find the eyes grow brighter and less hollow, the cheeks less wan, the voices less thin and pipy, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> laugh <b>breaking</b> out when she mistook Minna for Ella.|$|R
6000|$|However, Caroline was {{convinced}} that the warnings against the intimacy had not been so uncalled for as she had believed; for she found, when she tried to tighten the reins, that her daughter was restive, and had come to think herself a free agent, as good as grown up. Spirit was not, however, lacking to Caroline, and when she had roused herself, she made Janet understand that she was not to be disregarded or disobeyed. Regular hours were instituted, and the difficulty of getting broken into them again was sufficient proof to her that she had done wrong in neglecting them. Armine yawned portentously, and declared that he could not learn except at his own times; and Babie was absolutely naughty more than once, when her mother suffered doubly in punishing her from the knowledge of whose fault it was. However, they were good little things, and it was not hard to re-establish discipline with them. After <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>breaking</b> in, Babie gave it to her dolls as her deliberate opinion that [...] "Wegulawity settles one's mind. One knows when to do what." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{come back}} as soon as I can," [...] she promised, with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> in her voice,--"as soon as ever I can, Mr. Heepman." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carrie laughed, {{though there}} was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> in her voice. [...] "They are yours, and so am I. Only you must think them precious--and never let me go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{took the}} part of the tenant-farmers, of course, as the beloved of one should in duty do.' There {{followed}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> or gasp, implying a strangled sigh.|$|E
60|$|She {{moved to}} her place and mounted the dais and seated herself upon her bench, {{gathering}} her chains into her lap and nestling her little white hands there. Then she waited in tranquil dignity, the only person there who seemed unmoved and unexcited. A bronzed and brawny English soldier, standing at martial ease in the front rank of the citizen spectators, did now most gallantly and respectfully put up his great hand and give her the military salute; and she, smiling friendly, put up hers and returned it; whereat there was <b>a</b> sympathetic <b>little</b> <b>break</b> of applause, which the judge sternly silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Accounts are {{not quite}} settled between us," [...] said she, with a passion that equalled my own. [...] "I can love, and I can hate. You had your choice. You chose to spurn the first; now you must test the other. It will take <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more to <b>break</b> your spirit, I see, but broken it shall be. Miss Marden comes back to-morrow, as I understand." ...|$|R
60|$|When a man steals cattle, {{they cut}} off {{his right hand and}} left leg and nail them up in the {{marketplace}} as a warning to everybody. Their surgery is not artistic. They slice around the bone <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> then <b>break</b> off the limb. Sometimes the patient gets well; but, as a general thing, he don't. However, the Moorish heart is stout. The Moors were always brave. These criminals undergo the fearful operation without a wince, without a tremor of any kind, without a groan! No amount of suffering can bring down the pride of a Moor or make him shame his dignity with a cry.|$|R
6000|$|... "We've been {{so lonely}} without you." [...] And then shyly, with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> in her voice, she asked: [...] "You are glad {{to come back}} to your home, aren't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't she?" [...] cried Dan, with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> in his voice, for he {{had found}} his father's manner rather trying. [...] "And she's good too. I assure you that she is--she is simply perfect every way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{only one}} {{question}} I want answered," [...] the girl replied, with straining eyes fixed upon Wrayson's face, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> in her tone. [...] "Shall I see him again? If Augustus was really--his brother--where is he? What has happened to him?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In February 2014, {{shortly after}} the release of Red Rising, Universal Pictures {{acquired}} the rights for a film adaptation in a 7-figure auction. Marc Forster is set to direct, with Brown writing the screenplay. Brown told Entertainment Weekly in that after completing the original trilogy, [...] "I took <b>a</b> meager <b>little</b> <b>break,</b> mostly to stretch my screenwriting muscles." [...] As of February 2016, the film was still in development, with Brown having written the first two drafts. He said in March 2016, [...] "I have written the first two drafts of the film and now we're on the third. Hopefully it will be greenlit this year. The vision from the film makers is Lawrence of Arabia in space', which is terribly exciting for me as it's my favorite film." ...|$|R
25|$|I made {{a mistake}} going into that fight. I knew Conn was kinda small and I didn't want them {{to say in the}} papers that I beat up on some little guy so the day before the fight I did <b>a</b> <b>little</b> roadwork to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> sweat and drank as little water as {{possible}} so I could weigh in under 200pounds. Chappie was as mad as hell. But Conn was a clever fighter, he was like a mosquito, he'd sting and move.|$|R
6000|$|The Invisible Man amused {{himself for}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while by <b>breaking</b> {{all the windows}} in the [...] "Coach and Horses," [...] and then he thrust a street lamp through the parlour window of Mrs. Gribble. He it must have been who cut the {{telegraph}} wire to Adderdean just beyond Higgins' cottage on the Adderdean road. And after that, as his peculiar qualities allowed, he passed out of human perceptions altogether, and he was neither heard, seen, nor felt in Iping any more. He vanished absolutely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you must}} be reasonable," [...] she begged, with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> in her voice. [...] "You {{know very well that}} I ought not to listen to you. I ought not to welcome you here. I ought to be strong and close my ears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doesn't {{all that}} Miss Fairclough has said apply to me?" [...] Philippa demanded, with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> in her voice. [...] "Richard is my twin brother, {{he is the}} dearest thing in life to me. Can't you realise, though, that what you ask of us is treason?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is so absurd--so horrible--to look back--and to {{remember}} nothing," [...] she said one day, with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>break</b> in her voice. [...] "I {{want to see}} some one who really belongs to me--my father, or my uncle, or some one. Perhaps that would help me--{{to remember}}." ...|$|E
50|$|A female {{artist is}} {{painting}} a seascape on a deserted beach when she discovers a beautiful conch. Curious, {{she puts her}} ear to it and listens to the echoes and sounds of the ocean waves. However, she also hears the voice of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl, Sophie, who recounts her short and troubled life in her small town, which once stood on a lush shore but has since been destroyed by an ecological catastrophe. One night, a boat discharged illegal toxic waste that poisoned the fish and local fisherman, eventually contaminating all the vegetation on the coast and the region's inhabitants. Sophie's story is recounted twelve months after the ecological disaster first struck that strip of land, forever ruining the habitat and claiming many lives, including that of the child herself. The film's last sequence nevertheless leaves a glimmer of hope: {{a group of children}} are playing near the sea, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl <b>breaks</b> away from the pack to invite the female protagonist to join their game.|$|R
50|$|However, Louis {{had clearly}} underestimated Conn's threat. In his autobiography, Joe Louis said:I {{made a mistake}} going into that fight. I knew Conn was kinda small and I didn't want them {{to say in the}} papers that I beat up on some little guy so the day before the fight I did <b>a</b> <b>little</b> roadwork to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> sweat and drank as little water as {{possible}} so I could weigh in under 200 pounds. Chappie was as mad as hell. But Conn was a clever fighter, he was like a mosquito, he'd sting and move.|$|R
6000|$|As to Barbara, {{she stood}} by the hearth, leaning her white {{shoulders}} against the carved marble, her hands behind her, looking down. Now and then her lips curled, her level brows twitched, a faint sigh came from her; then <b>a</b> <b>little</b> smile would <b>break</b> out, and be instantly suppressed. She alone was silent--Youth criticizing Life; her judgment voiced itself only in the untroubled {{rise and fall of}} her young bosom, the impatience of her brows, the downward look of her blue eyes, full of a lazy, inextinguishable light: ...|$|R
