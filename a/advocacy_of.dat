40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the concept <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> in context <b>of</b> {{procedural}} pain care and to investigate the implementation <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> in that context. First, the concept <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> was described on the basis of a literature review (n = 89 empirical studies from 1990 to 2003). Then, the concept was described in the context of procedural pain care on the basis of interview data (n = 22 patients, 21 nurses) in a medical and surgical context. In the second phase, an instrument exploring the content <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> and the implementation <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> in context <b>of</b> procedural pain care was developed and validated. Then, the content <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> and implementation <b>of</b> it was explored in a sample of otolaryngeal patients (n = 405) and nurses (n = 118) in 12 hospitals. In the third phase, an update literature review (n = 35 empirical studies from 2003 to 2007) was conducted, and all data from phases one and two were reviewed in order to refine the elements the concept <b>of</b> <b>advocacy,</b> and the relationships between these elements. As a result <b>of</b> this study, <b>advocacy</b> in context <b>of</b> procedural pain care was defined as consisting of the dual aspects <b>of</b> patient <b>advocacy</b> and professional advocacy, and called nursing advocacy. It was divided into dimensions and subdimensions in which patient and nurse empowerment seems to play a vital role. All the data obtained lend support to this definition <b>of</b> nursing <b>advocacy.</b> Patients and nurses felt that nearly all of the activities that they considered as advocacy were implemented...|$|R

Included in the literature is {{a wealth of information}} on the technical aspects <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> such as how it is done, when it is done, and with whom.

5|$|At {{this point}} in his life, Beebe was forming a close {{friendship}} with then-president Theodore Roosevelt, which would last until Roosevelt's death in 1919. Beebe admired Roosevelt's skill as a field naturalist as well as his <b>advocacy</b> <b>of</b> conservation, and Roosevelt's fame made his support highly valuable in Beebe's scientific endeavors. Roosevelt in turn admired Beebe's writing and his respect for the natural world. Roosevelt frequently provided praise for Beebe's books, and went on to write introductions to Beebe's books Tropical Wild Life and Jungle Peace.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, {{the leader}} of the North Carolina branch of the CPUSA, Junius Scales, became the final CPUSA member convicted under the Smith Act, and the only one convicted after the Yates decision. Prosecutors pursued Scales' case because he {{specifically}} advocated violent political action and gave demonstrations of martial arts skills. Scales was accused of violating the membership clause of the Smith Act, not the clause prohibiting <b>advocacy</b> <b>of</b> violence against the government. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Scales contended that the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act rendered the Smith Act's membership clause ineffective, because the McCarran Act explicitly stated that membership in a communist party does not constitute a per se violation of any criminal statute. In 1961, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, upheld Scales' conviction, finding that the Smith Act membership clause was not obviated by the McCarran Act, because the Smith Act required prosecutors to prove first, that there was direct <b>advocacy</b> <b>of</b> violence; and second, that the defendant's membership was substantial and active, not merely passive or technical. Two Justices of the Supreme Court who had supported the Yates decision in 1957, Harlan and Frankfurter, voted to uphold Scales' conviction.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{consistently}} {{called for}} a more equitable redistribution of wealth, so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia, could share fully in Canada's prosperity.

Macdonald's <b>advocacy</b> <b>of</b> provincial autonomy however, fell victim to the centralizing tendencies of a post-war welfare state in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs.|$|E
