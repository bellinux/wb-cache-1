40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of {{relating}} the nonschool experiences of students to the content of social studies textbooks. Specifically, this study explored the effect that the use of personalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions had on discussion of social studies textbook content. This study presented a questioning technique in which the teacher helped students relate their nonschool experiences to the discussion of textbook content. ^ The setting for this study was an elementary school located in Omaha, Nebraska. The subjects for the study were two groups of fifth-grade students which were designated as a control group and an experimental group. ^ A comparison of the effects of the use of personalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions as compared to generalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions was made through the use of five daily social studies lessons with both groups. ^ The following conclusions are based upon the findings of the study: (1) The data collected through the use of a Nonschool Activity Student Profile showed that the students were involved in a variety of nonschool activities that were related to social studies programs in schools. (2) The use of personalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions required more time to discuss social studies textbook content than when generalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions were used. Also, when personalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions were used, it appeared that a greater portion of lesson time was consumed by student talk during discussion with less time used for teacher talk. (3) When personalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions were used in the discussion of textbook content, the number of interactions between students and the teachers and among students were greater as compared to the use of generalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions.

Specifically, the study explored the effect that the use of personalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions had upon the discussions of social studies textbook content. ^ The study was designed to collect information to answer four research questions and test three hypothesis. After data had been collected, appropriate forms of analysis were utilized. Instruments utilized in this study included a Nonschool Activity Student Profile, five daily lesson plans, videotapes of daily lessons, a summative essay test, and an attitudinal survey. Statistical treatment of the data included the calculation of t-tests and chi-square distributions, as well as simple numerical formulas and calculations of percentages. ^ The following conclusions are presented: (1) Data collected through the use of the Nonschool Activity Student Profile provided specific information about each student 2 ̆ 7 s nonschool experiences. Fifth-grade students had a wide variety of nonschool experiences. (2) Discussion of textbook content through the use of personalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions required a greater amount of time than when generalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions were used. Also, more time was consumed by student talk and less by teacher talk when personalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions were used.

(4) Greater reference was made to nonschool experiences by students in the group using personalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> when writing about specific social studies textbook content. However, the amount of written material provided and the number of social studies terms used were used in greater quantities by students who had discussed the content through the use of generalized <b>application</b> <b>level</b> questions.

Moreover, the accumulative uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium by the rice plants was increased by application of organic manure in combination with 150 kg/hm 2 nitrogen.

Correlation analysis showed that rice yield {{was positively correlated with}} the accumulative uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium by the rice plants. The highest correlation coefficient observed was between the amount of nitrogen uptake and rice yield. The rate and accumulative amounts of ammonia volatilization increased with increasing nitrogen fertilizer <b>application</b> <b>level.</b> Compared with other stages, the rate and accumulative amount of ammonia volatilization were higher after base fertilizer application. The ammonia volatilization rates in response to the nitrogen <b>application</b> <b>levels</b> of 270 kg/hm 2 and 330 kg/hm 2 were much higher than those in the other treatments.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between nitrogen efficiency (NE), defined as seed {{yield per unit}} nitrogen (N) application, and seed quality was examined in two oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) varieties at 5 N <b>application</b> <b>levels,</b> 0. 6, 3, 6, 12, 15 mmol L - 1, N 1, N 2, N 3, N 4 and N 5, respectively. Seed yield, oil yield and protein content were increased {{with the increase in}} N <b>application</b> <b>level,</b> but NE and oil content were decreased, and the fatty acid composition in seed was hardly changed. Analysis of seven fatty acids revealed a slight decrease in the contents of erucic acid and arachidonic acid with the increase in N <b>application</b> <b>level,</b> but no obvious change in the contents of palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid. Compared with the low NE variety H 29, the seed yield and contents of erucic acid and arachidonic acid in the high NE variety bin 270 were more markedly increased with the increase in N <b>application</b> <b>level,</b> and the oil content was hardly changed. The seed yield, oil content and oil yield were higher in the high NE variety than in the low NE variety at all 5 N <b>application</b> <b>levels.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} protein, palmitic acid, stearic acid and oleic acid contents between the varieties at any of the 5 N <b>application</b> <b>levels,</b> but there were slight differences in the linoleic acid and linolenic acid contents between the two varieties. In brief, N application improved oil yield more greatly in the high NE variety than in the low NE variety, but hardly affected the fatty acid composition. Therefore, the seed quality and oil content of oilseed rape may not be decreased by breeding of a high NE variety with a high N absorption efficiency and high N use efficiency. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Traditionally, fault {{tolerance}} researchers have requiredarchitectural {{state to be}} numerically perfect for program execution to be correct. However, in many programs, even ifexecution is not 100 % numerically correct, the program can still appear to execute correctly from the user's perspec-tive. Hence, whether a fault is unacceptable or benign may depend {{on the level of}} abstraction at which correctness isevaluated, with more faults being benign at higher levels of abstraction, i. e. at the user or <b>application</b> <b>level,</b> comparedto lower levels of abstraction, i. e. at the architecture level. The extent to which programs are more fault resilient athigher levels of abstraction is application dependent. Programs that produce inexact and/or approximate outputs canbe very resilient at the <b>application</b> <b>level.</b> We call such programs soft computations, and we find they are common inmultimedia workloads, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Programs that compute exact numerical outputsoffer less error resilience at the <b>application</b> <b>level.</b> However, we find all programs studied in this paper exhibit some en-hanced fault resilience at the <b>application</b> <b>level,</b> including those that are traditionally considered exact computations-e. g., SPECInt CPU 2000...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{capacity}} {{values of}} strongly acidic and weakly acidic ionexchangers of biopolymers {{and the total}} cation exchange capacity of leaves and stems of maize are determined in dependence of fertilizer <b>application</b> <b>level,</b> soil pH and growth stage under field experiment conditions. Acidification of leached cinnamonic forest soil at high fertilizer <b>application</b> <b>levels</b> leads to an increased share of strongly acidic ionexchangers, mainly in the leaves. This provides additional cation exchange and shows the adaptability of maize to high soil acidity. The cation exchange capacities of leaves and stems increase with the rise in fertilizer <b>application</b> <b>level</b> and plant age. The capacity of stems is {{higher than that of}} the leaves, but the difference between them decreases in the same direction. In milk ripenness stage and highest fertilizer <b>application</b> <b>level</b> the capacities of leaves and stems are almost equal.
