5|$|Martin was an {{integral}} member of the Cardinals' teams of the 1930s that {{became known as the}} Gashouse Gang for their roguish behavior and practical jokes. Early in his career, he was labeled by some contemporary press reports as the next Ty Cobb because of his spirited, hustling style of play. However, because his headlong <b>attitude</b> <b>on</b> the playing field took a physical toll on his body, he never lived up to those initial expectations. After the end of his playing career, he continued his career in baseball as a successful minor league baseball manager.|$|E

One of the two lead anchors on the show, Casey, is called up for having an unprofessional <b>attitude</b> <b>on</b> and off screen in the light of his recent divorce from his wife, and is even thinking of leaving the show. Producer Natalie is stuck in a dilemma when she becomes attracted to her colleague Jeremy, who is the new sports statistician at the network.|$|E
5|$|Then Lothair, who {{had hoped}} for the {{complete}} conquest of Sicily, gave Capua and Apulia from the Kingdom of Sicily to Roger's enemies. Innocent protested, claiming that Apulia fell under papal claims. Lothair turned north, but died while crossing the Alps on December 4, 1137. At the Second Council of the Lateran in April 1139, Innocent excommunicated Roger for maintaining a schismatic <b>attitude.</b> <b>On</b> March 22, 1139, at Galluccio, Roger's son RogerIII, Duke of Apulia ambushed the papal troops with a thousand knights and captured the pope. On March 25, 1139, Innocent was forced to acknowledge the kingship and possessions of Roger with the Treaty of Mignano.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} concerned {{attitude change}} towards a majority or minority {{position as a}} function of convergent and divergent message processing. Results of a 2 (majority/minority support for persuasive arguments) × 3 (convergent/divergent/no-processing instructions) experiment showed that recipients identified more with a majority rather than minority, and identification was positively correlated with <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> the focal, but not the related issue. More importantly, results showed that in the no-processing condition, counter-attitudinal majority arguments produced more positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> the focal rather than related issue; minority arguments had no effects on either issue. A similar pattern emerged under convergent processing: majority support produced more positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> focal than related issues, while minority support had no effect on either issue. Divergent processing instructions, finally, produced more positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> the related issue than on the focal issue, {{especially in the case of}} minority support. Unexpectedly, majority arguments under divergent processing had no effect on focal or related attitudes whatsoever. Overall, results support the conclusion that majority arguments affect <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> focal issues more than on related issues because of convergent message processing, while minority arguments affect <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> related issues more than on focal issues because of divergent message processing and a desire to avoid identification with the source...|$|R

5|$|House {{was filmed}} {{on one of}} Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a {{storyboard}} {{over a period of}} about two months. Obayashi described the <b>attitude</b> <b>on</b> the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got into the spirit of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off her clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E
5|$|Most {{shooting}} {{was done at}} the Arthur Ranch in the San Francisco Valley, which was used as Aunt Elizabeth's estate for interior and exterior scenes. Beginning at the Arthur Ranch shoot, Grant and Hepburn often ad-libbed their dialogue and frequently delayed production by making each other laugh. The scene where Grant frantically asks Hepburn where his bone is was shot from 10 am until well after 4 pm because of the stars' laughing fits. After one month of shooting Hawks was seven days behind schedule. During the filming, Hawks would refer to four {{different versions of the}} film's script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue. His leisurely <b>attitude</b> <b>on</b> set and shutting down production to see a horse race contributed to the time it took to film, and he took twelve days to shoot the Westlake jail scene instead of the scheduled five. Hawks later facetiously blamed the setbacks on his two stars' laughing fits and having to work with two animal actors.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky {{remained}} friendly {{but never}} intimate {{with most of}} The Five, ambivalent about their music; their goals and aesthetics did not match his. He took pains to ensure his musical independence from {{them as well as}} from the conservative faction at the Conservatory—an outcome facilitated by his acceptance of a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory offered to him by Nikolai Rubinstein, Anton's brother. When Rimsky-Korsakov was offered a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, it was to Tchaikovsky that he turned for advice and guidance. Later, when Rimsky-Korsakov was under pressure from his fellow nationalists for his change in <b>attitude</b> <b>on</b> music education and his own intensive studies in music, Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, told him that he fully applauded what he was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. In the 1880s, long after the members of The Five had gone their separate ways, another group called the Belyayev circle took up where they left off. Tchaikovsky enjoyed close relations with the leading members of this group—Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and, by then, Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E

25|$|Siegel and Shuster {{were also}} avid moviegoers.

40|$|We study {{effects of}} {{explicit}} and implicit interethnic <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> ethnic discrimination in hiring. Unlike explicit attitudes, implicit attitudes are characterised by reduced controllability, awareness or intention. Effects of implicit interethnic <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> ethnic {{discrimination in the}} labour market remain under-researched. Moreover, previous experiments {{on the effects of}} explicit interethnic <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> discrimination have important drawbacks. We use data from a laboratory experiment (n = 272) consisting of an Implicit Association Test, a questionnaire and a recruitment test in which participants reviewed resumes representing fictitious applicants who varied regarding ethnicity, gender, education and work experience. Participants graded applicants and selected applicants for an interview. Results show that only explicit interethnic attitudes affect discrimination in grades, but both explicit and implicit interethnic attitudes increase discrimination in selection...|$|R

25|$|Lanfranc {{assisted}} William {{in maintaining}} {{the independence of the}} English Church; and appears at one time to have favoured the idea of maintaining a neutral <b>attitude</b> <b>on</b> the subject of the quarrels between papacy and empire. In the domestic affairs of England the archbishop showed more spiritual zeal. His grand aim was to extricate the Church from the fetters of corruption. He was a generous patron of monasticism.

40|$|Several {{studies of}} cross-national <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> {{immigration}} use {{a theory of}} self-interest that focuses upon the relative size of the immigrant group and the economic situation of the survey respondent. Kunovich wrote that attitudes can also be shaped by national economics, political structure, and culture. This study examines the influences of national economics and one factor of culture: political tolerance. I build upon previous explanations of public <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> immigration in two ways. First, I add to the current knowledge concerning {{the influence of the}} national economy <b>on</b> <b>attitudes</b> by including estimates of economic wealth and growth. Second, I examine the influence of political tolerance <b>on</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> immigration. This study uses ordered probit to examine data from the 1997 Eurobarometer survey. The results show that both economic and political tolerance influence public opinion <b>on</b> immigration. Therefore, <b>attitudes</b> are shaped by numerous factors beyond self-interest economic theories, including the health of the national economy and political tolerance...|$|R

25|$|In Yoga principle, it is {{recommended}} that one maintains a spiritual fast on a particular day each week (Monday or Thursday). A fast should also be maintained on the full moon day of each month. It is essential on the spiritual fasting day to not only to abstain from meals, but also to spend the whole day with a positive, spiritual <b>attitude.</b> <b>On</b> the fasting day, intake of solid food during the day is avoided and only a light veggie meal around 5 o'clock is taken. Water can be taken any time as needed. If health does not permit fasting for a whole day, for example with Diabetes, careful planning is done to reduce or skip one meal.|$|E
25|$|Cromwell's {{treatment}} of Kilkenny and Clonmel {{is in contrast}} to that of Drogheda and Wexford. Despite the fact that his troops had suffered heavy casualties attacking the former two, Cromwell respected surrender terms which guaranteed the lives and property of the townspeople and the evacuation of armed Irish troops who were defending them. The change in <b>attitude</b> <b>on</b> the part of the Parliamentarian commander may have been a recognition that excessive cruelty was prolonging Irish resistance. However, in the case of Drogheda and Wexford no surrender agreement had been negotiated, and by the rules of continental siege warfare prevalent in the mid-17th century, this meant no quarter would be given; thus {{it can be argued that}} Cromwell's attitude had not changed.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to examine university students’ <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> recreational exercise. The sample included 473 students from the University of Zagreb. We analyzed the data by analysis of frequency and a statistical method called »Relation model of action«. The results indicated that there were two general courses in students’ <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> recreation activities. The first course represents general values and the second course reflects the <b>attitudes</b> <b>on</b> specific sports and recreational activities. It can be concluded that university students recognize the importance of exercise but they do not understand its real meaning and they do not exercise regularly. Therefore, it is important to foster positive attitudes towards exercise early in youth, which would allow young people to preserve the healthy habit of exercise throughout their whole life. There is a need for quality system of education, which would start early in childhood...|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} that, during those years, Tzara and Janco {{first came to}} hear and {{be influenced by the}} absurdist prose of Urmuz, the lonesome civil clerk and amateur writer who would later become the hero of Romanian modernism. Years later, in 1923, Janco drew an ink portrait of Urmuz. In maturity, he also remarked that Urmuz was the original rebel figure in Romanian literature. In the 1910s, Janco was also interested in the parallel development of French literature, and read passionately from such authors as Paul Verlaine and Guillaume Apollinaire. Another immediate source of inspiration for his <b>attitude</b> <b>on</b> life was provided by Futurism, an anti-establishment movement created in Italy by poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and his artists' circle.|$|E
25|$|For {{nearly a}} decade prior to 1903, an {{industrial}} union called the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) had been increasing in power, militancy, and radicalism in response to dangerous working conditions, the imposition of long hours of work, and what members perceived as an imperious <b>attitude</b> <b>on</b> the part of employers. In particular, members of the WFM had been outraged by employers' use of labor spies in organizing efforts such as Coeur d'Alene. The miners' frustrations had occasionally exploded in anger and violence, although they had also tried peaceful change. For example, after winning a referendum vote for the eight-hour day with support from 72 percent of Colorado's electorate, the WFM's goal of an eight-hour law was still defeated by employers and politicians.|$|E
