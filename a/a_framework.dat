500|$|The {{most basic}} frames are called primary <b>frameworks.</b> <b>A</b> primary <b>framework</b> takes <b>an</b> individual's {{experience}} or {{an aspect of}} a scene that would originally be meaningless and makes it meaningful. One type of primary <b>framework</b> is <b>a</b> natural <b>framework,</b> which identifies situations {{in the natural world}} and is completely biophysical, with no human influences. The other type of <b>framework</b> is <b>a</b> social <b>framework,</b> which explains events and connects them to humans. An example of <b>a</b> natural <b>framework</b> is the weather, and an example of <b>a</b> social <b>framework</b> is <b>a</b> meteorologist who predicts the weather. Focusing on the social frameworks, Goffman seeks to [...] "construct a general statement regarding the structure, or form, of experiences individuals have at any moment of their social life".|$|R
