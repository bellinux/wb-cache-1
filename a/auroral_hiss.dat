40|$|The {{simultaneous}} VLF hiss observations at Syowa and Molodezhnaya Stations, Antarctica, {{showed that}} continuous <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> {{with a narrow}} spectral band was observed widely over the polar region, whereas the impulsive <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> with the burst-like spectral structure occurred mainly in the localized region of breakup of aurora. Based on the obtained results, the generation mechanisms of the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> of these two types are briefly discussed in the present paper...|$|E
40|$|Observations at Sanae, Antarctica of a {{pulsating}} aurora with a {{low light}} level T. V. system have been combined with simultaneous recordings of VLF hiss on a broad band receiver. Both <b>auroral</b> light and <b>hiss</b> intensities display a significant peak at 1. 3 Hz in the power spectrum. The peaks in the auroral light intensity variations lead those in the VLF hiss by times between zero and 0. 2 s, as revealed by cross-spectral analysis. These results are {{explained in terms of}} cyclotron resonance in the equatorial plane between the auroral electrons and echoing VLF hiss...|$|R
40|$|VLF and ELF waves were {{measured}} on two rocket payloads launched into the dayside auroral oval on Dec. 18, 1974, and on Jan. 11, 1975. The correlation of the VLF hiss intensity with the fluxes of precipitating electrons above 500 eV on short spatial and time scales was often poor, {{even when a}} positive slope existed in the electron phase space density. During the flight in 1975, distinct features were observed at the lower hybrid frequency; the frequency of this emission was used together with an independent density measurement to determine the relative concentration of O(+) to the heavier ions NO(+) and O 2 (+). It {{was found that the}} density of NO(+) or O 2 (+), which could not be distinguished, is enhanced over expected values between 150 and 400 km altitude. Broadband electrostatic and electromagnetic waves were observed after the barium-shaped charged explosion in 1975; the observed lowering of the <b>auroral</b> VLF <b>hiss</b> cutoff due to the barium is consistent with either ducting of VLF hiss emissions along the enhanced density duct produced by the barium or with local generation VLF hiss during the barium injection...|$|R
40|$|Observations of polarization, {{incident}} {{angle and}} arriving direction of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> {{were carried out}} at Syowa Station {{during the period of}} 1967 to 1970. The present paper consists of two parts. In Part I, we describe the equipment used for the measurement of polarization, incident and azimuthal angles and show the obtained results. The direction finding (DE) system used is based on the analysis of Lissajous 2 ̆ 7 figures of electric and magnetic fields displayed on cathode ray tubes. The individual polarization of the received signal is also measured. Moreover, <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> is decomposed into right-and left-handed polarized components, and these two components are continuously recorded. From the discussion of the observed results, it is found that <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> has propagated downward in the azimuthal direction from a not so broad range around the magnetic meridian plane and its incident angle is also not so large. Additionally, in most cases, <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> is known to consist of wave components downcoming from multiple directions in the azimuthal and incident planes. The DF system used was found to be effective in a few cases of isolated and sharp <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss.</b> However, this system should be re-examined because it is, strictly speaking, useful only for monochromatic waves, while the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> seems to have a noise-like nature. Therefore, a new DF system applying the correlation method is being planned to study, with more accuracy, the azimuthal and incident angles of noisy signals such as <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss.</b> The polarization of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> received on the ground seems to be almost right-handed circular, at VLF and LF, which is theoretically confirmed by the full wave calculation of the polarization using the realistic model of the auroral ionosphere. On the other hand, the observed polarization of ELF hiss is slightly right-handed circular, which can be reasonably accepted, taking into consideration the result of the full, wave calculation. In Part II, the morphological characteristics of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> are discussed in comparison with those of low-latitude hiss using the VLF data observed at Syowa Station and at Moshiri in Japan. <b>Auroral</b> <b>hiss,</b> considered to be a manifestation of polar substorms, is a local phenomenon and its frequency extends from a few kHz to more than 100 kHz. Low-latitude hiss, however, is closely correlated with worldwide geomagnetic storms and it is a narrow band VLF phenomenon. Together with other differences between them, it is concluded that <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> is completely different from low-latitude hiss. Although the morphological features of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> have been well known, a complete understanding of its generation mechanism has not yet been obtained. There are unsolved problems such as about two orders shortening of the calculated intensity below the observations and the existence of the threshold low-energy electron flux below which VLF hiss is not observed. These facts may suggest that a coherent plasma instability mechanism is partially involved in the generation of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss.</b> Therefore, the investigation of the coherency of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> being planned by us may give {{a better understanding of the}} generation processes of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a VLF (0. 3 - 18 kHz) {{experiment}} aboard OGO 4 are compared with simultaneous data obtained by the satellite on precipitating electrons at 0. 7, 2. 3, and 7. 3 keV to determine {{the source of the}} <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> band in the night side auroral zone. At these energies the correlation with VLF <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> is best at 0. 7 keV and worst at 7. 3 keV. Auroral electrons in the keV range may enhance the intensity of VLF <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> on the night side, but the predominant source of night side hiss appears to be electrons of energies below 0. 7 keV. <b>Auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> tends to occur simultaneously over a broad range of frequencies. A study based on OGO 6 data has revealed a lack of correlation between keV electrons and LF <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss.</b> These observations suggest that hiss of all frequencies is generated by electrons with energies below about 1 keV. The excellent correlation between <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> and 0. 7 keV electrons in the day time cleft is apparently maintained when the region of very soft electron precipitation is in motion...|$|E
40|$|<b>Auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> {{is rarely}} {{detected}} at subauroral-zone ground stations, {{but during the}} 4 -month period January to April 1976 it became very prevalent in the wide-band audio-frequency synoptic whistler records at Farewell, Alaska (L = 4. 2). A possible {{reason for this is}} that in the normal reduction and retreat of auroral zone effects to higher latitudes at sunspot minimum the reduction in the particle precipitation which causes auroral absorption is greater than that in the softer precipitation which causes <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss.</b> The occurrence of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> at Farewell showed, at 21 hours LMT (local magnetic time), the same strong diurnal peak found at auroral zone and polar cap stations. The low-frequency cutoff of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> on the ground is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic waves {{constructing}} <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> in the VLF range {{were observed}} by the S- 310 JA- 11 and - 12 rockets {{launched into a}} quiet auroral arc and into a breakup aurora respectively, from Syowa Station in Antarctica. An altitude profile of the electric field intensity, which peaked {{at an altitude of}} 90 km was observed by the S- 310 JA- 12 rocket in the frequency range less than 5 kHz. An estimation of the source location of the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> was made with the altitude profile of the hiss intensity calculated by the full wave analysis so as to agree with those observed especially around the altitude of 90 km. It was found that the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> is most likely to be generated at an altitude about 700 km or less. On the other hand, the absolute intensity of the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> at a frequency of 4 kHz observed by the rocket, which was 9. 4 × 10 ^ V/m/√, was much stronger, by about 50 dB, than that observed at Syowa Station. This means that the k-vector direction of the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> actually observed by the rocket lay outside the transmission cone, so that the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> could reach Syowa Station with very week intensity...|$|E
40|$|The polar-orbiting DE 1 {{spacecraft}} {{has provided}} the first measurements of high-latitude auroral phenomena. Three types of plasma-wave emissions were observed: <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss,</b> Z-mode radiation, and auroral kilometric radiation. Whistler mode <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> emissions were observed on virtually every pass over the auroral zone. The shape of the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> frequency-time spectrum is explained by a whistler mode propagation effect if the radiation is emitted from a spatially localized source below the spacecraft. Broadband Z emissions have been observed in the low-density region over the auroral zone and polar cap. The <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> may be distinguished from the Z-mode radiation by the sharp upper cutoff of the whistler mode at the local electron plasma frequency. Auroral kilometric radiation usually occurs at frequencies above electron gyrofrequency, indicating that this radiation is propagating in the free-space R-X mode...|$|E
40|$|<b>Auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> is {{observed}} to propagate over distances comparable to an Earth radius from its {{source in the}} auroral oval. The role of Landau damping is investigated for upward propagating <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss.</b> By using a ray tracing code and a simplified model of the distribution function, the effect of Landau damping is calculated for <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> propagation through the environment around the auroral oval. Landau damping {{is found to be}} the likely mechanism for explaining some of the one-sided <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> funnels observed by Dynamics Explorer 1. It is also found that Landau damping puts a lower limit on the wavelength of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss.</b> Poleward of the auroral oval, Landau damping is found in a typical case to limit omega/k(sub parallel) to values of 3. 4 x 10 (exp 4) km/s or greater, corresponding to resonance energies of 3. 2 keV or greater and wavelengths of 2 km or greater. For equatorward propagation, omega/k(sub parallel) is limited to values greater than 6. 8 x 10 (exp 4) km/s, corresponding to resonance energies greater than 13 keV and wavelengths greater than 3 km. Independent estimates based on measured ratios of the magnetic to electric field intensity also show that omega/k(sub parallel) corresponds to resonance energies greater than 1 keV and wavelengths greater than 1 km. These results lead to the difficulty that upgoing electron beams sufficiently energetic to directly generate <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> of the inferred wavelength are not usually observed. A partial transmission mechanism utilizing density discontinuities oblique to the magnetic field is proposed for converting <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> to wavelengths long enough to avoid damping of the wave over long distances. Numerous reflections of the wave in an upwardly flared density cavity could convert waves to significantly increased wavelengths and resonance velocities...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} types of auroral radio emissions are reviewed. Particular attention {{is given to}} the following four types of electromagnetic emissions: <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss,</b> saucers, ELF noise bands, and auroral kilometric radiation. It is shown that the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> and auroral kilometric radiation are generated along the auroral field lines relatively close to the earth, at radial distances in the range of 2. 5 - 5 earth radii, probably in direct association with auroral-particle acceleration by parallel electric fields. The <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> appears to be generated by amplified Cerenkov radiation. Several mechanisms are proposed for the auroral kilometric radiation, usually involving the intermediate generation of electrostatic waves by the precipitating electrons...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} fifty years, a {{multitude}} of spacecraft and rocket experiments have studied plasma wave emissions from Earth 2 ̆ 7 s auroral regions. One such emission is <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss,</b> a low-frequency whistler-mode wave that is produced in the auroral zone. Observations from Earth-orbiting spacecraft show that <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> is generated by field-aligned electron beams, with the resulting plasma wave emission propagating along the resonance cone. This propagation results in <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> appearing as a V-shaped funnel when observed on a frequency-time spectrogram. This thesis presents the first comprehensive study of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> at a planet other than Earth, using the Cassini spacecraft to study <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> at Saturn. NASA 2 ̆ 7 s Cassini spacecraft, currently in orbit around Saturn, has allowed for the first opportunity to study this emission in detail at another planet. Since 2006, the Cassini spacecraft has twice been {{in a series of}} high inclination orbits, allowing investigation and measurements of Saturnian auroral phenomena. During this time, the Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) Investigation on Cassini detected low frequency whistler mode emissions propagating upward along the auroral field lines, much like terrestrial <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss.</b> Comparisons of RPWS data with observations from several other Cassini instruments, including the Dual-Technique Magnetometer (MAG), Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI), and the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS), have revealed a complete picture of this emission at Saturn. Observations from these instruments have been used to make a variety of determinations about <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> at Saturn. RPWS has only observed this emission when Cassini was at high-latitudes, although these observations have shown no preference for local time. Tracking the times this emission has been observed revealed a clear periodicity in the emission. Further study later revealed not one but two rotational modulations, one in each hemisphere, rotating at rates of 813. 9 and 800. 7 degrees per day in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. These rates match with observations of the clock-like Saturn Kilometric Radiation. Study of the field-aligned current structures in the auroral regions revealed a strong upward-directed current in both hemispheres on the lower-latitude side of the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> emission. Along with correlating particle densities, these observations were used to infer the presence of a high-density plasmasphere at low latitudes, with the series of field-aligned current structures lining up with the outer boundary at L-shell values of around 12 - 15. Analysis of electron beams observed in conjunction with <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> shows that these beams produce large growth rates for whistler-mode waves propagating along the resonance cone, similar to terrestrial <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss.</b> Analytical calculation of the normalized growth rates of ten electron beam events on Day 291, 2008, yielded a wide range of growth rates, from 0. 004 to over 6. 85 times the real frequency. The latter, a non-physical result, came from a violation of the weak growth approximation, suggesting there was so much growth that the analytical calculation was not valid in this instance. Numerical calculation using a plasma dispersion-solving code called WHAMP produced a growth rate of about 0. 3, a still very large number, suggesting the detected beams may be the source of the observed <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> plasma wave emission...|$|E
40|$|Observations of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> {{obtained}} from the Voyager 1 encounter with Jupiter have been reanalyzed. The Jovian <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> was observed near the inner boundary of the warm Io torus and has a low-frequency cutoff caused by propagation near the resonance cone. A simple ray tracing procedure using an offset tilted dipole of the Jovian magnetic field is used to determine possible source locations. The results obtained are consistent with two sources located symmetrically {{with respect to the}} centrifugal equator along an L shell (L approximately = 5. 59) that is coincident with the boundary between the hot and cold regions of the Io torus and is located just inward of the ribbon feature observed from Earth. The distance of the sources from the centrifugal equator is approximately 0. 58 +/- 0. 01 R(sub J). Based on the similarity to terrestrial <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss,</b> the Jovian is <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> is believed to be generated by beams of low energy (approximately tens to thousands of eV) electrons. The low-frequency cutoff of the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> suggests that the electrons are accelerated near the inferred source region, possibly by parallel electric fields similar to those existing in the terrestrial auroral regions. A field-aligned current is inferred to exist at L shells just inward of the plasma ribbon. A possible mechanism for driving this current is discussed...|$|E

40|$|A newly {{developed}} direction finding ("DF") for <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> {{based on the}} measurement of time difference of wave arrival {{was carried out in}} 1978 at Syowa Station (geomag. lat. - 70. 4 °), Antarctica and its two slave unmanned observing points located at about 20 km from Syowa Station. The <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> signals received at the two spaced points were transmitted to Syowa Station by 2 GHz telemeters. The arrival time difference of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> between Syowa Station and each spaced point was automatically determined by cross-correlating the waveforms of the received signals. It has been found that the new DF can determine localized exit regions at the ionospheric level which show a rapid temporal movement. A comparison of the DF results with ground-based auroral data has shown that impulsive type <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> with a wide frequency range larger than several tens kHz has not emerged from the whole region of bright aurora but from some localized regions of bright auroras at the ionospheric level, and that the arrival directions of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> change rapidly in accordance with the auroral movements. The time resolution of the new DF is about 3 μs by the measurement of delay times between two observing points in the reception of NAA wave. Therefore, the incident and azimuthal angles were measured with an accuracy of about 10 °in the range of incident angle of 20 °to 80 °...|$|E
30|$|Below 1000  kHz, {{impulsive}} LF <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> {{is often}} observed, a whistler mode emission which like MFB occurs at substorm onsets (e.g., Makita 1979; Morgan 1977; LaBelle et al. 1994). In some cases, intense bursts of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> are {{correlated with the}} bursts of MFB below the 1300 – 1500  kHz cutoff. The association of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> with MFB, and with bursts of MFB below the electron gyrofrequency in particular, {{as well as the}} existence of the distinctive cutoff and gap, motivates speculation that the portion of MFB below the gyrofrequency might be whistler mode. According to this scenario, the MFB generation mechanism produces either LO-mode or W-mode depending on the emission frequency (LaBelle and Treumann 2002, p. 406). In the absence of polarization measurements, this interpretation remained speculative.|$|E
40|$|Properties of VLF saucers and auroral hisses {{have been}} studied by using ISIS VLF {{electric}} field data (50 Hz- 30 kHz) received at Syowa Station, Antarctica. Source altitudes of VLF saucers are obtained from frequency-time spectra of VLF saucers by assuming the limiting ray model. The source distances of VLF saucers are less than about 800 km below the satellite. VLF saucers occur around the high-and low-latitude ends of the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> region. The active <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> and the stable <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> are classified according to the variability of the narrow-band intensity data processed from ISIS VLF tapes. The frequent occurrence region of the former agrees well with the usual auroral zone, while the latter occurs at invariant latitude from about 70 °to about 80 °both on {{the day and night}} sides. The properties of the stable <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> have some similarities to those of the precipitating low-energy electrons, the so-called polar rain, in occurrence region and in intensity.

40|$|<b>Auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> in the {{vicinity}} of a quiet arc is studied by comparing the data obtained from a sounding rocket with predictions of the convective beam amplification (CBA) model of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> generation. It is concluded that the VLF <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> observed by the payload appears to have been natural in origin. The CBA model produces predicted hiss spectra that are in good agreement with the data. The hiss intensity above the ionosphere was greater equatorward of the arc than within the arc; this pattern appears {{to be the result of}} emission geometry and refraction. Hiss intensity was not found to be better correlated with 0. 1 - 0. 7 keV fluxes than with more energetic electrons. No evidence is found for a three-wave parametric decay process.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{types of}} electromagnetic plasma wave emission {{produced in the}} high latitude auroral regions are reviewed. Three types of radiation are described: auroral kilometric radiation, <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss,</b> and Z mode radiation. Auroral kilometric radiation is a very intense radio emission generated in the free space R-X mode by electrons associated {{with the formation of}} discrete auroral arcs in the local evening. Theories suggest that this radiation is an electron cyclotron resonance instability driven by an enhanced loss cone in the auroral acceleration region at altitudes of about 1 to 2 R sub E. <b>Auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> is a somewhat weaker whistler mode emission generated by low energy (100 eV to 10 keV) auroral electrons. The <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> usually has a V shaped frequency time spectrum caused by a freqency dependent beaming of the whistler mode into a conical beam directed upward or downward along the magnetic field...|$|E
40|$|From {{the results}} of the {{simultaneous}} observations of direction finding of 5 - 8 kHz <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> with aurora at Syowa Station (geomagnetic latitude, - 70. 4 °), the comparison between the exit region of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> from the ionosphere and the location of aurora has been made. The relation between the exit region of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> and 8 kHz hiss intensities at Syowa and at Mizuho (geomagnetic latitude, - 72. 3 °) Stations has been investigated. The exit regions of the narrow-band hiss emissions (≲ 20 kHz) which usually occur at geomagnetically quiet times are located at lower latitudes than the location of aurora appearing over or to the geomagnetic south of Mizuho. In this case, the intensities of 8 kHz hiss at Syowa and at Mizuho depend on the propagation distances from the exit region to the two stations. The exit regions of the wide-band hiss emissions (≲ 100 kHz) which usually occur during geomagnetically moderate disturbances are located in a localized active region of aurora or at higher latitudes than the location of aurora appearing around the zenith or to the geomagnetic north of Syowa. In this case, the intensity of 8 kHz hiss at Mizuho is highter than that at Syowa. In order to interprete these observational results, two propagation models have been proposed as regards to <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> emissions which exit through the ionosphere at lower latitudes as well as at higher latitudes than the location of aurora...|$|E

40|$|Two recent {{sounding}} rocket experiments have yielded VLF wave data with spectral structures {{ordered by the}} hydrogen gyrofrequency. The spectral structures occur near and above the lower hybrid frequency in association with <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss.</b> These structures are observed within and near regions of auroral electron precipitation and transverse ion acceleration. They are accompanied by <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> but are anticorrelated with spectral peaks at the lower hybrid frequency. They are typically found above 500 km altitude, have no measurable magnetic component, and are at least occasionally short wavelength. Because the spectral structures appear to be electrostatic, are ordered by the hydrogen gyrofrequency, and are short wavelength, the structures are interpreted as modes which connect the lower hybrid mode with the hydrogen Bernstein modes. A study of the plasma wave mode structure {{in the vicinity of}} the lower hybrid frequency is presented to substantiate this interpretation. These results imply that these waves are a common feature of the auroral zone ionsphere above 500 km altitude and exist any time that <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> exists.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR) {{was made by}} the Voyager spacecraft over three decades ago. The Voyager observations showed that SKR had a well-defined clock-like amplitude modulation with a period of 10 hr 39 min 24 ± 7 sec. Since then much has changed. In 2000 radio observations by the Ulysses spacecraft showed that the SKR modulation period varied by as much as several minutes on time scales of years. This long-term variability was subsequently confirmed by radio measurements from the Cassini spacecraft, which was put in orbit around Saturn on 1 July 2004. We now know that there are three basic types of Saturnian radio emissions: SKR at frequencies from about 50 to 1, 200 kHz; narrowband (NB) emissions in two frequency ranges, near 5 kHz and near 20 kHz; and whistler-mode <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> at frequencies from a few Hz to several kHz. All of these radio emissions display long-term variations in their modulation periods of up to one percent or more on time scales of years, with smaller variations on shorter time scales. For several years prior to Saturn’s recent equinox (August 2009) these radio emissions displayed two dominant periods of about 10. 6 and 10. 8 hours. The 10. 6 -hour period {{has been shown to be}} associated with SKR and <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> originating from the northern auroral zone; and the 10. 8 -hour period has been associated with SKR and <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> originating from the southern auroral zone. The narrowband emissions observed during this period have the same two periods as the SKR and <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss,</b> but do not have the corresponding north-south symmetry. As equinox approached the two periods converged and now appear to have crossed several months after equinox. A similar crossing of the two components may have occurred in the Ulysses measurements of SKR during the Saturn’s equinox fourteen years ago. Possible models for explaining these complex long term variations will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} thought from ray tracing studies that quasi {{electrostatic}} whistler mode <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> {{is difficult to}} propagate {{down to the ground}}. To evaluate a refracting capability of VLF waves, we use the equations which were originally given by R. R. SCARABUCCI (1969). The refracting capability becomes gradually large with decreasing altitude in the height range above 2000 km, and it becomes very large by a gradient of electron density below 2000 km. It is confirmed from ray tracing and the calculation of the refracting capability that the wave normal of a quasi electrostatic whistler mode <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> can enter the transmission cone at the ionospheric altitude when a latitudinally irregular magnetospheric plasma model is adopted, but, such a wave propagation is impossible with a simple diffusive equilibrium (DE) model. As the result, hiss is able to propagate down to the ground under the restricted condition...|$|E
40|$|Determination of {{the origin}} of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> by {{comparing}} the records of a vlf experiment (0. 3 to 18 kHz) with simultaneous data obtained by an auroral-particle experiment having detectors for precipitating electrons at 0. 7, 2. 3, and 7. 3 keV. It is found that, on the dayside of the earth, the occurrence of vlf hiss correlates well with precipitation events at 0. 7 keV, but in general very poorly with activity in the higher-energy channels. Exact correlation between variations in vlf hiss intensity and in electron fluxes is rare even at 0. 7 keV. In addition, vlf hiss tends to be observed over a somewhat larger spatial region than precipitating 0. 7 -keV electrons. It is concluded that, on the dayside, <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> is generated by soft (E less than 1 keV) 'cusp region' electrons and that the lack of detailed correlation between the two phenomena is caused by propagation effects as the hiss travels downward and spreads from the generation region...|$|E
40|$|Wave normal {{directions}} of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> observed by the S- 310 JA- 5 rocket are analyzed from the spin modulation data of electric field components {{picked up by}} a dipole antenna extended perpendicular to the rocket axis, and the angle between the wave normal direction and the rocket axis observed by the crossed loop antennas which are both perpendicular to the rocket axis. It is found that the wave normals were making large angles to the magnetic meridian plane, so that the ray paths tracing back to the source indicate an altitude which is not above 700 km, when the electron and ion temperature are less than 800 K. The electron density between 200 km and 230 km actually observed by same rocket showed a density gradient much less than that represented by the plasma temperature of 800 K. This point will support our result for the source altitude of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> observed by rocket...|$|E
40|$|A new {{direction}} finding technique (abbreviated as DF) for <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> emissions is introduced {{based on the}} measurement of time differences of arrival of waves between three spaced observing stations. Two unmanned observatories for VLF hiss were built at positions about 20 km south and east from Syowa Station (geomagnetic lat. - 69. 6 °), Antarctica. The VLF signals observed at these two unmanned stations are sent in real time to Syowa Station over 2 GHz wide-band telemetry systems. The arrival time differences of VLF hiss signals between Syowa Station and each unmanned station are automatically determined by cross-correlating the wave forms of the received signals. The arrival directions of hiss emissions {{are determined by the}} tripartite observation method. The accuracy of the whole system is about 10 °in incident and azimuthal angles. A comparison of the results obtained with those of ground-based auroral data has shown that the arrival directions of <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> correspond well to the bright aurora areas at the ionosphere level and that they change rapidly in accordance with movements of the aurora...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{intensity}} and polarization measurements of narrow-band <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> observed simultaneously {{with the direction}} finding (DF) observations at Syowa Station, Antarctica, are compared with results of the full-wave calculation in a realistic ionospheric model. The ratios of the 8 kHz hiss intensity observed at Syowa to that at Mizuho Station (about 270 km distant from Syowa in the geomagnetic south direction) depend on the propagation distance from the exit regions {{at the height of}} the lower edge of the ionosphere to the two ground stations. However, the observed ratios (SY/MI) are 2 - 3 dB higher than the corresponding theoretical values. The disagreement is discussed as regards to the effects of the wave polarization and the ground conductivity at the observing site on the received wave intensity. The distribution of R/L (R-to L-handed polarized component) values of the narrow-band <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> observed at Syowa with incident angles indicates a similar tendency to the R/L values for the limiting polarization by full-wave calculation, but the observed values are smaller than the calculated ones. The disagreement seems to be caused by the low accuracy of DF at small incident angles, and by the disturbance from strong VLF atmospherics...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{estimate}} the dynamic structure of the VLF ionospheric exit point, we conducted multipoint ground-based observation of the natural VLF emissions at three unmanned sites: West Ongul (69 ° 01 ′ S, 39 ° 30 ′ E), Skallen (69 ° 40 ′ S, 39 ° 24 ′ E), and H 100 (69 ° 18 ′ S, 41 ° 19 ′ E) around Japanese Syowa station, Antarctica, during a whole year of 2006. In this observation, we developed three sets of unmanned autonomous observation systems for natural VLF emissions. Each observation system consists of two crossed vertical loop antennas to pick-up North–South (NS) and East–West (EW) magnetic components, a multi-channel analyzer, and a data logger. The intensity and polarization of NS and EW magnetic components are obtained in 4 spaced frequency (0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, and 6. 0 kHz) channels by the multi-channel analyzer. The VLF emissions observed at the three sites exhibit an interesting difference in the wave intensity {{as well as the}} polarization that allows important information about the locations of their ionospheric exit point to be determined. Firstly, to find the distinct exit point, we have theoretically calculated the spatial distributions of the wave intensity and the polarization on the Earth for VLF whistler mode waves coming down from the magnetized ionosphere, by using the full-wave analysis. Then, we have compared the calculated results with the observed data, to evaluate the possible locations of the ionospheric exit point for the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> events. As an example, the direction of the estimated ionospheric exit point for the <b>auroral</b> <b>hiss</b> event at 31 March 2006 was found to be consistent with a bright aurora region.
