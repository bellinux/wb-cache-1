50|$|<b>Ambroxol</b> is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of the neuronal Na+ channels. This property {{led to the development}} of a lozenge containing 20 mg of <b>ambroxol.</b> Many state-of-the-art clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of <b>Ambroxol</b> in relieving pain in acute sore throat, with a rapid onset of action, with its effect lasting at least three hours. <b>Ambroxol</b> is also anti-inflammatory, reducing redness in a sore throat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ambroxol</b> is a lysosomotropic drug of {{clinical}} use to treat conditions of productive cough for its mucolytic action. <b>Ambroxol</b> triggers the exocytosis of lysosomes via neutralization of lysosomal pH and calcium release from acidic calcium stores. Presumably for this reason, <b>Ambroxol</b> {{was also found}} to improve cellular function in some disease of lysosomal origin such as Parkinson's or lysosomal storage disease.|$|E
50|$|As of 2017, in a {{combination}} drug with <b>ambroxol</b> it was available as Aliviatos, Ambroclar, Antitusivo L Labsa, Bronar, Broncovital, Broquixol, Clarixol, Ideobron, Lorabrox, Lorfast-AM, Sensibit XP, and Toraxan, and in {{a combination}} drug with <b>ambroxol</b> and salbutamol as Sibilex.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} {{recently}} shown that <b>Ambroxol</b> triggers exocytosis of lysosomes by releasing calcium from acidic cellular calcium stores. This occurs by diffusion of <b>Ambroxol</b> into lysosomes and lysosomal pH neutralization. This mechanism {{is most likely}} responsible for the mucolytic effects of the drug, but may also explain the reported activity in Gaucher and Parkinson's disease.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ambroxol</b> has {{recently}} been shown to increase activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Because of this {{it may be a}} useful therapeutic agent for both Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease. <b>Ambroxol</b> triggers the secretion of lysosomes from cells by inducing a pH-dependent calcium release from acidic calcium stores. Hence, relieving the cell from accumulating degradation products is a proposed mechanism by which this drug may help.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ambroxol</b> also {{provides}} pain relief in acute sore throat. Pain in sore throat is {{the hallmark of}} acute pharyngitis. Sore throat is usually caused by a viral infection. The infection is self limited and the patient recovers normally after a few days. What is most bothering for the patient is the continuous pain in the throat maximized when the patient is swallowing. The main goal of treatment is thus to reduce pain. The main property of <b>Ambroxol</b> for treating sore throat is the local anaesthetic effect, described first in the late 1970s, but explained and confirmed in more recent work.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} formulations developed since the first marketing authorisation in 1978. <b>Ambroxol</b> is available as syrup, tablets, pastilles, dry powder sachets, inhalation solution, drops and ampules as well as effervescent tablets.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ambroxol</b> is {{indicated}} as [...] "secretolytic therapy in bronchopulmonary diseases associated with abnormal mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport.

50|$|<b>Ambroxol</b> is a secretolytic agent {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of respiratory diseases associated with viscid or excessive mucus. It is the active ingredient of Mucosolvan, Mucobrox, Mucol, Lasolvan, Mucoangin, Surbronc, Ambolar, and Lysopain. The substance is a mucoactive drug with several properties including secretolytic and secretomotoric actions that restore the physiological clearance mechanisms of the respiratory tract, which {{play an important role in}} the body’s natural defence mechanisms. It stimulates synthesis and release of surfactant by type II pneumocytes. Surfactant acts as an anti-glue factor by reducing the adhesion of mucus to the bronchial wall, in improving its transport and in providing protection against infection and irritating agents. <b>Ambroxol</b> is often administered as an active ingredient in cough syrup.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to Bay K8644, {{which is not}} for clinical use, <b>Ambroxol</b> is a frequently used mucolytic drug that triggers lysosomal secretion by mobilizing calcium from acidic calcium stores. This effect does most likely not occur by a direct interaction between the drug and a lysosomal calcium channel, but indirectly by neutralizing the acidic pH within lysosomes. Calcium permeable ion channels in lysosomal membranes that may be activated by a luminal pH increase include two pore channels (TPCs), mucolipin TRP channels (TRPMLs) and purinergic receptors of the P2X channel type.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ambroxol</b> is {{a widely}} used secretolytic agent {{originally}} developed from vasicine, a natural alkaloid found in Adhatoda vasica, extracts {{of which have been}} used to treat bronchitis, asthma, and rheumatism. We previously reported that <b>ambroxol</b> inhibits IgE-dependent mediator secretion from human mast cells and basophils, key effector cells of allergic inflammation. Here, the mechanisms involved in the inhibitory properties of <b>ambroxol</b> were assessed in comparison to other secretolytic analogues (e. g. vasicine, bromhexine, sputolysin). The results show that, in comparison to <b>ambroxol,</b> which reduced IgE-dependent histamine release from basophils at 10 microM- 1 mM, the release of the amine was only moderately reduced by sputolysin and vasicine at 1 mM. In contrast, above 10 microM, bromhexine was found to be toxic to basophils in vitro as evidenced by induction of histamine release and reduced cell viability. In contrast, the inhibitory actions of <b>ambroxol</b> at concentrations below 1 mM were not toxic and entirely reversible. <b>Ambroxol</b> was also more potent than either sputolysin or vasicine in attenuating basophil IL- 4 and IL- 13 secretions, whereas bromhexine-induced suppression of de novo cytokine synthesis was due to toxic effects. Additionally, <b>ambroxol</b> reduced IgE-dependent p 38 MAPK phosphorylation in basophils, unlike bromhexine, sputolysin and vasicine. These results clearly show that <b>ambroxol</b> is both more potent and effective at inhibiting IgE-dependent basophil mediator release and p 38 MAPK activity than the other secretolytic analogues employed. The therapeutic potential of <b>ambroxol</b> as an anti-allergic agent is further underlined by these data. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effect of <b>ambroxol</b> on the concentration of cefotaxime in the bronchioal-veolar lavage fluid of rats with bleomycin‑induced pulmonary fibrosis. A total of 54 Wistar male rats were randomly divided into three groups, namely the normal control group, model group and <b>ambroxol</b> group. On experimental day 0, the rats were intratracheally instilled with bleomycin (5 mg/kg body weight) or sterile saline. The rats in the <b>ambroxol</b> group were then treated with <b>ambroxol</b> (35 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally. On days 7, 14, 28 after instillation, six rats from each group were sacrificed, bronchial alveolar fluids were recovered and the lungs were collected for histopathological examination following the injection of cefotaxime (600 mg/kg) intrave-nously. The concentration of cefotaxime in the bronchial alveolar fluids was assayed by a liquid chromatography‑mass spectrometry method. On day 7, the concentration of cefo-taxime in the bronchial alveolar fluid of the <b>ambroxol</b> group was {{lower than that of}} the model group. On day 14, the concen-tration of cefotaxime in the bronchial alveolar fluids of the <b>ambroxol</b> group was higher than that of the model group, and the difference between these groups was significant statisti-cally (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Neutrophils {{are major}} culprits for the protease/antiprotease {{imbalance}} during various lung diseases, that is, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, {{idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}} and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Thus, these cells are presently considered an ideal target for the pharmacologic control of tissue injury during these diseases. This study was planned in order to investigate if <b>ambroxol</b> and its precursor bromhexine are actually capable of preventing alpha- 1 -antitrypsin (A 1 AT) inactivation by stimulated neutrophils and possibly {{to look into the}} mechanisms underlying this event. <b>Ambroxol</b> inhibited the production of superoxide anion by activated neutrophils, whereas bromhexine had no inhibitory effect. <b>Ambroxol</b> decreased the production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from activated neutrophils with high efficiency, whereas bromhexine had a modest activity. <b>Ambroxol</b> and bromhexine were capable of limiting the chlorination of monochlorodimedon by HOCl, displaying the capacity of directly scavenging the oxidant. <b>Ambroxol</b> decreased the release of elastase and myeloperoxidase from activated neutrophils, whereas bromhexine was ineffective. <b>Ambroxol</b> prevented the A 1 AT inactivation by neutrophils, whereas bromhexine was completely ineffective. Among drugs currently available for in vivo use in humans, <b>ambroxol</b> is unique by virtue of its ability to prevent neutrophil-mediated A 1 AT inactivation via inhibition of HOCl production as well as HOCl scavenging. Also taking into account its capacity for curbing elastase release, the drug displays the potential to lessen the burden of oxidants/proteases and to increase the antiprotease shield at the site of inflammation. Thus, <b>ambroxol</b> appears to be a good candidate for raising attempts to develop new therapeutic histoprotective approaches to inflammatory bronchopulmonary diseases...|$|E
