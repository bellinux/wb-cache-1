5000|$|Following ureterostomy, urine {{needs to}} be {{collected}} in bags. Several designs are available. One popular type features an open bag fitted with an <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>valve,</b> which prevents the urine from flowing back toward the stoma. A urostomy bag connects to a night bag that may {{be attached to the}} bed at night. Urostomy bags are available as one- and two-piece bags: ...|$|E
30|$|The {{recovery}} time was quick and no case {{has suffered from}} urinary regurgitation or stenosis. The extravesical technique may be more feasible in cases with more extensive defects. In this situation it also offers easier connect-ability but has the disadvantage of possible urine backflow. The transvesical technique {{has the advantage of}} creating an <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>valve</b> and offering a more stable result.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{methods of}} {{arrangement}} of combined intravenous parallel infusions using <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>valve</b> (ARV), {{with and without}} anti-syphon valve (ASV) that could decrease occlusion alarm delay were investigated. Methods: Occlusion challenge tests were mainly performed as bench experiments of four kinds of multiple parallel infu-sions (10 ml/h and 50 ml/h infusions), which were connected at the proximal or distal portion of ARV, with or without ASV. Alarm threshold was set to 1000 mmHg. Occlusion alarm delays and the compliances of the infusion systems were compared among groups. Results: Without ASV, compared to 10 ml/h infusion alone distal to <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>valve,</b> 50 ml/h infusion distal to <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>valve</b> reduced the mean alarm delay from 416 ± 7 s to 81 ± 3 s (P < 0. 001). Compared to 50 ml/h infusion alone, combined 10 ml/h and 50 ml/h infusion distal to ARV prolonged the alarm delay from 81 ± 3 s to 133 ± 6 s (P < 0. 001). However, combined infusions distal to ARV with ASV significantly reduced the alarm delay from 133 ± 6 s to 74 ± 5 s (P < 0. 001), and also reduced the compliance of the infusion system from 2. 31 ± 0. 12 to 1. 20 ± 0. 08 μl/mmHg (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: The infusion setup of faster infusion rate, lower compliant system using ASV could effectively decrease oc-clusion alarm delay during multiple intravenous parallel infusions using ARV.

40|$|The tick {{feeding process}} in humans and its local effects {{have been studied}} histologically and in {{reflection}} microscopy on specimens of skin lesions, and on tick samples. The mouthparts of the attached ticks, embedded in a cement cone, lined the oral canal. The pharynx was supplied with <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>valves</b> and dilating muscles. The dermis around the mouthparts was, characteristically, replaced by a lose network of fibrin, endothelia, and collagen fibers, soaked with edema and blood, with a dense neutrophilic infiltrate beneath the cone. The vessels showed interruptions, with blood extravasation, endothelial proliferation, and vasculitis. After the tick removal, Erythema Chronicum Migrans–like patches, foreign body granuloma, T- and the B-cell lymphoid hyperplasia, and alopecia areata –like hair loss were recognized...|$|R
40|$|Endoscopic {{insertion}} of a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) through a malignant {{common bile duct}} stricture is {{the first line of}} palliation for malignant jaundice. Patency of these stents remains a major concern. SEMS dysfunction can result from tumor ingrowth, overgrowth and/or clogging. Initial SEMS modifications involved covering {{the central part of the}} stent in order to reduce ingrowth and ultimately increase patency. Fully covered stents became available shortly after reports of their use in human patients. The potential removability and radial strength of SEMS have led to evaluation of their use in new indications including benign biliary strictures, post sphincterotomy bleeding and perforation. Other aspects of development include the addition of features such as <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>valves,</b> drug elution and spontaneous biodegradability. These aspects and their clinical implications are reviewed and discussed. JOURNAL ARTICLESCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The tick {{feeding process}} in humans {{and its effects}} on the host skin have been studied histologically on {{specimens}} of tick bites, some of which included the attached parasite, and on ticks extracted from lesions or caught in the wild. The specimens, included in paraffin, were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, orcein–Giemsa for elastic fibers, periodic acid-Schiff for polysaccharides, Weigert method for fibrin, Warthin-Starry stain for spirochetes, and Bodian’s method for nerve fibers. The mouthparts of the attached ticks were embedded in a cement cone, with the chelicerae and the hypostome lining the oral canal, while the basis capituli contained the pharynx with its <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>valves,</b> the hypopharynx with its dilating musculature, and the muscles serving the chelicerae. The structure of the motor muscles, of the inner organs, of the central nervous system, and the cuticle with its nerve endings were also visible. The superficial and the mid dermis underlying the cone was replaced by a lose network of fibrin, endothelial linings, and residual collagen bundles, soaked with edema and blood. The dilated small vessels showed gaps of the walls with blood extravasation, and endothelial proliferation, sometimes associated to neutrophilic and eosinophilic vasculitis. A dense neutrophilic infiltrate was present beneath the apex of the cone. The lesions observed after the tick removal included: Erythema Chronicum Migrans – like changes, foreign body granuloma, cutaneous T- and the B-cell lymphoid hyperplasia, and alopecia with involvement of the permanent portion of the hair follicles and hyperplasia of their fibrous sheaths. The acute changes, similarly to the “cavity” described in the animal hosts, result from a “vacuum pump” action performed by the mouthparts, together with the effect of proteinases, vaso-dilators, anticoagulants, immunosuppressants and antiinflammatory molecules contained in the regurgitated saliva. A persistent reaction of the host to these chemicals and/or to possible infectious agents accounts for the subacute and chronic lesions...|$|R
30|$|The late ureteroneovesical {{stenosis}} rate in {{this series}} was 5.4  %. Most patients underwent ureteral reimplantation, and only two had a lifelong single-J stenting. The ureteroneovesical anastomosis was created by a simple refluxing end-to-end anastomosis, which {{is believed to have}} the lowest stenosis rates (Roth et al. 1997). An anti-reflux anastomosis is not considered necessary for three reasons: An OIN is a low-pressure system that cannot provoke active reflux; the afferent ileal limb acts as an anti-reflux protection mechanism; and urine in an OIN is considered to be sterile (Hautmann et al. 2006). Stenosis rates are higher in <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>valve</b> anastomoses (9  %) while refluxing anastomoses stenosis rates are generally reported in no more than 3  % (Studer et al. 2006; Hautmann et al. 1999; Gakis and Stenzl 2010). Long-term and adequate follow-up could again explain the higher stenosis rate in our series.|$|E
