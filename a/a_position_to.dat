5|$|After Actium and {{the defeat}} of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> rule the entire Republic under an {{unofficial}} principate—but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains. He did so by courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, appearing {{that he was not}} aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy. Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{one of the}} plaintiffs' witnesses, a {{chartered}} land surveyor, {{had suggested}} that the authorities could redevelop the land in a different manner, he did not state that the authorities' redevelopment plan was wrong or indefensible. The court was not in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> decide which plans for redeveloping areas in Singapore were better. Thus, the acquisition of the temple property had not infringed Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{was not in}} <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> {{influence}} what transpired at Fort Griswold, as {{he remained}} in New London and observed the action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, {{because he was the}} commanding officer who bore full responsibility for the actions of his men. American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the simple fact that he had betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.|$|E

5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and {{controlled}} state business and patronage. However, {{she was never}} in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> control {{the country as a}} whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.|$|E
5|$|Following his baptism, Edwin's Northumbrian priests were in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to}} {{suppress}} pagan practices in Eorpwald's kingdom and convert the East Anglians.

5|$|In 2006, Norberto Fontana {{claimed in}} an {{interview}} with the Argentinian newspaper Olé that a few hours before the Grand Prix the Ferrari team director Jean Todt visited the Sauber motorhome and told the Swiss team, which used Ferrari engines at the time, that the Saubers must block Jacques Villeneuve if they were in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> do so in order to help Michael Schumacher win the World Championship.|$|E
5|$|In 796 or 797 the Welsh engaged Mercian {{forces at}} Rhuddlan. By 798 Coenwulf was in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> invade in return, killing Caradog ap Meirion, the King of Gwynedd. A {{civil war in}} Gwynedd in the 810s ended with the {{succession}} of Hywel ap Caradog in 816 or 817, and Coenwulf invaded again, this time ravaging Snowdonia and taking control of Rhufuniog, a small Welsh territory near Rhos. It is not clear if the Mercians {{were involved in a}} battle recorded in Anglesey in 817 or 818, but the following year Coenwulf and his army devastated Dyfed.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, {{at the age}} of 26, Chatwin was {{promoted}} to a director of Sotheby's, <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> which he had aspired. To his disappointment, he was made a junior director and lacked voting rights on the board. This disappointment, along with boredom and increasing discomfort over potentially illegal side deals taking place at Sotheby's, including the sale of objects from the Pitt-Rivers museum collection, led Chatwin to resign from his Sotheby's post in June 1966.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the evidence of the}} Chronicle that Æthelberht was accorded the title of bretwalda, there is evidence of his domination in several of the southern kingdoms of the Heptarchy. In Essex, Æthelberht appears to have been in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> exercise authority shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of King Sæberht of Essex, his nephew, to Christianity. It was Æthelberht, and not Sæberht, who built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where St Paul's Cathedral now stands. Further evidence is provided by Bede, who explicitly describes Æthelberht as Sæberht's overlord.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Arthur Miller Boyd (11 November 1923 − 14 February 2008) was an English {{professional}} footballer who played 333 matches in the Football League in the 1940s and 1950s. After {{serving in the}} Royal Navy during the Second World War, Boyd signed for Second Division club Plymouth Argyle, where he spent two seasons playing as an inside forward. When he began playing as a wing half, <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> which he was better suited, he attracted attention, and soon secured a transfer to the First Division with Birmingham City for what was for Plymouth a record fee.|$|E

The princes also {{believed that}} he would be in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> ensure that independent India adhered to any terms that might be agreed upon, because Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel had asked him to become the first Governor General of the Dominion of India.|$|E

5|$|New manager Craig Brown {{successfully}} guided Scotland to the 1996 European Championship tournament. The {{first game}} against the Netherlands ended 0–0, raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against England at Wembley. Gary McAllister missed a penalty kick, and a goal by Paul Gascoigne led to a 2–0 defeat. Scotland recovered to beat Switzerland 1–0 with a goal by Ally McCoist. England taking a 4–0 lead in the other match briefly put both teams in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> qualify, but a late goal for the Netherlands meant that Scotland were knocked out on goals scored.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1944, the 6th Airborne Division {{landed in}} Normandy {{to secure the}} left flank of the British landing zone. The division's {{objectives}} were to capture intact the Caen canal bridge, the Orne river bridge, destroy the Merville gun battery– which was in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> engage troops landing at the nearby Sword– and the bridges crossing the River Dives, the latter to prevent German reinforcements approaching the landings from the east.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the final}} {{decision}} on {{the location of the}} new capital territory, the local landowners and residents of Queanbeyan looked favourably on the possibility of having the territory located nearby. Such a result, it was hoped, would bring improvements to local infrastructure, increase the demand for local goods and services, and raise land values. It was assumed that the existing freehold arrangements would remain, and that those whose land was not required for the city itself would be in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> capitalise on the new circumstances.|$|E

In late March 1899, Gefion was sent to Kiaotschou in response to mistreatment of German missionaries there; Kapitänleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) Franz Grapow went ashore with a landing party of 132marines and artillerymen to punish the offenders.|$|E

5|$|The {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} extends the classical theory, which determined {{the interest rate}} solely by savings and investment, in that it adds bank credit.

Hence, the equilibrium (or market) interest rate is not only influenced by the propensities to save and invest {{but also by the}} creation or destruction of fiat money and credit.|$|E
