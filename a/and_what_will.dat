5|$|In June 2011, Malmö Stad {{decided that}} a new public {{swimming}} arena is {{to be built in}} the same area as the stadium in the near future. This leaves the stadium's future clouded in uncertainty. Recent occurrences have indicated that Malmö Stadion might continue to be used as an athletics arena, as MAI intends to revive the MAI Gala. In November 2012, MAI lobbied to attract 100 metres Olympic champion Usain Bolt to the stadium for the proposed MAI Gala in August 2014. MAI are also working towards hosting the European Athletics Junior Championships in 2015, and have written to the European Athletic Association to express their interest. On 31 January 2015 new reports suggested that the city council had reached an agreement that Malmö Stadion is to be demolished. The decision to approve the demolition of the stadium was taken on 2 February 2015. As of February 2015 it is still unknown when the demolition process will start <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> become of the area.|$|E

[...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said the film [...] "delivers all the 3D CGI mayhem audiences have come to expect from the Marvel entertainment juggernaut, but there’s darkness and confusion just under its comic-book surface." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said, [...] "What makes The Winter Soldier so enjoyable, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> make it so profitable, is its emotional bandwidth—all the vivid, nuanced life lived by its characters in between their frenzied escapades," [...] and felt it fixed all the shortcomings of The First Avenger [...] "and then some".|$|E

Al-Bulqini commented that [...] "the terminology of the hadith specialists is more than this, while, at the same time, is only ṣaḥīḥ and its opposite.
