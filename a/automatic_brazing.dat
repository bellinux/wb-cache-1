40|$|As an {{alternative}} to oven brazing a brazing, process has been developed {{which is based on}} local electric heating, such as resistance or induction heating. Joining is executed in an inert gas atmosphere e. g. argon or nitrogen or in a weak reducing atmosphere, e. g. forming gas with a maximum of 10 % hydrogen, thus eliminating the necessity of applying aggressive flux material. Steel, Cr-Ni-steel, hard metal as well as brass alloys, can be brazed flux free. The joint surfaces are activated by means of heat, which causes the oxide layer to crack and spall. It will be demonstrated that different metals require different temperatures for the breaking of the oxide layer to occur and, thus, for wetting of the braze. Inert gas brazing with local heating is currently employed in the industry. Manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>brazing</b> equipment for this procedure is commercially available...|$|E
50|$|Torch brazing {{is by far}} {{the most}} common method of {{mechanized}} brazing in use. It is best used in small production volumes or in specialized operations, and in some countries, it accounts for a majority of the brazing taking place. There are three main categories of torch brazing in use: manual, machine, and <b>automatic</b> torch <b>brazing.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> torch <b>brazing</b> is {{a method}} that almost {{eliminates}} the need for manual labor in the brazing operation, except for loading and unloading of the machine. The main advantages of this method are: a high production rate, uniform braze quality, and reduced operating cost. The equipment used is essentially the same as that used for Machine torch brazing, with the main difference being that the machinery replaces the operator in the part preparation.|$|R
