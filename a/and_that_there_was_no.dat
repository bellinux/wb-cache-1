5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E

A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
5|$|On February 2, 2015, Cody {{was indicted}} on animal cruelty and drug charges by a Baltimore County grand jury.

Cody's agent, Peter Schaffer, denied his client's guilt and said that Cody's dog died of worms <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> animal cruelty.

5|$|São Paulo's mayor Gilberto Kassab {{supported}} {{the selection of}} the Morumbi Stadium and guaranteed that president Luis Inácio da Silva wanted the same; he blamed FIFA for vetoing the selection. He said Corinthians could not influence FIFA and that CBF wanted Morumbi Stadium to host the opening game. The senior management of São Paulo F.C. criticised the chosen stadium and the selection process on numerous occasions after Morumbi Stadium was excluded from the World Cup. President Juvenal Juvencio said the region had no city structures, hospitals or hotels; the only way to enter or leave the area would be to use a fire engine <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> way to create a VIP area around the stadium. Juvenal blamed ex-governor José Serra for Morumbi Stadium's deselection. Serra denied the accusations.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, at the {{direction}} of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal opened an inquiry into thirteen cases of unresolved recognition for past acts of gallantry. Among the group were eleven naval personnel, including Sheean. Known as the 'Valour Inquiry', the Tribunal was directed to determine if the individuals were unduly overlooked for recognition {{at the time of their}} actions and, if so, whether retrospective awards were appropriate. The inquiry lasted two years and witnessed 166 written submissions from the public, before the Tribunal reported its findings in January 2013. In the case of Sheean, the Tribunal found that there was no manifest injustice with the award of the Mention in Despatches, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> new evidence to support the reconsideration of Sheean for a Victoria Cross for Australia. If Sheean had lived, they reported, he might have been recommended for either the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal or the Distinguished Service Medal instead, but neither medal could be awarded posthumously in 1942. The Tribunal did recommend that the RAN perpetuate the use of Sheean as the name of a major combatant vessel.|$|E
5|$|In What Starts Wars: Intentional Delusions Stratton {{presented}} nations, themselves {{collections of}} people, as triggering war from several delusions. Three of those delusions held by citizens were {{that their own}} country was a paragon of peace, that its arms were only to defend the land, and that when it fought, it fought only for what was right. Blaming the enemy rounded out this list justifying war. Stratton believed and stated people could be freed of these delusions <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> will to war integral to human nature. He saw both the need for and the ways to eliminate war in individuals and in their ways, and not in abstract or innate traits. Florence Finch Kelly, reviewing the book for the New York Times, saw Stratton's placing of both the blame and the responsibility on persons, of identifying the roots {{of war in the}} psyches {{of the men and women}} his readers, as an action likely to discomfit those readers.|$|E

5|$|Recognising {{that the}} {{situation}} was safer for him, Lenin returned to Petrograd via Vyborg. There, Lenin attended {{a meeting of the}} Bolshevik Central Committee on 10 October, where he again argued his case that the party should lead an armed insurrection of their supporters to topple the Provisional Government. This time, he was successful in his argument, and the motion was ratified with ten votes against two. Those critical of the plan, Zinoviev and Kamenev, expressed the view that Russian workers would not support a violent coup against the existing regime <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> clear evidence for Lenin's assertion that all of Europe {{was on the verge of}} proletarian revolution.

This was the base of the Military Revolutionary Committee (MRC), an armed militia that had been established by the Petrograd Soviet with the Provisional Government's support during the Kornilov Affair; the MRC consisted largely of those loyal to the Bolsheviks.|$|E

5|$|Several {{lawsuits}} {{have been}} filed against Yelp accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products. Each have been dismissed by a judge before reaching trial. In early 2010, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Yelp alleging it asked a Long Beach veterinary hospital to pay $300 a month for advertising services that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews. The following month, nine additional businesses joined the class-action lawsuit, and two similar lawsuits were filed. That May the lawsuits were combined into one class-action lawsuit, which was dismissed by San Francisco U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in 2011. Chen said the reviews were protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> evidence of manipulation by Yelp. The plaintiffs filed an appeal. In September 2014 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, finding that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to favor advertisers, this would not fall under the court's legal definition of extortion.|$|E

5|$|Singapore {{argued that}} Pedra Branca was terra nullius, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> {{evidence}} the island {{had ever been}} under {{the sovereignty of the}} Johor Sultanate. In the event the Court did not accept this argument, Singapore contended that sovereignty over the island had passed to Singapore due to the consistent exercise of authority over the island by Singapore and its predecessor, the United Kingdom. The actions taken included selecting Pedra Branca as the site for Horsburgh Lighthouse and constructing the lighthouse, requiring Malaysian officials wishing to visit the island to obtain permits, installing a military rebroadcast station on the island, and studying the feasibility of reclaiming land around the island. Malaysia had remained silent {{in the face of these}} activities. In addition, it had confirmed in a 1953 letter that Johor did not claim ownership of the island, and had published official reports and maps indicating that it regarded Pedra Branca as Singapore territory. Middle Rocks and South Ledge should be regarded as dependencies of Pedra Branca.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown {{to the left and}} needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her disappearance, {{according}} to her friends, Carol was feeling depressed. She had talked of tracing her biological parents, as she was adopted. On 17 July 1976, she went missing. Gordon claimed that she had left home for another man, and Carol had left their home in Leece twice before. It was for this reason, Gordon claimed, {{that he did not}} report her missing for six weeks. Carol was said to time her periods away from home to coincide with the school holidays. Gordon claimed that it wasn't until she didn't return in time to take up her job as a primary school teacher in September (the start of the school term) that he realised that there was a problem. At this time he reported her missing via his solicitor, and her family was informed. On the day she vanished, the family had been due to visit Blackpool on a day trip. However, Carol said she felt unwell and wanted to remain behind in bed. She was never seen alive again by her family. Gordon claimed he returned home to find Carol had left the house, leaving behind her wedding ring, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sign of a struggle. A missing persons enquiry was launched, but nothing came of it. This missing persons report was subsequently lost, and it was implied by some that it was because both Gordon and a senior police commander (who, by the time the article was published, had died) involved in the case were freemasons. This was rebutted by Sandra Lean, who, in No Smoke, claimed that Gordon had never been a freemason. At the time, police told Gordon that, should a body be found, he would be the main suspect.|$|E
