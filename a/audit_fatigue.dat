50|$|Back in 2000, {{food safety}} {{was a top}} of mind issue for {{companies}} due to several high-profile recalls, quarantines and negative publicity about the food industry. There was also extensive <b>audit</b> <b>fatigue</b> through the industry, as retailers performed inspections or audits themselves or asked a third party to do this on their behalf. These were often carried out against food safety schemes that lacked international certification and accreditation, resulting in incomparable auditing results.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{work hours}} of junior doctors {{have been in}} the {{spotlight}} since the mid- 1980 s. Rostering and the structure of surgical units aim to balance quality and continuity of patient care with reasonable working hours. Methods: Actual hours worked during two 12 -week surgical registrar rosters were compared. Compliance of each roster with fatigue recommendations was assessed with <b>Fatigue</b> <b>Audit</b> InterDyne (FAID, InterDynamics Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia) software. Workload was determined from an electronic prospective surgical audit. Impact of the roster change was discussed with consultants and registrars. The traditional roster started on 16 July 2007 and the fatigue-friendly roster on 14 July 2008. Results: The total number of hours worked reduced by 11 % (from 5085. 17 h in 2007 to 4530. 85 h in 2008). Fatigue was eliminated (from 133. 25 h in 2007 to 0 h in 2008). Over the 12 -month period, the operative workload for the Department of General Surgery increased by 18 %. FAID compliance improved from 67. 3 to 91. 2 %. Consultant and registrar satisfaction with the new roster was high. Conclusions: Safe working hours have been achieved for surgical registrars by restructuring the surgical units and implementing a new on-call rota without a perceived effect on patient care.
