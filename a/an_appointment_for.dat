5|$|With the {{creation}} of the Cadet Instructional Staff of the Australian Military Forces, Blamey saw a new opportunity. He sat the exam and came third in Australia, but failed to secure an appointment as there were no vacancies in Western Australia. After correspondence with the military authorities he persuaded the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General, Major Julius Bruche, that he should be given the option of taking up <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>for</b> one of the vacancies in another state. He was appointed to a position in Victoria with the rank of lieutenant, commencing duty in November 1906 with responsibility for school cadets in Victoria.|$|E
5|$|In 1837, Augustus {{attempted}} to obtain <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>for</b> James to the United States Military Academy, but the vacancy for his congressional district {{had already been}} filled so James was appointed in 1838 by a relative, Reuben Chapman, who represented the First District of Alabama (where Mary Longstreet lived). James was a poor student academically and a disciplinary problem at West Point, ranking 54th out of 56 cadets when he graduated in 1842. He was popular with his classmates, however, and befriended a number of men who would become prominent during the Civil War, including George Henry Thomas, William S. Rosecrans (his West Point roommate), John Pope, D. H. Hill, Lafayette McLaws, George Pickett, and Ulysses S. Grant, who was of the Class of 1843. Longstreet was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant. After a brief furlough, {{he set out to}} join the 4th U.S. Infantry at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. Longstreet spent his first two years of service at the post, which was under the command of Lt. Col. John Garland. In 1843, he was joined by his friend, Lieutenant Ulysses Grant.|$|E
5|$|When the {{war began}} the Army was {{on the cusp of}} a generational change. At the time, the senior {{officers}} on the active list were Major Generals Gordon Bennett and Thomas Blamey, although Bennett had not held <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>for</b> seven years and Blamey for the last two. Then came the Chief of the General Staff, Major General John Lavarack; the Adjutant General, Major General Sir Carl Jess; Major General Owen Phillips, the Quartermaster General; Major General Edmund Drake-Brockman, the commander of the 3rd Division; and Major General Iven Mackay, the commander 2nd Division. All were over 50 years of age and all except Bennett, Drake-Brockman and Mackay were serving or former regular soldiers. Only the first three were considered to command the 6th Division and Second AIF, for which posts Blamey was selected by Prime Minister Menzies. Both Blamey and Lavarack were promoted to lieutenant general on 13 October 1939. Blamey was subsequently appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) I Corps following its raising in March 1940, while Mackay was appointed to succeed him in command of the 6th Division and Lavarack assumed command of the newly formed 7th Division.|$|E

When Harris had left, Adams gave a single injection of 10cc of the Megimide. Hullett developed broncho-pneumonia and on the 23rd at 6.00 a.m. Adams gave Hullett oxygen. She died at 7.23 a.m. on 23 July. The results of a urine sample taken on 21 July were received after Hullett's death, on the 24th.

Fellow cadet William Rosecrans would later remember Sherman at West Point as [...] "one of the brightest and most popular fellows" [...] and [...] "a bright-eyed, red-headed fellow, who was always prepared for a lark of any kind". About his time at West Point, Sherman says only the following in his Memoirs: ...|$|E
500|$|The Mozarts {{were free}} to leave Milan early in November, but they stayed another month because Leopold hoped {{that the success of}} Ascanio would lead to <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>for</b> Wolfgang from a royal patron. He {{apparently}} solicited Archduke Ferdinand on 30 November, and his request was passed on to the imperial court in Vienna. It is possible that Leopold's pushiness in Vienna over La finta semplice still rankled, or that word of his crowing over Hasse's failure had reached the Empress. For whatever reason, Maria Theresa's reply to the archduke was unequivocal, describing the Mozarts as [...] "useless people" [...] whose appointment would debase the royal service, and adding that [...] "such people go around the world like beggars". Leopold never learned this letter's contents; by the time it reached Milan the Mozarts had left, disappointed but still hopeful. [...] "The matter is not over; I can say that much", Leopold wrote as he and Wolfgang made their way home.|$|E

500|$|By 1926, he rallied {{with the}} People's League, and unsuccessfully asked Octavian Goga to assign him a {{candidature}} for a Parliamentary seat during {{the elections of}} that year. In January 1928, he again became pursuing {{a career in the}} diplomatic service, and sought <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>for</b> himself at the Romanian Consulate in Helsinki, Finland; he thus visited Foreign Minister Nicolae Titulescu in Italy, at Sanremo. His passage through Lombardy coincided with major floods, an event recorded with interest in his private notes. Titulescu received him at the Miramare Hotel, but talks between them were inconclusive. According to Perpessicius, the failure was generated by the adversity other politicians had towards Caragiale, while Ion Vianu argues that the ambition itself had constituted proof of [...] "perfect utopianism". The writer was nonetheless pleased with his visit, having been deeply impressed by the Italian landscape, and, as a result, attempted to create an atmosphere of, in his words, [...] "profound Italian rustic quietude" [...] on his property in Fundulea. His diary also perpetuated the rumor according to which Titulescu was a cocaine addict.|$|E
500|$|Holly later {{returns to}} McKinley High as a {{substitute}} sex education teacher in the season's fifteenth episode, [...] "Sexy". She informs Will {{that the members of}} New Directions are woefully ignorant about sex. He invites her to teach the glee club about safe sex, and she performs a rendition of Joan Jett's [...] "Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)", much to the chagrin of the new head of the celibacy club, guidance counselor Emma (Jayma Mays). Holly advises Puck and Lauren (Ashley Fink) that the sex tape they plan to make is illegal, as both are minors, and helps Brittany (Heather Morris) and Santana (Naya Rivera) start {{to come to terms with}} their true feelings for each other, later performing [...] "Landslide" [...] with them in front of the club. When Emma's choice of [...] "Afternoon Delight" [...] as an abstinence song reveals her sexual naivete, her husband Carl (John Stamos) asks Holly for <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>for</b> him and Emma to work out issues in their sex life. During the counseling session, he reveals that Emma is still a virgin, and in answer to a question from Holly, Emma admits that she may still have feelings for Will. At the end of the episode, Holly begins a relationship with Will.|$|E
500|$|Leopold, {{unaware of}} the Empress's views, {{continued}} to pursue <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>for</b> Wolfgang by applying to Grand Duke Leopold I of Tuscany, the Empress's third son. The application was strongly supported by Count Firmian, and Leopold, in a coded letter home, said he was quite hopeful. While the Mozarts waited for a reply, Wolfgang composed a series of [...] "Milanese" [...] string quartets (K.155/134a to K.160/159a), and the famous motet Exsultate, jubilate, K.165. Leopold resorted to deception to explain his extended stay in Milan, claiming to be suffering from severe rheumatism that prevented his travelling. His ciphered letters to his wife Anna Maria assure her {{that he is in}} fact well, but urge her to spread the story of his indisposition. He waited through most of January and all of February for the Grand Duke's reply. The negative response arrived on 27February. It is not known whether the Grand Duke was influenced by his mother's opinion of the Mozart family, but his rejection effectively ended Leopold's hope of an Italian appointment for Wolfgang. The Mozarts had no choice now but to return to Salzburg, leaving Milan on 4March and reaching home nine days later. Neither father nor son visited Italy again.|$|E

500|$|On August 24, 2009, Garrido {{visited the}} San Francisco {{office of the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and left a four-page essay {{containing}} his ideas about religion and sexuality, suggesting that he had discovered a solution to problem behaviors like his past crimes. The essay described how he had cured his criminal sexual behaviors and how that information {{could be used to}} assist in curing other sexual predators by: [...] "controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts." [...] On the same day, he went to a University of California, Berkeley police office with Dugard's two daughters, seeking permission to hold a special event on campus as a part of his [...] "God's Desire" [...] program. He spoke with U.C. Berkeley special events manager Lisa Campbell. She perceived his behavior as [...] "erratic" [...] and that the girls were [...] "sullen and submissive." [...] She asked him to make <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>for</b> the next day, which he did, leaving his name in the process. Officer Ally Jacobs discovered, through a background check, that Garrido was a registered sex offender on federal parole for kidnapping and rape. When he and the girls returned for their appointment at 2:00p.m. the following day, August 25, Jacobs made a point of sitting in during the meeting. The girls appeared to Jacobs to be pale, as if having not been exposed to sunlight, and their behavior unusual. Since Garrido's several parole violations were a basis for an arrest, Jacobs phoned the parole office to relay her concerns, leaving a report of the meeting on voicemail.|$|E
