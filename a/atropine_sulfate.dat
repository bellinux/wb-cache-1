50|$|Reported {{effective}} treatment for early zygacine poisoning in animals consists of injection of 2 mg <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and 8 mg picrotoxin per 45 kg bodyweight. Intravenous fluid therapy {{is also used}} to increase the blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|Dioxathion must {{be stored}} away from alkalis, iron, tin and strong acids. Contact {{can be avoided}} by using {{protective}} clothing and eyeware. If poisoning occurs, a physician may administer <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate,</b> or pralidoxime in case of severe poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Its active {{ingredients}} are diphenoxylate and atropine. Diphenoxylate is anti-diarrheal and atropine is anticholinergic. A subtherapeutic amount of <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> is present to discourage deliberate overdosage. Atropine has no anti-diarrheal properties, but will cause tachycardia when overused. The medication diphenoxylate works by {{slowing down the}} movement of the intestines. In some cases Lomotil has been shown to ease symptoms of opiate/opioid withdrawal.|$|E
50|$|Sinoatrial blocks are {{typically}} well-tolerated. They {{are not as}} serious as an AV block and most often do not require treatment. In some people, they can cause fainting, altered mental status, chest pain, hypoperfusion, and signs of shock. They {{can also lead to}} cessation of the SA node and more serious dysrhythmias. Emergency treatment, if deemed necessary, consists of administration of <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> or transcutaneous pacing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> tablets {{are used}} in some {{circumstances}} to reduce salivation. The same for anticholinergic drugs which can be also a benefit because they decrease {{the activity of the}} Acetylcholine Muscarinic Receptors and can result in decreased salivation. They may be prescribed by doctors in conjunction with behavior modification strategies. In general, surgical procedures are considered after proper diagnosis of the cause and evaluation of non-invasive treatment options.|$|E
50|$|In large doses, <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> helped {{control the}} {{involuntary}} movements associated with klazomania in one patient; attempts to treat {{with a combination}} of phenobarbital and trihexyphenidyl (also known as Artane) were also made. Phenobarbital acts as an anticonvulsant and is generally used to treat seizures, while Artane is used to treat involuntary movements in Parkinson's disease; however, this combination was found to have no beneficial effect in treating klazomania. Klazomania does not respond to anti-epileptic medications.|$|E
50|$|Clyde and Jones {{went into}} town to {{purchase}} bandages, crackers, cheese, and <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> to treat Bonnie's leg. The druggist contacted Sheriff Holt Coffey, {{who put the}} cabins under surveillance. Coffey had been alerted by Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas law enforcement to watch for strangers seeking such supplies. The sheriff contacted Captain Baxter, who called for reinforcements from Kansas City, including an armored car. At 11 p.m. that night, Sheriff Coffey led a group of officers armed with Thompson submachine guns toward the cabins.|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} {{is very rare}} but there are reports in medical literature of successful treatment with beta blockers (propranolol 10 mg) with significant reduction {{in the frequency of}} spontaneous blood oozing. The successful use of beta blockers supports the theory that the {{condition is}} induced by stress and anxiety yet this etiology is not established yet as the high prevalence of stress and anxiety in the modern era did not change the incidence of this extremely rare disease, suggesting that other co-abnormality also {{play a key role in}} this disease. <b>Atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> transdermal patches have also been used successfully.|$|E
50|$|The {{atropine}} additive {{strategy is}} designed to discourage use of the drug in a manner inconsistent with its labelling and physician and manufacturer instructions; in theory, the anticholinergic effect of atropine will produce severe weakness and nausea if standard dosage is exceeded, {{and at the time}} diphenoxylate was introduced in the United States a number of manufacturers used this strategy with oral forms of morphine, methadone (also using scopolamine), oxycodone and others. Currently, the only other narcotic produced in the United States to use this strategy is Motofen (difenoxin 1 mg with 25 µg <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate).</b> Difenoxin is a DEA schedule C-I without atropine, but a schedule C-IV or C-V with varying doses of concurrent atropine.|$|E
50|$|Carpaine {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{alkaloid}} components of papaya leaves which has been studied for its cardiovascular effects. Circulatory effects of carpaine were studied in Wistar male rats weighing 314 +/- 13 g, under pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) anesthesia. Increasing dosages of carpaine from 0.5 mg/kg to 2.0 mg/kg resulted in progressive decrease in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Selective autonomic nervous blockade with <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> (1 mg/kg) or propranolol hydrochloride (8 mg/kg) did not alter the circulatory response to carpaine. Carpaine, 2 mg/kg, reduced cardiac output, stroke volume, stroke work, and cardiac power, but the calculated total peripheral resistance remained unchanged. It is concluded from these results that carpaine affects the myocardium directly. The effects of carpaine may be related to its macrocyclic dilactone structure, a possible cation chelating structure.|$|E
50|$|Cholinergic {{syndrome}} {{occurs in}} acute poisonings with OP pesticides and {{is directly related}} to levels of AChE activity. Symptoms include miosis, sweating, lacrimation, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory difficulties, shortness of breath, slowed heart rate, cyanosis, vomiting, diarrhea, trouble sleeping, as well as other symptoms. Along with these central effects can be seen and finally seizures, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure. If the person survives the first day of poisoning personality changes can occur, aggressive events, psychotic episodes, disturbances and deficits in memory and attention, as well as other delayed effects. When death occurs, it is most commonly due to respiratory failure from the combination of central and peripheral effects, paralysis of respiratory muscles and depression of the brain respiratory center. For people afflicted with cholinergic syndrome, <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> combined with an oxime is used to combat the effects of the acute OP poisoning. Diazepam is sometimes also administered in combination with the atropine and oximes.|$|E
5000|$|Later that afternoon, Sheriff Coffey got a {{call from}} Louis Bernstein, the {{druggist}} at Platte City Drugs, about a stranger who had just left his store: [...] "a good-looking gal in a slinky riding habit," [...] the eager pharmacist reported. Both drug stores and law enforcement agencies had been alerted by Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas officials {{to be on the lookout}} for strangers seeking certain medical supplies. The stranger was, of course, Blanche, buying bandages and <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> to treat Bonnie's leg burns. For Coffey and Baxter, Bernstein's call pushed the situation to critical mass: if the guests had indeed bought burn wound supplies, it may well be the scorched Bonnie Parker and the freeshooting Barrows within the brick cabins. Although [...] "most of the general public had never heard of them" [...] that afternoon, Coffey's son Clarence was on the scene as it dawned on his dad whom he would be going up against: [...] "The look on my father's face," [...] he told the papers then and later, [...] "I'll never forget that!" ...|$|E

In Experiment I, 40 rabbits were trained under saline, 10, 18 or 26 mg/kg <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> or 18 mg/kg methylatropine. Six rabbits in Experiment 2 were conditioned, then given further sessions with saline, and 18, 26 and 34 mg/kg <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and methylatropine. In Experiment 3, 18 rabbits were conditioned and then given two extinction sessions under saline or 34 mg/kg <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> or methylatropine followed by extinction under saline. Chief findings were (a) <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> but not methylatropine disrupted acquisition and maintenance of conditioned eyeblinks, (b) neither drug affected unconditioned blinks, (c) fewer blinks occurred in extinction under <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> than under methylatropine or saline, (d) rabbits extinguished under atropine sulphate showed higher percentages of eyeblinks when tested without drug.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> {{blocks the}} muscarinic receptors in the salivary glands {{and leads to}} reduced saliva production. There are no {{published}} studies about its use in children with cerebral palsy. Objective To report the effect of sublingual <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> to treat drooling in children with cerebral palsy {{by comparing the results}} of the Drooling Impact Scale in a non-controlled open clinical trial. Results Twenty-five children were assessed. The difference in the mean scores of the pre- and post-treatment scales reached statistical significance. There was a low frequency of side effects compared to studies with other anticholinergics. Conclusion The use of sublingual <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> seems to be safe and there is a reduction in the Drooling Impact Scale score, which suggests efficacy in the treatment of drooling in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy. Our results should be replicated in randomized, placebo-controlled studies with larger numbers of participants...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} on 10 g/L cyclopentolate and 10 g/L atropine on cycloplegia in children before optometry. METHODS: Eighty eyes of 40 children among 4 - 12 {{years old with}} refractive error were recruited in this study. 10 g/L cyclopentolate eye drops were topically administered once per 5 min for 3 times and optometry was performed after 45 min. Three days after that, 10 g/L <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> eye gel then was used 3 times per day for consecutive 3 d and again the refractive diopter was obtained at the 4 th d. The differences of the results in retinoscopy refraction were compared between 10 g/L cyclopentolate eye drops and 10 g/L <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> eye gel. RESULTS: Therefraction results of those given 10 g/L cyclopentolate eye drops and 10 g/L <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> eye gel were no statistical different in both 4 - 8 years group and 9 - 12 years group with myopia(≤- 3. 00 D) (P = 0. 411, 0. 924). The differences of refraction results of both the drugs were significant in 4 - 8 years group with low hypermetropia, medium hypermetropia and high hypermetropia(P = 0. 007, 0. 007, 0. 009). No {{significant difference was found}} in 9 - 12 years group with low hypermetropia(P = 0. 592), given 10 g/L cyclopentolate eye drops and 10 g/L <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> eye gel, but the differences of refraction results of both the ophthalmic preparations above were significant in 9 - 12 years group with medium and high hypermetropia(P = 0. 039, 0. 012). CONCLUSION: Both 10 g/L cyclopentolate eye drops and 10 g/L <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> eye gel have the cycloplegic effects, but their cycloplegic effects are significant different among hypermetropia children. Thus, the reasonable cycloplegic should be chosen according to the specific situation...|$|E
40|$|The antidotal {{effectiveness}} of <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and pralidoxime chloride delivered by autoinjectors against sarin toxicity was evaluated in rabbits. Sarin, diluted in saline was administered at {{a dose of}} 5, 10 or 20 µg/kg, topically to one eye of the rabbits. Anticholinesterase activity was assessed by measurements of ocular pupillary diameter and plasma cholinesterase activity. <b>Atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> (1. 8 ± 0. 1 mg) and / or pralidoxime chloride (36 ± 2 mg) were administered by autoinjectors to evaluate their antidotal efficacy individually and as combined treatment. The pupillary diameter was decreased to less than 50 % of pretreatment values in the sarin-treated eyes within 5 minutes, without {{any change in the}} contralateral eye. Sarin given by topical application to the eye caused a significant inhibition of plasma cholinesterase activity. Tremor and paralysis of the limbs were observed at 20 µg/kg dose. When the antidotes were given alone, the effects of sarin on pupillary diameter and plasma cholinesterase activity were only marginally protective. More significant protection was obtained when <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and pralidoxime chloride were given as a combined antidote.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Theγ-amino {{butyric acid}} (GABA) -mediated {{neurotransmission}} {{is useful in}} treat-ing conditions like anxiety, sleep disturbances, depression and bipolar disorders. The aim ofthe present study is to supply evidence about neurochemical effects of acute lamotriginetreatment on GABA and L-glutamic acid levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of Wistar Albino ratsand the involvement of cholinergic system. The day after the placement of concentric micro-dialysis probes into the lateral ventricles of rats, microdialysis experiments were performedin conscious rat model. The rats either received intraperitoneal injections of physiologicalsaline or 20 mg/kg lamotrigine. For assessing the cholinergic involvement 0. 5 mg/kg phys-ostigmine or 2 mg/kg <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> pre-treatments were given prior to lamotrigine injec-tion. GABA, L-glutamic acid and lamotrigine concentrations in the dialysates were analyzedusing High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Saline produced no change in GABA orL-glutamic acid levels, but lamotrigine treatment significantly elevated GABA concentrations(p< 0. 05). Pre-treatment with physostigmine or <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> did not affect either GABA or L-glutamic acid levels siginificantly. Physostigmine or <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> pre-treatments {{did not affect the}} lamotrigine-induced GABA levels.

40|$|Previous {{tests on}} the use of large doses of {{atropine}} for the treatment of anticholinesterase poison-ing have revealed postural hypotension following the administration of 2 mg. of this drug. In this study on 78 normal adult males, the cardiovascular responses to positional change after 2 mg. atropine have been measured and the mechanisms elucidated. Blood pressure response to tilting was normal during control and placebo phases, but showed a profound alteration after atropine. THE recommended therapy for anti-cholinesterase intoxication is <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and artificial respiration. ' The use of anticholinesterases as insecticides and their potential use as chemical warfare nerve gas agents has rekindled an interest in this well-known parasympatholytic drug and the manual methods of resuscitation. <b>Atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> has found a wide range of clinical applications. In most instances it is prescribed in small doses (0. 3 mg. to 0. 6 mg.). However, it has been established that human tolerance to this drug in the presence of anti-cholinesterase agents is enormous. 2 Its im-mediate injection in case of exposure is impera-tive, and the recommended initial dose is 2 mg. In civil defense emergencies and possible insecticide exposures, it may become necessary to administer this large dose of atropine to normal, but potentially poisoned, individuals.

Similarly six groups of rabbits (n = 5) received an IM injection of either saline, atropine (0. 2 mg/kg), atropine (2 mg/kg), glycopyrrolate (0. 1 mg/kg), ketamine:xylazine (35 : 10 mg/kg) or glycopyrrolate:ketamine:xylazine (0. 1 : 35 : 10 mg/kg). In rats, <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> (0. 05 mg/kg) and glycopyrrolate (0. 5 mg/kg) produced an increase in heart rate for 30 and 240 min, respectively. In rabbits <b>atropine</b> <b>sulfate</b> at either 0. 2 or 2. 0 mg/kg did not induce a significant increase in heart rate, but glycopyrrolate (0. 1 mg/kg) elevated the heart rate above saline treated animals for over 50 min. Both atropine and glycopyrrolate provided protection against a decrease in heart rate in rats anesthetized with ketamine: xylazine (85 : 15 mg/kg) or ketamine: detomidine (60 : 10 mg/kg); however, glycopyrrolate was significantly more effective in maintaining the heart rate within the normal range. Glycopprrolate also prevented a decrease in heart rate in rabbits anesthetized with ketamine:xylazine (35 : 5 mg/kg). Neither glycopyrrolate nor atropine influenced respiration rate, core body temperature or systolic blood pressure when used alone or when combined with the injectable anesthetic.
