40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{determinants}} of children’s scores on tests of cognitive achievement in math and reading. Using rich longitudinal data on test scores, home environments, and schools, we implement alternative specifications for the cognitive achievement production function that allow achievement {{to depend on the}} entire history of lagged home and school inputs as well as on parents ’ ability and unobserved endowments. The empirical results show that both contemporaneous and lagged inputs matter in the production of current achievement and the importance of allowing for unobserved endowment effects. We use cross-validation methods to select among competing specifications and find support for a variant of a value-added model of the production function augmented to include information on lagged inputs. Using this specification, we study the sources of test score gaps between black, white and Hispanic children. The estimated model captures key patterns in the data, such as the widening of minority-white test score gaps with age and differences in the gap pattern between Hispanics and blacks. We find that differences in mother’s ability (as measured by AFQT) accounts for about half of the test score gap. However, home inputs also account for a significant proportion.

The State aid means winning financial benefits from the state resources in the way which might distort competition. Depending on the object it is earmarked, the State aid can be distinguished as horizontal, sectoral, regional. The Agenda in respect o f State aid assumes phasing out this aid for enterprises, let alone aid distorting competition, and its closer scrutiny. In the period 2000 - 2005 {{the total value of}} State aid in Poland amounted to € 14. 8 billion (79 billion PLN), which gives an <b>average</b> at the <b>level</b> <b>o</b> f € 2. 5 billion (13. 2 billion PLN) per annum. The value ol State aid granted for rescue and restructuring in the period 2000 - 2005 in Poland accounted for € 35. 8 billion PLN which means 45. 3 % of the total value of State aid. State aid for rescue and restructuring achieved the annual <b>average</b> <b>level</b> <b>o</b> f 5. 9 billion PLN, which means € 670 million.

Cross-country regressions, while showing a robust IQ-growth relationship, cannot fully test this hypothesis. Thus, recent work explores the micro-foundations of the IQ-productivity relationship. The well-identified psychological relationship between IQ and patience implies higher savings rates and higher folk theorem-driven institutional quality in high average IQ countries. Experiments indicate that intelligence predicts greater pro-social behavior in public goods and prisoner’s dilemma games, supporting the hypothesis that high national average IQ causes higher institutional quality. High average IQ countries also have higher savings intensity by a variety of measures. Other possible IQ-productivity channels are discussed, as are possible environmental causes of differences in national average IQ. In recent years, some economists and psychologists have proposed that the <b>average</b> <b>level</b> <b>o...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Vegetation {{cover and}} {{groundwater}} level changes {{over the period}} of restoration {{are the two most}} important indicators of the level of success in wetland ecohydrological restoration. As a result of the regular presence of water and dense vegetation, the highest evapotranspiration (latent heat) rates usually occur within wetlands. Vegetation cover and evapotranspiration of large areas of restoration like that of Kissimmee River basin, South Florida will be best estimated using remote sensing technique than point measurements. Kissimmee River basin has been the area of ecological restoration for some years. The current ecohydrological restoration activities were evaluated through fractional vegetation cover (FVC) changes and latent heat flux using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Groundwater level data were also analyzed for selected eight groundwater monitoring wells in the basin. Results have shown that the average fractional vegetation cover and latent heat along 10 km buffer of Kissimmee River between Lake Kissimmee and Lake Okeechobee was higher in 2004 than in 2000. It is evident that over the 5 -year period of time, vegetated and areas covered with wetlands have increased significantly especially along the restoration corridor. Analysis of groundwater level data (2000 - 2004) from eight monitoring wells showed that, the <b>average</b> monthly <b>level</b> <b>o...</b>|$|R

From the primary key words screening, 1591 records were identified from which 32 Russian-language publications were relevant. The lowest O. felineus infection rate of 0. 4 % was reported in Tatarstan Republic, and the highest reached 83. 9 % in the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug. The infection prevalence was lower in children than in adults and increased with age. O. felineus infection was detected more often in indigenous population than in migrants. Infection intensity in western regions (Permskaya, Bryanskaya Oblast) was low and varied from 15 to 336 eggs per gram stool (epg), while in endemic regions it reached more than 2000 epg. In some settlements the mean intensity infection was 5234 epg. The high rates of intensity were registered in regions with a high prevalence of infection. Based on obtained data, a map of O. felineus infection prevalence in Western Siberia was developed. After mapping the results, the highest prevalence was detected in Tyumenskaya Oblast with over 60 %, while the Tomskaya Oblast had the lowest prevalence at fewer than 19. 0 %. Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomus Okrug, Altaiskii Krai, Novosibirskaya Oblast and Omskaya Oblast had an <b>average</b> <b>level</b> of <b>O.</b> felineus infection of 20 - 39 %.

The measures came from the ALIS (A-level Information System) in England. The main source of data were 1167 students who agreed to complete questionnaire sent {{as part of the}} ALIS project. Simple correlation, multiple and stepwise and regression analysis were performed. The following conclusion were drawn from the findings: 1. All the predictor variables except home background were significantly predictive of academic success in terms of scholastic performance, the predictive power was very low for <b>average</b> <b>O</b> <b>level</b> (AVO), socio economic status of Head of Household (HOH), moderate for the likelihood of staying in Education (LSE) and moderately high for A-level. 11.

The low values for HOH may be because decision about future study had already been made perhaps on the basis of home background.

Participants completed a battery of tests measuring cognitive ability, personality, and test-taking attitude. Results suggested that test-taking attitude primarily consists of two components: motivation and performance expectancy. Multiple-regression analyses indicated minimal support for moderating effects o f the TAS on criterion-related validities o f selection tests. Participants who reported high <b>levels</b> <b>o</b> f test-taking motivation following a cognitive ability test were found to have a marginally significant higher validity coefficient in predicting grade point average (GPA) than those who reported low <b>levels</b> <b>o</b> f test-taking motivation.

40|$|An {{economic}} {{theory of the}} process of diffusion of innovations is developed and illustrated. In the theory, adoption is detennined by comparative advantage eonsiderations. An innovation is tirst adopted by skilled and experimenting entrepreneurs and then "diffuses " down the skills scale. Ir the innovation affeets supply substantially, prices may decline, prot~ts eliminated, and early, skilled (and high labor opportunity cost) producers may exit from the affected line of productionmhenee, an "innovation cycle. " The theory implies that technological ehange is affected by the distribution {{as well as by the}} <b>average</b> <b>level</b> of skills. <b>O</b> NE would expect comparative advantage considerations [...] dynamic as well as static [...] to be crucial in determining patterns of adoption of innovations. This has been recognized in empirical work by, for ex-ample, Griliches [2], Mansfield [6] and Nelson [8] who incorporated measures of such items as benefits, costs, and profits as explanatory variables in the analysis. The most explicit recognition of the role of comparative advan-tages in the adoption of innovations is found in the theory of the "product cycle " in interna-tional trade as expounded by Vernon [12] and Hufbauer [3]. The present study is an analysis of a similar process within one industry. A for-mal model describing an "innovation cycle " is developed in the first part of the paper and illustrated by ah example from agriculture in the second. The model concentrates on the main aspects of the analysis and is based on simplifying as-sumptions. It is assumed that the innovation is either a new product or a new method that appreciably affects the supply of an existing product. The industry is competifive and is composed of small firms. Producers with the highest skills (the better schooled, perhaps) will be first to adopt the innovation. Their ad-vantage is in spotting a good idea, experiment-ing with ir, and solving problems of adaptatio...|$|R
