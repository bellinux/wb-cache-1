5|$|As Barbara {{moved toward}} the Canadian Maritimes, it began to undergo an extratropical transition, {{completing}} the transition by late on August15 just south of Nova Scotia. However, the Canadian Hurricane Centre assessed Barbara as remaining tropical until after it turned northward and struck eastern Nova Scotia on August16. At this time, a trough developed to the southeast of the storm, and Barbara later tracked just west of Newfoundland. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>low</b> formed {{in association with the}} trough, and as Barbara rapidly headed northward, the developing center moved more slowly. However, the new low quickly gained strength and became the more intense of the two storm systems. Barbara then stalled near Goose Bay and lost its tropical identity, dissipating late on August16.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>low</b> {{pressure}} area developed {{while the}} tropical wave was located over the Gulf of Honduras. However, {{this area of}} disturbed weather was unable to develop further, because the storm quickly moved over the Yucatán Peninsula. After its one-day passage through the peninsula, the system entered the Bay of Campeche, but lacked any deep convection. This time, though, the wave quickly developed the deep convection it needed to become a tropical cyclone. In part, {{this was due to}} the Sierra Madre Oriental enhancing large-scale rotation of the disturbance by forcing air to flow parallel to the mountain range, instead of through it. As a result, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida designated it as Tropical Depression Seven, just 255miles east-southeast of Tuxpan, Mexico. Early on the July 24, the cyclone was upgraded to a tropical storm with winds of 40mph (65km/h) and received the name Gert.|$|E

Lisa catches Lady Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven she and Lady Gaga perform a duet together. With Lady Gaga's assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being oneself is better than being like anyone else.

As Moe turns and walks across the train track, a second train hits him.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of November 10, all of Ida's {{convection}} appeared displaced to the northeast and the forward motion of the storm slowed substantially. Additionally, the storm had begun to undergo an extratropical transition near the United States Gulf Coast. Shortly before making landfall near Dauphin Island, Alabama, the storm completed its extratropical transition. Ida crossed Mobile Bay shortly thereafter and maximum winds decreased below gale-force. After slowly tracking eastward for several hours, the surface circulation of Ida dissipated over the Florida Panhandle, late on November 10. However, energy from the storm {{led to the formation}} of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>low</b> off the coast of North Carolina. This new low quickly intensified and became a powerful nor'easter that caused substantial damage throughout the Mid-Atlantic States. By November12, the system attained a minimum pressure of 992mbar (hPa; 29.29inHg) along with winds of 65mph (100km/h). The extratropical low weakened the following day and moved out to sea after stalling along the North Carolina Coastline. The remnants of the cyclone persisted through November17, by which time it had moved over Atlantic Canada.|$|E
