Only professionals whose job involves supporting children would be able to access the database, and they would be required to undergo enhanced Criminal Records Bureau checks and training. Each local authority would decide who may access the database provided their role was listed in the ContactPoint Regulations. Users would need to provide a reason for accessing a record, and an audit trail would be kept on access to the database to help detect misuse. Professionals who have completed a Common <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework,</b> a tool used to identify the severity of a child's situation, would be able to record on a child's record that they had carried this out.

40|$|Increasing {{widespread}} {{requirements that}} assessment practice conforms to generic guidelines contained in <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks</b> has been contentious and critiques offered on individual frameworks have been assumed {{to apply to}} the concept of <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks</b> more generally. After comparing four <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks</b> currently being used in the UK, this paper argues that although some generalizations can be made, for the most part, they are highly individual documents in terms of range and depth of content, {{the extent to which they}} are evidenced and the quality of that evidence and implicit expectations as to the skill bases of assessors. Furthermore, the introduction of <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks</b> is not in itself a panacea to ensure good practice. Even with the most comprehensive frameworks, social workers will still need comprehensive training in assessment and supervision of their practice. <br /...|$|R

2500|$|ASU {{is one of}} the nation's most {{successful}} universities in terms of creating start-up companies through research. The university has raised more than $600million in external funding, and 100 companies have been launched based on ASU innovations. ASU ranks #2 in the nation for proprietary start-ups [...] "created for every $10million in research expenditures." [...] In fiscal year 2015, ASU researchers were issued 62 patents, a significant increase over 2014 when 48 patents were granted. During fiscal year 2015, ASU faculty launched 12 new startup companies and submitted 270 invention disclosures to AzTE. Since its inception, AzTE has fostered the launch of more than 96 companies based on ASU innovations, and attracted more than $600 million in venture funding, including $96 million in fiscal year 2016 alone. According to the Sweden-based University Business Incubator (UBI) Index for 2013, ASU {{is one of the}} top universities in the world for business incubation, ranking 17th out of the top 25. ASU is one of only 15 universities and institutes from the United States to make the list, and the only university representing Arizona. UBI reviewed 550 universities and associated business incubators from around the world using an <b>assessment</b> <b>framework</b> that takes more than 50 performance indicators into consideration. As an example, one of ASU's spin-offs (Heliae Development, LLC) raised more than $28million in venture capital in 2013 alone. In June 2016, ASU received the Entrepreneurial University Award from the Deshpande Foundation, a philanthropic organization that supports social entrepreneurship and innovation.|$|E

40|$|Open {{data are}} {{currently}} {{a hot topic}} and are associated with realising ambitions such as a more transparent and efficient government, solving societal problems, and increasing economic value. To describe and monitor the state of open data in countries and organisations, several open data <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks</b> were developed. Despite high scores in these <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks,</b> the actual (re) use of open government data (OGD) fails {{to live up to}} its expectations. Our review of existing open data <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks</b> reveals that these only cover parts of the open data ecosystem. We have developed a framework, which assesses open data supply, open data governance, and open data user characteristics holistically. This holistic open data framework assesses the maturity of the open data ecosystem and proves to be a useful tool to indicate which aspects of the open data ecosystem are successful and which aspects require attention. Our initial assessment in the Netherlands indicates that the traditional geographical data perform significantly better than non-geographical data, such as healthcare data. Therefore, open geographical data policies in the Netherlands may provide useful cues for other OGD strategies. Accepted Author ManuscriptGeo-information and Land Developmen...|$|R

Nevertheless, their successful implementation remains problematic in sub-Saharan Africa. To address this challenge in this paper, through a thorough examination of academic and grey literature, repeatedly occurring sustainability aspects/issues were drawn from internationally recognised biofuel <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks.</b> Theoretical framings that corresponded with the interlinking socio-environmental-economic qualities and issues for achieving sustainability through ethical implementation conformity (political ecology, development economics, social capital and institutional economics) were then used to inform development of a conceptual framework that could guide biofuel project implementation in sub-Saharan Africa to address complex sustainability issues. The supporting theories pursue sustainable development through, amongst others, {{an emphasis on the}} more equitable dispersal of costs and benefits through transparent networking in rural settings and the integration of contrasting viewpoints of diverse stakeholders in emerging economies...|$|R
