All root canal sealers tested showed some antimicrobial activity against most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microorganisms. There {{were no significant differences between}} the materials tested (p > 0. 05). All root canal sealers also flowed under <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> this study. Statistical analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results revealed that AH Plus and Kerr Pulp Canal Sealer EWT had flow values significantly superior to the other sealers tested (p > 0. 05). Taken together, these findings suggest that these sealers have the potential to help in the microbial control in <b>the</b> <b>root</b> canal system...|$|R
40|$|This study {{measured}} {{displacement of}} canal centers in extracted human teeth after preparation by Lightspeed and nickel-titanium K-files. The specimens {{were divided into}} two groups (n = 11), after radiographing <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> from <b>the</b> buccolingual and mesiodistal planes with pathfinding files in situ. More strongly and less strongly curved canals were, respectively, assigned to the Lightspeed and nickel-titanium K-file groups. Using a reassembly technique, cross-sections at 1. 25 mm, 3. 25 mm, and 5. 25 mm from the apices were made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimental <b>roots</b> embedded in clear plastic. Stereomicroscopic 35 -mm slides were taken <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uninstrumented sectioned canals. The sections were reassembled and then prepared to size 50 Master Apical Rotary and size 40 Master Apical Files, for the Lightspeed and K-file groups, respectively. Similar 35 -mm slides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrumented canals were taken and electronically superimposed over their uninstrumented counterparts. Displacements of root canal centers after preparation and increases in cross-sectional <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prepared <b>root</b> canals were evaluated at specific levels. No significant differences in displacement of canal centers or between <b>the</b> mean cross-sectional <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrumented <b>root</b> canals were recorded between the Lightspeed and K-file groups. Both types of instruments produced similar displacement of canal centers after preparation...|$|R
