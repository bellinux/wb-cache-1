5|$|Most World War I war {{designers}} {{attempted to}} produce memorials that were, as cultural historian Jay Winter describes, noble, uplifting, tragic and endurably sad. There were various architectural styles used on memorials, {{but most were}} essentially conservative in nature, typically embracing well established styles such as classicism and embracing mainstream Christian symbolism. This conservatism in part resulted from the age and background of the committees that were commissioning the memorials, and also from a sense that established architectural styles, rather a potentially more transitory but fashionable style, would be more enduring <b>and</b> <b>appropriate.</b>|$|E

5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, <b>and</b> <b>appropriate</b> self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E
5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame <b>and</b> <b>appropriate</b> pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able to fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.|$|E

5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive <b>and</b> <b>appropriate</b> manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E

5|$|The {{plaintiff}} in Lines International {{argued that the}} guidelines adopted by the multi-agency committee {{set up by the}} PSA, STPB and GSB were invalid as the committee had no existence at law. The High Court held that there was nothing unlawful or even intrinsically wrong with these government agencies setting up such a committee to discuss matters of relevance to their respective jurisdictions as long as each agency made its own decisions within the ambit of its own statutory powers. The notion that such a committee fettered PSA's discretion was dismissed by a further finding of fact that the ad-hoc committee had not acted as an entity in itself. Enforcement <b>and</b> <b>appropriate</b> action were left to the agencies. A meeting attended by the plaintiff's representatives at which the guidelines relating to cruises-to-nowhere were announced was facilitated by a moderator rather than a chairperson, and each of the agencies read out guidelines which they themselves would be adopting and implementing.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary goal}} of the planned University of New England {{extension}} program was to provide opportunities for people to obtain a university degree who could not easily travel to attend lectures, often because they lived in rural areas.

In setting up the program, Madgwick directed that the program's instructors also participate in internal education and should be considered {{on a par with}} their internal colleagues. The examinations given to external students would be the same as those given to internal attendees. External students were required to attend some residential courses as part of their degree programs.|$|E
