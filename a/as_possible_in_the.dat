5|$|Petaluma, a {{similarly}} small town approximately 20 {{miles north of}} San Rafael, became more cooperative and American Graffiti moved there without {{the loss of a}} single day of shooting. Lucas convinced the San Rafael City Council to allow two further nights of filming for general cruising shots, which he used to evoke as much of the intended location <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finished film. Shooting in Petaluma began on June 28 and proceeded at a quick pace. Lucas mimicked the filmmaking style of B movie producer Sam Katzman in attempting to save money and authenticated low-budget filming methods.|$|E
5|$|Bormann {{used his}} {{position}} {{to create an}} extensive bureaucracy and involve himself as much <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decision making. He gained acceptance into Hitler's inner circle, and accompanied him everywhere, providing briefings and summaries of events and requests. He began acting as Hitler's personal secretary on 12 August 1935. Bormann assumed Hess' former duties, with the title of Head of the Parteikanzlei (Party Chancellery), after Hess' solo flight to Britain on 10 May 1941 to seek peace negotiations with the British government. He had final approval over civil service appointments, reviewed and approved legislation, and by 1943 had de facto control over all domestic matters. Bormann {{was one of the}} leading proponents of the ongoing persecution of the Christian churches and favoured harsh treatment of Jews and Slavs in the areas conquered by Germany during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Both Berman and Piller {{sought to}} have Forbes {{sign on to}} portray Ro as a main {{character}} in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation, but {{did not want to}} tie herself down to a five- to six-year main cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, {{and did not want to}} undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine. The producers of Deep Space Nine decided to create a new character to fit a similar mould, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, a {{nationwide}} movement pressed {{to return to}} pre-war society as quickly <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. When combined with the increasing national paranoia about communism and psychoanalytic theory that had become pervasive in medical knowledge, homosexuality became an undesired characteristic of employees working for the U.S. government in 1950. Homosexuals {{were thought to be}} vulnerable targets to blackmail, and the government purged its employment ranks of open homosexuals, beginning a widespread effort to gather intelligence about employees' private lives. State and local governments followed suit, arresting people for congregating in bars and parks, and enacting laws against cross-dressing for men and women.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaders of}} the {{uprising}} in Kozara met on 15August 1941 {{in the village of}} Knežica. At the conference, Stojanović was recognised as the principal leader in Kozara; this recognition mostly resulted from his pre-war social status and good reputation among the people. It was concluded that forming a front line was a mistake because it was not consistent with guerrilla warfare. At some point during the conference, Stojanović stressed the importance of keeping as many enemy troops <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, so that they could not be sent to the Russian front to fight the Red Army. As the five detachments in the area were tied to their specific territories, it was decided that another detachmentwhich could operate anywhere in Kozarashould be formed. It was decided that Stojanović would command this new Kozara Detachment, and Karabegović would be the political commissar. It was promptly formed with about forty men. Carrying a red banner, the Kozara Detachment paraded {{for a couple of days}} through villages in the Partisan-held territory. The villagers gathered and Stojanović delivered speeches.|$|E

5|$|The {{total cost}} of Kronan was {{estimated}} at 326,000 silver dalers in contemporary currency, and {{about half of the}} cost, 166,000 dalers, lay in the armaments. It was therefore {{in the interest of the}} Swedish Navy to salvage as many of the cannons <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1660s almost all the guns from Vasa had been brought up through greatly improved technology. Commander Paul Rumpf and Admiral Hans Wachtmeister were put in charge of the salvage of Kronan's cannons. With the help of diving bells, they were able to raise 60 cannons worth 67,000 daler in the summers (c. June–August) of 1679–86, beginning as soon as the war with Denmark had ended. In the 1960s, diving expert Bo Cassel made some successful descents to Vasa with a diving bell made according to 17th-century specifications. In 1986, further experiments were done on Kronan. The tests proved successful and the conclusion was that the 17th-century operations must have required considerable experience, skill and favorable weather conditions. Though the conditions off Öland were often difficult, with cold water and unpredictable weather, and required a large crew, the expeditions were very profitable. Historian Björn Axel Johansson has calculated that the total cost for the entire crew for all eight diving seasons was less than 2,000 dalers, the value of one of Kronan's 36-pounder guns.|$|E

25|$|Sumner's proof shows, more strongly, {{that in any}} {{connected}} claw-free graph one {{can find}} a pair of adjacent vertices the removal of which leaves the remaining graph connected. To show this, Sumner finds a pair of vertices u and v that are as far apart <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> graph, and chooses w to be a neighbor of v that is as far from u as possible; as he shows, neither v nor w can lie on any shortest path from any other node to u, so the removal of v and w leaves the remaining graph connected. Repeatedly removing matched pairs of vertices in this way forms a perfect matching in the given claw-free graph.|$|E
25|$|That winter, Eves {{promised a}} provincial budget before the {{beginning}} of the fiscal year, to help hospitals and schools budget effectively. However, as multiple scandals in the fall had already made the party unwilling to return to Question Period, they wished to dismiss the Legislative Assembly of Ontario until as late <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring. The budget was instead to be announced at the Magna International headquarters in Newmarket, Ontario rather than in the Legislature. The move was met with outrage from the PC Speaker, Gary Carr who called the move unconstitutional and would rule that it was a prima facae case of contempt of the legislature. The controversy over the location of the budget would far outstrip any support earned by the content of the budget.|$|E
25|$|The altarpiece of the chancel is {{representative}} of the 19th century.

An analysis of the piece, however, shows strong ties to 18th-century carving, not only in the dynamism of its design, but also in the preservation of columns with straight channelled shafts and in the two angels set on the curved segment of the upper section. (It is possible that the earlier sketch by Manuel Francisco Xavier was adapted in large part by Mathias.) The image on the main altar is of Our Lady of Light, the patron saint of the church (and of Lagoa).|$|E

25|$|Ranatunga {{went on to}} captain Sri Lanka in 1988, {{taking control}} of the {{national}} team for the next 11 years, transforming it from a weak, routinely defeated team into a competitive and successful unit.

His strategies was commended by many cricketing greats and followed by other teams. He was the brain behind the strategy of scoring as many runs <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first 15 overs of an ODI match in which there are field restrictions.
