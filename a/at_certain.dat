5|$|Adult {{crocodilians}} {{are typically}} territorial and solitary. Individuals may defend basking spots, nesting sites, feeding areas, nurseries, and overwintering sites. Male saltwater crocodiles establish year-round territories that encompass several female nesting sites. Some species are occasionally gregarious, particularly during droughts, when several individuals gather at remaining water sites. Individuals of some species may share basking sites <b>at</b> <b>certain</b> {{times of the}} day.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera gel is used commercially as an {{ingredient}} in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts, although <b>at</b> <b>certain</b> doses, its toxic properties could be severe whether ingested or topically applied.

5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the ice age 4.5 million years ago, baleen whales did not exceed 10 meters (33 feet) in length. But when the ice sheets caused their food sources to concentrate in certain areas <b>at</b> <b>certain</b> times of years, they began to increase in size while smaller species became more rare.|$|E
5|$|In {{late summer}} large shoals of roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) fry congregate around the margins and weed beds, which are predated by the brown trout (Salmo trutta morpha fario) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Chew Valley also holds a large {{population}} of pike (Esox lucius), and fishing for these is permitted <b>at</b> <b>certain</b> times of the year.|$|E
50|$|Another type of {{non-reversing}} mirror {{can be made}} {{by making}} the mirror concave (curved inwards like a bowl). <b>At</b> a <b>certain</b> distance from the mirror a non-reversed image will appear. The disadvantage of this is that it only works <b>at</b> a <b>certain</b> distance.|$|R

5|$|The Thousand-Year Door borrows many {{gameplay}} {{elements from}} its predecessor, {{such as a}} paper-themed universe and a turn-based battle system {{with an emphasis on}} action. For the majority of the game the player controls Mario, although Bowser and Princess Peach are playable <b>at</b> <b>certain</b> points. The plot follows Mario's quest as he tries to retrieve the seven Crystal Stars and rescue Peach from the X-Nauts.|$|E
5|$|The game {{does not}} feature an inventory, and neither health packs nor ammo can be stockpiled. Health packs are used {{immediately}} upon collection, {{and no more}} ammo can be collected than {{the capacity of the}} specific weapon.

5|$|The player {{interacts with}} {{characters}} and objects by clicking on them. Clicking {{on the ground}} causes the player's selected characters to move. The gameplay, though in real-time, can be paused, whereupon commands may be issued to controllable characters, who will attempt to execute them when the game is unpaused. The game can also be set to pause automatically <b>at</b> <b>certain</b> times. Dialogue is started by NPCs <b>at</b> <b>certain</b> scripted times, or by the player's clicking on NPCs who are not immediately hostile. When speaking to an NPC, the player must often choose what to say {{from a list of}} responses. The dialogue may lead to quests or important information. When the player clicks on a hostile being, the currently selected characters will advance to attack it. Information about characters, creatures, items, and buildings in the game environment is shown on a tool tip, which appears when the mouse pointer is held over game elements.|$|E
5|$|Visitors {{are allowed}} to feed the captive birds with {{approved}} food mixes bought on site, and during the winter, feeding of wild birds {{near one of the}} hides takes place <b>at</b> <b>certain</b> scheduled times, including on some floodlit occasions in the evening for visiting groups.|$|E

For pH stability, the enzyme was incubated <b>at</b> a <b>certain</b> pH (pH 2 – 8) for 24  h before activity measurement. In view of thermostability, the enzyme was incubated <b>at</b> a <b>certain</b> temperature (20 – 80  °C) for 2  h before activity measurement.|$|R
5|$|As in the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the inactive character to gradually recover some life they might have lost. <b>At</b> <b>certain</b> points, an inactive character's life bar may flash, giving them a temporary boost in strength if they are tagged in. If the life bar of either of a player's fighters runs out, that player loses the round. If time runs out, the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>certain</b> dates, food may be set {{out as a}} {{sacrifice}} to {{the spirits of the}} deceased or the gods, such as during the Qingming Festival. This may include slaughtered animals, such as pigs and ducks, or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Joss paper, or Hell Bank Notes, on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones. At other points, a vegan diet or full fast may be observed.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>certain</b> {{times in}} the {{geological}} past, corals were very abundant. Like modern corals, these ancestors built reefs, some of which ended as great structures in sedimentary rocks. Fossils of fellow reef-dwellers algae, sponges, {{and the remains of}} many echinoids, brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, and trilobites appear along with coral fossils. This makes some corals useful index fossils. Coral fossils are not restricted to reef remnants, and many solitary fossils may be found elsewhere, such as Cyclocyathus, which occurs in England's Gault clay formation.|$|E
50|$|Characters with a class {{advantage}} {{against their}} opponent gain increased damage <b>at</b> a <b>certain</b> percent, while their opponent loses damage <b>at</b> a <b>certain</b> percent.

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>certain</b> {{times there}} was an {{administrative}} office that presided over all temples and clergies. In the Old Kingdom, pharaohs gave this authority first to their relatives and then to their viziers. In the reign of Thutmose III the office passed from the viziers to the High Priests of Amun, who held it {{for much of the}} New Kingdom. The Romans established a similar office, that of the high priest for all Egypt, which oversaw the temple cults until their extinction.|$|E
5|$|Before Glöckner's 2003 {{article on}} the origin of the Magnificat, and for some authors still after that, it was {{generally}} assumed that Bach had composed his Magnificat in the quiet time of Advent 1723 for a first performance at the Christmas vespers. For that performance Bach composed four laudes, songs of praise partly in German, partly in Latin to be inserted <b>at</b> <b>certain</b> points in the E-flat major version of the Magnificat. The E-flat major version of the Magnificat including these interpolations is known as BWV 243a.|$|E
5|$|Buildings play a {{big role}} in gameplay, as they are used for {{training}} civilian and military units, researching improvements, supporting population, providing structural defense or as resource providers. The buildings portrayed in Age of Empires III resemble the architectural design of that era. All of the games in the series share several buildings, including the Town Center and Docks. The appearance and attributes of a building change as the player advances through the Ages, and some civilizations have their own unique buildings. The appearance of these buildings depends on the civilization. Some buildings can only be built <b>at</b> <b>certain</b> times like the defensive towers.|$|E
