25|$|For the , {{the facade}} of the Big Brother house was fully renovated, and the gates were removed. The outside of the Big Brother house still served as the venue for evictions. The Big Brother house was still divided into two {{different}} themed houses yet both equally furnished. Both houses have separate confession rooms. The garden was removed, and the pool was retained and was considered a separate area and was called the Resort. The area was used for some time for Big Brother's rewards and tasks to the housemates, and was a venue for some House Battles. The <b>activity</b> <b>area</b> was retained, and was renovated several times in order to accommodate the season's twists. Initially, it was used as a temporary shelter for the initial group of housemates, and was themed after a typical urban slum house.|$|E

The focus of this evaluation was on the design of two areas: wandering paths and <b>activity</b> <b>areas.</b> Four Alzheimer???s care units were selected for this study from the Bay Area, California. Postoccupancy Evaluation was employed for the assessment of the existing design of the wandering paths and the <b>activity</b> <b>areas.</b> Research methods included behavioral observations, visual analysis, and survey questionnaires. Four study sites were compared for the design of the wandering paths and the <b>activity</b> <b>areas</b> by plotting evaluation graphs and tables.

We tracked 12 adult female long-eared myotis for 23 nights from June to August, 1996 and 1997, on the western slope of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, USA. The <b>activity</b> <b>areas</b> of nine bats (n= 11 nights) averaged 38. 3 ha and were centred an average of 518 m from the day roost (SE= 60 m) and 73 m from water (SE= 10 m); centres of activity were significantly closer to water than random points (P< 0. 001). Odds of an area being used decreased with distance to available water (P= 0. 0001). <b>Activity</b> <b>areas</b> typically encompassed water but {{did not include the}} day roost. <b>Activity</b> <b>areas</b> did not significantly differ in forest composition as determined from randomly selected circular plots. Bodies of open water appear to function as important centres of activity for long-eared myotis. We contend that management of habitats for bats should consider spatial relationships among <b>activity</b> <b>areas,</b> day roosts and water.

2500|$|The park {{is divided}} into four zones, which have {{different}} purposes, in order to reconcile {{the protection of the}} park and the welcoming of tourists. This is the first Swedish park to adopt this strict kind of zoning. The majority of the park (60%) is in zone 1, that is to say the untouchable zone: this space {{is the heart of the}} park and only has a tiny amount of tourism infrastructure. The south-east zone of the park (14%) is in zone 2, the low <b>activity</b> <b>area.</b> In this zone, elk hunting is allowed, but infrastructure is always limited. 25% of the park is in zone 3, the high activity zone. This zone includes most of the tourism infrastructure, such as the trails and the cabins. Fishing is authorized there. Finally, zone 4 (about 1% of the area of the park) corresponds to a radius of about [...] around the points of strong concentration of visitors, which is to say the entrances, the waterfall of Njupeskär and the valley of Göljån, where the traces of a great flood are still visible.|$|E

The {{southern part of the}} complex in the Mojave Desert ecoregion is mostly Creosote Bush-Dominated Basins and Arid Footslopes (Jackass Flats is in the Amargosa Desert ecoregion.)
