5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} {{is equal to the}} number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average time it takes to execute <b>an</b> <b>instruction.</b> An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E

5|$|In 1543, Henry VIII allied {{himself with}} Spain {{in a war}} against France. Despite Henry's initial successes, France and Spain made peace in 1544, leaving England exposed to a French invasion, backed by her allies in Scotland. In response, Henry issued <b>an</b> <b>instruction</b> to improve the country's defences, {{particularly}} along the south coast. Dartmouth Castle was reinforced by three new gun batteries, two {{either side of the}} gun tower, and another, Lamberd's Bulwarke, positioned in the south-east corner of the fortalice.|$|E

Crawford also patches Graham through to Frederick Chilton, Lecktor's warden, who has found a note in Lecktor's personal effects. Reading it, they realize {{it is from the}} Tooth Fairy, expressing admiration for Lecktor—and an interest in Graham. Crawford brings Graham to the FBI Academy at Quantico, where a missing section of the note is analyzed to determine what Lecktor has removed. It is found to be <b>an</b> <b>instruction</b> to communicate through the personals section of the National Tattler, Lounds' newspaper.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the paper}} of Checkoway et al, it is {{possible}} to perform return-oriented-programming on x86 and ARM architectures without using <b>a</b> return <b>instruction</b> (0xC3 on x86). They instead used carefully crafted instruction sequences that already exist in the machine's memory to behave like <b>a</b> return <b>instruction.</b> <b>A</b> return <b>instruction</b> has two effects: firstly, it searches for the four-byte value {{at the top of the}} stack, and sets the instruction pointer to that value, and secondly, it increases the stack pointer value by four. On the x86 architecture, sequences of jmp and pop instructions can act as <b>a</b> return <b>instruction.</b> On ARM, sequences of load and branch instructions can act as <b>a</b> return <b>instruction.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1697 Gale {{translated}} Louis Jobert's La science des medailles into English, {{with the}} title of The Knowledge of Medals. This was designed as <b>an</b> <b>instruction</b> to the beginning coin collector, and also contained information to protect the new collector from fraud. Gale then in 1709 published his father's work on the Antonine Itinerary, which Gale supplemented with his own notes and commentary.

5|$|The Ottoman Minister of the Interior Talaat Pasha {{gave the}} {{detention}} order on 24 April 1915.

5|$|To the consternation of Hamond {{and some}} other parishioners, the bishop delayed issuing <b>an</b> <b>instruction</b> forbidding Davidson to preach. When Hamond locked the Morston church against him, the rector preached to a large {{congregation}} on the grass outside the church. In August, Davidson's licence to minister as a priest was revoked; his last service was morning worship at Stiffkey on 21 August 1932, when around 1,000 people congregated outside the church. That afternoon he demanded the Morston church keys from Hamond, who sent him away by turning him round and administering a substantial kick. Hamond was later fined for this assault.|$|E

5|$|Galileo made {{a number}} of {{contributions}} to what is now known as engineering, as distinct from pure physics. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a Geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccolò Tartaglia and Guidobaldo del Monte. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular polygon, computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, {{and a variety of other}} calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with <b>an</b> <b>instruction</b> manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire.|$|E
5|$|Schleswig-Holstein was the {{flagship}} {{of the fleet}} until 1932 when she was taken in for another reconstruction that converted her into a training vessel. As a result, Schlesien held the position of fleet flagship afterward. In 1932, Wilhelm Canaris took command of the ship, a post he held for two years. In May 1935, the Reichsmarine was again reorganized as the Kriegsmarine. Shortly after, Schlesien took part in extensive fleet maneuvers with the new heavy cruiser Deutschland. Later that year, Schlesien was converted into a training ship. Among the modifications were the installation of additional anti-aircraft guns and replacement of the ship's boilers. The newer boilers were more efficient, which allowed fewer {{of them to be}} used; the additional space this created was used as crew compartments for the cadets and <b>an</b> <b>instruction</b> room. The crew was also altered; the standard crew had been 35 officers and 708 enlisted men; after the conversion, this was reduced to 29 officers and 559 sailors, supplemented by 214 cadets. The following year, Schlesien toured the Americas; in March 1937 the ship stopped in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Later that year in December, she stopped in Mar del Plata, Argentina. In 1938, the ship visited Samaná Bay in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
