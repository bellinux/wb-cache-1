40|$|As with {{classics}} in {{the contemporary}} mass-market theatrical scene, legal classics appear to come in trilogies as well.

However, to suggest that the difficulties in negligence law have been clarified by these cases would be inaccurate. Indeed, not only is the actual test for duty of care unclear in England (see, e. g.

40|$|Despite its {{recognition}} in different jurisdictions, the application of the iura novit curia principle in international commercial arbitration has been subject to debate. From {{the most liberal}} point of view, the principle is entirely applicable to international commercial arbitration {{in the same way}} that it would be applied by a judge when rendering a decision under his national law.  However, from the most conservative standpoint, any manifestation of this principle allowing arbitrators to take the initiative in raising new legal issues during the proceedings must be completely rejected. Taking as a premise that, generally speaking, members of an international arbitral tribunal are not familiar with the law applicable to the disputes that are brought to them and that they have no experience or practical knowledge regarding such law, the application of the iura novit curia principle in its purest form would not be adequate in the context of international commercial arbitration given its contractual nature and the interests involved. On the other hand, an outright rejection of this principle in international commercial arbitration would tie the hands of arbitrators and create the risk of awards being rendered that either ignore or contradict rules or principles that form part of the applicable law, which could lead to challenges to their validity or later enforcement. For this reason, in order for iura novit curia to be applied in the context of international commercial arbitration, an intermediate approach should be adopted. This involves a significant adaptation of the principle, so that some of its manifestations could be accepted in exceptional circumstances as a tool that arbitrators could use in order to fully comply with duties that are inherent to their decision-making function, including the duty not to exceed the jurisdiction conferred upon them by the parties, the duty to render awards that are valid, enforceable and in accordance with the <b>applicable</b> law, the <b>duty</b> to act in an impartial manner and the duty to guarantee at all times fundamental due process rights of the parties, such as the right to adequately and timely exercise their defense and the right to equality...|$|R
40|$|Between 1995 and 2001, the {{influential}} National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) promulgated iterations of uniform laws pertaining to partnerships, limited partnerships and limited liability companies. One {{or more of}} those acts have been widely adopted by state legislatures. Each of the three acts—the Uniform Partnership Act (1997) (hereinafter RUPA), the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (2001) (hereinafter ULPA (2001)), and the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (1996) (hereinafter ULLCA) —contains identical fiduciary duty provisions. The acts all adopt the same standards for the duty of care and the duty of loyalty, and offer parties the same limited rights {{to opt out of}} the statutory fiduciary standards. The fiduciary standards and the opt-out rights in RUPA, ULPA (2001), and ULLCA are badly flawed. The fiduciary duty provisions in the three acts reflect a pro-management bias that facilitates managers’ pecuniary interest in constructing inefficient transactions with the entity’s investors. The default standards themselves, which are likely to govern most situations, are inefficiently lax and limited, and the opt-out provisions, which permit the parties within broad limits to re-make the default standards of care and loyalty, fail to facilitate fully-informed bargaining between managers and investors respecting the nature of fiduciary duties, making it likely that parties will misperceive and misprice their fiduciary duties. The recently promulgated Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (hereinafter RULLCA) offered the NCCUSL the opportunity to begin to correct its past mistakes regarding the fiduciary <b>duties</b> <b>applicable</b> to managers of unincorporated business entities. Unfortunately, the Commissioners squandered this opportunity and, once again in RULLCA, enacted duties that are poorly designed and bound to lead to inefficient and unfair outcomes. RULLCA contains many of the same misdirected fiduciary duty notions that plague its predecessor uniform acts, although the Commissioners in RULLCA did make a sensible adjustment to managers’ duty of loyalty standards and, at least arguably, to managers’ duty of oversight or monitoring, a part of their overall duty of care. Any modest progress in these regards, however, was more than offset by the adoption of the “business judgment rule” as a part of an awkward statutory framework for RULLCA’s duty of care provision. This overlaying of the “business judgment rule” on RULLCA’s negligence standard of care will be confusing to LLC parties and to courts, which in turn will increase transaction costs and the probability of unexpected and unintended outcomes. Even more importantly, the adoption of a business judgment standard will reduce managers’ standard of care to a level that is even more lax and inefficient than the present gross negligence standard that one finds in RUPA, ULPA (2001), and ULLCA...|$|R
40|$|According to Family and Guardianship Code (F. G. C.), {{adoption}} is realized {{by means of}} guardianship count decision on demand of am adopter. Unless it is otherwise provided by law, consent of specified persons is indispensable for adoption i. e. : consent of an adoptee when he turned thirteen, consent of his parents, of a guardian or an adopter's spouse if both spouses are not adopting jointly. The consent of 'the said persons as an element of adoption's effectuation {{is characterized by the}} fact that it is not creating the relationship of adoption but consists one of the premises of admissibility of deciding adoption by court. There are numerous question open to discussion related to the consent to adoption as a material premise of an adoption decision. One of those of a general impact for the whole institution of consent to adoption as well as related to the consent's positioning in a construction of adoption's realization is discussed in the article. It is a question of establishing legal character of a declaration of consent to adoption. That issue has not yet been satisfactirily clarified in the doctrine and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Particularly, the commonly adopted treatment of the consent as a declaration of will (legal (transaction) in the understanding of Civil Code (C. C.) must raiseobjections. That view can be /traced to a psychological concept of declaration of will according to which the declaration of will means as much as manifesting an intention to cause legal consequences. The reason for doubts lies in the nature of;legal transaction an indispensable element of which is a declaration of will; the fürst is considered to be a (particular element of civil daw system provided for the legal subjects to form independently binding legal relations. Whereas no results turning into a change of previous legal situation of -the subjects are observed with making a statement of consent to adoption. Consequently it can be advocated that the institution of legal transaction (declaration of will) is not applicable in the system of adoption instituted judicially and admitted by F. G. C, for the reason of inadequacy of its function to the statutorily set role of a declaration of consent to adoption. The appraisal of a declaration of consent in the light of the newer concept of declaration of will as a normative statement instituting an individual norm of behavior is positively speaiking against considering the consent to adoption to be a declaration of will. Referring to the theory of conventional acts, which generated the aforementioned concept, it can be maintained that a sense of declaration of consent to adoption as a conventional act of legal consequence consists entirely in creating a situation in which a formerly laid down norm becomes <b>applicable</b> ana <b>duties</b> of court in a shape of an adequate reaction to that act would actualize thenselves. The results of study of the C. C. regulation of legal transactions to solve quétions related to consent to adoption prove that it is of little avail what is ia ::onsequence speaking for differentiating consent to adoption from legal transactions. The article focuses on such controvertible questions as application of C. C. provisions to the consent to adoption i. e. defects in a declaration of will, consent of -the third party, statutory representation. It can be inferred that, irrespective of its features, a déclaration of consent to adoption evades the C. C. regulation of legal transactions. The authoress advocates that upon a legai qualification of declarations of consent to adoption, one ought to refer to a type of acts in the family law, already distinguished in the doctrine and based on general premises of family law.

40|$|Despite the {{impressive}} strides made in international fisheries {{law in the}} sixteen years since the convening of the United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the state {{of most of the}} world’s fish stocks with which the conference was concerned continues to show little improvement. This is not because of any deficiency in the U. N. Fish Stocks Agreement adopted at the Conference, which as of July 1, 2008 has seventy-one parties, including the United States, the European Community and its twenty-seven member States, Japan, Canada, Russia, Norway, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, in other words most of the major players in international fisheries. The only calls for its revision at the 2006 Review Conference were from non-parties, and these were unconvincing. The standard explanation for the persistent gap between promise and performance has tended to be the slowness of regional fisheries management organizations to implement the Agreement’s solutions, despite the central role they are given by Articles 8 and 13. While there is some truth to this, in part because not all members of these commissions are parties to the Agreement, this Article argues that {{a significant part of the}} explanation is the conspicuous neglect of an essential legal tool in international fisheries discourse: the doctrine of State responsibility. This branch of international law can hold delinquent States accountable to other States for their acts and omissions contrary to their legal obligations. One of the reasons why so many stocks have been overfished to the point of sharply reduced productivity, or even collapse, is that States exerting a risky level of fishing pressure on the stocks have not been systematically visited with any adverse legal consequences before the point of collapse is reached, or for that matter, after. The only consequence they have had to face has been the collapse of the stock itself—a consequence that affects all other States with an interest in the stock, whether they have contributed to causing the collapse or not. In economic terms, States have been largely able to externalize the costs of their risk-taking, leading to levels of risk in the form of fishing pressure that are insufficiently precautionary not just from a biological viewpoint, but also from an economic one. Although there is no shortage of international fisheries documents in which the expression “State responsibility” occurs, it is invariably preceded either by “flag” or, rarely, “coastal” or “port,” and often in the plural, indicating that something other than State responsibility in the sense of public international law was in the drafters’ minds. In the sense in which it is used in these instruments, “responsibility” could easily be replaced by “duty,” “obligation,” or a similar term without a noticeable change in meaning. That is, the obligations here, to the extent that they exist, are primary and substantive, not the secondary duties associated with State responsibility that arise when a primary obligation is breached. It is similarly easy to find rhetorical references in fisheries commissions documents and elsewhere to “responsible fishing States,” and when used in this adjectival form the meaning is even less clear. The origin of this phrase appears to lie in the Cancún Declaration of 1992, where “responsible” seems to be no more than a term of general approbation devoid of any specific meaning. Subsequently, this use has been perpetuated by the soft-law Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. More disturbingly, there are now signs that other State responsibility terms have been appropriated for use in a sense quite foreign to that in which they appear in the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles on State Responsibility. For example, an International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recommendation otherwise drafted in orthodox legal language, used “counter-measures” where it bears no evident relationship to that concept as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness of a State’s acts as set out in Article 22. Countermeasures in its true meaning was raised not many years ago by Rosemary Rayfuse, as a way for the high seas boarding and inspection provisions in Part VI of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement (a significant departure from the long-established ordinary rule codified in Article 92, paragraph 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that on the high seas the flag State of a vessel has exclusive jurisdiction over it) to be made opposable to non-parties to that treaty. Rayfuse argues that where a State persistently breaches its customary and, where <b>applicable,</b> conventional, <b>duty</b> to cooperate with other States and the institutions established by them in conserving high seas fish stocks, other States specially affected may board and inspect that State’s fishing vessels on the high seas. This would be by way of a proportionate response, satisfying the criteria for “resort to countermeasures” laid down in Article 22 of the ILC’s Draft Articles as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of the otherwise unlawful interference with the flag State’s exclusive jurisdiction. Provided the other necessary elements were present, such an argument might well have succeeded as a defense for Canada to the merits of the action brought against it by Spain over its actions on the high seas against the Spanish-flagged Estai in 1995, which was dismissed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1998 for want of jurisdiction. On the other hand, since countermeasures by their very nature tend to be ad hoc responses to immediate exigencies, States are unlikely to adopt this approach as a preannounced policy, as they would then be admitting in effect their willingness to breach international obligations. The remainder of this Article is divided as follows: Section II considers in the abstract how certain basic State responsibility concepts could apply to internationally managed fisheries, and highlights some of the practical difficulties that may also have contributed to their neglect; Section III—the bulk of the Article—is a case study of how States’ practice in accounting to each other for their catches of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) has gradually evolved a “compliance” focus over the years that owes little to any systematic State responsibility framework; Section IV shows that this focus does not sufficiently discharge the member States’ responsibility to other States potentially able to enter the fishery in pursuance of their UNCLOS Article 116 right to fish on the high seas; and Section V offers some concluding thoughts as to how compliance can be reunited with State responsibility to benefit international fisheries...|$|R
40|$|Wet {{clutches}} are lubricated {{machine components}} which utilize friction to transfer torque and thus establish connection between shafts rotating at different speeds. They {{are used in}} automatic transmission as shifting device or lockup clutch. As well as cooling the contacting surfaces, the lubrication provides controlled friction, smooth performance and long life. Because of this advantage, wet clutches are <b>applicable</b> for heavy <b>duty</b> vehicles (e. g. construction equipment, tractors) to handle high power. However, like any other tribological system, wet clutch performance is dependent on several factors concerning operating conditions, system design etc. As a friction generating machine component, the degradation of the lubricant and the contacting clutch surfaces are continuous process and the friction behavior also changes consequently with the progression of the system deterioration and that directly influences the clutch performance. So, to investigate the clutch influencing factors and fundamental understanding of the interaction mechanism is of great interest. Though wet clutches were immensely studied earlier to investigate different issues, there was lack of clear understanding and knowledge concerning water contamination problem and the system design parameters. The main aim of this thesis is to experimentally evaluate and explain the impact of water contamination and to verify different system design parameters’ influence on wet clutch tribological performance. The study focused on the wet clutches in automatic transmissions. Initially the thesis reviews {{the state of the}} art in wet clutch research, discusses the motivation for the current research aim and clarifies the goals of the investigation. Later the details of the experimental method and findings are discussed in this thesis. Since evaluating the friction behaviour in desired environment is the key requirement, an automated wet clutch test rig was utilized to carry out the friction test where operating conditions (slip time, oil temperature, contact pressure/load, sliding speed) can be controlled and the output torque, contact temperature etc. can monitored. This suitable test equipment was designed for standard paper based friction plate and steel separator plate lubricated with automatic transmission fluid. Instead of using a multiple clutch plate configuration, as in real applications, a single friction and reaction plate arrangement is considered to simplify the analyses. In the first part of the thesis the effect of water contamination on wet clutch tribological performances is experimentally investigated. The study reveals that both the friction reliability and the friction-velocity relation are influenced by the change in the friction behaviour for a water contaminated lubricant. It is shown that the friction level increased for the addition of water in the system. This is not a desirable clutch frictional behaviour for maintaining frictional stability. The increase of friction for added water is influenced by the water amount but not by the water exposure time. Then the study is continued for longer test to evaluate the ageing of the friction interfaces and the lubricant. Though water does not show any long term effect on water contaminated ATF as it is seen in case of friction interfaces, the short term effect in the surface active additives is observed in the current research. This finding also supported the investigation on the water contaminated friction interface degradation and the effect of water on additive adsorption of the contacting surfaces. It was found that the addition of water in ATF intensifies the mean friction coefficient, but in the long run the loss of friction much faster and high, which can in fact degrade the clutch life faster as well. Two simplified ATF was also analysed along with the commercial fully formulated ATF for investigating the water impact to get a simple and comprehensive overview of the consequence. In the second part of this thesis, the influence of the clutch’s output shaft’s stiffness and inertia on the clutch system‘s friction reliability is experimentally evaluated. Test results show that the change in the clutch frictional behaviour with time and degradation can largely influence by the choice of these design factors. This can provide different outcome concerning clutch frictional performance and shudder sensitivity. Shudder tendency is seen to be increased for decreased torsion shaft stiffness. High frictional losses and clutch degradation are observed for systems with less inertia.

Ao tempo em que isto se sucede no plano interno, debates e provid?ncias t?m sido tomadas, na seara internacional, no intuito de n?o se permitir que a legisla??o trabalhista seja um instrumento de competitividade transnacional por interm?dio da instala??o fabril em pa?ses com legisla??o fr?gil ou com baixa fiscaliza??o do cumprimento das regras trabalhistas. Diante de dois cen?rios que tratam sobre o mesmo fen?meno, mas com tratamentos absolutamente opostos, o presente trabalho possui como objetivo geral a averigua??o acerca da correla??o entre custos trabalhistas, concorr?ncia empresarial e mercados para aferir se ? poss?vel a defesa do reconhecimento de uma fun??o concorrencial do direito do trabalho. Como objetivos espec?ficos pretende: a) analisar a proposta universalizante dos padr?es internacionais trabalhistas, capitaneados pela Organiza??o Internacional do Trabalho, para propor um n?cleo reduzido de direitos aplic?veis em todos os Estados, denominado de bloco de convencionalidade; b) demonstrar a interliga??o {{fundamental}} do custo trabalhista relacionado ? lucratividade e ? obten??o de mercados; c) investigar como os sistemas nacionais e internacionais de defesa da concorr?ncia enfrentam o tema, destacando as peculiaridades doutrin?rias e jurisprudenciais do dumping social na doutrina brasileira. No intuito de concretizar os objetivos propostos, a pesquisa se socorre do m?todo de abordagem l?gico-dedutivo e hermen?utico, cujo desafio inicial ? estabelecer a problem?tica objeto da pesquisa, ou seja, se ? poss?vel que viola??es trabalhistas sirvam de substrato para a atua??o dos ?rg?o respons?veis pela regula??o concorrencial. Quanto aos m?todos de procedimento, as ferramentas utilizadas s?o eminentemente legislativas, estat?sticas e comparativas, que visam perscrutar a exist?ncia de um hiato entre o direito do trabalho e o direito da concorr?ncia, de modo a viabilizar uma conjuga??o interseccional. A pesquisa documental considerou a jurisprud?ncia de cortes supranacionais e locais, a an?lise de dados produzidos por entidades internacionais, locais e a bibliografia estrangeira e brasileira sobre o tema. Como resultado conclusivo, tem-se que existe uma fun??o concorrencial no direito do trabalho desconsiderada pela teoria geral trabalhista e pelo direito da concorr?ncia. Entende-se, ainda, que tal fun??o representa um dos v?rios desafios propostos pela globaliza??o jur?dica diante da persecu??o da efici?ncia dos custos de produ??o pelos agentes econ?micos, devendo ser exercida, na seara internacional, pela Organiza??o Mundial do Com?rcio (que aplicar? o paradigma das Conven??es Fundamentais da OIT) e, no campo interno, unicamente pelo Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econ?mica (CADE) e pela Justi?a Federal, nos casos de judicializa??o, sendo vedada, de toda forma, a an?lise da mat?ria pela Justi?a do Trabalho, de of?cio ou a pedido, sob pena de vilip?ndio ao princ?pio processual da unicidade de convic??o. The classical {{functions of}} labor law enrolled by doctrine the, {{the law and}} the specialized law does not contemplate, at the national level, the systematic evasion of labor rights as conduct enough for the environment in the event of anti-competitive behavior. As it happens, internally, debates and actions have been taken in international view, in order not to allow the labor legislation is a transnational instrument of competitiveness through the manufacturing facility in countries with weak legislation or with low enforcement of labor rules. Faced with two scenarios that deal with the same phenomenon, but with absolutely opposite treatments, this study has the general objective to research the correlation between labor costs, business competition and markets to assess whether the defense of the recognition of a competitive function is possible to labor law. The specific objectives are: a) examine the universalizing proposal of labor international standards, led by the International Labour Organization, to propose a reduced core <b>duties</b> <b>applicable</b> in all Member States, called conventionality block; b) demonstrate the fundamental interconnection of the labor cost related to profitability and obtaining markets; c) investigate how the national and international systems of antitrust face the theme, highlighting the doctrinal and jurisprudential peculiarities of social dumping in the Brazilian doctrine. In order to achieve the proposed objectives, the research uses the logical-deductive method and hermeneutic approach, which initial challenge is to establish the problematic object of research, that is, if it is possible that labor violations serve as substrate for the action of the body responsible for regulating competition. Concerning the methods of procedure, the sources are eminently laws, statistics and comparative aimed at scrutinizing the existence of a gap between the labor law and competition law in order to enable a intersectional conjugation. The documentary research considered the jurisprudence of supranational courts and local analysis of data produced by international organizations, local and foreign and Brazilian literature on the subject. As a final result, there is a competitive role in labor law disregarded the labor theory and the general competition law. It is understood also that this function {{is one of the many}} challenges posed by the legal globalization on the pursuit of efficiency in production costs by economic agents, should be exercised in the international harvest, the World Trade Organization (which apply the paradigm of ILO Core Conventions) and, in the infield, solely by the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) and the Federal Justice in cases of legalization, being prohibited in all, the analysis of the matter by the Labor Court, ex officio or on request, under penalty of contempt to the procedural principle of unity of belief...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Ethical and Epistemic Choices: New Approaches track. It is commonplace for epistemologists to reject doxastic voluntarism, the thesis that persons can form beliefs voluntarily. To the philosophically uninitiated, though, this rejection can sound preposterous. Epistemologists who reject doxastic voluntarism sound as if they reject a person’s very ability to control her beliefs, reject epistemic agency tout court. And such wholesale rejection of agency is certainly unintuitive. We generally believe that persons, unless specially constrained in some way, are free thinking as well as free acting. This view of persons as free thinkers shows up in our language and actions, in our treatment of and comportment toward one another. It is part of our self-image. Peter Strawson made evident the depth and significance of the so-called reactive attitudes in our interpersonal economy. Strawson emphasized that the reactive stance we most often take towards one another, in engagement with each other, was illustrative of the agency we implicitly attribute to one another. Though Strawson discussed action and not belief, we can extrapolate from his observations to the epistemic realm. We do in fact exhibit reactions akin to gratitude and resentment in regard to belief. Beliefs can be met with judgments of outrage or commendation and their authors blamed or praised accordingly. We judge our own and others’ beliefs all the time. And we hold each other responsible for the beliefs we espouse. We say that Colin Powell ought not to have believed apocryphal CIA reports on Iraq. Arlen Spector ought to have believed Anita Hill’s testimony. The fictional jurors of To Kill a Mockingbird ought to have believed Tom Robinson. So what sense do those who would reject doxastic voluntarism make of this sort of behavior? How do the involuntarists explain deontological, or at least faux-deontological, claims about belief? One option is an error theory. All such deontological judgments (like the claim that Colin Powell ought not to have believed CIA reports) are simply false. False because they attribute an agency not in fact possessed by their subjects. Another option is to maintain that such statements can in fact be true and that doxastic involuntarism is compatible with doxastic deontology. It is this latter option that I intend to explore: how can doxastic involuntarism be compatible with doxastic deontology? Taking this tack, at least one further choice manifests. The aim is to maintain that deontological claims are (at least sometimes) true while doxastic voluntarism is false. Here we can assuage the seeming tension either by mitigating the apparent demandingness of the deontology or by shoring up agency {{in the face of the}} erosion involuntarism appears to present. I want to examine each of these options in turn, whilst looking at a particular set of examples, in order to see which alternative can better handle the particular cases. Richard Feldman pursues the first of these two strategies. His arguments support what I would call a faux-deontology; he says that epistemic ought-statements like “Colin Powell ought not to have believed apocryphal CIA reports on Iraq,” are sometimes true, but elaborates that such judgments should be analyzed in a way that does not require the subject have epistemic control. Feldman: “Even in cases in which a believer has no control at all, it makes sense to speak of what he ought to believe and ought not to believe. ” According to Feldman, such epistemic ought-claims express what he calls ‘role oughts’. They express the right way to be a believer, a ruling ideal applicable to all, regardless of any particular subject’s ability to conform to it. The reason why the expression of a ‘role-ought’ amounts only to what I’ve called ‘faux-deontology’ is that it has no clear place in the economy of Strawsonian reactive attitudes. Articulating a doxastic ideal is a different kettle of fish from either praising or taking someone to task for her epistemic performance. Doing the latter more explicitly holds the subject to the standard, holds her accountable to it, holds her responsible for succeeding or failing to meet it. And it is not yet clear that Feldman is entitled to an interpretation of ‘role-oughts’ that are thus robustly deontological. He denies that voluntarism is true in any significant sense. It remains to make sense of the <b>duty</b> <b>applicable</b> to agents who so lack voluntary control over belief. I draw out this difficulty for Feldman’s (and similar) accounts via several particular examples. Pamela Hieronymi, in a series of recent papers, pursues our second strategy. She elaborates on the sort of control we enjoy as epistemic agents. In the remainder of the paper, I plumb Hieronymi’s account of epistemic agency in order to make sense of the thought that deontological claims can be true while voluntarism false. I explore what Hieronymi calls ‘managerial’ and ‘evaluative’ control by discussing several examples, most notably by looking at an interesting class of examples—those where evaluative judgment is faulty by our lights, perhaps in a way that could only have been remedied by superior ‘managerial’ intervention. Some such cases are those Miranda Fricker classes as ‘epistemic injustice’. I discuss the cases of Anita Hill and Tom Robinson using the mechanics of Hieronymi’s view. I ultimately argue that while Hieronymi’s account faces several difficulties, it is the more promising route to making sense of epistemic deontology without doxastic voluntarism...|$|R

Issuing {{guarantees for}} consumer loans in Croatia has very serious {{consequences for the}} guarantors, and this was confirmed in an empirical study conducted within the CitProtect Project, according to which a total of 27. 6 % of subjects-guarantors were not informed or do not remember being informed about their rights and obligations before executing the guarantee. Out of those guarantors that were informed, 11. 9 % did not understand, or poorly understood, or do not remember if they understood the information about their legal position and its consequences. These numbers show that necessary attention should {{be paid to the}} pre-contractual informing of consumers. Croatian law does not expressly provide that a guarantor who issues a guarantee outside his or her commercial, business, trade, or professional activity for a consumer loan should also be considered a consumer. However, an analysis of the content of Croatian law compared to Austrian legislation and case law on this issue, as well as Rec. 12 of Directive 2014 / 17 /EU on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property, indicates that within this context a guarantor should also be considered a consumer under Croatian law, to whom consumer law should consequently be <b>applicable.</b> The pre-contractual <b>duty</b> to inform the guarantor within the consumer loan context is not regulated under European law. However, it is generally accepted that it is not prohibited to widen the personal scope of application of Directive 2008 / 48 /EU on credit agreements for consumers and Directive 2014 / 17 /EU on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property, which consider only principal debtors in consumer loan contracts as consumers. Until 2013, Croatian law had no special rules on the duty to pre-contractually inform guarantors, so the primary mode of inferring its existence was through legal interpretation. The existence of the duty to pre-contractually inform the guarantor in consumer loan contracts was thus to be inferred from the general principle of good faith and fair dealing under the Obligations Act. Furthermore, the Consumer Protection Act also contains rules that enable such an inference about the existence of this duty on the creditor side of the transaction. However, in both these cases, and considering the absence of any relevant domestic case law, it could not be determined what exactly the content of such communication would be. Considering the nature and effects of the rules on the pre-contractual duty to inform the consumer under the Consumer Credit Act and the Draft Residential Consumer Credit Act, which refer only to the principal debtors in consumer loan contracts, it cannot not be argued that the credit institution has a duty to provide to the guarantor the same information that it must provide to a potential borrower before executing the contract per analogy, particularly not that there is identical criminal and civil liability of the credit institution with respect to the guarantor as with respect to the principal debtor. Opinions to the contrary exist in German and Austrian literature, {{in the context of their}} domestic rules that implement European law. However, these comparative examples do not contain case law corroborating such views. It is only the Credit Institutions Act that contains key provisions on the pre-contractual duty to inform guarantors. Under these provisions, the credit institution has a duty to disclose before the execution of a loan contract “all relevant information” about the terms of the contract that will make visible the rights and duties of the parties and advise them about the legal nature of a guarantee, as well as the right of the credit institution to collect their claims from guarantors. Nevertheless, with respect to guarantors the credit institution is not obligated to provide all the information it must provide the principal debtor. This Act does not contain a clear provision defining the meaning of “all relevant information about the terms of the contract that will make visible the rights and duties of the parties. ” Therefore it should be understood that the credit institution has a duty to determine the content of the pre-contractual communication to the guarantor in good faith, as this Act determines the minimum rights of guarantors as consumers of, and credit institutions are in no way prohibited from broader communication with the guarantor about their rights and duties. On the other hand, it should be borne in mind that the right measure of informing is key for the consumer to be truly informed and make an informed decision about entering into the contract. The research on legal regulation conducted here has demonstrated that consumer-guarantors are entirely free and unrestricted in entering into guarantee contracts, while at the same time there is no counter-balance in regulating detailed and sufficiently substantial information that the credit institution should provide before they enter into such contracts. Furthermore, the Credit Institutions Act that generally provides a duty to pre-contractually inform guarantors does not, however, envisage a duty to advise guarantors about entering into such contracts for consumer loans, and particularly about the consequences of such guarantees. Therefore, it would be useful to regulate in detail the duty to pre-contractually inform guarantors within special statutes, such as the Consumer Credit Act and the future Residential Consumer Credit Act, modeled after the current scheme for consumers-principal debtors...|$|R
40|$|Anthony Forsyth {{proposes a}} social {{partnership}} agenda for Australia WHAT kind of labour law or industrial relations system should replace Work Choices? This might seem an odd question - after all, {{the new legislation}} has only been in operation for a little over six months. But the Work Choices Act is widely {{considered to be a}} partisan piece of legislation - one that provides too much scope for the untrammeled exercise of managerial power. It is also heavily oriented towards conflict - especially in the bargaining sphere, where the statute sets up a complex, legalistic process for parties to engage in “industrial warfare,” without any effective mechanism for dispute resolution. In his recent Julian Small Lecture (PDF), Professor Ron McCallum speculated that Work Choices will not stand the test of time. In his view, it will be substantially revised within six to eight years, for several reasons, including the failure of many employers to engage with the new laws - for example, because they want to treat their employees fairly (rather than engaging in the labour cost-cutting that is now open to them) or they want to avoid its complexity. Clearly, the outcome of the next federal election will be critical in determining the longevity of the reforms. If the Coalition is re-elected, then Work Choices will probably have a minimum “life” of five years or so. On the other hand, if Labor wins the election, that will {{be the end of the}} Work Choices experiment. But apart from the ALP’s commitment to “rip up these unfair laws,” scrap AWAs, and introduce a firmer basis for collective bargaining, we do not really know what they will put in the place of Work Choices. So with the federal election only twelve months away (maybe less), it is not at all premature to be considering “what next, after Work Choices?” I want to suggest that the central concept underpinning any new industrial relations system should be that of “social partnership. ” I also want to briefly outline a couple of key elements of a system based on that concept. Social partnership is a continental European notion. It essentially denotes the idea of cooperation between government, unions and employers, rather than adversarialism, as the basis for ordering labour relations. In its purest form, for example in Germany, these cooperative arrangements operate at three mutually reinforcing levels: 1. At the national, policy formulation level - through tripartite mechanisms for determining the framework of labour regulation and economic policy (Australia had some experience of this in the Accord years) 2. At the industry or sectoral level - through collective bargaining between unions and employer associations, which sets the parameters for workplace-level outcomes regarding wages, working hours, and other core employment conditions 3. At the firm level - the legal rights of workers to participate in workplace decision-making through works councils, and employee representation on the boards of larger companies. Obviously, Australia cannot simply replicate the German (or any other European) industrial relations system. We have to bear in mind that their systems operate within specific institutional and economic contexts that support the social partnership approach - such as the European “social market economy,” and “stakeholder” rather than shareholder-centred corporate governance systems. However, we can borrow the underlying concept - that of partnership, or cooperation in industrial relations - and, by giving it a modern Australian flavour, use it as a basis for developing an alternative workplace relations framework. In this respect, recent experience in New Zealand points the way. New Zealand has a remarkably similar industrial relations heritage to Australia: a long-standing conciliation and arbitration system that provided strong support to trade unions, but which gave way to a deregulated model centred on individualised bargaining. When Labour was re-elected to government in NZ in 1999 it was faced with similar questions to those confronting the ALP now; with a return to conciliation and arbitration no longer viable, how could the new government legislate for a fair and balanced employment relations system to protect workers’ interests and meet the needs of a modern economy? The settlement arrived at in New Zealand’s Employment Relations Act 2000 is founded on the concept of “good faith,” which permeates all aspects of individual employment relationships, and collective labour relations, which are regulated by the legislation. For example, the 2000 legislation provides a framework of “good faith bargaining” rights and <b>duties,</b> <b>applicable</b> to employers, employees and unions, as well as consultation rights for workers over company restructuring at the firm level. The strong statutory support for “good faith” employment relations is intended to facilitate a broader cultural shift in NZ towards “workplace partnership,” which is defined as “an active relationship between unions & employers to deliver outcomes that benefit the mutual trust of both parties. ” The core ideas behind partnership include: a collaborative, “mutual gains” approach to bargaining; wide union and employee consultation practices; consensus over conflict; and restraint and protection of relationships in the management of conflict. This approach is supported by various government organisations and processes operating at the national level, including the Growth and Innovation Framework, the tripartite Workplace Productivity Project, and the Partnership Resource Centre. Overall, through these inter-linked layers of innovative regulation, the Labour government has really engineered a NZ version of the European social partnership model. I think we need a public policy conversation in Australia about establishing an IR system based on cooperation, not conflict. That debate should involve all of the “social partners” in the Australian context - for example, federal and state governments, employer bodies, unions, and welfare, church and community groups. And, in my view, there are two key elements that need to form part of an Australian social partnership agenda: 1. “Good faith bargaining”: We must rectify the current legislative anomaly, where we have around 100 pages of rules regarding protected industrial action, secret ballots, etc - but nothing preserving the right of a group of workers to obtain a collective agreement if they want one; nothing about the bargaining process; and little opportunity for resolving bargaining impasses (except in the most extreme cases). The ACTU is leading the way here. Its recent collective bargaining proposals seek to bring Australia into line with other major industrialised economies, such as the UK, US, Canada - all of which provide in some way for a right to collective bargaining, where this is supported by a majority of the workforce. The ACTU has sensibly steered clear of mandatory employee ballots and other complex legal procedures that are features of some overseas IR systems, drawing in part on NZ’s good faith bargaining model. It also seeks to restore a prominent role for the AIRC, as the body for determining whether a union has met the “majority support” requirement for triggering the bargaining process, overseeing that process and resolving deadlocks. 2. Participation in workplace decision-making: Employees in the modern workforce should be involved in strategic business decisions, and provided with the information they need to do so, including information about firm performance, future investment plans, and restructuring proposals. Much international evidence shows that this kind of “high consultation/high performance” approach leads to productive outcomes for firms, as well as providing workers with a “voice” over important issues of job security. In Australia, these objectives could be achieved through a combination of statutory mandate - for example, information & consultation rights for employees in larger businesses - supplemented by a range of regulatory supports (provided by federal and state governments) to enable firms to pursue the cooperative path to workplace innovation and business competitiveness - for example, information, training, funding trials, tax breaks and other incentives. These ideas might seem a world away from the current reality of Work Choices. But they are being successfully implemented, in various forms, in several countries that share Australia’s tradition of adversarial IR, including (as well as New Zealand) the United Kingdom and Ireland. As in those countries, any move to embrace workplace partnership will require a major cultural shift in Australia - greater levels of trust by managers in their workers, and a degree of compromise on the part of employees and their representatives. The idea of social partnership warrants serious consideration in any process of formulating alternative proposals for labour regulation in Australia. • Anthony Forsyth is senior lecturer and director of the Corporate Law and Accountability Research Group, Department of Business Law & Taxation, Monash University, and an associate of the Australian Institute of Employment Rights.
