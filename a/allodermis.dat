40|$|Chinese intermingled {{skin grafts}} of {{allogenic}} material interspersed with small autogenic islets heal permanently with {{no signs of}} a rejection reaction. A study of the T-helper and T-suppressor cells {{in the region of}} the autogenic islets and the remaining <b>allodermis</b> revealed a distinctly greater frequency of these cells in the islets, with marked massing of the cells between the autoepithelium and the autodermis. Histologically it could be shown, that the Langerhans' cells grow over the <b>allodermis</b> together with the epithelium, although compared with the autogenic islets their number in the newly formed epidermis remained reduced...|$|E
40|$|The almost {{forgotten}} method of intermingled skin grafting of allogeneic material with small autogeneic islets, once {{developed in the}} People's Republic of China, proves the feasibility of permanent healing of even extensive burn wounds, at low cost, and therefore an effective treatment possibility in poorer countries, as well as under conditions of a burn disaster. Intermingled skin grafting obtains a better elasticity of the reconditioned skin as elastic fibres of the <b>allodermis</b> survive, and this results in fewer contractures. From the cosmetic point of view the transplantation of autologous keratinocytes results in a better aesthetic homogeneous texture...|$|E
