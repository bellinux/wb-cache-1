Thus, both industry and academia focus on defining model driven engineering (MDE) approaches and on integrating several analyses in the development process.

Our contribution is a modeling framework allowing the generation of dependability-oriented analytical models from AADL models, to facilitate the evaluation of dependability measures, such as reliability or availability. We propose an iterative approach for system dependability modeling using AADL. In this context, we also provide a set of reusable modeling patterns for fault tolerant architectures. The AADL dependability model is transformed into a GSPN (Generalized Stochastic Petri Net) by applying model transformation rules. We have implemented an automatic model transformation tool. The resulting GSPN can be processed by existing tools to obtain dependability measures.

40|$|Abstract. Molecular {{diffusion}} under confinement by highly ordered nanoporous structures is {{subjected to}} a hierarchy of particle-particle correlations. These correlations result {{in a variety of}} peculiarities of molecular diffusion. Three examples are discussed in detail. As a consequence of the confinement by the host matrix, molecular displacements in different directions often intimately depend on each other, resulting in an interdependence of the principal elements of the dihsion tensor (correlation rule of difision anisotropy). If intrac~ystalline channel systems confine molecular propagation to one direction, molecules with diameters Mciently exceeding the channel radii are subjected to single-jle d~flusion, whose spatial-temporal dependence significantly deviates from normal diffusion. In networks of intersecting single-file systems with different affinities to the reactant and product molecules, the interplay of diffusion and reaction leads to deviations from a homogeneous pore filling over the sample and to an enhanced output of reaction products in comparison with channel networks of equal adsorption affinities (reactivity enhancement by molecular <b>trafic</b> <b>control).</b> The presented theoretical concepts are compared with experimental results, in particular with the findings of pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR diffusion studies. 1...|$|R

New hybrid microwave integrated circuit application techniques were used to design a small local oscillator, tunable over the 5400 to 5900 MHz range with a frequency drift of less than ± 1 MHz. This low frequency drift allowed {{the use of a}} 4 pole immediate amplifier filter, 60 dB down, at 40 MHz bandwidth, which, when coupled with the three cavity radio frequency preselector filter, provides 7 pole out of band rejection for unwanted radar signals operating at close frequencies.

This allows rejection of the radars own in-band multipath signals by reducing the gain and threshold sensitivity.

However, using a conventional case‐control design, large samples are needed to capture enough rare variants to achieve sufficient power for testing the association between suspected loci and complex diseases. In such large samples, population stratification may easily cause spurious signals. One approach to overcome stratification {{is to use a}} family‐based design. For rare variants, this strategy is especially appropriate, as power can be increased considerably by analyzing cases with affected relatives. We propose a novel framework for association testing in affected sibpairs by comparing the allele count of rare variants on chromosome regions shared identical by descent to the allele count of rare variants on nonshared chromosome regions, referred to as test for rare variant association with family‐based internal <b>control</b> (<b>TRAFIC).</b> This design is generally robust to population stratification as cases and controls are matched within each sibpair. We evaluate the power analytically using general model for effect size of rare variants. For the same number of genotyped people, TRAFIC shows superior power over the conventional case‐control study for variants with summed risk allele frequency f< 0. 05; this power advantage is even more substantial when considering allelic heterogeneity. For complex models of gene‐gene interaction, this power advantage depends on the direction of interaction and overall heritability. In sum, we introduce a new method for analyzing rare variants in affected sibpairs that is robust to population stratification, and provide freely available software...|$|R
40|$|A new Transponder {{architecture}} {{offers the}} ability to reprogram the transponder in the field. The current implementation of flash based memories for code and/or parameter storage impede this feature due to significant current consumption over {{a long time for}} store operation. The proposed sophisticated approach uses the low current consumption of embedded nvSRAM memories. The nvSRAM embedded memory combines the fast unlimited access of a SRAM bitcell backed up by a SONOS based storage device. The store and erase procedure are based on Fowler-Nordheim erase and programming of the SONOS device. This field emission tunneling consumes very small current and provides the capability of programming all memory cells at the same time. The necessary charge is stored on a capacitor that was charged up very smoothly during power on by controlled current source technique to avoid the feedback on transponder operation. Based on this concept the code and/or parameters could be stored by hardware <b>control</b> of the <b>transponders</b> microcontroller, by software control insight and outsight of the system or even in case of emergency system power down. Beside the field programming capability a proprietary store procedure control allows to store additional information of the store procedure itself to flag the successful store operation. This capability provides the new powerful feature of logging the store procedure in a very low current consuming environment and checks the validity after re-powering the system.

40|$|<b>Control</b> of {{satellite}} <b>transponders</b> {{is considered a}} crucial factor in {{the historical development of}} remote Indigenous broadcasting. However, recent events reveal the tenuous nature of such ‘control’. In the mid 1980 s the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association won the remote commercial TV service licence for Australia’s first communications satellite and established Imparja. The satellite also provided the necessary backbone for the Broadcasting for Remote Aboriginal Communities Scheme (BRACS), whereby communities were given the technology to choose content off the satellite for local viewing and to create and distribute locally produced content. Remote Indigenous broadcast networks developed from this system. The arguments put forward during the initial licensing process highlighted the importance of Indigenous control of remote broadcasting in remote areas for the purposes of cultural maintenance, and to counteract the influence of Western culture on language and traditional practices. This historical moment is worth revisiting in light of the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010, which {{paved the way for the}} VAST satellite platform. VAST is intended to replace terrestrial transmission in remote communities by the end of 2013. The legislation does not clearly provide for Indigenous narrowcasters and has called into question Imparja’s historical role in meeting the demands of the Indigenous broadcasting sector.

40|$|Background: Long-term {{exposure}} to traffic-related air pollution may increase blood pressure (BP) and induce hypertension. However, evidence supporting these associations is limited, {{and they may}} be confounded by {{exposure to}} traffic noise and biased due to inappropriate control for use of BP-lowering medications. Objectives: We evaluated the associations of long-term traffic-related air pollution with BP and prevalent hypertension, adjusting for transportation noise and assessing different methodologies to control for BP-lowering medications. Methods: We measured systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) at baseline (years 2003 – 2005) in 3, 700 participants, 35 – 83 years of age, from a population-based cohort in Spain. We estimated home outdoor annual average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) with a land-use regression model. We used multivariate linear and logistic regression. Results: A 10 -μg/m 3 increase in NO 2 levels was associated with 1. 34 mmHg (95 % CI: 0. 14, 2. 55) higher SBP in nonmedicated individuals, after adjusting for transportation noise. Results were similar in the entire population after adjusting for medication, as commonly done, but weaker when other methods were used to account for medication use. For example, when 10 mmHg were added to the measured SBP levels of medicated participants, the association was β = 0. 78 (95 % CI: – 0. 43, 2. 00). NO 2 was not associated with hypertension. Associations of NO 2 with SBP and DBP were stronger in participants with cardiovascular disease, and the association with SBP was stronger in those exposed to high traffic density and traffic noise levels ≥ 55 dB(A). Conclusions: We observed a positive association between long-term exposure to NO 2 and SBP, after adjustment for transportation noise, which was sensitive to the methodology used to account for medication.

The aim of the study was to examine if different individuals’ feeding-times of roughage affect the amount of feed the horses gets every day. The research issues for the study were: How much does feeding-times of roughage differ between different individuals’ measurements? Does measuring method affect the horses’ feeding-times? How much do feeding-times differ within the individual’s measurements? A total of eleven horses were used in the study, at ages from 3 - 17 years old. Two different methods were tested to measure feeding-times, and both methods were tested in the horses’ natural feeding habitat. The first method was to offer the horse five kg dry matter and measure how much the horse would eat in a 15 minute time period. The second method was to measure how long it took for the horse to eat one kg dry matter. The results showed significant differences between individuals. One horse had significantly slower feeding-time compared to all other horses and another horse had significantly faster feeding-time compared to four other horses. There were no differences depending on what method that was used for measurement. In conclusion, the mean value for the feeding-time for the whole group was 25. 3 minutes. The variation between horses differed 13. 8 minutes per kg dry matter and which was a significant difference. Feeding-times within the individual are parting from 6. 9 minutes to 31. 2 minutes. Choice of measuring method does not affect the horses’ feeding-times. The hypothesis “The horse’s feeding-times are individual” was accepted.

40|$|The {{building}} in XXX {{was constructed in}} XXX. It was designed using the International Building Code (IBC). This fire protection analysis report will be reviewing the building based on the 2015 edition of the IBC including several performance based fire scenarios involving the smoke exhaust system. The passive system section highlights the physical construction of the building. The building is a business occupancy with three separate stories including a penthouse which {{is included in the}} third story. The building has adequate fire ratings for a Type II-B construction except for heavy timber columns within the commons of the building. It seems likely that the designer obtained a waiver for construction with use of these heavy timber beams, but it still needs to be verified. In addition to the heavy timber construction issue, there was a concern with the egress requirements of the large conference room on the first floor. This conference room has the ability to be partitioned into three separate conference rooms. When this is achieved, the occupant load for each of these three separate smaller conference rooms is higher than an occupant load of 50. There is only one door per each of these smaller conference rooms. This is a violation of the IBC 2015 edition. The fire suppression section highlighted the capabilities of the sprinkler system. The fire flow test shows that there is a high enough water capacity at a high enough pressure for the worst case locations within the building to be supplied to meet NFPA 13. There is no need for a fire pump in this building. The fire alarm section highlights the construction of the fire alarm system. The fire alarm system uses Class A wiring as required by the AHJ for this type of construction. In addition to being a Class A wiring connection, additional provisions were included in the fire alarm system to an emergency voice notification system that notifies occupants {{in case of an emergency}} on the steps needed to maintain safety in emergency situations. Included in the fire alarm system are various panels including a Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP), 3 Transponder Panels (TP), 9 Notification Appliance Circuit Panels (NACP), and a Smoke Control Panel included in the fire alarm system. There is an issues with the placement of smoke detectors. There are no smoke detectors protecting the FACP and associated panels which does not meet NFPA 72 requirements. The smoke control system is interconnected to the fire alarm system via the smoke control panel. In the event of a fire, the smoke is exhausted through the ceiling through use of eight exhaust fans and make up air is funneled through inlets in the floors of the common areas and vents in the commons (conference rooms) through the use of five supply fans. This was a focal point in the performance based fire modeling section of the report. The performance based fire analysis focuses on two fire scenarios. The first scenario focuses an atrium fire and the second fire scenario focuses on a fire in the main conference room that removes the ability to egress through one of the three doors within the room. The two fire scenarios are not meant to verify acceptability based on NFPA 96 requirements for an exhaust system for an atrium. The fire scenarios shown to illustrate semi-realistic fires in the main conference room on the first floor and in the center of the atrium. The tenability requirements looked at for these fire scenarios were for visibility, CO (carbon monoxide) concentrations within the space, and the temperature of the air in within the space. The minimum tenability for visibility was determined to be 10 meters. Jin suggests that the criteria for visibility range from 13 ft to 46 ft (4 m to 14 m). Jin suggests a tenability limit of 10 m (33 ft) for occupants unfamiliar with a building based on his studies of people exposed to smoke. 10 m (33 ft) seems like a reasonable selection criteria for limiting visibility criterion in a non-complex building with reasonably sized rooms and square footage of the building. The minimum tenability for both the Oxbow building and the conference room on the first floor was determined due to this rational because there are periodic tours of the building and visitors that tend to join conferences within the conference room on the first floor. The minimum tenability requirement for CO concentrations was 0. 1 FED. This value was conservative enough for very low chances of affecting personnel that were sensitive to either toxic gases or asphyxiation because there are other contaminates in addition to CO concentration produced in fires depending on the materials burnt. “Hartzell [2] states that a (Ct) CO of 35, 000 ppm×min has the potential to cause serious harm to many occupants and therefore (Ct) CO = 35, 000 ppm×min would be a reasonable representation of an FED of 1. 0. If LC 50 data for rats is used, the value is 171, 000 ppm min. ” The value of 35, 000 was determined to be 1. 0 in this example. Using 35, 000 ppm, 0. 1 FED was determined to 1, 166 ppm of total exposure. The minimum tenability requirement for air temperature was determined to be 60 ° C. An exposure to a temperature of 60 º C was determined to be the worst case tenable condition for this fire model because exposure to a temperature of 60 º C air for 1 second will produce pain and 10 seconds or more will produce burns. The atrium based fire scenario shows that the building can be fully egressed with the all three of minimum required tenable requirements for visibility, CO concentration, and air temperature. Whereas, the fire scenario for egressing the conference room had visibility and CO concentration tenability issues. The analysis has determined the following conclusions and recommendations for meeting the IBC, 2015 edition: 1) The number of doors exiting the large conference room is not adequate. Recommendation: Add doors on the far sides of the conference room and include a type of interlock to the room separators to only allow one to be used at a given time. 2) Smoke detectors were not installed near the Fire Alarm <b>Control</b> Panel (FACP), <b>transponder</b> panels, and the Notification Appliance Circuit (NAC) panels. Recommendation: If feasible, install smoke detectors in these locations. At minimum, a smoke detector should be installed near the FACP. 3) Heavy timber columns were installed in the atrium area. Recommendation: Verify waver from fire marshal for construction. If waver was not obtained, the heavy timber beams may need to be encased, replaced, or another alternative acceptable by the fire marshal...|$|R
