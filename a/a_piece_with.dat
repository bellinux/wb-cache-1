5|$|Artist Matthew Ritchie was {{commissioned}} to create {{much of the}} building's artwork. One piece is a metal sculpture located on the exterior in the courtyard that mimics the nearby Willamette River's watershed, and includes metal spheres attached to the line shaped metal. The other main piece of art is <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> two lightboxes on the interior that display different images as one moves along the display that uses lenticular glass. Images represent themes {{of the river and}} of legal history.|$|E
5|$|Seneb's {{dwarfism}} {{is depicted}} realistically in the sculpture. It portrays {{him with a}} large head but small arms and legs. This possibly indicates that he had achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest-growing {{parts of the body}} – particularly the femur and humerus, which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge. An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – a condition that produces short arms and legs. Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is of <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-five media {{commentators}} {{were interviewed}} for the film. Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, The Big Empty, and had industry credibility as {{executive producer of}} Napoleon Dynamite. Anderson said he intended to select interviewees {{with a variety of}} perspectives, conservative as well as liberal. He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone {{was among the first to}} confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> Boone about eight years before starting work on Fuck. After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on Fuck, it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.|$|E

[...] He also struck up a friendship with an anti-war leader, David Ifshin, who had once traveled to Hanoi to make an anti-American propaganda broadcast that McCain had heard in his cell.|$|E
500|$|The Bb4 is {{attacked}} but Black {{can play}} 7...Ngxe5 {{to get the}} gambitted pawn back, as 8.axb4?? would allow the Kieninger trap 8...Nd3 mate (see the section [...] "Kieninger trap").

Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 Qxe5, so he usually plays 9.e3 {{in order to protect the}} c4-pawn and defuse the mating threat, so that now Black is obliged to move his Bb4. As 9...Bd6 would misplace the bishop and 9...Ba5?? would lose the bishop to 10.b4 Bb6 11.c5, Black usually plays 9...Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2.|$|E

500|$|The Kieninger Trap {{is named}} after Georg Kieninger who used it in an offhand game against Godai at Vienna in 1925. It occurs in the Rubinstein {{variation}} 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3. The Bb4 is attacked but Black {{does not have to}} move it for the moment, and instead both regains the gambit pawn and sets a trap with 7...Ngxe5 (see diagram at right). Superficially, White seems to win <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> 8.axb4??, but that would be falling into the Kieninger Trap because it would allow 8...Nd3 mate; even after the exchange 8.Nxe5 Nxe5, the threat of ...Nd3 mate remains and indirectly defends the Bb4 from capture.|$|E
500|$|According to Shani D'Cruze of the Feminist Crime Research Network, {{the fact}} that she was Irish was a {{significant}} factor in the widespread revulsion felt towards Webster in Great Britain. Many Irish people had emigrated to England since the Great Famine of 1849, but met widespread prejudice and persistent associations with criminality and drunkenness. The Irish were at worst depicted as bestial and subhuman, and there were repeated episodes of violence between Irish and English workers as well as attacks by Fenians (Irish nationalists) in England. The demonisation of Webster as [...] "hardly human", as O'Donnell put it, was of <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> the public and judicial perceptions of the Irish as innately criminal.|$|E

[...] Given that Justice Samuel Chase was acquitted by the Senate in his impeachment case on March 1, 1805, the day before the release of the More decision, [...] "ne can imagine John Marshall passing a sigh of relief as he handed down the judgment in More." [...] "he dismissal of More marked the end of Federalist efforts to obtain a Supreme Court ruling, directly or by implication, that the repeal of the 1801 Judiciary Act was unconstitutional. [...] "More is of <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> Marbury and Stuart v. Laird in its avoidance of an opportunity for an open clash with political critics of the courts.

500|$|Axelrod and his musicians used key musical {{phrases that}} are {{expanded}} upon throughout Song of Innocence. He {{was interested in}} György Ligeti's 1961 piece Atmosphères and Lukas Foss' idea of starting <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> a sustained chord, having musicians improvise over 100bars, and ending with another chord as they finish. [...] "Urizen" [...] opened with long sustained chords, sound effects, reverbed guitar stabs, and a supple bassline. On [...] "Holy Thursday", the rhythm section played a slow, jazzed-out groove and bluesy bop piano lines, as a big band vamp was played by a large-scale string section. In response to their swing style, the brass section and guitarists played dramatic, high-pitched overtones built around a complex melody. The middle of the album featured more traditional jazz passages {{and the presence of}} a psychedelic harpsichord. [...] "The Smile" [...] was recorded with a rhythmic drum beat, offbeat bass, and a progressive string part. For the songs near the end, the musicians steadily transitioned to heady psychedelia featuring gritty guitars and disorienting organ licks. On [...] "The Mental Traveler", Axelrod said he tried to experiment with atonality but [...] "chickened out".|$|E
500|$|Having {{awarded the}} album {{a score of}} nine out of ten, the {{reviewer}} for NME said, [...] "At no point does [...] rock. It glides with a beautiful, uninhibited momentum." [...] The reviewer described McCulloch's voice as an [...] "instrument honed by years of life, love and all the shitty bits in between to a ravishing state of molten cashmere" [...] and the album as [...] "flawless" [...] for every [...] "second of its defiantly brief 38-and-a-half minutes". M. Tye Comer for CMJ said, [...] " [...] revisit the melancholia they've tussled with for nearly 20 years with a mature soul and a romantic urgency, having grown up without growing old." [...] Awarding the album {{four out of five}} stars, Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing for Allmusic said the album [...] "feels of <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> their earlier albums, not only sonically, but in terms of quality." [...] Mark Richard-San for Pitchfork Media said, [...] "The over-the-top, bass-driven rockers of yore have been replaced with an album of introspective, acoustic songs appropriate for these aging geezers." [...] Richard-San also described McCulloch as having a [...] "rich, resonant voice", adding [...] "the quality of his singing is perfect – a weary voice transmitting from some abandoned studio of yesteryear." ...|$|E
500|$|Though much of {{his work}} was made public only years later, Charles Ives had been {{exploring}} the possibilities of the tone cluster—which he {{referred to as the}} [...] "group chord"—for some time. In 1906–7, Ives composed his first mature piece to extensively feature tone clusters, Scherzo: Over the Pavements. Orchestrated for a nine-piece ensemble, it includes both black- and white-note clusters for the piano. Revised in 1913, it would not be recorded and published until the 1950s and would have to wait until 1963 to receive its first public performance. During the same period that Ornstein was introducing tone clusters to the concert stage, Ives was developing <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>with</b> what would become the most famous set of clusters: in the second movement, [...] "Hawthorne," [...] of the Concord Sonata ( [...] 1904–15, publ. 1920, prem. 1928, rev. 1947), mammoth piano chords require a wooden bar almost fifteen inches long to play. The gentle clusters produced by the felt- or flannel-covered bar represent the sound of far-off church bells (...) [...] Later in the movement, there are a series of five-note diatonic clusters for the right hand. In his notes to the score, Ives indicates that [...] "these group-chords...may, if the player feels like it, be hit with the clenched fist." [...] Between 1911 and 1913, Ives also wrote ensemble pieces with tone clusters such as his Second String Quartet and the orchestral Decoration Day and Fourth of July, though none of these would be publicly performed before the 1930s.|$|E
