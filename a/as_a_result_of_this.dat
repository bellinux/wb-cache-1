5|$|Between 1951 and 1960 a {{national}} service scheme had operated and {{during this time}} the CMF's numbers remained reasonably steady. However, in 1960 the scheme was suspended and the Australian Army was reorganised {{with the introduction of}} the Pentropic divisional structure. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> the CMF was greatly reduced and 14 infantry battalions were disbanded altogether, while many others were amalgamated into the battalions of the six sequentially numbered multi-battalion State-based regiments. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> on 1 July 1960, the 2nd Battalion became part of the Royal New South Wales Regiment, and was reduced to a company-sized element of the Pentropic 2nd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (2 RNSWR), forming 'C' Company (City of Newcastle Company). Just prior to this, on 30 April 1960, the battalion had been afforded the Freedom of the City of Newcastle.|$|E

50|$|Complications {{may occur}} {{immediately}} following the myocardial infarction or may take time to develop. Disturbances of heart rhythms, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation and heart block can arise <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> ischemia, cardiac scarring, and infarct location. Stroke is also <b>a</b> risk, either <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> clots transmitted from the heart during PCI, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> bleeding following anticoagulation, or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> disturbances in the heart's ability to pump effectively <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the infarction. Regurgitation of blood through the mitral valve is possible, particularly if the infarction causes dysfunction of the papillary muscle. Cardiogenic shock <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the heart being unable to adequately pump blood may develop, dependent on infarct size, and {{is most likely to}} occur within the days following an acute myocardial infarction. Cardiogenic shock is the largest cause of in-hospital mortality. Rupture of the ventricular dividing wall or left ventricular wall may occur within the initial weeks. Dressler's syndrome, a reaction following larger infarcts and a cause of pericarditis is also possible.|$|R

By 1994, jurisdiction of the portion of SR 605 between SR 37 and the US 36/SR 3 concurrency was transferred from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to Delaware County, who renamed the road to County Road 605. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> move, SR 605 took on the routing that it does today.|$|E
