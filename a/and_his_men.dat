5|$|After {{some hard}} {{fighting}} at the Jabiya Gate, commander Abu Ubaidah <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>men,</b> repulsed the sally and the Byzantines hastened {{back to the}} city. The battle was intense at the Small Gate, which was guarded by commander Yazid <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>men.</b> Yazid had fewer troops but Dharar came to Yazid's aid with his 2,000 cavalry of the Mobile Guard. The cavalry attacked the flank of the Byzantine sortie force and repulsed the sally.|$|E
5|$|Amésqueta was {{extremely}} {{suspicious of the}} small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjK'ixaw had betrayed them {{and that this was}} precisely what had happened to Díaz <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>men.</b> As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and with no sign of Díaz <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>men,</b> Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of the}} morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches. They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies. The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4miles or 37.7km) north of Mopan.|$|E

5|$|After this, the Spartans {{sent out}} a new commander, Anaxibius, to Abydos. For a time, he enjoyed a number of successes against Pharnabazus, and seized a number of Athenian {{merchant}} ships. Worried that Thrasybulus's accomplishments were being undermined, the Athenians sent Iphicrates to the region to confront Anaxibius. For a time, the two forces merely raided each other's territory, but eventually Iphicrates succeeded in guessing where Anaxibius would bring his troops on a return march from a campaign against Antandrus, and ambushed the Spartan force. When Anaxibius <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>men,</b> who were strung out {{in the line of}} march, had entered the rough, mountainous terrain in which Iphicrates <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> were waiting, the Athenians emerged and ambushed them, killing Anaxibius and many others.|$|E

5|$|At 07:00 on {{the morning}} of 25 November, the Portuguese {{garrison}} at Ngomano received word from a British intelligence officer that an attack was about to commence. Nevertheless, when the attack came they were unprepared. In order to distract Pinto <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>men,</b> the Germans shelled the camp from across the river with high explosive rounds. While the artillery attacked the camp, the Germans moved their forces upstream and crossed the Rovuma safely out sight of Pinto <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>men.</b> The Portuguese did not resist von Lettow-Vorbeck's forces when they crossed the river and remained encamped at Ngomano. The Germans were easily able to flank the Portuguese positions and completely envelop them with six companies of German infantry attacking the camp from the south, south-east and west.|$|E

5|$|Clark's men easily {{captured}} Vincennes and Fort Sackville. Prior {{to their}} arrival in 1778, Clark had sent Captain Leonard Helm to Vincennes to gather intelligence. In addition, Father Pierre Gibault, a local priest, helped persuade the town's inhabitants {{to side with}} the Americans. Before Clark <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> set out to recapture Vincennes in 1779, Francis Vigo provided Clark with additional information on the town, its surrounding area, and the fort. Clark was already aware of the fort's military strength, poor location (surrounded by houses that could provide cover), and dilapidated condition before his arrival. Clark's strategy of a surprise attack and strong intelligence were critical in catching Hamilton <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> unaware and vulnerable.After hatcheting five captive Indians to death within view of the fort, Clark forced its surrender.|$|E
