5|$|In 1914 while {{designing}} the residence {{after the first}} devastating fire, Wright received a sympathetic letter from Miriam Noel, a fan of his architecture. Wright exchanged correspondence with the wealthy divorcee and met with her at his Chicago office. Wright was quickly infatuated, and the two began a relationship. By Spring 1915, Taliesin II was completed and Noel moved there with Wright. Wright's first wife Catherine finally granted him a divorce in 1922, meaning that Wright could marry Noel a year later. Although Wright admired Noel's erratic personality at first, her behavior (later identified as schizophrenia) led to <b>a</b> <b>miserable</b> life together at Taliesin. They married in November, 1923, but Noel left Wright {{by the spring of}} 1924.|$|E
5|$|Mulan was {{originally}} conceived as an animated short in 1994, {{in which the}} heroine is depicted as <b>a</b> <b>miserable</b> Chinese girl who elopes to the West {{to be with a}} British prince. While developing a series of treatments based on traditional stories and folk tales, children's book author Robert D. San Souci discovered the Ballad of Mulan, an ancient Chinese poem about Hua Mulan – a Chinese woman who replaces her ailing father in the army by disguising herself as a man. Fascinated by Hua Mulan's story, San Souci suggested the poem to Disney; the studio hired San Souci himself to write the film's treatment and story.|$|E

Jillian, however, tells Brian (gently) that he had his chance and blew it, as she decided to move on and he needs to as well. Brian is now <b>a</b> <b>miserable,</b> single dog, unable even to go back to Lauren, who has dumped him because he gave her worms.|$|E

5|$|The {{evening of}} April 6 was a dispiriting {{end to the}} first day of one of the bloodiest battles in American history. The cries of wounded and dying men on the fields between the armies could be heard in the Union and Confederate camps {{throughout}} the night. Exhausted Confederate soldiers bedded down in the abandoned Union camps. The Union troops were pushed back to the river and the junction of the River (Hamburg–Savannah Road) and the Corinth-Pittsburg Landing Roads. Around 10 p.m. a thunderstorm passed through the area. Coupled with the continuous shelling from the Union gunboats Lexington and Tyler, it made the night <b>a</b> <b>miserable</b> experience for both sides.|$|E

With Kevin still away, Noah calls Claire over to help him cook. She ends up having dinner with him, during which he unashamedly flirts with her. Despite Claire's hesitation, she lets Noah seduce her and they have sex. Claire tells Noah that she regrets their night together, causing him to punch a wall in rage. The school year begins, with Noah joining an uncomfortable Claire's class after hacking into her computer, making it appear {{as if she had}} {{requested}} this.

Later, Kevin overexerts himself at the gymnasium and goes into shock; Noah saves his life by injecting him with Kevin's EpiPen. Claire receives flowers from Noah, and she confronts him about this. Noah witnesses Claire and Garrett on a date together, which escalates his obsession with her.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007 World Cup England {{played in}} Pool A with Samoa, Tonga, South Africa and the United States.

England won 14–9 {{to qualify for the}} final against South Africa, which they lost 15–6. England followed up the World Cup with two consecutive 2nd place finishes in the Six Nations, behind Wales and Ireland respectively. The 2009 Six Nations also saw former England Captain Martin Johnson take up the job of head coach. However, Johnson could not replicate his on-field success to management, and resigned in November 2011 following <b>a</b> <b>miserable</b> 2011 Rugby World Cup which ended in quarter-final defeat by France and featured a series of on and off-field controversies.|$|E
