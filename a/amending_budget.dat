50|$|The agency {{initially}} {{struggled to}} recruit staff due to its location in Warsaw, which offered lower pay than some other cities, and the unclear agency mandate. According to its third <b>amended</b> <b>Budget</b> 2015, the agency had in that year 336 employees. Additionally it could make use of 78 employees which had been seconded from the member states. The dependency of the organisation on staff secondments has been identified by external auditors as a risk, since valuable experience may be lost when such staff leave the organisation and return to their permanent jobs.|$|R

With the threshold lowered from 60 votes {{for a constitutional amendment}} to 51 votes for a statute, the House of Representatives passed the expanded gambling bill, but the measure died in the Republican-dominated Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee by a 10–5 vote.

50|$|The Assembly {{eventually}} {{agreed to}} raise the sales tax by {{half a percentage point}} instead of the one percentage increase requested in the budget approved by the board of legislators, and the record $1.4 billion spending plan adopted by the County legislature in December had included an 8.5 percent increase in the property-tax levy and assumed that additional revenues would come from the sales-tax increase. In early 2004, Kaplowitz voted in favor of the <b>amended</b> <b>budget</b> which raised county property tax collections by an additional 10 percent from the amount approved in December to offset the budget gap from the diminished sales tax increase, and when the measure passed, Westchester County ended with 18.82 percent more in property taxes during 2004 than it did in 2003.|$|R

40|$|According to an {{influential}} theoretical argument, presidential systems tend to present smaller governments because {{the separation between}} those who decide {{the size of the}} fiscal purse and those who allocate it creates incentives for lower public expenditures. In practice, forms of government vary greatly, and budget institutions -the rules according to which budgets are drafted, approved, and implemented- are one (of many) drivers of such variation. This paper argues that under more hierarchical budget rules, presidential and parliamentary systems generate a similar incentive structure for the executive branch in shaping the size of government. This hypothesis is tested on a broad cross-section of countries, presidentialism is found to {{have a negative impact on}} government size only when executive discretion in the budget process is low (that is, in a context of separation of powers). However, the negative effect of presidentialism on expenditures vanishes or is even reversed when the executive`s discretion over the budget process is higher. Hence, budget institutions that impose restrictions on the legislature`s ability to <b>amend</b> <b>budget</b> proposals can make political regimes look more alike in terms of fiscal outcomes. ...|$|R
