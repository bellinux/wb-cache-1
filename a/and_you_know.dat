5|$|I think I can't {{be happy}} if I'm the only one that's getting {{published}} by Random House when I know there are such magnificent writers – both Latinos and Latinas, both Chicanos and Chicanas – in the U.S. whose books are not published by mainstream presses or whom the mainstream isn't even aware of. <b>And,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> if my success means that other presses will {{take a second look}} at these writers... and publish them in larger numbers, then our ship will come in.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

25|$|I {{always had}} the feeling that no one {{understood}} me anyway, that no one knew who I was and what made me do this or that. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E
25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. <b>And,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles <b>and,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E

25|$|In a December 2015 {{interview}} with BBC Radio 4's Today programme Ahern said low pay workers had brought country {{to its knees}} because they got “cocky” and insisted on “second, third and even fourth homes”. The former Taoiseach said that the availability of cheap credit through Ireland's involvement in the eurozone created “a huge problem”. “Anyone could walk into any institution and seem to get any amount of money {{and this is where}} the cocky bit came in. “Unfortunately… Joe Soap and Mary Soap, who never had a lot, got the loans for the second house and leveraged the third house off the second house and the fourth on the third, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> what are you having yourself.” People, among them those who had previously regarded the former Taoiseach highly, took to social media and the airwaves to criticise Ahern for his remarks.|$|E
25|$|The fell is very rugged {{with several}} small tops along {{the summit of}} the ridge. At the {{northern}} end is a peaked summit at 1,971ft (601m), very prominent from the valley below. Alfred Wainwright took this as {{the summit of the}} fell in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, even though he readily acknowledged that it wasn't the highest point. This is one of many subjective decisions which differentiate Wainwrights from more modern (and logical) hill lists such as Nuttalls and Hewitts. Wainwright stated that the 1,971ft top was generally regarded as the summit of the fell, although he cited no references. Other guidebooks have taken Wainwright's lead, Mark Richards stating Stand upon that (northern) pike <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> why tradition has ordained this to be the summit. The view down Borrowdale is peerless. A new generation of fellwalkers may arrive seeking to overthrow the traditional perception and feeling no compunction at adopting the highest ground as a summit. Richards does at least acknowledge the highest point as a top, as does Birkett, who gives equal status to both.|$|E

500|$|... "I wrote a song a {{while back}} even before [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] {{and it was not}} my {{favorite}} song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E

500|$|Basically we {{were having}} a laugh at a lot of the {{different}} articles that were appearing at that time in different magazines and papers, and they were talking about 'Pop Kylie, Dance Kylie, Sex Kylie' <b>and,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> with every different release of a single they'd say 'What Kylie is it now?' and it was just becoming a joke.

500|$|In {{academic}} works, {{the diversity}} of the Spectrum personnel in terms of both race and gender has been viewed highly. Bould praises the series for its [...] "beautiful, multiethnic, female Angel fighter pilots" [...] and [...] "secondary roles played by capable women." [...] In an interview conducted in 2003, Anderson confirmed that a conscious effort was made to feature ethnic minorities: [...] "...I think people who make television programmes have a responsibility, particularly when children are watching avidly <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> their minds can be affected almost irreversibly as they grow up.We were very conscious of introducing different ethnic backgrounds." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cosas De La Vida" [...] (Things of Life) is {{a romantic}} {{tropical}} bachata ballad, infused with R rhythms: [...] "They {{are the things}} of life, don't ask me for an explanation, our love is first, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> my heart is yours. For the sake of us two, fight for our love against temptation". The track features Queen and Dominican bachata singer Frank Reyes; she expressed her love for the song (and bachata in general), calling it a genre where [...] "men express themselves with women". The minor-key [...] "Cansada" [...] (Tired) showcases Queen's rapping skills, featuring techno synthesizers. Frances Tirado of Primera Hora described it as [...] "pegajosa" [...] ("addictive").|$|E
500|$|... "I {{loved that}} song. It was {{actually}} Rick Rubin's suggestion.

And I love the way it came out, and I think probably the rest of the band really does not like it, and that’s probably why it didn’t make our fifth record, in 2005 when we were recording it." ...|$|E
