It has also been suggested by some authors, including Bill Bryson in A Short History of Nearly Everything, that Owen even used his influence in the Royal Society to ensure that many of Mantell’s research papers were never published. Owen was finally dismissed from the Royal Society's Zoological Council for plagiarism.|$|E
25|$|M's profits {{peaked in}} the {{financial}} year 1997/1998. At {{the time it was}} seen as a continuing success story, but with hindsight it is considered that during Sir Richard Greenbury's tenure as head of the company, profit margins were pushed to untenable levels, and the loyalty of its customers was seriously eroded. The rising cost of using British suppliers was also a burden, as rival retailers increasingly imported their goods from low-cost countries, but M's belated switch to overseas suppliers undermined a core part of its appeal to the public. Another factor was the company's refusal until 2001 to accept <b>any</b> <b>credit</b> cards except its own chargecard.|$|E

25|$|Groove recordings, first {{designed}} in the final quarter of the 19th century, held a predominant position for nearly a century—withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape, the 8-track cartridge, and the compact cassette. In 1988, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles. First the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing <b>any</b> <b>credit</b> at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining {{the availability of the}} format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies.|$|E

500|$|The {{origins of}} the crash disk are {{uncertain}} because of significant irregularities and gaps, noted in the NTSB report, in the manufacturing records of GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE) and its suppliers. [...] Records found after the accident indicated that two rough-machined forgings having the serial number of the crash disk had been routed through GEAE manufacturing. Records indicated that Alcoa supplied GE with TIMET titanium forgings for one disk with the serial number of the crash disk. Some records show that this disk “was rejected for an unsatisfactory ultrasonic indication”, that an outside lab performed an ultrasound inspection of this disk, that this disk was subsequently returned to GE, and that this disk should have been scrapped. [...] The FAA report stated “There is no record of warranty claim by GEAE for defective material and no record of <b>any</b> <b>credit</b> for GEAE processed by Alcoa or TIMET”.|$|E

On March 7, 2007, Schlafly was interviewed on BBC Radio 4's flagship morning show, Today, opposite Wikipedia administrator Jim Redmond. Schlafly raised several concerns: that the article on the Renaissance does not give <b>any</b> <b>credit</b> to Christianity, that Wikipedia articles apparently prefer to use non-American spellings even though most users are American, that the article on American activities in the Philippines has a distinctly anti-American bias, and that attempts to include pro-Christian or pro-American views are removed very quickly. Schlafly also claimed that Wikipedia's allowance of both Common Era and Anno Domini notation was anti-Christian bias.|$|E
500|$|In November 1997, Massot began {{preparing}} a director's cut of Wonderwall, which omitted {{many of the}} musical cues that {{had appeared in the}} original film but not on the soundtrack album, and instead repeated tracks such as [...] "Ski-ing" [...] and [...] "Cowboy Music" [...] at different points in the film. Harrison supplied Massot with a tape containing various pieces recorded for Wonderwall, which led to the unearthing of the Remo Four's [...] "In the First Place". A Manley–Ashton composition, [...] "In the First Place" [...] was released as a single in January 1999 with Harrison credited as producer, after Massot had incorporated the song into his new audio for the film. Harrison had played on the recording, but according to an article by Martin Lewis, he eschewed <b>any</b> <b>credit</b> as a performer. In March 2014, Harrison's full soundtrack was made available on DVD when the original cut of the film was included in the two-disc set Wonderwall Collector's Edition.|$|E

500|$|The Association {{called an}} end to the Harvest Campaign as of March 31, 1926, most likely because the sales did not justify the {{continued}} salary expenses. [...] Coins remaining at banks were to be sent to the Federal Reserve, and <b>any</b> <b>credit</b> balances remitted to the Association. [...] Thereafter, coins were available either through the Association or the Federal Reserve at an increased price of $2. With a price increase and the end to the campaign, sales plummeted. Total sales from the Harvest Campaign were about 430,000 pieces. One exception to the drop in sales was a drive in New York under the sponsorship of Mayor Jimmy Walker, which succeeded in selling 250,000 coins in 1926, though at the original price of one dollar. [...] Bernard Baruch, then a prominent investor and later a counselor of presidents, was honorary chairman of the organizing committee, and personally subscribed for some of the pieces.|$|E
500|$|The ship {{stopped in}} New London, Connecticut, {{to pick up}} a {{replacement}} assistant engineer, leaving on July 3, 1871. By the time the ship reached St. John's, there was dissension among the officers and scientific staff. Bessels, backed up by Meyer, had openly rejected Hall's command over the scientific staff. The dissension spread to the crew, which was divided along nationalist lines. In his diary, Assistant Navigator George Tyson wrote that {{by the time they reached}} Disko Island, Greenland, [...] "...expressions are freely made that Hall shall not get <b>any</b> <b>credit</b> from this expedition. Already some have made up their minds how far they will go and when they will get home again." [...] Hall asked Captain Davenport of the supply ship Congress to intervene. Davenport threatened to have Meyer shackled for insubordination and sent back to the United States, at which point all of the Germans threatened to quit. Hall and Davenport were forced to back down, however Davenport delivered a strongly worded speech on naval discipline to the crew.|$|E
500|$|They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, {{followed}} by {{three days of}} rehearsals at Black Island Studios. The sessions were problematic, with minor disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order decided {{on the eve of}} the event.

[...] At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage. Waters then called him back, and the band shared a group hug.
