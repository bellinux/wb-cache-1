Conditions increasing the likelihood of aflatoxicosis in humans include limited availability of food, environmental conditions that favour mould growth on foodstuffs, and lack of regulatory systems for aflatoxin monitoring and control.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Hepatic abscesses {{have been}} {{reported}} as a rare complication of diverticulitis of the bowel. This complication is recognized more commonly {{at the time of}} the diagnosis of diverticulitis, or ruptured diverticula, but also can be diagnosed prior to surgery, or postoperatively. Case presentation This report describes a man who developed <b>an</b> <b>hepatic</b> abscess within <b>a</b> simple <b>hepatic</b> cyst, two months after operation for ruptured diverticula of the sigmoid colon. The abscess was drained surgically and the patient made a complete recovery. Conclusion The development of <b>an</b> <b>hepatic</b> abscess in <b>a</b> pre-existing <b>hepatic</b> cyst, secondary to diverticulitis, is a rare complication. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required for immediate diagnosis and treatment. </p...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{the second part of}} a {{comprehensive}} review of the arterial blood supply of the pancreas and deals with the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. The aim of this review is to summarise the anatomical studies, starting from Haller's reports, and to supply as far as possible, with original material, angiographic evidences for the classic anatomical notions. For this purpose, the overall research was carried out by picking out and studying 1015 selective angiographies (celiac trunk and its branches, superior mesenteric a.) taken from the angiographic archives of the Institutes of Radiology of Siena, Rome (University of Sacro Cuore, Catholic University), and Perugia. Angiographically, many possible different sources of the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal a.

Moreover, the authors underline the discordant opinions still existing regarding the incidence of the different ways the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal a. arises...|$|R
25|$|Bromazepam is {{reported}} to be metabolized by <b>a</b> <b>hepatic</b> enzyme belonging to the Cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. In 2003, a team led by Dr. Oda Manami at Oita Medical University reported that CYP3A4, a member of the Cytochrome P450 family, was not the responsible enzyme since itraconazole, a known inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not affect its metabolism. In 1995, J. van Harten at Solvay Duphar B.V.'s Department of Clinical Pharmacology in Weesp reported that fluvoxamine, which is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, a less potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, and a negligible inhibitor of CYP2D6, does inhibit its metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have claimed}} that, without avian air sacs, modest {{improvements}} {{in a few}} aspects of a modern reptile's circulatory and respiratory systems would enable the reptile to achieve 50% to 70% of the oxygen flow of a mammal of similar size, and that lack of avian air sacs would not prevent the development of endothermy. Very few formal rebuttals {{have been published in}} scientific journals of Ruben et al.s claim that dinosaurs could not have had avian-style air sacs; but one points out that the Sinosauropteryx fossil on which they based much of their argument was severely flattened and therefore {{it was impossible to tell}} whether the liver was the right shape to act as part of <b>a</b> <b>hepatic</b> piston mechanism. Some recent papers simply note without further comment that Ruben et al. argued against the presence of air sacs in dinosaurs.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin K is an {{essential}} factor to <b>a</b> <b>hepatic</b> gamma-glutamyl carboxylase that adds a carboxyl group to glutamic acid residues on factors II, VII, IX and X, as well as Protein S, Protein C and Protein Z. In adding the gamma-carboxyl group to glutamate residues on the immature clotting factors Vitamin K is itself oxidized. Another enzyme, Vitamin K epoxide reductase, (VKORC) reduces vitamin K back to its active form. Vitamin K epoxide reductase is pharmacologically important as a target of anticoagulant drugs warfarin and related coumarins such as acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, and dicumarol. These drugs create a deficiency of reduced vitamin K by blocking VKORC, thereby inhibiting maturation of clotting factors. Vitamin K deficiency from other causes (e.g., in malabsorption) or impaired vitamin K metabolism in disease (e.g., in liver failure) lead {{to the formation of}} PIVKAs (proteins formed in vitamin K absence) which are partially or totally non-gamma carboxylated, affecting the coagulation factors' ability to bind to phospholipid.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To compare <b>a</b> {{histological}} <b>hepatic</b> iron index with <b>a</b> biochemical <b>hepatic</b> iron index, {{derived from}} {{atomic absorption spectroscopy}} measurements of hepatic iron content, for the diagnosis of genetic haemochromatosis (GH). METHODS: Histological sections of liver biopsy specimens from 70 subjects, who had previously had their biochemical hepatic iron index measured, were examined. The iron stores were scored to derive <b>a</b> histological <b>hepatic</b> iron index and were also graded from 0 to 4 by a standard grading system. The case history of each patient was then reviewed to establish a definitive clinical diagnosis and patients were classified as GH, non-GH or indeterminate. RESULTS: There were 26 cases of GH, 40 cases of non-GH and four indeterminate cases in whom a definite clinical diagnosis was not established. Using <b>a</b> biochemical <b>hepatic</b> iron index cut off level of 2. 0, two cases were misclassified, with one case of GH having <b>a</b> biochemical <b>hepatic</b> iron index of 1. 8 and one non-GH case having <b>a</b> biochemical <b>hepatic</b> iron index of 3. 1. This {{could not have been}} improved by altering the cut off level. Using the recommended cut off level of 0. 15, the histological hepatic iron index was raised in all cases of GH, but was also increased in 11 of the 40 non-GH patients. The specificity of this histological index can be improved by increasing the cut off level to 0. 30. A histological iron grade of > or = 3 is more specific than the histological index but has a lower sensitivity, which particularly affects the diagnosis of younger patients with GH. CONCLUSIONS: The biochemical hepatic iron index is a reliable method for establishing a diagnosis of homozygous GH. In contrast, the histological hepatic iron index as originally described is non-specific and does not reliably distinguish patients with GH from others with <b>a</b> raised <b>hepatic</b> iron index due to other causes. The specificity of this index can be improved by increasing the cut off level used, but the discrimination provided by the histological index is still inferior to that provided by the biochemical hepatic iron index...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} long-term survival and prognostic factors for radio-frequency ablation (RFA) in colorectal liver metastases. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 35 colorectal liver metastases patients who underwent RFA between 2004 and 2008. We analyzed survival after RFA and prognostic factors for survival. Results: Of the 35 patients, 23 patients were male and 12 were female. Their mean age was 62. 40 ± 12. 52 years. Mean overall survival was 38. 8 ± 4. 6 months, and mean progression free survival was 19. 9 ± 3. 4 months. Three- and 5 -year overall survival rates were 42. 7 ± 0. 1 % and 26. 0 ± 0. 1 %, respectively. Three- and 5 -year progression-free survival rates were 19. 6 ± 0. 1 % and 4. 9 ± 0. 04 %, respectively. Overall survival and progression-free survival were significantly improved in male and in patients with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) ≤ 100 ng/mL, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19 - 9 ≤ 100 ng/mL, absence of extrahepatic disease, and <b>a</b> unilobar <b>hepatic</b> lesion. In addition, progression-free survival was improved in patients with <b>a</b> solitary <b>hepatic</b> lesion. On the multivariate analysis, significant survival factors were the absence of extrahepatic disease and the presence of <b>a</b> unilobar <b>hepatic</b> lesion. Conclusion: RFA for colorectal liver metastases is an effective treatment option in male patients and in patients with CEA or CA 19 - 9 ≤ 100, absence of extrahepatic disease, <b>a</b> solitary <b>hepatic</b> lesion, and <b>a</b> unilobar <b>hepatic</b> lesion...|$|R
