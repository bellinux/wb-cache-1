25|$|Chelmsford had {{underestimated the}} disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and {{confident}} Zulu. The failure to secure an effective defensive position, the poor intelligence {{on the location}} of the main Zulu army, Chelmsford's decision to split his force in half, and the Zulus' tactical exploitation of the terrain and the weaknesses in the British formation, all combined to prove catastrophic for the troops at Isandlwana. In contrast, the Zulus responded to the unexpected discovery of their camp with <b>an</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> spontaneous advance. Even though the indunas would lose control over the advance, the warriors' training allowed the Zulu troops to form their standard attack formation on the run, their battle line deployed in reverse of its intended order.|$|E

25|$|SDUSA's electoral {{strategy}} ("realignment") {{intended to}} organize labor unions, civil rights organizations, and other constituencies into a coalition that would transform the Democratic Party into a social-democratic party.

SDUSA opposed the New Politics of Senator George McGovern, which had lost all states but Massachusetts to Richard Nixon at the 1972 election, when Americans voted for a Democratic House of Representatives in the House elections. While SDUSA had endorsed McGovern, it had adopted resolutions criticizing the New Politics for having made criticisms of labor unions and working-class Americans and for its advocacy of <b>an</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> unconditional U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|In the 1850s, the {{fungal disease}} powdery mildew began to ravage {{vineyards}} in nearby Galicia, {{opening up the}} market up for Rioja bodegas, which had been only slightly affected. The completion of a railway system linking Logroño to Bilbao, Madrid and Irun coincided {{with the onset of}} the phylloxera epidemic in Europe. The French were the first and hardest hit by the louse, which created <b>an</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> insatiable demand for all the wine the Rioja could produce. Amidst devastation in the French wine industry, dozens of négociant and French winemakers, mostly from Bordeaux, traveled to the Rioja to set up wineries, where they could continue to produce wine – bringing with them extensive knowledge, techniques and experience. This ushered in a period of unprecedented growth and prosperity for the Rioja wine industry.|$|E

While Anne and Emily's novels 'lingered in the press', Jane Eyre was <b>an</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> resounding success. Anne and Emily were obliged to pay fifty pounds to help meet their publishing costs. Their publisher, urged on by the success of Jane Eyre, published Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey in December 1847. They sold well, but Agnes Grey was outshone by Emily's more dramatic Wuthering Heights.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{during the}} early 1960s, there were several scandals in California {{involving}} county assessors. These assessors were found rewarding friends and allies with artificially low assessments, with tax bills to match. These scandals led {{to the passage of}} AB 80 in 1966, which imposed standards to hold assessments to market value. The return to market value in the wake of AB 80 could easily represent a mid-double-digit percentage increase in assessment for many homeowners. As a result, a large number of California homeowners experienced <b>an</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>and</b> drastic rise in valuation, simultaneous with rising tax rates on that assessed value, only to be told that the taxed monies would be redistributed to distant communities. The ensuing anger started to form into a backlash against property taxes which coalesced around Howard Jarvis, a former newspaperman and appliance manufacturer, turned taxpayer activist in retirement.|$|E
