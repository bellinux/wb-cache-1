5|$|The obverse {{is similar}} to coins from Merovingian France, {{especially}} from the southern parts, as well as showing influences from Visigothic Spain. The reverse side, however, has no known predecessors in Merovingian or Visigothic coinage. Although by the late 6th century, Merovingian and Visigothic kings were putting their names on their coins, no surviving coins from either kingdom name a bishop. The design of the figure is derived from Byzantine imperial coins, and the cross itself is large and closely resembles an <b>altar</b> <b>cross.</b>|$|E

50|$|The crown is {{decorated}} with 144 precious stones (including sapphires, emeralds and amethysts) (green and blue precious stones being proper to emperors in Byzantine imperial protocol) and {{about the same number}} of pearls. Similar gem-studded styles of decoration were used for precious objects of a number of types at this period, in particular religious ones such as reliquaries, crux gemmata or, processional or <b>altar</b> <b>crosses</b> such as the Cross of Lothair, and book-covers such as that of the Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram and Codex Aureus of Echternach.|$|R

25|$|During the {{suppression}} of the monasteries All Saints' medieval stained glass was destroyed, as was, in 1561, a rood screen with its attached gilded crucifix and figures of Mary and St John, and the Easter Sepulchre.

5000|$|A {{processional cross}} is a {{crucifix}} or cross which is carried in Christian processions. [...] Such crosses {{have a long}} history: the Gregorian mission of Saint Augustine of Canterbury to England carried one before them [...] "like a standard", according to Bede. Other sources suggest that all churches were expected to possess one. They became detachable from their staffs, so that the earliest <b>altar</b> <b>crosses</b> were processional crosses placed on a stand {{at the end of}} the procession. In large churches the [...] "crux gemmata", or richly jewelled cross in precious metal, was the preferred style. Notable early examples include the Cross of Justin II (possibly a hanging votive cross originally), Cross of Lothair, and Cross of Cong.|$|R

2500|$|In the West altar crosses and processional crosses {{began to}} be crucifixes in the 11th century, which became general around the 14th century, as they became cheaper. The Roman Rite {{requires}} that [...] "either on the altar or near it, {{there is to be}} a cross, with the figure of Christ crucified upon it, a cross clearly visible to the assembled people. It is desirable that such a cross should remain near the altar even outside of liturgical celebrations, so as to call to mind for the faithful the saving Passion of the Lord." [...] The requirement of the <b>altar</b> <b>cross</b> was also mentioned in pre-1970 editions of the Roman Missal, though not in the original 1570 Roman Missal of Pope Pius V. The Rite of Funerals says that the Gospel Book, the Bible, or a cross (which will generally be in crucifix form) may be placed on the coffin for a Requiem Mass, but a second standing cross is not to be placed near the coffin if the <b>altar</b> <b>cross</b> can be easily seen from the body of the church.|$|E
2500|$|The Cloisters are {{so named}} {{on account of}} the five medieval French cloisters whose {{salvaged}} structures were incorporated into the modern building, and the five thousand objects at the Cloisters are strictly limited to medieval European works.

2500|$|Usually a Presbyterian {{church will}} not have statues of saints, nor the ornate altar more typical of a Roman Catholic church. Instead, one will find a [...] "communion table," [...] usually {{on the same level}} as the congregation. [...] There may be a rail between the communion table and the [...] "Chancel" [...] behind it, which may contain a more {{decorative}} altar-type table, choir loft, or choir stalls, lectern and clergy area. [...] The altar is called the communion table and the altar area is called the Chancel by Presbyterians. In a Presbyterian (Reformed Church) there may be an <b>altar</b> <b>cross,</b> either on the communion table or on a table in the chancel. By using the [...] "empty" [...] cross, or cross of the resurrection, Presbyterians emphasize the resurrection and that Christ is not continually dying, but died once and is alive for all eternity. Some Presbyterian church buildings are often decorated with a cross that has a circle around the center, or Celtic cross. [...] This not only emphasized the resurrection, but also acknowledges historical aspects of Presbyterianism. [...] A baptismal font will be located either at the entrance or near the chancel area. Presbyterian architecture generally makes significant use of symbolism. You may also find decorative and ornate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the bible. Some Presbyterian churches will also have ornate statues of Christ or Graven Scenes from the Last Supper located behind the Chancel. St. Giles Cathedral ( [...] Church Of Scotland- The Mother Church of Presbyterians) does have a Crucifix next to one of the Pulpits that hangs alongside. The image of Christ is more of faint image and more modern design.|$|E
