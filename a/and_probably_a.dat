Initially, Bury lived in the stable, but later moved into the house. There, he met Ellen Elliot, who was {{employed}} by Martin as a servant <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{say that}} asexual {{reproduction}} {{in the wild}} is rare, <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction {{may have contributed to}} the blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E
5|$|The Sumerian King List (SKL) records a dynasty of six kings from Mari enjoying hegemony {{between the}} dynasty of Adab and the dynasty of Kish. The {{names of the}} Mariote kings were damaged on the early copies of the list, and those kings were {{correlated}} with historical kings {{that belonged to the}} second city. However, an undamaged copy of the list that date to the old Babylonian period was discovered in Shubat-Enlil, and the names bears no resemblance to any of the historically attested monarchs of the second city, indicating that the compilers of the list had an older <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> legendary dynasty in mind, that predate the second city.|$|E

5|$|At {{this time}} the Luftwaffe was sending {{increased}} numbers of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters over England, at night and at low-level. They were able to hit the coastal areas and their speed and agility meant they were a difficult prospect to intercept. The German pilots were disadvantaged in some respects. There {{was a lack of}} nigh-flying experience in these units, the Fw 190s did not carry radar and had a short range. Aside from a small mirror, the pilot could not always see behind him well enough at night. On 16 May 1943 the Fw 190s lost four <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> fifth to 85 Squadron. On 13 June 1943 Cunningham intercepted an Fw 190 not far from his airfield at West Malling. The GCI controller telephoned the crew-room to notify them the commanding officer was closing on an enemy aircraft heading to London. They heard both aircraft and the brief burst of fire followed by the explosion. To his amazement, Cunningham later learned the pilot—Leutnant Ullrich from 3./Schnellkampfgeschwader 10 (Fast Bomber Wing 10—SKG 10)—was thrown through the canopy as the Fw 190A-5, Werknummer, 840047 code CO+LT, fell earthwards. He deployed his parachute and was picked up by a searchlight crew with a broken arm.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{took the}} form of a motte and bailey design, and a dam was {{probably}} constructed to turn the surrounding marshy, low-lying land into an artificial lake, called Skipsea Mere, in turn connected the channel leading to the sea. The complex had its own private harbour, <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> boat yard and a fresh-water fishery. By the end of the 11th century a church had been built to the east of the castle across the mere, and the village of Skipsea soon grew up alongside the church. Drogo settled 10 knights on lands near the castle in an arrangement known as a castlery or castle-guard system, under which the knights helped to guard the castle in return for their estates, and one of them probably built his own smaller fortification at nearby Aldborough.|$|E
5|$|The central {{pathways}} of metabolism described above, such as glycolysis and the {{citric acid}} cycle, {{are present in}} all three domains of living things and {{were present in the}} last universal common ancestor. This universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> methanogen that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The retention of these ancient pathways during later evolution {{may be the result of}} these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps. The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of purine nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient RNA world.|$|E

5|$|Before Burebista became king, the Dacians {{experienced}} {{a succession of}} kings through the period of 450 to 60 BC. The kings included Dromichaetes, Oroles and Rubobostes {{in the third and}} second centuries BC. From the 4th century BC to the 2nd century BC the La Tène Celts of the Danube, Alpines and Balkans influenced the Dacian culture. La Tène material culture was found in the central and north-west of Dacia. The development of a La Tène based economy in 3rd–2nd century BC allowed the consolidation of political power through tribal unions. Such regional unions were found both among the Transylvanian Dacians under the rule of Rubobostes, and the Moldavian and Wallachian Getae in Argedava. It is from the La Tène that the Dacians were introduced to the potter's wheel, superior metal-working techniques <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> tradition of coinage. Homes were a combination of Celtic and Dacian pottery, and certain Celtic style graves contain Dacian style vessels. This suggests a sort of co-existence and fusion between the cultures. Sometime after around 150 BC, however, evidence of La Tène culture peters out, around the same time the Dacian culture began to mature as evidenced by population and economic growth. Under Rubobstes the authority of the Dacians appears to have increased, thus ending the dominance of the Celtic culture, and leading to the Celts being expelled from the area or merged into the culture, or both at once. There is archaeological evidence to suggest that relations between Dacians and Celts living in the areas north and west of Dacia continued. Painted ceramics of late La Tène-style have been found in Dacian sites in west and central Dacia. Some of these were imported while others were made by Dacian potters imitating Celtic style. A stable monarchy, however, only developed when Burebista became king. Burebista's accession came with the expulsion of Celts around 60 BC when his forces moved through to the middle Danube region, and {{with the support of the}} religious establishment and leaders in Dacia which brought around a stricter moral code in the Dacian kingdom. Around this time pottery of the Dacian style began appearing in Celtic settlements in Central Europe, including former Yugoslavia including in Gomolava, Yugoslavia and Budapest, Hungary.|$|E

25|$|A pellet stove {{is a type}} of {{clean-burning}} stove {{which uses}} small, biological fuel pellets which are renewable and very clean-burning. Home heating using a pellet stove is an alternative currently used throughout the world, with rapid growth in Europe. The pellets are made of renewable material –- typically wood sawdust or off-cuts. There are currently {{more than half a million}} homes in North America using pellet stoves for heat, <b>and</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> similar number in Europe. The pellet stove typically uses a feed screw to transfer pellets from a storage hopper to a combustion chamber. Air is provided for the combustion by an electric blower. The ignition is automatic, using a stream of air heated by an electrical element. The rotation speed of the feeder and the fan speeds can be varied to modulate the heat output.|$|E
25|$|Before being encircled, the Ninth Army {{had already}} {{suffered}} heavy {{losses in the}} Battle of the Seelow Heights.

In all, there were about 80,000 men in the pocket, the majority of whom belonged to the Ninth Army, consisting of the XI SS Panzer Corps, V SS Mountain Corps and the newly acquired V Corps, but there was also the Frankfurt Garrison. The number of tanks reported included 36 tanks in the XI SS Panzer Corps, including up to 14 King Tigers of the 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. Air supply was attempted on April 25 and 26, but could not be carried out because the planes that had taken off could not find the drop point for supply, and no contact with the encircled army could be established.|$|E
