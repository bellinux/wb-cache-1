5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual <b>and</b> <b>system</b> level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{response}} to the increasing criticality of software within <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> the increasing demands being put onto software-intensive <b>systems,</b> software <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> engineering processes will evolve significantly {{over the next two}} decades. This paper identifies eight relatively surprise-free trends – the increasing interaction of software engineering <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> engineering; increased emphasis on users and end value; increased emphasis on <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> software dependability; increasingly rapid change; increasing global connectivity <b>and</b> need for <b>systems</b> to interoperate; increasingly complex systems of systems; increasing needs for COTS, reuse, <b>and</b> legacy <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> software integration; and computational plenty. It also identifies two “wild card ” trends: increasing software autonomy and combinations of biology and computing. It then discusses the likely influences of these trends on software <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> engineering processes between now and 2025, and presents an emerging three-team adaptive process model for coping with the resulting challenges and opportunities of developing 21 st century software-intensive <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> of systems. ...|$|R
5|$|Sega AM2's {{first attempt}} in the genre was the 1993 arcade game Burning Rival, but gained renown {{with the release}} of Virtua Fighter for the same {{platform}} the same year. It was the first fighting game with 3D polygon graphics and a viewpoint that zoomed and rotated with the action. Despite the graphics, players were confined to back and forth motion as seen in other fighting games. With only three buttons, it was easier to learn than Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, having six and five buttons respectively. By the time the game was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan, the game <b>and</b> <b>system</b> were selling at almost a one-to-one ratio.|$|E

Approximately 25 percent of the airframe is made of carbon-fibre composites, which are primarily used on control surfaces and the tail assembly, while aluminium and steel alloys are used {{for the rest of}} the structure. The An-70 has a designed life of 45,000hours over 15,000flights. The prototypes had a fly-by-wire flight-control system that comprised three digital channels and six analog channels; it was expected that production aircraft would have a four-channel digital fly-by-wire system. Aircraft <b>and</b> <b>system</b> information are mainly relayed to the pilot and co-pilot via six large multi-function CRT displays, with secondary electro-mechanical instruments and head-up displays; a flight engineer position is also present on the prototypes.|$|E
