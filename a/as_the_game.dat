5|$|A 95-page {{official}} strategy guide, titled Blue Wing Blitz Freedom Fighter's Guide, {{was published}} by DigiCube on the same date <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> The contents include information on the characters and the setting, battle system explanations, map screenshots, and reference and data tables.|$|E
5|$|A prostitute is {{available}} as soon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> starts. Should Larry have unprotected intercourse with her, he will contract a sexually-transmitted disease and die shortly thereafter. This fate may {{be avoided by}} buying a condom at the convenience store. Larry questions the validity of losing his virginity to a prostitute, but the game resumes without a time limit.|$|E
5|$|Graham was at {{the centre}} of {{development}} across platforms, and {{had no problem with}} the Game Gear version having vehicle behaviour similar to the NES version. Routledge and Saunders came up with the method of multiplayer on the same device. Multiplayer via link-up was difficult to implement, with problems such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> losing sync.|$|E
50|$|Meat Loaf and Neverland Express served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> pregame show performance. The United States Army Europe Band and Chorus from Heidelberg Germany served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> half time show performance.|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} of the song appears in <b>the</b> <b>game</b> Parasol Stars <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> Boss Music.|$|R
5000|$|German website 4Players gave <b>the</b> <b>game</b> 64/100, citing awkward {{controls}} and a steep learning curve <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> downfall.|$|R
5|$|In 1937, the Phillies {{played the}} Boston Braves in a doubleheader on Opening Day, winning both games. Reliever Syl Johnson started game one, {{but did not}} factor in the decision, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> went to 11 innings. Starter Bucky Walters won game two.|$|E
5|$|Lokvenc scored {{his first}} league {{goal of the}} 2006–07 Austrian Football Bundesliga in a December match against Altach, {{levelling}} the scores <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> finished 1–1. The club {{went on to win}} the league in April 2007 with five matches of the season remaining.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the film's release, July 12, 2013, another {{viral video}} was {{released}} to promote the film. It involved the collaboration of the film studio (including del Toro himself) and the YouTube network Polaris (also known <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Game</b> Station). It featured members of the YouTube network (such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> Grumps) as Jaeger pilots fighting Kaiju. On July 16, a novelization by Alex Irvine was released. NECA began selling action figures of the film's Kaiju and Jaegers.|$|E
5000|$|David Buckley scored <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> {{original}} soundtrack. Rapper Eminem's 2013 song [...] "Survival" [...] {{is featured}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> credit song.|$|R
5|$|Popular {{reaction}} to the trailer led Techland to slightly adjust <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> tone, gameplay, and story, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> promotion strategy.|$|R

5|$|A Tony Romo {{touchdown}} {{pass in the}} third quarter gave the Cowboys their first lead of the game. The lead was extended when Nick Folk converted his second field goal of the day, putting the Cowboys up 13–3 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> entered the final quarter. Reed converted his second field goal of the game, bringing the Steelers within seven points with 7:20 remaining in regulation. On the Steelers next drive, Ben Roethelisberger threw a {{touchdown pass}} to Heath Miller—tying the game with 2:04 remaining. Deshea Townsend intercepted Romo's next pass and returned the ball 25yards, scoring a touchdown to give the Steelers a seven-point lead, which they held {{to the end of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Age of Empires {{requires}} the player {{to develop a}} civilization {{from a handful of}} hunter-gatherers to an expansive Iron Age Empire. To assure victory, the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and more advanced technology. Resources must also be preserved, as no new resources become available <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> progresses, for example, trees that are cut down will not grow back.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1999, {{the ballroom}} dance scene of Final Fantasy VIII was {{featured}} {{as a technical}} demo for the PlayStation 2. In 2000, a PC version was released for Windows. This port featured smoother graphics, enhanced audio, and the inclusion of Chocobo World, a minigame starring Boko, a Chocobo featured {{in one of the}} side-quests in Final Fantasy VIII. For most North American and European players, the PC version of the game was the only means of playing Chocobo World, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was originally designed to be played via the PocketStation, a handheld console never released outside Japan. In 2009, Final Fantasy VIII was added to the PlayStation Store on the PlayStation Network.|$|E
5000|$|IGN gave <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{an overall}} rating of 7.5 complimenting <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> great {{graphics}} <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> [...] " [...] loot-heavy dungeon crawling experience that doesn't tax your skills" [...] <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>game</b> allows for <b>the</b> player to play leisurely {{and enjoy the}} world.|$|R

5|$|Also injured was Virginia Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Scales. Scales didn't play for 10 weeks {{during the regular}} season because of surgery to an injured tendon. Despite playing in only four games during the season, he finished the regular season as the Hokies' No. 5 receiver, catching 13 passes for 298 yards. Scales' injury caused the Hokies to be ranked among the worst in the Big East in receiving yardage, averaging less than 180 yards per game through the air. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> moved closer, however, Scales recovered from his injury and appeared near full strength.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{was without}} injured trio Robert Pirès, Freddie Ljungberg and Giovanni van Bronckhorst and {{lined up in}} their {{traditional}} 4–4–2 formation; striker Sylvain Wiltord was accommodated to the left wing, with Bergkamp playing off main striker Thierry Henry. After a lengthy illness, Liverpool defender Markus Babbel returned to the squad and was named as a substitute. Houllier deployed a 4–3–1–2 formation with Steven Gerrard, John Arne Riise and Dietmar Hamann as a midfield three and new signing, El Hadji Diouf positioned in a free role to begin with and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> went on, moved to the right wing to stretch Arsenal's defence.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> Boy Advance {{was able}} to handle newer, {{enhanced}} graphics, Ruby and Sapphire were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, {{as opposed to the}} previous limit of two. However, the development team used a more basic graphics engine {{in order to keep the}} game simple and not overly confusing. The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to be easy enough for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.|$|E
50|$|The {{song was}} {{featured}} in <b>the</b> video <b>game</b> Test Drive Off-Road Wide Open <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> opening video music and a selectable music track in <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|R

50|$|Sergeant Smash- A {{giant pumpkin}} created by Dr. Percy Frankenstein that serves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> final boss.|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{began to}} spread to Europe and beyond, clubs adopted kits similar to those worn in the United Kingdom, {{and in some cases}} chose colours {{directly}} inspired by British clubs. In 1903, Juventus of Italy adopted a black and white strip inspired by Notts County. Two years later, Argentina's Club Atlético Independiente adopted red shirts after watching Nottingham Forest play.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is played, each PC {{changes over}} time and {{generally}} increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes. The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> proceeds, flashbacks occur showing {{events in}} Harris and Klebold's lives {{which may have}} caused them to commit murder; real life events are {{compressed}} into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes. Much of the plot is constructed around the events precisely as they {{are believed to have}} occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos of each other. In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E
50|$|The season {{also saw}} a change of {{television}} address <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> moved from ABC to NBC.|$|R

50|$|As <b>the</b> second <b>game</b> progresses, Corvo and his {{daughter}} are confronted by Jessamine's purported half-sister, Delilah, who serves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> main antagonist.|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> wears on, Shooter only deals, {{and then}} after another hand when Howard outplays them, two more players, Yeller and Sokal, drop out. That leaves just Howard and the Kid. After a few {{unlikely}} wins, the Kid calls for a break and confronts Shooter, who admits to being forced into cheating by Slade. The Kid insists he can win {{on his own and}} tells Shooter to deal straight or he will blow the whistle, destroying Shooter's reputation. Before the game resumes, Melba succeeds in seducing the Kid. Christian makes a surprise visit to the room, catches them after the fact and walks out on The Kid.|$|E
5|$|As with {{equipped}} items, Garment Grids {{often provide}} characters {{with a variety}} of enhancements and extra abilities. The game features diverse Garment Grids and dresspheres which can be discovered <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> progresses. While normal dresspheres can be used by all three playable characters, each character can acquire a dressphere that only they can use. These dresspheres can only be activated after a character has changed into all of the classes designated to her Garment Grid in a single battle. When a character activates one of these dresspheres, the other characters are replaced by two controllable support units.|$|E
5|$|Conker the Squirrel {{also had}} its own game. Originally named Conker's Quest, the title was renamed to Twelve Tales: Conker 64. However, the new title was criticised for being too family-friendly and too similar to Banjo-Kazooie. As a result, the team renamed the game to Conker's Bad Fur Day and was re-revealed again in 2000. Conker's Bad Fur Day, unlike Banjo-Kazooie, was {{intended}} for a mature audience, and features violence, profanity and scatological humour. The game received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial failure <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was released {{at the end of}} the Nintendo 64's life cycle and the game was not actively promoted by Nintendo.|$|E
50|$|Vib-Ripple {{is notable}} for {{allowing}} the player to import photographs {{to be used}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> playing field.|$|R
