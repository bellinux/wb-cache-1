5|$|A {{group of}} {{antibodies}} {{can be called}} monovalent (or specific) if they have <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the same epitope, or for the same antigen (but potentially different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of microorganism (but potentially different antigens on or in it). In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called polyvalent (or unspecific) if they have <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E

5|$|Certain non-inhibitory serpins {{also use}} the serpin {{conformational}} change {{as part of their}} function. For example, the native (S) form of thyroxine-binding globulin has high <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> thyroxine, whereas the cleaved (R) form has low affinity. Similarly, transcortin has higher <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> cortisol when in its native (S) state, than its cleaved (R) state. Thus, in these serpins, RCL cleavage and the S to R transition has been commandeered to allow for ligand release, rather than protease inhibition.|$|E

Half-elves, like humans, do not get attribute bonuses and decreases, so they don't have a favored class. Naturally, like elves, they have low-light vision, immunity against sleep effects and partial <b>affinities</b> <b>for</b> skills related to perception (elves have full skill <b>affinities</b> <b>for</b> same skills).|$|R
50|$|Receptor binding studies, in {{competition}} with 3H-spiperone, using receptors from pig anterior pituitary, have revealed the following <b>affinities</b> <b>for</b> D2 receptors exhibited by DMDA: Kahigh = 20 nM; Kalow = 10200 nM. In comparison, the corresponding <b>affinities</b> <b>for</b> N-methyldopamine are: 10.4 nM (high) and 3430 nM (low), while for dopamine they are 7.5 nM (high) and 4300 nM (low affinity state).|$|R
5|$|Chemical {{principles}} govern specific RNA {{interaction with}} amino acids.

5|$|In {{addition}} to this metabolic diversity, prokaryotes also possess a range of isozymes– different enzymes that catalyze the same reaction. For example, in E. coli, {{there are two different}} types of ubiquinol oxidase using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Under highly aerobic conditions, the cell uses an oxidase with a low <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> oxygen that can transport two protons per electron. However, if levels of oxygen fall, they switch to an oxidase that transfers only one proton per electron, but has a high <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> oxygen.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of a rat opioid receptor, designated as ROR-D, has been deduced by cloning and sequencing the cDNA. The ROR-D expressed from the cDNA exhibits high <b>affinities</b> <b>for</b> ligands selective for the opioid receptor κ-subtype and low <b>affinities</b> <b>for</b> ligands selective for the δ- and μ-subtypes. RNA blot hybridization analysis indicated that ROR-D mRNA is distributed in cerebrum and brainstem but not in cerebellum...|$|R

The uridine analogs were trans-ported at 2 -fold higher rates (at 10 M) by hCNT 1 than by hCNT 2. Enantiomeric configuration and the 3 -hydroxyl group of the ribose ring were important determinants for interaction with hCNTs, whereas the 2 -hydroxyl group was less important...|$|R

5|$|Protease-inhibition {{is thought}} to be the ancestral function, with non-inhibitory members the results of {{evolutionary}} neofunctionalisation of the structure.

5|$|Psilocybin {{is rapidly}} dephosphorylated {{in the body}} to psilocin, which is a partial agonist for several {{serotonin}} receptors, which are also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Psilocin has a high <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in the human brain, and with a slightly lower <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the 5-HT2A receptor. Psilocin binds with low affinity to 5-HT1 receptors, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D. Serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, and {{are involved in a}} wide range of functions, including regulation of mood and motivation. The psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimicking) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the 5-HT2A antagonist drug ketanserin. Various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non-5-HT2 receptors also contribute to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug. For example, psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia, and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by haloperidol, a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist. Taken together, these suggest that there may be an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin's psychotomimetic effects. Unlike LSD, which binds to D2-like dopamine receptors in addition to having strong <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> several 5-HT receptors, psilocybin and psilocin have no <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the dopamine D2 receptors.|$|E

The newfound popularity secured him a cult following, spawned the Norton Records label, and helped usher in the genre known as psychobilly.|$|E
40|$|Several {{diphenylmethane}} derivatives {{have been}} synthesized with variable <b>affinities</b> <b>for</b> Anti-estrogen Binding Sites (ABS) {{but not for}} the estrogen receptor. Using these molecules as probes it is shown that their binding <b>affinities</b> <b>for</b> ABS correlate with their abilities to inhibit the growth of MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells. In contrast they have no influence on the proliferation of tamoxifen-resistant variant cells (RTx 6) in which ABS are undetectable. These data support the conclusion that ABS has a functional role in the anti-proliferative effect of triphenylethylene anti-estrogens and structurally related compounds...|$|R

The traits of the character were also partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official in Burbank, California.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{precipitation}} {{of sodium}} salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically {{have a high}} <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> water; an exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3). Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol.

5|$|During Part II of {{the series}} the concept of , {{altering}} the quality of chakra, is introduced. Nature manipulation allows ninja, following certain training, to convert their chakra into one of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and lightning. Each element is predominant and subordinate to different elements; for example, fire is weak against water, but can easily counter and even gain strength when used against a wind-based jutsu and earth is weak against lightning based jutsu. Most ninja have a natural <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> {{one of the five}} elements, allowing them to use jutsu of that type with greater ease.
