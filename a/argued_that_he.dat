5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no conclusive evidence that he ever went there or was even homosexual. Some authors have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Although John was the Count of Poitou and {{therefore}} the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal John's actions in France to his own feudal lord, Philip. Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case. John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way. He <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> need not attend Philip's court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court. Philip <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as the Count of Poitou, which carried no such special status. When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John's lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur – {{with the exception of}} Normandy, which he took back for himself – and began a fresh war against John.|$|E
50|$|Florida {{has drawn}} {{criticism}} for taking an overly academic and elitist point of view. Critics <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> overstates {{the size and}} potential impact of the creative class, neglecting many economic and social realities. They also <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ignores many factors that people consider when they are choosing a place to live.|$|R

5|$|From that point, Manne refocused his {{attention}} on his own drumming. It might be <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never played with more taste, refinement, and soulful swing than in the 1970s, when he recorded numerous albums with musicians like trumpeter Red Rodney, pianist Hank Jones, saxophonists Art Pepper and Lew Tabackin, and composer-arranger-saxophonist Oliver Nelson.|$|E
5|$|In 1628, an ecclesiastical case {{related to}} a game at East Lavant, near Chichester in West Sussex, being played on a Sunday.

It did him no good as he was fined the statutory 12d and ordered to do penance.|$|E
5|$|In March 1975 Massino {{was arrested}} {{at the scene of}} the arrest of one of his hijackers, Raymond Wean, and charged with {{conspiracy}} to receive stolen goods. He was scheduled to go on trial in 1977, but the charges were dropped after he successfully <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not been properly mirandized, disqualifying statements Massino gave to police from being used in trial.|$|E

By {{the end of the year}} the strikers had formed a new organization called the Association of Former Police of the City of Boston.|$|E
5|$|Seltzer {{defended the}} Cleveland Press {{and his own}} {{personal}} involvement in the case in his 1956 memoir The Years Were Good. Seltzer <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was convinced the Sheppard family {{was involved in a}} conspiracy to get away with murder and that he personally wrote the editorials, instead of passing them off to one of his employees, out of concern for the safety of his staff.|$|E
5|$|British ornithologist David Lack {{considered}} that the Puerto Rican amazon had {{evolved from the}} Hispaniolan amazon (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (A. agilis) of Jamaica and the Puerto Rican amazon. Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within {{members of the same}} species. The research concluded that the Puerto Rican amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis. Recent phylogenetic studies show that the Puerto Rican amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the Cuban amazon than to the black-billed amazon.|$|E

5|$|Burton was {{the first}} {{defendant}} convicted under § 1782 of the Revised Statutes, 40 years after its 1864 enactment. Burton and his supporters <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was selectively prosecuted, on the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, for political reasons. Burton also became {{the first member of}} the United States Senate to be convicted of public corruption, in fact the first member of the Senate to be convicted of any crime. The next year, Senator John H. Mitchell (R-OR) was convicted under the same statute {{for his role in the}} Oregon land fraud scandal.|$|E
5|$|Cancellor {{was found}} dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April. His body was covered, with long {{stockings}} over his legs and kidskin gloves on his hands. The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease and <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should be buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{historians have}} long debated whether Hanpu was of Silla, Goryeo, or Jurchen ethnicity. Since the 1980s, they have chiefly <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a Jurchen {{who had lived}} in Silla, the state that had {{dominated}} the Korean peninsula until it was destroyed by Goryeo in 935. Western scholars usually treat Hanpu's story as a legend, but agree that it hints to contacts between some Jurchen clans and the states of Goryeo and Balhae (a state located between Jurchen lands and Silla until it was destroyed in 926) in the early tenth century. In Korea, a recent KBS history special treated Hanpu as a native Silla man who moved north and settled in Jurchen lands during the demise of Silla.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his capture}} in 1071, he was imprisoned. This incarceration lasted until 1087, when a guilt-ridden King William, in {{expectation}} {{of his own}} death, ordered Siward's release. Firm evidence of Siward's later life is non-existent, but some historians have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> took up {{a career in the}} Varangian Guard at Constantinople, {{in the service of the}} Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. The sources upon which this theory is based also allege that Siward led a party of English colonists to the Black Sea, who renamed their conquered territory New England.|$|E
5|$|Henry assumed {{formal control}} of his {{government}} in January 1227, although some contemporaries <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was legally still a minor until his 21st birthday the following year. The King richly rewarded Hubert de Burgh for his service during his minority years, making him the Earl of Kent and giving him extensive lands across England and Wales. Despite coming of age, Henry remained heavily influenced by his advisers {{for the first few}} years of his rule and retained Hubert as his justiciar to run the government, granting him the position for life.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Savage sued his {{publisher}} for $12,000 in unpaid royalties. The publisher, Frank Tennyson Neely, who {{had filed}} for bankruptcy five years earlier before accepting Savage as a client, <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not owe Savage anything, instead, Savage owed him. Neely's scattered and incomplete accounting books prevented an easy conclusion to the trial. Three years later, Neely once again declared bankruptcy. In 1899, Abraham Lewis of Brooklyn sued Savage for $10,000 in damages, for stealing away the affections of his wife. Savage's own wife and a friend defended him in court, saying Lewis, an informal supplier of food to soldiers under Savage's command, was retaliating for being stopped from the lucrative but illegal act of selling liquor to the troops at Montauk Point.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 McNallen {{was invited}} to the International Asatru Summer Camp, but this was opposed {{by many of the}} groups attending, who <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should not be invited because of what they {{perceived}} as his racist views; a number of European Heathen groups, such as Norway's Bifrost and the Swedish SAS, threatened to boycott the event as a result of McNallen's invite. In 2011, the AFA sent a contingent to the annual conference of a white nationalist organization, the National Policy Institute, in what some figures close to McNallen revealed was an attempt to recruit members. After this incident was publicized it resulted in accusations of racism being levelled against McNallen and the AFA from various parts of the Pagan blogosphere.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Thompson brought another $600 million {{lawsuit against}} Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, and Sony Computer Entertainment. The lawsuit claimed that 14-year-old Posey {{played the game}} obsessively before murdering his father, stepmother, and stepsister on a ranch in Hondo, New Mexico. Posey's defense team <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was abused by his father and was taking Zoloft {{at the time of}} the killings. The suit alleged that the murders would not have taken place if Posey had not obsessively played Vice City. The case was {{dismissed}} in December 2007, as New Mexico held no jurisdiction over Sony or Take-Two.|$|E
5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E
