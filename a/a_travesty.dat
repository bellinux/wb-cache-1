5|$|In April 1883 Carvalho finally revived Carmen at the Opéra-Comique, with Adèle Isaac {{featuring}} in an under-rehearsed {{production that}} removed {{some of the}} controversial aspects of the original. Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering <b>a</b> <b>travesty</b> of what {{had come to be}} regarded as a masterpiece of French opera; nevertheless, this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses. In October Carvalho yielded to pressure and revised the production; he brought back Galli-Marié, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.|$|E

25|$|Such an act is an {{obscenity}} and <b>a</b> <b>travesty</b> of Jewish values. That {{it should}} have been perpetrated against worshippers in a house of prayer at a holy time makes it a blasphemy as well... Violence is evil. Violence committed in the name of God is doubly evil. Violence against those engaged in worshipping God is unspeakably evil.|$|E

25|$|In {{the ensuing}} two-year trial, dozens of {{witnesses}} were heard and many documents were considered. When the Court {{refused to allow}} new evidence from witnesses, Dolci and Alasia decided that the trial was <b>a</b> <b>travesty.</b> They announced that under these circumstances they would no longer attempt to defend themselves. The remainder of the trial, therefore, took place with Dolci and Alasia absent from the courtroom. Dolci responded by broadcasting his opinions over a private radio station, which was promptly closed.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the {{settlement}} of the Heisenberg affair was a victory for academic standards and professionalism. However, the replacement of Sommerfeld by Wilhelm Müller on 1 December 1939 was a victory of politics over academic standards. Müller was not a theoretical physicist, had not published in a physics journal, and was {{not a member of}} the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG, German Physical Society); his appointment as a replacement for Sommerfeld was considered <b>a</b> <b>travesty</b> and detrimental to educating a new generation of theoretical physicists.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Versailles, a series of trials of alleged German war criminals was held in Leipzig, Germany, in May–July 1921. Of the twelve accused, seven, whose rank ranged from a private to a major-general, were charged with mistreating prisoners of war. Four were found guilty, and sentenced to prison terms ranging from a few months to two years. Outside Germany, the trials were {{regarded}} as <b>a</b> <b>travesty</b> because of the apparent leniency of the court; while inside Germany they were seen as excessively harsh.|$|E

25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. Without getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would simply say that I have been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at all. That, I suggest to my colleagues, would be <b>a</b> <b>travesty.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hopkinson {{considered}} his warnings had been amply justified when the Second World War broke out. He re-enlisted at age 60, {{this time in}} the Royal Navy on the declaration of war, serving from 1939 to 1942. During breaks in his service he voted against Chamberlain after the Norway debate of 1940, and supported Churchill's policy of 'total war', but opposed the use of secret sessions of the House of Commons to suppress public criticism of the performance of Ministers. In 1942 a corrupted report of a speech of his was printed in the This England column of the New Statesman in which he was supposed to have declared himself an autocrat. Hopkinson sued for libel, describing the statement as <b>a</b> <b>travesty.</b> The New Statesman eventually agreed to pay 50 guineas to the RAF Benevolent Fund in damages, and Hopkinson's costs. The same erroneous report also appeared in Reynolds News and Hopkinson won £500 damages from them.|$|E
25|$|Frederic Reynolds' Catherine and Petruchio (1828) is an {{adaptation}} of Garrick, with an overture taken from Gioachino Rossini, songs derived from numerous Shakespeare plays and sonnets, and music by John Braham and Thomas Simpson Cooke. Starring Fanny Ayton and James William Wallack, the opera premiered at Drury Lane, {{but it was not}} successful, and closed after only a few performances. Hermann Goetz' Der Widerspänstigen Zähmung (1874), with libretto by Joseph Viktor Widmann, is a comic opera, which focuses on the Bianca subplot, and cuts back the taming story. It was first performed at the original National Theatre Mannheim. John Kendrick Bangs' Katherine: <b>A</b> <b>Travesty</b> (1888) is a Gilbert and Sullivan-style parody operetta which premiered in the Metropolitan Opera. Spyridon Samaras' La furia domata: commedia musicale in tre atti (1895) is a now lost lyric comedy with libretto by Enrico Annibale Butti and Giulio Macchi, which premiered at the Teatro Lirico. Ruperto Chapí's Las bravías (1896), with libretto by José López Silva and Carlos Fernández Shaw, is a part sainete, part zarzuela. The production was a huge success in Spain, with over 200 performances in 1896 alone. It continued to be performed regularly until 1926.|$|E

500|$|Birds have {{sometimes}} served as religious symbols. For example, on Ancient Greece, Athena, Athens's patron goddess and {{the goddess of}} wisdom, had a little owl as her symbol. In Medieval Christian iconography, the cormorant's [...] "wing-drying" [...] pose represents the Christian cross, and hence is a figure of Christ. In John Milton's Paradise Lost, on the other hand, the bird's cross-like pose is <b>a</b> <b>travesty</b> of Christ: [...] "Then up he flew, and... Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life Thereby regained, but sat devising death To them who lived".|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad {{reported}} that this episode {{was an odd}} one produced by the show. [...] "I don't {{know if it was}} the off-balance tone the episode had because two of the three plots took place outside, but it just wasn't as good as most episodes." [...] Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student called Jenna and Kenneth's plot <b>a</b> <b>travesty,</b> commenting that the two along with Grammer scamming Carvel was [...] "diabolical, and definitely not funny enough to justify the horribleness". In regards to the episode, itself, Sanders wrote that it was [...] "mostly awful".|$|E

5000|$|Behan's {{involvement}} {{in the formation of}} this led to his nomination from the Democratic Party for the Mayor of New Orleans. He won in what is considered a landslide political victory in the 1882 election. He became the first Mayor in the new city charter which was constructed in the post-war process. In 1884, after two years in office, Behan lost his incumbent position in what is considered to be <b>an</b> <b>travesty</b> to the Democratic selection. The popular vote in the election was thrown out and was deemed inconclusive, and the decision was made by a [...] "Ring" [...] of influential politicians. He was then ousted by fellow Democrat J.

500|$|The case {{attracted}} {{national press}} and [...] many reporters deemed the conviction <b>a</b> <b>travesty.</b> Within Georgia, this outside criticism fueled antisemitism and hatred toward Frank. On August 16, 1915, he was kidnapped from prison {{by a group}} of armed men and lynched at Marietta, Mary Phagan's hometown, the next morning. The new governor vowed to punish the lynchers, who included prominent Marietta citizens, but nobody was charged. In 1986, Frank was posthumously pardoned by the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles, although not officially absolved of the crime. Most researchers today agree that Conley was likely the murderer. The case [...] inspired various media productions, including movies, plays, a TV miniseries, and books.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} rights groups criticized the sentences. Amnesty International {{designated}} the Thirteen prisoners {{of conscience and}} called for their immediate and unconditional release. It also called for an independent investigation of their allegations of mistreatment and urged that those responsible should be brought to justice, criticizing the Bahraini authorities for what it called <b>a</b> <b>travesty</b> of justice and said sentences were yet another proof that Bahrain {{was not on the}} path of reforms. Human Rights Watch demanded the prisoners' immediate release; according to HRW's Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director Joe Stork, the military court’s original verdict was [...] "absolutely mind-boggling", failing to mention a single actual criminal offense beyond acts relating to the defendants' basic human rights.|$|E
500|$|Busoni made a {{considerable}} number of piano rolls, and a small number of these have been re-recorded onto vinyl record or CD. These include a 1950 recording by Columbia Records sourced from piano rolls made by Welte-Mignon including music of Chopin and transcriptions by Liszt. The value of these recordings in ascertaining Busoni's performance style is a matter of some dispute. Many of his colleagues and students expressed disappointment with the recordings and felt they did not truly represent Busoni's pianism. Egon Petri was horrified by the piano roll recordings when they first appeared on vinyl and said that they were <b>a</b> <b>travesty</b> of Busoni's playing. Similarly, Petri's student Gunnar Johansen who had heard Busoni play on several occasions, remarked, [...] "Of Busoni's piano rolls and recordings, only Feux follets (no. 5 of Liszt's [...] Transcendental Études) is really something unique. The rest is curiously unconvincing. The recordings, especially of Chopin, are a plain misalliance".|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 1920s, sound films had become common, {{following}} the 1927 sensation, The Jazz Singer. Actors with trained voices were in demand by the studios, and Barrymore {{was offered a}} five-film deal with Warner Bros. at $150,000 per picture, and {{a share of the}} profits. Before he began this contract, he played his first speaking role on film: a one-off section in The Show of Shows (1929), playing Richard, Duke of Gloucester in Henry VI, Part 3. His first two films under contract were General Crack and The Man from Blankley's, each of which were modestly successful. As he had been frustrated at the inability of making The Sea Beast as a sound film, Barrymore returned to Moby Dick as the source for a 1930 film of the same name. Peters thinks little of the film, describing it as [...] "a seesaw between the cosmic and the comic, <b>a</b> <b>travesty</b> of Melville as well as a silly film all on its own".|$|E
500|$|Walton of The Moving Picture News {{said the}} film was, [...] "A bright, clean, human {{interest}} tale. It holds the attention {{from beginning to}} end. A thoroughly commendable reel - in every way." [...] The Moving Picture World offers {{a summary of the}} work and was more or less neutral in its review of the film. The reviewer states, [...] "It is a romantic picture, affording ample opportunity for the imagination to run riot {{in a number of different}} directions. ... Much of human nature is disclosed in this film, even though it is, in a way, <b>a</b> <b>travesty</b> upon the way wealthy girls often fall in love with stablemen or others employed about their fathers' places." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was not very critical, but not offering any praise either. The reviewer highlighted the [...] "common fault of actors" [...] by throwing things on the floor and how Ann's refusal to even look at the titled guest was overdone.|$|E
500|$|Barber's {{design for}} the Lafayette dollar has often been criticized. [...] Swiatek and Breen complained about the [...] "lifeless head of the President [...] ". Q. David Bowers stated that [...] "the shallow relief of Barber's work is but <b>a</b> <b>travesty</b> of Krider's {{extremely}} detailed high-relief artistry". According to Don Taxay, [...] "When one compares Barber's portraits to those by Du Vivier [...] and Caunois, it is clear why [...] Saint-Gaudens used to refer contemptuously to the 'commercial medalists of the Mint'. [...] The difference here is not merely in the relief, but in elementary modeling skill." [...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that, [...] "the Lafayette dollar lacks the quaint, dated appeal of the Isabella quarter or the amusing originality of the Columbian half-dollar. [...] Despite the necessity for low relief the jugate busts are too linear. The reverse suffers from too much lettering of uniform size. [...] The words 'Paris 1900' might have been enough; at most, the addition of 'From the Youth of the United States' would have conveyed the matter." ...|$|E
5000|$|Robert Salusbury of Outloud Culture {{has stated}} that [...] "Carnage’s debut album descends further and further into unoriginality and is <b>a</b> {{complete}} <b>travesty</b> that makes it all too clear that Carnage has swiftly gone from a pioneer of the hardstyle scene, producing some of the liveliest tracks that Spinnin’ Records has seen, to an embarrassing dinosaur of the EDM scene." ...|$|R
