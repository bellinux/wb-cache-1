25|$|In {{addition}} to fast integration with the European Union, safety against Russian leverage has been increased by building fully NATO-compatible military. 1000 troops (a high per-capita amount) are simultaneously committed in NATO and UN operations. Finland has also opposed energy projects that increase dependency on Russian imports. At the same time, Finland {{remains one of}} the last non-NATO members in Europe <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> not enough support for full membership unless Sweden joins first.|$|E
500|$|Julian Lennon {{discovered}} that [...] "Hey Jude" [...] {{had been written}} for him almost 20 years after McCartney composed the song. He recalled of his and McCartney's relationship: [...] "Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit – more than Dad and I did. We had a great friendship going <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures {{of me and my}} dad." [...] In 1996, Julian paid £25,000 for the recording notes to [...] "Hey Jude" [...] at an auction. He spent a further £35,000 at the auction, buying John Lennon memorabilia. John Cousins, Julian Lennon's manager, stated at the time: [...] "He has a few photographs of his father, but not very much else. He is collecting for personal reasons; these are family heirlooms if you like." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{administration}} has announced new procedural safeguards concerning {{individuals who are}} sent to foreign countries. President Obama also promised {{to shut down the}} CIA-run [...] "black sites," [...] <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> anecdotal evidence that extreme renditions are not happening, at least not as much as they did during the Bush administration. Still, human rights groups say that these safeguards are inadequate and that the DOJ Task Force recommendations still allow the U.S. to send individuals to foreign countries.|$|E
2500|$|April 11, 1951: After several public {{criticisms of}} White House policy in Korea, which {{were seen as}} {{undercutting}} the Commander-in-Chief's position, Harry Truman removes MacArthur from command and orders {{him to return to}} the United States. Some suggest Truman may have exchanged MacArthur for a sound nuclear policy in Korea since he did not trust [...] "Brass Hat MacArthur" [...] with nuclear weapons. [...] Some disagree with this, however, since (as David Horowitz noted in The Free World Colossus) MacArthur later came out against Truman's use of the bomb against Japan <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no concrete evidence of a major change in his views.|$|E

2500|$|Football {{was played}} in England {{as far back}} as medieval times.

[...] He also went on to mention that each trade had their own team, [...] "The elders, the fathers, and the men of wealth come on horseback to view the contests of their juniors, and in their fashion sport with the young men; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aroused in these elders a stirring of natural heat by viewing so much activity and by participation in the joys of unrestrained youth."

2500|$|Hardy's {{enlistment}} {{into the}} British intelligence services {{came at a}} time when membership of the organisation was low and a recruitment drive had been initiated by its leadership for the purposes of action in Ireland during the Irish War of Independence. While several of the most careless and high-profile members of the so-called [...] "Cairo Gang" [...] of British Army clandestine intelligence operatives (MO4x) were assassinated by Collins' Twelve Apostles on Bloody Sunday, Hardy had left for England two months previously, after his own disastrous attempt at espionage, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no correspondence to link Hardy {{with other members of the}} group. He was, nonetheless, profiled closely by Béaslaí, to whom he was known as [...] "Z499", on Collins' behalf; these sets of profiles are kept in the section housing Béaslaí's papers in the National Library of Ireland.|$|E
