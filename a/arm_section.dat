North of those ridges lies the small, but broad, arid drainage valley, Bitter Springs Valley, which is southeast of, and adjacent the Muddy Mountains. The trail passes the southern third of the mountain range on the west, making the circuit around Hamblin Mountain and descending Callville Wash.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the construct validity}} and unidimensionality of the Rivermead Motor Assessment, <b>arm</b> <b>section,</b> using Rasch analysis which transforms the ordinal scale into an interval scale with hierarchical ordering of items. SETTING: Twelve stroke units and rehabilitation centres across Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. SUBJECTS: Two hundred fifty-two stroke patients, average (SD) age of 63. 5 (13. 22) years. MAIN MEASURES: Principal component analysis on the Rasch data gave additional information on unidimensionality. Differential item functioning established the stability of items for gender, age, country, hemiplegic side, stroke type, and time since stroke. RESULTS : Four items {{did not meet the}} requirements for the Rasch model and were removed. These were 'Lying, protract shoulder with arm in elevation', 'Pick up tennis ball from table, release on midthigh, return to table, release', 'Same exercise with pencil' and 'Pick up piece of paper from table. Release five times'. Principal component analysis of the remaining 11 items revealed two dimensions in the scale, 'static and dynamic control of movement', and 'coordination'. All items were stable among the subgroups of the sample. CONCLUSION: The Rivermead Motor Assessment, revised <b>arm</b> <b>section</b> meets the required criteria for validity and unidimensionality. It consists of 11 individual items, which yield two subtotals of overall upper limb ability of the patients. It is a valid tool to evaluate upper limb function after stroke. status: publishe...|$|E

By declaring a type to be abstract, one can prevent objects {{of that type}} from being declared, although type derivation (or extension) is permitted, and these new types may then have objects and actual primitive operations. Abstract subprograms allow the definer of the type to make unavailable certain operations that would ordinarily be available for the type. When a tagged type is extended, abstract primitive operations ensure that the extender of the type provides "real" code for each primitive operation, and does not accidentally use default or incomplete operations. 5. 3. 9. 3. 2 Applicability to High Integrity Systems Because of the capabilities described above, abstract types and subprograms can be a significant engineering advantage for Ada 95.
