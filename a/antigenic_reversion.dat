40|$|The O antigens of Salmonella chittagong were {{altered in}} vitro from 1, 3, 10, 19 to 3, 15 by {{infection}} with bacteriophages obtained from Salmonella canoga or Salmonella newington. It was also {{confirmed that the}} antigenic alteration was accompanied by lysogenization of the cells. The antigens of the variant cells were reverted to original structure, 1, 3, 10, 19 by cultivating the variant cells in broth containing anti- 15 monofactor serum, which was prepared by absorbing anti-S newington O serum with S. london. And the <b>antigenic</b> <b>reversion</b> was accompanied by loss of lysogenicity of the cells. In both caces of antigenic alteration, no change was observed in H antigenic structure or biochemical behaviors...|$|E
40|$|Measuring {{selective}} pressures {{shaping the}} evolution of viral populations is important for preventing and controlling the spread of disease, {{as well as for}} understanding evolutionary processes in general. Traditional methods for detecting and quantifying selection assume that a single segregating allele is under constant selection in a population of constant size. However, viruses frequently violate these assumptions due to (i) their high mutation rates and (ii) their complex epidemiological dynamics. We examine the effect of these factors using computational models describing evolution at protein-coding regions, under various population dynamics. In Chapter 2 we show, assuming population sizes are constant, that linkage-induced interference between segregating mutations distort commonly used statistics such as dN/dS and the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) statistic. We propose three alternative statistics to detect the effect of background selection, hitch-hiking and clonal interference. In Chapter 3, we examine selection acting {{in the context of an}} epidemiological multi-strain SIRS model, by explicitly modelling the effect of cross-immunity between related strains, competition for susceptible hosts, and decaying host immunity. By studying the probability of <b>antigenic</b> <b>reversion,</b> we show that time-varying antigenic selection mediated by host immunity has a qualitatively different effect from constant selective constraint, which is observable from changing frequencies at antigenic sites over time. In Chapter 4, we apply both of these methods to avian influenza, demonstrating their utility in comparing selection between different lineages. In combination, these methods allow us to distinguish between different forms of selection, which may allow us to discriminate between potential biological mechanisms shaping viral populations...|$|E
40|$|Resistance to adenine analogs such as 2, 6 -diaminopurine {{occurs at}} a rate of {{approximately}} 10 (- 3) per cell per generation in mouse L cells. This resistance is associated with a loss of detectable adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity. Other genetic loci in L cells have the expected mutation frequency (approximately 10 (- 6)). Transformation of L cell mutants with Chinese hamster ovary cell DNA results in transformants with adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity characteristic of Chinese hamster ovary cells. No activation of the mouse gene occurs on hybridization with human fibroblasts. That this high frequency event is the result of mutation rather than an epigenetic event is supported by <b>antigenic</b> and <b>reversion</b> studies of the 2, 6 -diaminopurine-resistant clones. These results are consistent with either a mutational hot-spot, a locus specific mutator gene, or a site of integration of an insertion sequence...|$|R
