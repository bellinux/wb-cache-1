Instead, it is {{on the top of a}} promontory about 100 metres high, surrounded on three sides by vineyards and terraces, the fourth side descends steeply to the sea. To reach Corniglia, it is necessary to climb the Lardarina, a long brick flight of steps composed of 33 flights with 382 steps or, otherwise follow <b>a</b> <b>vehicular</b> <b>road</b> that, from the station, leads to the village.

50|$|London's docks were rationalised in 1908, {{with the}} {{formation}} of the Port of London Authority. The canal was managed as part of Surrey Docks, and although there were few changes to its operation, it became known as the Surrey Canal. Despite the large number of railway bridges which crossed it, the railways were not in direct competition with the canal. There was a railway interchange on the remains of the Croydon Canal, and South Dock was served by the Deptford Branch railway, but neither offered a real threat, and the canal continued to thrive until the expansion of road transport {{after the end of the}} Second World War in 1945. The Camberwell basin and the final 500 yd of the canal were abandoned in the 1940s, and had been filled in by 1960. The timber trade to the docks ceased in the early 1970s, resulting in the docks closing, and the canal being filled in. The section of canal between South Bermondsey and Deptford was opened as <b>a</b> <b>vehicular</b> <b>road</b> and renamed Surrey Canal Road in the 1980s, linking Ilderton Road with Trundleys Road. Where the canal crossed Trundleys Road and proceeded towards the Evelyn Street and the docks was utilised as a private access road called Canal Approach to serve the warehouses and industrial sites that still existed along the top end of the canal's route. The former canal side offices and buildings opposite Deptford Park on Grinstead Road were largely demolished and replaced by a modern Barratt development of flats called Inwen Court.|$|R
40|$|Caching popular {{contents}} in vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communication networks {{is expected}} {{to play an important}} role in road traffic management, the realization of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), and the delivery of multimedia content across vehicles. However, for effective caching, the network must dynamically choose the optimal set of cars that will cache popular content and disseminate it in the entire network. However, most of the existing prior art on V 2 V caching is restricted to cache placement that is solely based on location and user demands and does not account for the large-scale spatio-temporal variations in V 2 V communication networks. In contrast, in this paper, a novel spatio-temporal caching strategy is proposed based on the notion of temporal graph motifs that can capture spatio-temporal communication patterns in V 2 V networks. It is shown that, by identifying such V 2 V motifs, the network can find sub-optimal content placement strategies for effective content dissemination <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicular</b> network. Simulation results using real traces from the city of Cologne show that the proposed approach can increase the average data rate by 45 % for different network scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{transmission}} of vehicular trajectory information is one {{basic building block}} of car-to-car communication. Frequently, this information is transmitted as raw data, i. e., as a sequence of location measurements. In this paper we argue that, due {{to the laws of}} physics and the requirement to follow <b>a</b> <b>road,</b> <b>vehicular</b> mobility has very specific characteristics. Hence, vehicular trajectory information can be compressed very efficiently using domain-specific lossy compression schemes. We discuss and compare three promising approaches {{that can be used to}} this end: linear approximation, cubic splines, and clothoids. I...|$|R
40|$|Classical {{transportation}} {{systems have been}} suffering from inefficiency in utilizing road capacity and incapability of guaranteeing safety due to inconsistent and unpredictable human based manipulations. This long standing issue {{is expected to be}} resolved through the introduction of vehicular autonomy, along with a properly configured traffic management system and an underlying communication network that supports the dissemination of safety and control messages. However, mechanisms {{to be used in the}} regulation of autonomous vehicles are yet to be developed. For the first part of the dissertation, we propose an efficient data dissemination protocol, identified as Vehicular Backbone Network (VBN), which support high throughput and low delay message delivery <b>across</b> <b>a</b> <b>Vehicular</b> <b>Ad</b> Hoc Network (VANET). Vehicles are elected as relay nodes at properly selected nominal positions to optimize system throughput rate with guaranteed outage probability. The proposed VBN mechanism is analyzed under different Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols and various stochastic traffic flow conditions. In the second part of the dissertation, we go beyond the statistical vehicular traffic modeland present our study of <b>a</b> platoon-based autonomous <b>vehicular</b> traffic regulation system. The traffic management system, serving to configure vehicles into platoons and regulating the on-ramp access of vehicular flows into the highway, is integrated with a design of a VANET system. The latter provides for the communications of essential message flows among highway vehicles. The fundamental tradeoffs that need to be made in designing the autonomous systems are modeled and studied. We propose an optimization framework to be used in designing the traffic control system in a manner that meet throughput and latency performance metrics across the vehicular mobility and the message communications networking dimensions of the overall system. We also study the design of a core network that employs Road Side Units (RSUs) that provide communications networking support in disseminating message flows to/from and among highway vehicles...|$|R

The building was the second to be built {{on the north side of}} the Dumbarton Road, in the King’s Park, which was under development as an up-market residential area.

The issue of breaching the medieval wall was one which was traditionally opposed by the people of Stirling. Today, these issues would be resolved by public consultation.
