5|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, {{so it was}} in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, {{it was in the}}ir interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E

5|$|Being in {{the genus}} Acinonyx, the {{morphology}} of the cheetah differs notably {{from the big}} cats (genus Panthera). The face and the jaw are unusually shortened and the sagittal crest is poorly developed, possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed. In fact, the skull resembles that of the smaller cats. Another point of similarity to the small cats is the long and flexible spine, {{in contrast to the}} stiff and short one of other large felids. A 2001 study of felid morphology stated that the truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in the cheetah at a relatively younger age than other felids could be <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the peculiar morphology of the cheetah. Interestingly, the cheetah appears to show convergent evolution with canids in morphology as well as behaviour. For example, the cheetah has a relatively long snout, long legs and deep chest, tough foot pads and blunt, semi-retractable claws; moreover, its hunting behaviour resembles that of canids. In the 2001 study, it was observed that the claws of cheetah have features intermediate between those of felids and the wolf. In the Puma lineage, the cheetah's skull morphology {{is similar to that of}} the pumaboth have short, wide skullswhile that of the jaguarundi is different.|$|E
5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> worry.|$|E
5|$|During the {{formative}} years of women's rights movements, {{the difference between}} the sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles, functions, aims and desires were different. As a result, they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also. Over the course of time, this difference itself became <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> initiating women's movements. Early 19th century reformers argued that the difference between men and women was no reason for the subjection of women in society. However, later reformers were of the opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles in society, for example, as mothers. Therefore, there was a need for the proper care of women's rights. With the formation of women's organisations and their own participation in campaigns, their roles as mothers was again stressed but in a different light: this time the argument was for women's rights to speech, education and emancipation. However, the image of women with the mother as a symbol underwent changes over time – from an emphasis on family to the creation of an archetypal mother figure, evoking deep, often atavistic images.|$|E

Recently Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been considered as a mean for reducing design errors. However, limited research has been conducted on the role of BIM as a means for transfer and sharing knowledge in order to reduce design errors. The aim of the paper is to analyse BIM’s role of facilitating knowledge and expertise sharing in order to prevent design errors. The aim is achieved by analysing a case study of design errors in a construction project. By drawing on the concept of boundary object it is confirmed that BIM can serve a mean for preventing design errors by facilitating knowledge and expertise sharing, across discipline, time and space, and professional boundaries. Depending the kind of boundary knowledge and expertise should be shared across, different challenges emerge in organizing the knowledge and expertise sharing...|$|R
5|$|Ron Wolf, who {{had been}} the Oakland Raiders’ Director of Player Personnel since 1963 and was {{credited}} with much of their success, was hired as Vice President of Operations. Los Angeles Rams general manager Don Klosterman and former Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram were early candidates for the job; but Klosterman withdrew, and Stram was interested in a combined coach/general manager position. Wolf was directly responsible for the drafting of 20 of the Raiders’ 22 starters, and his effectiveness at scouting talent was believed to be <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the Raiders’ being one of the few teams not to belong to a scouting combine. The Buccaneers quickly developed a Raiders flavor, choosing to hire a scouting staff rather than rely on the computerized scouting reports that almost all other teams were using, and hiring Raiders business manager Ken LaRue to serve in the same capacity. One of Wolf’s responsibilities was to assist in the hiring of a head coach. Wolf persuaded Culverhouse {{that it would be better}} for any prospect to gain a year of experience and knowledge in his present job, rather than be named at expansion time, when there was little or no advantage to having a coach in place.|$|E

30|$|People {{working in}} teams {{need to act}} reciprocally; they are interdependent to other team members, and share one working environment. Information about the {{situation}} within this process is of crucial importance, as it allows teams to manage the process of collaborative working, and to coordinate group or team activities [19]. Many {{studies show that the}} quality of communication or information sharing has a relation with team performance [20 – 23]. The effectiveness of a team is often reflected by the degree in which team members engage in processes for sharing information [24], while being engaged within both verbal and non-verbal communication. Work in the safety domain is collaborative work by nature. Still, effective collaboration in this field seems to be difficult to realize. Berlin and Carlström [25] study why collaboration often is minimised at an accident scene. Based on observations and semi-structured interviews, they discover that collaboration is often considered as ideal rather than something that is really carried out. <b>As</b> <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> only limited forms of collaboration, they identify information asymmetry, uncertainty and lack of incentives.

40|$|Malawi {{is among}} the five sub-sahara Africa {{presenting}} with very high maternal mortality rates, 984 per 100, 000 live. Inadequate access to and under-utilisation of quality maternal health care services was identified as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> poor health {{of the women in}} Malawi. As a response to this situation, the Malawi government initiated the implementation of skilled attendance approach to delivery of maternal health care in 2006. The main objectives {{of the study was to}} identify the patterns and determinants of utilisation of skilled attendace for maternal health care services in the catchment areas of two rural health centres in the northern part of Malawi. This study used methodological triangulation methods, quantitative study using a descriptive cross sectional survey and qualitative; semistructured interviews and observations. Results shows that, utilisation of maternal health care services at the study sites has improved compared to the 2004 demographic health survey reports on maternal health care service utilisation in Malawi. Utilisation of skilled care for child birth was much higher than of the other components of maternal health care services. Maternal health services at Bolero health centre seemed to be more accessible and available than at kande. Hence utilisation of most components of care were high at Bolero health centre. Higher odds for utilisation of skilled care at birth was associated with women who made atleast 4 antenatal care visit, who lived within 5 km from the health centre. Low utilisation of maternal health care was associated with womens’ low autonomy; women with lower levels of education, younger, married, had lower rates of utilisation of most components of maternal health care. The malawian strategy of implementing skilled attendance achieved is unique as it aims apromoting total utilisation of skilled care, some lessons can be learnt on how the implementation is done at Bolero health centre. However, provision of quality of care remains a challenge for Malawi. There is need for strengthening supportive supervision and human resource management systems...|$|R

This study presents a decision framework and operational model to project investment returns for alternative inflation cycle scenarios and demonstrates their application for developing a dynamic real estate investment strategy. Such a strategy provides for portfolio revisions during different stages of the inflation cycle and assumes that investors seek to maximize expected "real" rates of return and hence owner's wealth. A probabilistic discounted cash flow model is designed and used to inflation-adjust each cash flow variable affected. Mathematical relationships are developed for specifying unique cash flow variable linkages and sensitivities, with lead and lag periods consistent with empirical evidence of timing of inflation impacts. Finally strategic implications for acquisition and disposition policy are discussed. ...|$|R
