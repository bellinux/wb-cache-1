It was intended that this would enable the aircraft {{to land on the}} open ocean in rough seas and deploy a dipping sonar. Other visual features of the design were an extremely large swept vertical fin that, combined with the dorsal fin and rudder, would have been about half the total length of the aircraft, and <b>a</b> <b>thimble</b> nose radome.|$|E
500|$|Coal {{balls are}} not made of coal; they are {{non-flammable}} and useless for fuel. Coal balls are calcium-rich permineralised life forms, mostly containing calcium and magnesium carbonates, pyrite, and quartz. Other minerals, including gypsum, illite, kaolinite, and lepidocrocite also appear in coal balls, albeit in lesser quantities. Although coal balls are usually {{about the size of}} a man's fist, their sizes vary greatly, ranging from that of a walnut up to [...] in diameter. Coal balls have been found that were smaller than <b>a</b> <b>thimble.</b>|$|E
500|$|Soon after Trafford piqued Starkey's {{interest}} in skiffle, the two began rehearsing {{songs in the}} manufacturing plant's cellar during their lunch breaks. Trafford recalled: [...] "I played a guitar, and [...] just made a noise on a box ... Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged {{on the backs of}} chairs." [...] The pair were joined by Starkey's neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark. The band performed popular skiffle songs such as [...] "Rock Island Line" [...] and [...] "Walking Cane", with Starkey raking <b>a</b> <b>thimble</b> across a washboard, creating primitive, driving rhythms. Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools. Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town.|$|E

500|$|Monopoly {{was first}} marketed {{on a broad}} scale by Parker Brothers in 1935. A Standard Edition, with a small black box and {{separate}} board, and a larger Deluxe Edition, with a box {{large enough to hold}} the board, were sold {{in the first year of}} Parker Brothers' ownership. These were based on the two editions sold by Darrow. Parker Brothers sets were the first to include die-cast metal tokens for playing pieces, initially using a battleship, a cannon, a clothes iron, a shoe, a top hat, and <b>a</b> <b>thimble.</b> George Parker himself rewrote many of the game's rules, insisting that [...] "short game" [...] and [...] "time limit" [...] rules be included. On the original Parker Brothers board (reprinted in 2002 by Winning Moves Games), there were no icons for the Community Chest spaces (the blue chest overflowing with gold coins came later) and no gold ring on the Luxury Tax space. Nor were there property values printed on spaces on the board. The Income Tax was slightly higher (being $300 or 10%, instead of the later $200 or 10%). Some of the designs known today were implemented at the behest of George Parker. The Chance cards and Community Chest cards were illustrated (though some prior editions consisted solely of text), but were without [...] "Rich Uncle Pennybags", who was introduced in 1936.|$|E
2500|$|Practical gifts {{included}} work-baskets, a travelling bag, a biscuit-box, <b>a</b> <b>thimble,</b> an egg-boiler and a photograph-book. Some gifts give an {{glimpse of}} items necessary {{at the time}} but which are no longer needed or are now less valuable and more disposable. For example, [...] "carved ivory" [...] hair brushes {{have been replaced by}} plastic ones; visiting cards, inkstands and riding whips are no longer in regular use.|$|E
2500|$|If the arcs {{from the}} high voltage {{terminal}} strike the bare skin, they can cause deep-seated burns called RF burns. [...] This is often avoided by allowing the arcs to strike a piece of metal held in the hand, or <b>a</b> <b>thimble</b> on a finger, instead. [...] The current passes from the metal into the person's hand through a wide enough surface area to avoid causing burns. [...] Often no sensation is felt, or just a warmth or tingling.|$|E

2500|$|Type B1 and B2 {{cabinets}} have {{a minimum}} inflow velocity of 100ft/min, and these cabinets must be hard-ducted to an exhaust system rather than exhausted through <b>a</b> <b>thimble</b> connection. Their exhaust systems must also be dedicated (one BSC per duct run, per blower). In contrast to the type A1 and A2 cabinets, Type B BSCs use single pass airflow (air that does not mix and recirculate) in order to also control hazardous chemical vapors. Type B1 cabinets split the airflow so that the air behind the smoke-split is directed to the exhaust system, while air between the operator and the smoke-split mixes with inflow air and is recirculated as downflow. Since exhaust air is drawn from the rear grille, the CDC advises that work with hazardous chemistry be conducted {{in the rear of}} the cabinet. This is complicated, since the smoke split (demarking the [...] "rear of the cabinet") is an invisible line that extends the width of the cabinet (approximately 10-14 inches from the front grille) and drifts as the internal HEPA filters load with particulate.|$|E
2500|$|Hand {{quilting}} is {{the process}} of using a needle and thread to sew a running stitch by hand across the entire area to be quilted. This binds the layers together. A quilting frame or hoop is often used to assist in holding the piece being quilted off the quilter's lap. A quilter can make one stitch at a time by first driving the needle through the fabric from the right side, then pushing it back up through the material from the wrong side to complete the stitch; this is called a stab stitch. Another option is called a rocking stitch, where the quilter has one hand, usually with a finger wearing <b>a</b> <b>thimble,</b> on top of the quilt, while the other hand is located beneath the piece to push the needle back up. A third option is called [...] "loading the needle" [...] and involves doing four or more stitches before pulling the needle through the cloth. Hand quilting is still practiced by the Amish and Mennonites within the United States and Canada, and is enjoying a resurgence worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Early tubes used a {{metal or}} glass {{envelope}} atop an insulating bakelite base. In 1938 a technique {{was developed to}} use an all-glass construction with the pins fused in the glass base of the envelope. This {{was used in the}} design of a much smaller tube outline, known as the miniature tube, having 7 or 9 pins. Making tubes smaller reduced the voltage where they could safely operate, and also reduced the power dissipation of the filament. Miniature tubes became predominant in consumer applications such as radio receivers and hi-fi amplifiers. However the larger older styles continued to be used especially as higher power rectifiers, in higher power audio output stages and as transmitting tubes.Subminiature tubes with a size roughly that of half a cigarette were used in hearing-aid amplifiers. These tubes did not have pins plugging into a socket but were soldered in place. The [...] "acorn tube" [...] (named due to its shape) was also very small, as was the metal-cased RCA nuvistor from 1959, about the size of <b>a</b> <b>thimble.</b> The nuvistor was developed to compete with the early transistors and operated at higher frequencies than those early transistors could. The small size supported especially high-frequency operation; nuvistors were used in UHF television tuners and some HiFi FM radio tuners (Sansui 500A) until replaced by high-frequency capable transistors.|$|E
