5|$|A {{scene in}} the pre-title {{sequence}} was filmed during the same block as episodes three and four, which were directed by Sam Miller. The rest of the finale was filmed several weeks later. The inside of <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> van used in a few scenes were shot at a set {{right next to the}} Grid set; using a set would be more manageable for the filming crew. A military school in Belgravia was used to film two separate locations; the Home Office and Lindemann's office. Other scenes at the Home Office were filmed in a separate building in Roehampton.|$|E

Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns on a video camera and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Al-Saleem is shown arrested in his own SUV by Marwan Se-Kia, Hani Salaam's security officer.|$|E
5|$|Following Olivia's disappearance, Peter discovers <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> {{camera in}} her apartment. He takes its memory device, {{which has been}} {{overwritten}} numerous times like a palimpsest, to Walter Bishop's (John Noble) laboratory, using forensic tools to examine previous images on the disc. Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) take Nina into custody, learning that someone with Nina's bio-metric signature had accessed the Massive Dynamic supply of Cortexiphan {{over the last few}} months; Nina is surprised by this but refuses to talk. As they work, Walter accuses Peter of taking advantage of Olivia's state, even if unintentionally, imprinting his memories of Olivia of the original timeline onto her. They identify a face belonging to Leland Spivey (Monte Markham), a man with ties to Jones and Nina, and Peter suspects that they are dosing Olivia with Cortexiphan for nefarious purposes. Their work is disrupted by the sudden appearance of the Observer September (Michael Cerveris), bleeding from a chest wound.|$|E

5|$|The People's Committees {{led to a}} high {{percentage}} of public involvement in decision making, within the limits permitted by the RCC, but exacerbated tribal divisions. They also served as <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> system, aiding the security services in locating individuals with views critical of the RCC, leading to the arrest of Ba'athists, Marxists, and Islamists. Operating in a pyramid structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and from there to the national level, divided between the General People's Congress and the General People's Committee. Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions. In crossing regional and tribal identities, the committee system aided national integration and centralization and tightened Gaddafi's control over the state and administrative apparatus.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris. The Memorize {{corporation}} has invented a new brain implant called Sensen, which enables 99% of the population to upload and share their memories on the net, as well as remove unhappy or unpleasant memories. This gives Memorize an immense degree of control over the population and enables them to establish <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> state, which leads a small group of rebels by the name of Errorists to attempt to bring down Memorize. The invention of the Sensen has also resulted in the creation of Leapers, memory-addicted humans who have absorbed so many memories that their Sensen has degraded and they have mutated into subhuman form, now living in the sewers of Neo-Paris.|$|E

5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to itâ€¦ the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphereâ€¦ the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get the feeling that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> picture that showed that Chloe was behind the pedal to the metal. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery, and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E
5|$|The retrial {{was delayed}} {{for one day}} to give the {{defendants}} more time to prepare. The new jury selection was marked by attempts by Williams to be relieved of her duties, owing to disagreements with Shakur {{as well as with}} Hilton's attorney. Judge Arnold Bauman denied the application, but directed another lawyer, Howard Jacobs, to defend Shakur while Williams remained the attorney of record. Shakur was ejected following an argument with Williams, and Hilton left with her as jury selection continued. After the selection of twelve jurors (60 were excused), Williams was allowed to retire from the case, with Shakur officially representing herself, assisted by lawyer Florynce Kennedy. In the retrial, White testified that the six alleged robbers had saved their hair clippings to create disguises, and identified a partially obscured head and shoulder in a photo taken from <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> camera as Shakur's. Kennedy objected to this identification {{on the grounds that the}} prosecutor, assistant United States attorney Peter Truebner, had offered to stipulate that Shakur was not depicted in any of the photographs. Although both White and Rivers testified that Shakur was wearing overalls during the robbery, the person identified as Shakur in the photograph was wearing a jacket. The defense attempted to discredit White on the grounds that he had spent eight months in Matteawan Hospital for the Criminally Insane in 1968, and White countered that he had faked insanity (by claiming to be Allah in front of three psychiatrists) to get transferred out of prison.|$|E

5|$|The {{world of}} Human Revolution was {{designed}} to parallel the Greek myth of Icarus; in the myth, Icarus was flying with artificial wings, but flew {{too close to the}} sun and destroyed his wings, causing his fatal fall. The world's new reliance on and experimentation with augmentation technology mirrored the myth, with the game's narrative taking place at a crucial tipping point, the outcome of which would be decided by the player. The general focus on technology and its effect on human society also tied into the game's visual themes. The development team used multiple sources as references while creating the world and scenario. The Children of Men was used to capture the setting and resultant chaotic drama, Bioshock gave them a reference for the handling of mature themes, while the television series Rome showed how powerful people's ambitions shaped history. The sense of tension between augmented and normal humans was inspired by the similar tension between humans and mutants in the X-Men franchise. For the conspiracy elements of the plot, the team used novels Deception Point, The Firm, and Frank Herbert's Dune saga as inspiration. The desired quality of cutscenes and dialogue were directly inspired by the Grand Theft Auto and Mass Effect franchises. DeMarle termed the final product as a study in contrasts, as the implementation of augmentation technology had created a new form of divided social class system when other social barriers had fallen. Other themes used earlier in Deus Ex, such as exploring a culture of fear; the workings of <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> state; and the exploitation created by economic inequality, were paralleled in Human Revolution. To add more depth to the world and narrative, the team created supplementary written material such as emails, e-books, and cell phone-like devices called pocket secretaries.|$|E
