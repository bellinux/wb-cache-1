Henry and Seurat were in agreement that the basic elements of art—the line, particle of color, like words—could be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. In 1889 Fénéon noted that Seurat knew that the line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an <b>assessable</b> abstract <b>value,</b> in addition, to the individual pieces of color, and the relation of both to the observer's emotion.|$|R
40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Hip {{dysplasia}} {{may cause}} pain and premature hip osteoarthritis. Here, our {{objective was to}} assess the inter- and intraobserver reproducibility of radiographic hip parameter measurement in adults. METHODS: We used anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and false-profile lateral hip radiographs from 30 individuals (60 hips) enrolled in a prevalence study of hip osteoarthritis. For each hip, two independent observers recorded five parameters twice, at an interval of 1 month. The five parameters were the vertical-center-edge angle (VCE), the anterior center-edge angle (vertical-center-anterior angle, VCA), the acetabular roof angle (HTE), the neck-shaft angle (CC'D), and acetabulum depth (AD). Reproducibility was assessed using Bland-Altman plots, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and kappa coefficients for the radiographic diagnosis of hip dysplasia using widely accepted cutoffs. RESULTS: Of the 60 hips, 51 were <b>assessable.</b> Intraobserver ICC <b>values</b> ranged from 0. 72 to 0. 94 and interobserver ICC values from 0. 68 to 0. 84. Kappa coefficients were between 0. 60 and 1. 00, except for the VCA angle (κ= 0. 41). CONCLUSION: In this study, reproducibility of the main radiographic hip parameters was good according to all evaluation methods used. However, CC'D and, to an even greater extent, the VCA angle seemed challenging to measure...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A search of PUBMED/MEDLINE databases for English literature was performed. Only studies comparing 64 -slice CT angiography with conventional coronary angiography for the detection of coronary in-stent restenosis (more than 50 % stenosis) were included for analysis. Sensitivity and specificity estimates pooled across studies were tested using a fixed effects model. Fourteen studies met selection criteria for inclusion in the analysis. The mean <b>value</b> of <b>assessable</b> stents was 89 %. Prevalence of in-stent restenosis following coronary stenting was 20 % among these studies. Pooled estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of overall 64 -slice CT angiography for the detection of coronary instent restenosis was 90 % (95 % CI: 86 %, 94 %) and 91 % (95 % CI: 90 %, 93 %), respectively, based on the evaluation of <b>assessable</b> stents. Diagnostic <b>value</b> of 64 -slice CT angiography was found to decrease significantly when the analysis was performed with inclusion of nonassessable segments in five studies, with pooled sensitivity and specificity being 79 % (95 % CI: 68 %, 88 %) and 81 % (95 % CI: 77 %, 84 %). Stent diameter is the main factor affecting the diagnostic value of MSCT angiography. Conclusion: Our results showed that 64 -slice CT angiography has high diagnostic value (both sensitivity and specificity) for detection of coronary in-stent restenosis based on assessable segments when compared to conventional coronary angiography...|$|R

40|$|Fra i temi affrontati dalla legge 11 marzo 2011, n. 23, recante delega al governo per un sistema fiscale più equo, spiccano le questioni fondamentali della riforma catastale e della fiscalità energetico-ambientale, di cui si tratta nel presente studio. La nuova riforma del catasto dei fabbricati aspira a realizzare un sistema fiscale più perequato at-traverso la rimozione della disparità fra redditi (e valori) catastali e redditi (e valori) osservabili nei mercati immobiliari. Il tema catastale è rilevante per i molteplici effetti fiscali che ne derivano, e il divario esistente fra i valori di mercato e quelli catastali, hanno suscitato un grande interesse degli studiosi di estimo, stimolando la produzione di una mole di interventi di natura teorica, sulle finalità ed obiettivi del catasto, ed operativa, con sperimentazioni e proposte di procedimenti estimativi immobiliari professionali o appositamente concepiti per le applicazioni ca-tastali. Questi studi affrontato le tematiche suddette principalmente in rapporto agli immobili a destinazione ordinaria e ai fondi agricoli. Le problematiche di equità fiscale che la legge delega intende affrontare mediante la riforma del catasto dei fabbricati emergono, tuttavia, non soltanto nell’ambito delle {{categorie}} di immobili a destinazione ordinaria, ma altresì per gli immobili a destinazione speciale. Questo contributo approfondisce il tema in rapporto agli impianti per la produzione energetica da fonti alternative diffuse sul territorio (irraggiamento solare e vento). Il diverso “potenziale energetico locale” dei vari siti geografici, consente di rilevare una “rendita solare” differenziale che si concretizza in una variegata redditività di analoghi impianti a fonti rinnovabili diffuse installati su territori con localizzazione geografica differente. Alla luce di tale osservazione, si evidenziano i li-miti del procedimento adottato dal sistema normativo italiano e dalla prassi catastale per la stima della rendita catastale degli impianti a fonti rinnovabili e si proporre un rimedio coerente con gli obiettivi di incentivazione delle produzioni energetiche a più elevata qualità ambientale, da perseguire anche mediante un’adeguata fiscalità energetica, come prescrive l’art. 15 della legge delega in oggetto. Among {{the topics}} {{addressed by the}} Law of 11 March 2014 n. 23, delegating to the government for a fairer tax system, there are two fundamental issues which {{are the subject of}} this study, the cadastral reform and the energy and environmental taxation. The new reform of the cadastre of buildings aspires to achieve a more equalized tax system by removing the disparity between cadastral incomes (and <b>assessable</b> <b>values)</b> and incomes (and property values) observable in real estate markets. The Law n. 23 / 2014 also introduces the necessity of defining an energy-environmental taxation in order to promote the growth of green economy. The definition of an energy and environmental taxation is very broad issue. It includes many aspects related to the activities of production and consumption. However, with regard {{to the development of the}} electric energy market from renewable sources, it is referable to the theme of greater correspondence between cadastral incomes and values and respective incomes and values in actual market. The disparity in the definition of cadastral incomes and values affects the whole system of taxation that comes from them. It is the whole system of real estate taxation, including on property taxes or taxes on other real rights on real estate, the taxes due in the sale and transfer by gift or inheritance of properties and also the income tax of individuals. For the resulting consequences on the tax system, the gap between real estate market values and cadastral values have aroused great interest of appraisal scholars, that agree on the need for similarity of assessed values registered in the cadastre and values detectable on actual market. This condition must be satisfied in order to allow the cadastre to perform properly its own fiscal function. The cadastral estimation applied to buildings in ordinary destination generates inequalities arising in part from the macroscopic analysis of the built environment - which set aside an accurate segmentation of the housing market - and in part by the application of the estimation procedure "for classes and rates", in which the linking scales of real estate earnings and the linking scale of municipalities allow us to attribute to individual real estate units the relative rates of cadastral estimation. These apply to consistencies of the surface obtained, in their turn, with automatic coefficients for the conversion of the cadastral rooms. Issues of tax equity similar to those that the delegating law wants to address through the reform of the cadastre of buildings belonging to ordinary cadastral categories (A, B and C) emerge also in relation to real estate immovable for special purposes and for lands. For what concerns power plants using renewable energy sources, the theme of the lack of fairness in taxation for real estate properties for special purpose is of great importance for supporting the development of green economy in Italy. The present contribution deals with the theme of equity in attribution of cadastral incomes to installations for the production of electric energy using alternative sources scattered on the land (solar irradiation and wind power). A remedy for reducing inequality of incomes attributed according to current cadastral praxis is proposed. In Italy, the electricity production market from renewable sources was still negligible at the end of the nineties. Following the impetus provided by incentive policies adopted since 2001, the program "Photovoltaic roofs" and the five subsequent versions of the so-called "Energy Account", it has developed rapidly in the fields of photovoltaic and wind power. With the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (PAN) and the recent National Energy Strategy (SEN), developed in the context of energy and environmental policies promoted by the Euro-pean Union, Italy has made specific commitments on development of use of renewable energy sources and on the reduction of the production of greenhouse gases. These commitments require, among other things, a new increase in the produc-tion of electric energy by technologies free from production of greenhouse gases. Therefore, the issue of fairness in the attribution of cadastral income to installations producing electric energy by renewable sources, already involving a large number of plants, will affect in the short to medium term a growing number of installations, and most importantly, a significantly higher in-stalled power, with considerable effects on tax revenues resulting from the tax base of cadastral nature. In general, the photovoltaic and wind power plants belong to the cadastral category "D/ 1 - factories", unless they have a modest power and are in-tended for self-consumption or are classifiable in the category "D/ 10 " of "factory buildings for the production functions related to agricultural activities". Operational difficulties related to the lack of active markets for lease and sale of property units intended for special and particular use are found more so in the still latent market for solar and wind power installations. This circumstance makes it inapplicable, in cadastral praxis, the direct estimation procedure of the cadastral income for derivation from the gross average annual lease fee. A similar difficulty arises in the application of the indirect estimating method of the cadastral income derived from the capital value. Therefore, the cadastral praxis commonly resorts to the indirect process deriving income from the capital value expressed by the value of the reconstruction cost. Therefore, the annual income of wind and photovoltaic power plants surveyed in the cadastral category D/ 1 is determined by multiplying the reconstruction cost of the installation by an appropriate fruitfulness rate. Based on the in-dications of the prevailing case law, the latter is assumed to be equal to 2...|$|R
40|$|Despite over a century’s disputation and {{attendant}} {{opportunity for}} clarification, {{the field of}} inquiry now loosely labeled “welfare economics” (WE) remains surprisingly prone to foundational confusions. The same holds of work done by many practitioners of WE’s influential offshoot, normative “law and economics” (LE). A conspicuous contemporary case of confusion turns up in recent discussion concerning “fairness versus welfare. ” The very naming of this putative dispute signals a crude category error. “Welfare” denotes a proposed object of distribution. “Fairness” describes and appropriate pattern of distribution. Welfare itself is distributed fairly or unfairly. “Fairness versus welfare” is analytically on all fours with locutions of the form “warmth versus clothing” or “ 35 mph versus tennis balls. ” Framing disputes in this way leads us nowhere. It only miscarries our thinking. A more venerable source of perplexity {{is found in the}} hallowed Pareto criterion (PC) and its conceptual kin. One proffered advantage of the PC is its purportedly enabling “us” to sidestep contested questions of interpersonal comparison, aggregation and distribution. But what manner of collective agent – what “we” – might plausibly be expected to take interest in unavoidably resource-distributive prescriptions, without view to the propriety with which these treat each member of the collectivity effectively addressed by the prescriptions, is left unidentified. And as soon as we plausibly fill-in the gap, the PC and kin prove prescriptively sterile. We get nowhere until we confront distributions – and de facto distributors – head-on. This Mongraph seeks to lay out with some care both when, and how, such confronting should be done. It specifies both the conditions, and the appropriately structured mode of analysis, under which distributive-ethical assessment is called for and apt to bear fruit. The means to success lie in carefully mapping the constitutive structure – the full valence grammar – of distribution-implicative claims. Effectively normative claims concerning distributions wrought by legal rules, programs or policies, if they would be so much as cognitively complete let alone ethically <b>assessable,</b> must assign <b>values</b> to all variables opened by the case grammar of “to distribute” and cognate infinitives – “to allocate,” “to apportion,” “to mete out,” etc. They must, that is, determinately and inter-compatibly indicate to whom claims are in effect being addressed, what is effectively being distributed, pursuant to what pattern the latter is being distributed, by what means and to whom. To be normatively defensible, in turn, such claims must not only carefully specify, but also must ethically justify, the jointly compatible values they proffer for filling those variables. The normative payoff of the mode of analysis proposed here is a compelling distributive ethic, a means of rendering past and present foundational disputes both tractable and conclusively resoluble, and in the end a new research agenda for what the Article labels an “ethically intelligible law and economics. ...|$|R
