5000|$|The <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> (Spodoptera exempta) {{also called}} okalombo, kommandowurm, or nutgrass armyworm, is an African moth. It {{is a very}} {{deleterious}} pest, capable of destroying entire crops {{in a matter of}} weeks. The larvae feed on all types of grasses, early stages of cereal crops (e.g., corn, rice, wheat, millet, sorghum), sugar cane, and occasionally on coconut. [...] The armyworm gets its name from its habit of [...] "marching" [...] in large numbers from grasslands into crops. African armyworms tend to occur at very high densities during the rainy season, especially after periods of prolonged drought. [...] During the long dry season in eastern Africa, population densities are very low. Because outbreaks are never observed during the dry season, it is called the [...] "off-season" [...] by those who monitor African armyworms.|$|E
5000|$|S. exempta moths live about 10 days. The female can lay {{a maximum}} of about 1000 eggs in her lifetime. The ivory-coloured eggs of the <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> are laid in {{clusters}} on leaves. Eggs hatch in 2-5 days. Six larval (caterpillar) instars are completed in 2-3 weeks. Caterpillars occur in two morphologically distinct forms: a [...] "gregarious" [...] form, which is black with yellow stripes, and a solitary form, which is green or brown. The morphological form is determined by density [...] - [...] becoming [...] "gregarious" [...] at higher densities; it is these [...] "gregarious" [...] forms that cause outbreaks. However, the African armyworms do not exhibit the true gregarious behavior of locusts. Generally, African armyworms are not noticed by farmers until the caterpillars are 10 days old and change from green to black. [...] In the last instar, larvae burrow 2-3 cm into the ground to pupate. Adults emerge in 7 to 10 days. [...] The moths probably migrate over tens, and probably over hundreds, of kilometers between their emergence sites and their oviposition sites, causing outbreaks to occur suddenly in areas that were free of the pests for several months.|$|E

On 28 January 2009, the President of Liberia {{declared a state}} of emergency to deal with the infestation of army worms in the country.December 2009 had an infestation of ten regions of Tanzania. The infested regions include three of the five main grain-producing regions. The other two major grain-producing regions are at risk of infestation. Tanzania has trained farmers in fighting armyworms since 2007, and responded to forecasts of the late 2009 infestation by sending out hundreds of liters of pesticides to rural farmers. The first infestation was reported on 22 December and quickly spread to surrounding regions. The previous growing season had Tanzania produce 10.872 million tons of grain; after 10.337 million tons of domestic consumption, the remaining 0.534 million tons were exported. By 31 December almost 1400 acre of grain had been destroyed by armyworms.|$|R
40|$|Current anticholinesterase {{pesticides}} {{were developed}} during World War II and are toxic to mammals because they target a catalytic serine residue of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) in insects and in mammals. A sequence analysis of AChEs from 73 species and a three-dimensional {{model of a}} malaria-carrying mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) AChE (AgAChE) reported here show that C 286 and R 339 of AgAChE are conserved {{at the opening of}} the active site of AChEs in 17 invertebrate and four insect species, respectively. Both residues are absent in the active site of AChEs of human, monkey, dog, cat, cattle, rabbit, rat, and mouse. The 17 invertebrates include house mosquito, Japanese encephalitis mosquito, African malaria mosquito, German cockroach, Florida lancelet, rice leaf beetle, <b>African</b> bollworm, beet <b>armyworm,</b> codling moth, diamondback moth, domestic silkworm, honey bee, oat or wheat aphid, the greenbug, melon or cotton aphid, green peach aphid, and English grain aphid. The four insects are house mosquito, Japanese encephalitis mosquito, African malaria mosquito, and German cockroach. The discovery of the two invertebrate-specific residues enables the development of effective and safer pesticides that target the residues present only in mosquito AChEs rather than the ubiquitous serine residue, thus potentially offering an effective control of mosquito-borne malaria. Anti-AgAChE pesticides can be designed to interact with R 339 and subsequently covalently bond to C 286. Such pesticides would be toxic to mosquitoes but not to mammals...|$|R
50|$|Pests are {{becoming}} resistant to pesticides, or pesticides may be killing off the useful and necessary insects. Examples of this happening occur around the globe. Tanzania experienced a particularly horrible infection of armyworms in 2005. At the infections peak, {{there were over}} 1000 larva per square meter. In 2009, Liberia experienced {{a state of emergency}} when invading <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> caterpillars began what became a regional food crisis. The caterpillars traveled through 65 towns and 20 000 people were forced to leave their homes, markets, and farms. Losses like this can cost millions to billions, depending on size and duration, and have severe effects on food security. The FAO has created an international team, the Plant Production and Protection Division, which is attempting to ‘reduce reliance on pesticides’ and ‘demonstrate that pesticide use often can be reduced considerably without affecting yields or farmer profits' in these, and other hard-struck areas.Water stress, desertification, and erosion are leading to loss of arable land. Agricultural practices use the bulk of the Earth’s fresh water - up to 70 percent - and those numbers are predicted to rise by 50-100 percent by 2025’. Countries are being forced to divert more water than ever before to irrigate their land. Hydroelectric dams and mega-canal projects {{are becoming}} the new standard for countries like Egypt that can no longer depend on rainfall or natural flood cycles. These water shortages are also causing a source of conflict between neighboring nations as they live with increasingly high levels of water scarcity. Policy responses to these events could be implemented in order to strengthen the socio-economic growth, human health statuses, and environmental sustainability of these areas. Combining current limitations with water and transitions from practices such as agroforestry and shifting cultivation makes land susceptible to aeolian erosion by weakening soil composition and exposing larger areas of land to destructive wind. Aeolian erosion largely effects deserted areas, reducing air quality, polluting water sources, and limiting fertility of nearby land.|$|E

40|$|The <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> Spodoptera exempta (Walker) is an {{important}} migratory pest of cereal crops and grasslands in sub-Saharan Africa.

The <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> is known to cause extensive damage to maize crops and rangeland in the transition zone of Ghana. The work reported here was {{an investigation of the}} relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), rainfall and temperature and how they influence the outbreak of this moth species in the Ejura-Sekyeredumase district of Ghana.

A strong similarity between temporal patterns of vegetation index and rainfall was established. On the other hand, the temporal pattern of temperature runs opposite to NDVI and rainfall patterns. Standardized NDVI anomaly revealed periods of low vegetation index with corresponding high wetness denoting damage to vegetation due to the activities of the insects during outbreaks. These revelations confirm reports gathered from local famers. NDVI therefore appears to be a good predictor of armyworm outbreaks.

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF AMNA E. ELGUZOULI, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} ZOOLOGY, {{presented}} on May 8, 2012, at Southern Illinois University TITLE: Mitochondrial DNA sequence {{variation in the}} <b>African</b> <b>Armyworm</b> Spodoptera exempta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) MAJOR PROFESSOR: Kamal M. Ibrahim The <b>African</b> <b>Armyworm</b> remains problematic as a serious pest of cereals in sub-Sahara Africa. The population genetic structure of African armyworms was investigated {{to better understand the}} species 2 ̆ 7 population dynamics {{and the extent to which}} the two major outbreak areas in East Africa and Southern Africa are linked by gene flow. Specifically, I characterized the genetic variation of armyworm samples from Tanzania and South Africa and assessed whether the periodic swarming of armyworms homogenizes populations throughout the species range. The variability of a range of mitochondrial genes was screened. A 413 base pair long fragment of the Cytochrome Oxidase I gene (COI), located within positions 1688 to 2175 of the reference locust mitochondrial genome was found to be an ideal marker. This sequence is part of the Folmer region of the COI gene that is used as a 2 ̆ 7 barcode 2 ̆ 7 for all animal taxa. Haplotype diversity was found to be comparable to reports in the Spruce Budworm (Choristoneuru fumiferana), which, like the <b>African</b> <b>armyworm,</b> undergoes sporadic population buildup. The sequences were A+T rich particularly at the first codon position confirming previous findings in other insect species. ii A population genetic analysis of the sequence variation revealed that <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> populations are genetically structured and do not form a single panmictic population. Despite the limited sampling in this study, a clear picture of significant genetic separation between Tanzanian and South <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> populations has been confirmed. This leads to the conclusion that the extent of mixing resulting from the well documented tracking of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone by outbreak populations does not connect Tanzanian and South Africa armyworm populations. Many rare haplotypes that are one mutation step from one of two common haplotypes were observed; a parsimony based haplotype network supports the hypothesis that these rare haplotype may have arisen during the regional population expansions. However, because the southern and northern regions that were sampled share the same two common haplotypes, neither the phylogenetic trees nor the haplotype networks yielded geographic signal that show where the rare haplotypes may have evolved. The presence of many unique singleton haplotypes, coupled with the pattern of their mismatch distribution, suggests exponential growth of localized armyworm populations. Outbreak populations arise separately in different locations across the species geographic distribution; it appears that the sizes of these populations become large enough for new mutations to produce new variants in each location. The fact that the two commonest haplotypes were present both in South Africa and in Tanzania indicates that some exchange of migrants does take place between the two regions. Alternatively, since the haplotypes that are unique to each region are derived from, and a single mutation step away from, these two common haplotypes, this could indicate that the two common haplotypes were shared in the ancestral populations and that no current gene flow takes iii place. In either case, it is apparent that the periodic swarming of armyworms does not homogenize the entire species range. What are the implications of these findings to the control of armyworm infestations? Armyworm population dynamics in the species 2 ̆ 7 northern range appears to be decoupled from its population dynamics in the south. This implies that this pest 2 ̆ 7 s control strategies need to be region specific. However, this study had only two sampling points. It is plausible that a stepping-stone type of link exists in between and that I have sampled the extreme northern and southern ends of the link. A finer scale, multipoint sampling throughout the species geographic range, preferably during multiple years, is required in order to answer this question unambiguously. This would assist in developing an outbreak early warning system and in determining if multi-region control strategy is warranted. I also draw attention to another caveat to the above conclusions: a significant proportion of the divergence between the two sampling localities is attributable to two rare but highly divergent haplotypes. The possibility of these two haplotypes belonging to another, as yet unknown moth species, has been discussed. In addition to the above insights, this study has assessed the utility of the large number of universal mtDNA primers in the study of armyworm population genetics...|$|E

We also use laboratory bioassays to demonstrate that infection with one of these strains, a male-killer, increases host mortality due to SpexNPV by 6 – 14 times.

40|$|The <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> Spodoptera exempta {{is a major}} episodic migratory {{crop pest}} over much of Eastern and Southern Africa. Control of this pest has been reliant {{on the use of}} {{synthetic}} chemical insecticides. However, this approach fails to protect poor farmers and is becoming unacceptable for environmental and cost reasons. A programme of field trials was conducted in Tanzania to evaluate the endemic baculovirus, the S. exempta nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpexNPV), as an alternative control. Field trials demonstrated that both ground and aerial application of SpexNPV to armyworm outbreaks on pasture can initiate outbreaks of NPV disease and population collapses. The SpexNPV was effective when applied at 1 × 1012 occlusion bodies (OB) per hectare if applied to outbreaks early, when larvae are in I–III instar—mass mortalities appear 3 – 10 days post treatment. The data from these trials indicate that SpexNPV can have a potential role as a substitute for chemical insecticides in strategic armyworm management programmes...|$|E
40|$|Pathogens face {{numerous}} {{challenges to}} persist in hosts with low or unpredictable population densities. Strategies include horizontal transmission, such as by the production of propagules that persist in the environment, and vertical transmission from adults to offspring. While many pathogens are capable of horizontal and vertical transmission little is known of their relative roles under realistic conditions of changing population densities. Insect baculoviruses can be transmitted both horizontally and vertically, {{although much of the}} work on baculovirus transmission has focussed on horizontal transmission that can be effective at high host densities. Here, we examine the prevalence of a vertically-transmitted, covert infection of nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) in field populations of the <b>African</b> <b>armyworm,</b> Spodoptera exempta, in Tanzania. <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> is a major pest of graminaceous crops in Africa and despite its migratory nature and boom and bust dynamics, NPV epizootics are common and can be intense {{at the end of the}} multi-generation armyworm season. We found that virtually all the insects collected in the field were positive for S. exempta NPV (SpexNPV) DNA and 60 % of these insects had transcriptionally active virus. This suggests that SpexNPV is transmitted vertically at extremely high levels in field populations of S. exempta and can maintain a persistent infection without obvious symptoms. Similarly high levels of virus DNA and RNA were detected in a S. exempta colony that had been maintained in continuous culture for 5 years. This study provides an insight into mechanisms of pathogen persistence in migratory populations where hosts are unpredictable and indicates that covert infection may be more common and more relevant in disease dynamics of insects than had previously been thought. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Moths of the <b>African</b> <b>Armyworm,</b> Spodoptera exempta, {{displace}} downwind and are con-centrated by convergent wind flows {{associated with}} rainstorms. The moths land and breed, sometimes resulting in outbreaks of larvae at high densities which cause considerable dam-age to crops and grassland.

40|$|Many {{development}} interventions {{have failed}} to generate the desired impact among African resource-poor farmers for reasons including the centralised and top-down approach, lack of active community participation, and over-reliance on external information and technology delivery strategies and channels. The migrant <b>African</b> <b>armyworm,</b> Spodoptera exempta, is among the major challenges threatening livelihoods of millions of farmers in East and Southern Africa.

The new approach has been piloted and tested in several East African countries and found to be effective.

40|$|The International Red Locust Control Organisation for Central and Southern Africa (IRLCO-CSA) {{has existed}} since 1949 (when {{known as the}} International Red Locust Con-trol Service, IRLCS) after its {{establishment}} by an international convention. The formation of IRLCO-CSA was partly a result of nearly 15 years ’ work to identify sources of Red Locust (Nomadacris septemfasciata Serville) plagues and to prevent their re-occurrence. A plague of Red Locusts, which started in 1929 and ended in 1944, had affected most of Africa south of the equator and some areas further north.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis aims to improve understanding of the environmental factors affecting the epidemiology of the migratory noctuid moth pest the <b>African</b> <b>armyworm,</b> Spodoptera exempta (Walker). The role of weather as a factor causing differences in frequency and location of armyworm outbreaks between seasons is particularly examined. The work is put in context by a review of literature on insect (particulary moth) migration and of the weather and climate of eastern Africa. Armyworm reports and weather records for eastern Africa are analysed for armyworm seasons from 1972 - 88 and, for a limited dataset, {{for the beginning of}} the 1992 - 93 season. Outbreaks are classified into those derived from low-density populations (primaries) and those from previous outbreaks (secondaries). Moth migrations between outbreaks are estimated from synoptic windfields using trajectory analysis. The association between outbreaks and rainstorms within a season and the relationship between seasonal variations in outbreak frequency and rainfall are investigated. The use of satellite data for identifying rainstorms is described. The results support the hypothesis that outbreaks {{at the beginning of the}} season are derived from low-density populations and mostly occur in identifiable 'primary outbreak areas' but that most later outbreaks are secondaries. Severe outbreaks often'follow dry periods and persistent rainfall from October to December is associated with low armyworm seasons. Individual outbreaks are associated with the edge of rainstorms supporting the hypothesis that migrating moths are concentrated by rainstorm outflows before outbreak formation. The frequency of particular long-distance moth migrations is discussed in relation to hypotheses about the change in migratory potential of armyworm during the season and the reason for the apparent lack of return migration...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{investigation into}} the factors controlling migration in the <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> moth, Spodoptera exempta (Walker) was carried out using a tethered-flight technique. The methods used to culture S. exempta in the laboratory are described and evaluated., Larvae could not be satisfactorily reared on artificial diet, and a successful culture was only established when larvae were reared on freshly-cut maize leaves. A series of experiments were carried out {{to determine the effects}} of environmental conditions acting on the larvae on the flight performance of the resulting moths. Depriving larvae of food, or feeding them on leaves from, water-stressed maize plants, did not have any significant effects on the flight performance of female moths. However, when larvae were reared at high densities, a significant increase in the proportion of moths defined as "migrant" on an arbitrary criterion was observed. There was no significant difference between the wing-loadings of "migrant" and "non-migrant" moths. Observations made during the above experiments suggested that ä signifcant genetic component contributed to the determination of flight capacity. Selection experiments and the calculation of heritability estimates confirmed these expectations, and suggested that flight capacity was a polygenic character. Flight_ capacity of "migrant" moths generally declined with age. Feeding and mating did not have any, significant effects on the flight capacity of four-day old moths. No direct association could be found between flight capacity and rate of ovarian development. An hypothesis for the control of migration in S. exempta in East Africa is described. Differential selection is seen as operating between the wet and the dry seasons, with "flight"' genotypes selected for in the wet season when the potential habitat range of S. exempta expands, and "nonflight" genotypes being selected for during the dry season when habitats are isolated and topographically restricted...|$|E
40|$|Larvae of the <b>African</b> <b>armyworm,</b> Spodoptera exempta, are {{darker and}} more {{resistant}} to baculovirus infection when reared in groups (gregarious form) compared to being reared singly (solitary form). Lepidoptera that survive virus challenge as larvae could potentially retain a sublethal virus infection which is then transmitted vertically to the next generation. Here we examine whether gregarious and solitary forms of the armyworm differ in the costs of surviving virus infection and in their capacity to transmit an active baculovirus infection to their offspring. Pupae of larvae reared gregariously that survived virus challenge weighed significantly less than uninfected individuals, {{but this was not}} so for those reared solitarily. This did not, however, translate into differences in fecundity, at least under laboratory conditions. As found in previous studies, pre-oviposition period was shorter for solitary than gregarious insects, and it was also shorter for females that had been challenged with virus as larvae. Both the prevalence of egg batches containing larvae that died from nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) infection and the proportion of infected larvae within each egg batch were significantly increased (approximately doubled) when parental moths were previously challenged with the virus during their larval state. This demonstrates that horizontal transmission in one generation can elevate vertical transmission to the next generation. Moreover, prevalence of overt infection in the offspring generation was two to three times greater when parental moths were reared solitarily as larvae than when reared gregariously. Disease prevalence and proportional infection were both independent of the sex of the infected parent and whether or not the egg batch was surface-sterilized to remove potential contaminants. This suggests that the eggs are infected internally (transovarial) rather than externally (transovum). These results help to shed light on the observed temporal pattern of virus epizootics in eastern Africa...|$|E
40|$|Some animals {{change their}} feeding {{behaviour}} when infected with parasites, seeking out substances that enhance {{their ability to}} overcome infection. This self-medication' is typically considered to involve the consumption of toxins, minerals or secondary compounds. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that macronutrients can influence the immune response and that pathogen-challenged individuals can self-medicate by choosing a diet rich in protein and low in carbohydrates. Infected individuals might also reduce food intake when infected (i. e. illness-induced anorexia). Here, we examine macronutrient self-medication and illness-induced anorexia in caterpillars of the <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> (Spodoptera exempta) by asking how individuals change their feeding decisions over the time course of infection with a baculovirus. We measured self-medication behaviour across several full-sib families to evaluate the plasticity of diet choice and underlying genetic variation. Larvae restricted to diets high in protein (P) and low in carbohydrate (C) were more likely to survive a virus challenge than those restricted to diets with a low P:C ratio. When allowed free choice, virus-challenged individuals chose a higher protein diet than controls. Individuals challenged with either a lethal or sublethal dose of virus increased the P:C ratio of their chosen diets. This was mostly due to a sharp decline in carbohydrate intake, rather than an increased intake of protein, reducing overall food intake, consistent with an illness-induced anorexic response. Over time the P:C ratio of the diet decreased until it matched that of controls. Our study provides the clearest evidence yet for dietary self-medication using macronutrients and shows that the temporal dynamics of feeding behaviour depends on the severity and stage of the infection. The strikingly similar behaviour shown by different families suggests that self-medication is phenotypically plastic and not a consequence of genetically based differences in diet choice between families...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Numerous {{recent studies}} have shown that {{resident}} symbiotic microorganisms of insects play a fundamental role in host ecology and evolution. The lepidopteran pest, <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> (Spodoptera exempta), is a highly migratory and destructive species found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, that can experience eruptive outbreaks within the space of a single generation, making predicting population dynamics and pest control forecasting extremely difficult. Three strains of Wolbachia have recently been identified infecting this species in populations sampled from Tanzania. In this study, we examined the interaction between Wolbachia pipiensis infections and the co-inherited marker, mtDNA, within populations of armyworm, as a means to investigate the population biology and evolutionary history of Wolbachia and its host. Results A Wolbachia -infected isofemale line was established in the laboratory. Phenotypic studies confirmed the strain wExe 1 as a male-killer. Partial sequencing of the mitochondrial COI gene from 164 individual field-collected armyworm of known infection status revealed 17 different haplotypes. There was a strong association between Wolbachia infection status and mtDNA haplotype, with a single dominant haplotype, haplo 1 (90. 2 % prevalence), harbouring the endosymbiont. All three Wolbachia strains were associated with this haplotype. This indicates that Wolbachia may be driving a selective sweep on armyworm haplotype diversity. Despite very strong biological and molecular evidence that the samples represent a single species (including from nuclear 28 S gene markers), the 17 haplotypes did not fall into a monophyletic clade within the Spodoptera genus; with six haplotypes (2 each from 3 geographically separate populations) differing by > 11 % in their nucleotide sequence to the other eleven. Conclusions This study suggests that three strains of Wolbachia may be driving a selective sweep on armyworm haplotype diversity, and that based on COI sequence data, S. exempta is not a monophyletic group within the Spodoptera genus. This has clear implications for the use of mtDNA as neutral genetic markers in insects, and also demonstrates the impact of Wolbachia infections on host evolutionary genetics. </p...|$|E

In addition, within-host pathogen dynamics can have a strong impact on both infection outcome {{and the evolution of}} pathogen virulence, and thus, understanding the impact of pathogen diversity is important for disease management. We compared eight genetically distinguishable variants from Spodoptera exempta nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpexNPV) isolated from the <b>African</b> <b>armyworm,</b> Spodoptera exempta. NPVs are obligate killers, {{and the vast majority of}} transmission stages are not released until after the host has died. The NPV variants differed significantly in their virulence and could be clustered into two groups based on their dose–response curves. They also differed in their speed of kill and productivity (transmission potential) for S. exempta. The mixed-genotype wild-type (WT) SpexNPV, from which each variant was isolated, was significantly more virulent than any individual variant and its mean mortality rate was within the fastest group of individual variants. However, the WT virus produced fewer new infectious stages than any single variant, which might reflect competition among the variants. A survival analysis, combining the mortality and speed of kill data, confirmed the superiority of the genetically mixed WT virus over any single variant. Spodoptera exempta larvae infected with WT SpexNPV were predicted to die 2 · 7 and 1 · 9 times faster than insects infected with isolates from either of the two clusters of genotypes. Theory suggests that there are likely to be trade-offs between pathogen fitness traits. Across all larvae, there was a negative linear relationship between virus yield and speed of kill, such that more rapid host death carried the cost of producing fewer transmission stages. We also found a near-significant relationship for the same trend at the intervariant level. However, there was no evidence for a significant relationship between the induced level of mortality and transmission potential (virus yield) or speed of kill...|$|E
40|$|The use of radar to make direct {{observations}} of insects flying at altitude has provided many {{new insights into}} the phenomenon of long-range insect migration. In particular, the technique has produced a wealth of quantitative information on the spatial and temporal distribution of migrants in the air, on the direction, speed and duration of their displacements, and on their orientation behaviour. These data could not have been obtained by any other means, and it is probably fair to claim that our present knowledge of the magnitude and importance of high altitude insect movement stems very largely from radar observations. The pioneering field studies using the first specially designed entomological radar were undertaken in 1968, {{with the support of the}} UK Overseas Development Administration (ODA), and since that time ODA has been responsible for funding almost all of the applications of the technique in developing countries. The motivation for this work was the assumption that it was impossible to design efficient management strategies for migrant pest insects without a good knowledge of their migratory behaviour, and of the role which this played in their population dynamics. The ODA-funded studies thus focused primarily on pest species, and were carried out by the Radar Entomology Unit of the Natural Resources Institute (NRI) and its precursors. In this Bulletin, we give a brief account of the history of radar entomology, with emphasis on studies of insect pests. Next, the different types of entomological radar and some associated analysis methods are outlined, together with descriptions of some ancillary measurement techniques. We then describe in some detail the contributions made by the NRI Radar Unit to current knowledge of the flight patterns of a variety of major insect pests of agriculture and of human health. These pests include: grasshoppers and locusts, the <b>African</b> <b>Armyworm</b> moth, the Rice Brown Planthopper and other rice pests, the Old World Bollworm, and some mosquito vectors of human diseases. Recent developments directed towards long-term monitoring of insect aerial faunas (for environmental impact, biodiversity and conservation purposes), and towards observations of low-altitude flight, are included. The Bulletin concludes with a short overview, in which we speculate how the technique might find application in the future...|$|E
40|$|Distribution, {{frequency}} of attack and seasonal incidence of the <b>African</b> <b>armyworm</b> Spodoptera exempta (Walk.) (Lep. : Noctuidae), with particular reference to Africa and southwestern Arabia Spodoptera exempta (Walk.) is recorded very widely in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara and in adjacent parts of southwestern Arabia. It occurs intermittently through the oceanic countries of South East Asia and the Pacific as far east as Hawaii, {{but not in the}} Americas. This distribution is mapped in detail. The areas from which infestations have been reported and the {{frequency of}} attack have increased since 1970. This paper aims to help those concerned with monitoring and control of armyworm by making available the wider historical data needed for anticipating outbreaks. For the pan-African region, the monthly distribution and frequencies of incidence are presented as twelve maps showing the number of years in which infestations have been recorded in each degree-square of latitude and longitude during the period 1940 - 1982. In the areas to the north and south of about 4 °N, the periods of attack are roughly complementary and correspond with the seasonal rains. Thus from October-November until May infestations spread progressively northwards from southern Tanzania to northern Ethiopia and Yemen, {{and at the same time}} southwards from Malawi and Zimbabwe to the south of Cape Province. From June until September infestations occur intermittently from Senegal to southwestern Arabia, but very rarely south of the equator. The northward and southward progressions of outbreaks can be attributed to the migration of the moths on the wind. The scarcity of reports from all parts of the region in September-October and the start of the next season in the area between southeastern Kenya and Zimbabwe lend support to the alternative theory that outbreaks may develop from populations that remain at low density, particularly within this area. Evidence from other disciplines supporting both theories is outlined. Sequencies of attack do not follow exactly the same pattern each season. To enable years with events analogous to the current one to be identified, the range of recorded variations is appended as a series of maps showing month by month the distribution of S. exempta infestations over the last 43 years. For each territory there is an index to the years and months when outbreaks were recorded, and a summary of the monthly frequencies of occurrence. The incidence and importance of S. exempta in each country is summarised...|$|E
40|$|MSc (Environmental Sciences), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Organic {{insecticides}} play a {{big role}} in reducing the usage of chemical insecticides and their negative impact on the environment. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) spays are the only tool that organic farmers are allowed to use for the control of pests. Genetic engineering and modification of crops have been made possible with scientific advances in cell and molecular biology. These advances are used to transfer some of the Bt Cry toxins into crops for control of target species to reduce yield loss. Bt maize were commercialised {{for the first time in}} South Africa in 1998 and the economic important stem borers, Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and Sesamia calamistis (Hampson) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) were exposed to the Cry 1 Ab toxin that is found in Bt maize. Busseola fusca developed resistance to Cry 1 Ab under field conditions within eight years after it had been released. Eldana saccharina (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is a major pest on sugarcane in South Africa and although it has not been recorded on maize in this country, is it known as a major pest of maize in other African countries. <b>African</b> <b>armyworm,</b> Spodoptera exempta (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) has a very wide distribution in Africa and is known to be an occasional pest on maize. The aims of this dissertation were to determine the efficacy of Bt spray applications for control of four lepidopteran pests and whether development of Cry 1 Ab resistance by B. fusca caused a loss in susceptibility to other Bt toxins (i. e. cross-resistance). Susceptibility bioassays with 10 day old larvae were conducted under laboratory conditions. Treatments included application of various dosage rates of Dipel® and deltamethrin as well as exposure to MON 810 (maize leaves). Stemborer populations of C. partellus, E. saccharina, and B. fusca (Venda) as well as the S. exempta were effectively controlled by the Bt spray, Dipel®. Care should be taken not be interpret the percentage C. partellus, E. saccharina and S. exempta larvae that survived after exposure to MON 810 and Bt spray treatments as development of resistance without verification of these experiments with earlier instars that are known to be more susceptible. Spodoptera exempta is active throughout a year in temperate zones of Africa. If S. exempta develop resistance to Cry toxins and Bt maize events would be released for commercial planting in these areas, S. exempta pose a threat added to their injuriousness. Busseola fusca larvae were sampled from Venda (susceptible population), Ventersdorp and the Vaalharts Irrigation Scheme (resistant population). The Ventersdorp B. fusca population was controlled by MON 810 and MON 89034 and Bt sprays, but the percentage larvae that survived showed reduced susceptibility within the population. Dipel® treatments, MON 810 and MON 89034 did not provide effective control of the Vaalharts B. fusca population reported to be resistant to Cry 1 Ab, in two experiments. The high survival rates indicate a reduction in susceptibility to Cry toxins other than Cry 1 Ab and therefore development of cross resistance in the Vaalharts B. fusca population. Master...|$|E
