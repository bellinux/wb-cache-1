5|$|Childfree couples {{choose to}} not have {{children}}. These include: young couples, who plan to have children later, {{as well as those}} who do not plan to have any children. Involuntary childlessness may be caused by infertility, medical problems, death of <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>or</b> other factors.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{influenza}} {{can cause}} severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia. The obvious symptom is trouble breathing. In addition, if <b>a</b> <b>child</b> (<b>or</b> presumably an adult) {{seems to be}} getting better and then relapses with a high fever, that is a danger sign since this relapse can be bacterial pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has been}} shown to be toxic to humans and is also toxic to {{domestic}} pets such as cats and dogs. A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg body weight (mL/kg) of pure substance. That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 4 mL for a 20kg child. Poison control centers often use more than a lick or taste in <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.|$|E

5|$|Since the attack, Canadians have debated various {{interpretations of}} the events, their significance, and Lépine's motives. Many feminist groups and public {{officials}} have characterized the massacre as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal violence against women. Consequently, {{the anniversary of the}} massacre has since been commemorated as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. Other interpretations emphasize Lépine's abuse as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> suggest that the massacre was simply the isolated act of a madman, unrelated to larger social issues. Still other commentators have blamed violence in the media and increasing poverty, isolation, and alienation in society, particularly in immigrant communities.|$|E
5|$|With {{the signing}} into {{law of the}} Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 on 6 April 2015, {{same-sex}} couples {{have the ability to}} jointly adopt children and stepchildren, as well as be able to obtain parental recognition in assisted reproduction methods of child creation. On 18 January 2016, key provisions of the law (including spouses, stepparents, civil partners and cohabiting partners being able to apply to become guardians of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> for custody) went into effect, following the signing of a commencement order by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Portions of the Act allowing for joint adoption have not yet come into effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{composer}} Sergei Rachmaninoff {{produced a}} number of solo piano pieces that were either lost, unpublished, or not assigned an opus number. While often disregarded in the concert repertoire, they are nevertheless part of his oeuvre. He composed sixteen such pieces, and all others are lost. Ten of these pieces were composed before he completed his Piano Concerto No. 1, his first opus, and the rest interspersed throughout his later life. In these casual works, he draws upon the influence of other composers, including Frédéric Chopin and Pyotr Tchaikovsky. The more substantial works, the Three Nocturnes and Four Pieces, are sets of well-thought out pieces that are his first attempts at cohesive structure among multiple pieces. Oriental Sketch and Prelude in D minor, two pieces he composed very late in his life, are short works that exemplify his style as a mature composer. Whether completed as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> adult, these pieces cover {{a wide spectrum of}} forms while maintaining his characteristic Russian style.|$|E

5|$|Stela 4 {{was found}} in the {{northern}} part of the East Plaza. It was the only monument at El Chal to have been sculpted on both sides and had been moved from its original location. Due to its sculptural style and its location, it is believed to have been associated with Altars 3 and 4. The upper portion of the front of the stela bears a hieroglyphic text with a calendrical date that has been interpreted as 9.16.10.0.0. 1 Ahau 3 Zip (17 March 761) together with the site's Emblem Glyph. This side of the stela depicts a Maya bloodletting ritual with a richly dressed person standing with legs apart standing on top of three sitting prisoners, the middle of which bears his own name written upon his left leg. The principal figure bears a spear topped by a serpent head with a flint spearhead emerging from it. This spear is very similar in style to one depicted on Stela 8 at Naranjo. The reverse of the stela depicts three individuals standing upon a monster mask seen in profile. <b>A</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> youth is seated before two adult figures. All of them wear rectangular headdresses and hold something in their hands that cannot now be distinguished. Hieroglyphic texts are carved above the heads of the two standing figures and probably represent their names. The sculptural style of the two sides is different, and the foot-level of the standing figures on each side is different, with the figures on the reverse being positioned higher up the shaft than the figure on the front. This probably indicates that both sides were sculpted in situ at different times, with the reverse of the stela being crafted after the floor level of the plaza had risen to cover the base of the front side.|$|E
5|$|The best {{documented}} {{account of}} these hauntings occurred between 1968 and 1970. The Evening Herald and Evening Press newspapers carried a number of reports regarding a Mrs Margaret O'Brien and her husband Nicholas, a retired Garda superintendent, who were converting the house into an arts centre. The redevelopment had been a troubled affair with tradesmen employed on the work leaving complaining of ghosts. One night, {{a friend of the}} O'Brien's, artist Tom McAssey, and two workmen were confronted by a spectral figure and a black cat with glowing red eyes. McAssey painted a portrait of the cat which hung in the house for several years after. Although locals were sceptical of the reports, further apparitions were reported, most notably of an Indian gentleman and of two nuns called Blessed Margaret and Holy Mary who had taken part in black masses on Mount Pelier Hill. There were also reports of ringing bells and poltergeist activity. In 1970 an RTÉ television crew recorded a documentary at the house. In the documentary a clairvoyant called Sheila St. Clair communicated with the spirits of the house through automatic writing. In 1971, a plumber working in the house discovered a grave with a skeleton of a small figure, most likely that of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>or,</b> perhaps, the body of the dwarf alleged to have been sacrificed by the members of the Hell Fire Club. The house operated as a restaurant in the 1990s before closing in 2001; it is now a private residence.|$|E

Helicopter parents are so named because, like helicopters, they hover overhead, overseeing their child's life.|$|R

25|$|Most {{bedwetting}} is {{a developmental}} delay—not an emotional problem or physical illness. Only {{a small percentage}} (5% to 10%) of bedwetting cases are caused by specific medical situations. Bedwetting is frequently associated with {{a family history of}} the condition. Nocturnal enuresis is considered primary (PNE) when a child has not yet had a prolonged period of being dry. Secondary nocturnal enuresis (SNE) is when <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> adult begins wetting again after having stayed dry.|$|E

25|$|The age {{at which}} {{adolescents}} tend to become sexually active varies considerably between different cultures {{and from time to}} time. (See Prevalence of virginity.) The first sexual act of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> adolescent is sometimes referred to as the sexualization of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of virginity or innocence. Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the age of consent.|$|E
25|$|Children {{of alcoholics}} often {{incorporate}} behaviors learned as children into their marital relationships. These behaviors lead to poor parenting practices. For example, adult children of alcoholics may simultaneously express love and rejection toward <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> spouse. This {{is known as}} insecure attachment. Insecure attachment contributes to trust and bonding issues with intimate partners and offspring. In addition, prior parental emotional unavailability contributes to poor conflict resolution skills in adult relationships. Evidence shows a correlation between alcoholic fathers who display harsh and ineffective parenting practices with adolescent and adult alcohol dependence.|$|E
25|$|Although the Emperor of Ethiopia had {{theoretically}} unlimited {{power over}} his subjects, his councillors came {{to play an}} increasing role in governing Ethiopia, because many Emperors were succeeded either by <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>or</b> one of the incarcerated princes, who could only successfully leave their prisons {{with help from the}} outside. As a result, by the mid-18th century the power of the Emperor had been largely transferred to his deputies, like Ras Mikael Sehul of Tigray (ca. 1691 – 1779), who held actual power in the Empire and elevated or deposed Emperors at will.|$|E

25|$|Predictor {{models have}} {{consistently}} found that childhood trauma, chronic adversity, and familial stressors increase risk for PTSD {{as well as}} risk for biological markers of risk for PTSD after a traumatic event in adulthood. Experiencing bullying as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> an adult has been correlated {{with the development of}} PTSD. Peritraumatic dissociation in children is a predictive indicator of the development of PTSD later in life. This effect of childhood trauma, which is not well understood, may be a marker for both traumatic experiences and attachment problems. Proximity to, duration of, and severity of the trauma make an impact, and interpersonal traumas cause more problems than impersonal ones.|$|E
25|$|For {{the third}} person pronouns, Mixtec has several pronouns that {{indicate}} whether the referent is a man, a woman, an animal, <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>or</b> an inanimate object, a sacred or divine entity, or water. Some languages have respect forms for {{the man and woman}} pronouns. Some languages have other pronouns as well (such as for trees.) (These pronouns show some etymological affinity to nouns for 'man', 'woman', 'tree', etc., but they are distinct from those nouns.) These may be pluralized (in some varieties, if one wishes to be explicit) by using the common plural marker de in front of them, or by using explicit plural forms that have evolved.|$|E
