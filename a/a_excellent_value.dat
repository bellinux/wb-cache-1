This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of a skin cancer prevention program (named SunSmart) since it was introduced, together with its potential cost-effectiveness as an upgraded and ongoing national program. Methods The reduction in melanoma incidence attributable to SunSmart was modelled as the primary end-point. Historical expenditures on SunSmart were obtained from representative Australian states in three latitude zones. Melanoma incidence rates from these states were used to model key health outcomes. Non-melanoma skin cancer was modelled separately based on national survey results. Results We estimate that SunSmart has averted 28, 000 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), equivalent to 22, 000 life-years saved, {{in the state of}} Victoria since its introduction in 1988, as well as saving money from cost offset in skin cancer management (dominant). An upgraded national program for the next 20 years is estimated to avert 120, 000 DALYs, with associated reductions in the use of health care resources. It remains a dominant intervention in which every dollar invested in SunSmart will return an estimated AU$ 2. 30.

AgNO 3 solutions are used as raw materials {{in the production of}} traditional photographic materials, and it is known that contamination with metal traces can influence the quality of the films thus produced. After adding an appropriate amount of an Fe- 54 -enriched spike and permitting isotopic equilibration to take place, Ag was selectively removed from the solutions by precipitation as AgBr. Although to some extent, co-precipitation of Fe is possible under the given circumstances, an incomplete recovery of the analyte element did not affect the accuracy of the results, owing to the use of isotope dilution for calibration. NH 3 was used as a reaction gas in a quadrupole-based ICP-MS instrument, equipped with a dynamic reaction cell (DRC), providing interference-free measurement of the Fe- 54 /Fe- 56 ratio.
