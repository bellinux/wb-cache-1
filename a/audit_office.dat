On 30 September 2013, at the end of his mayoral administration, Galván was succeeded by Carlos Enrique Canturosas Villarreal of the PAN. That year, the new mayor opened an investigation against eleven former city officials alleged to be involved in the financial case. On November 8, 2016, one of the city's former financial heads, Juan Fernando Miranda Macías, was arrested for illegally using city resources. He was released from prison in two days after a judge concluded that the accusations against him were inconclusive.|$|E

The ombudsman is appointed for an eight-year term; the ombudsman's work is independent.

5|$|The {{cost of the}} Senedd {{increased}} from £12M in 1997 to £69.6M in 2006, an increase of 580%. In a report published in March 2008 by the Wales <b>Audit</b> <b>Office,</b> {{the reason for the}} difference between the two costs were that the original estimate of £12M was not based on any detailed design of the final requirements of the building. Extra costs of the building were due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks in the United States.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the Imperial War Museum {{sought to}} open a branch {{in the north of}} England. Seventy-one sites were offered for {{consideration}} by 36local councils. One such council was that of Hartlepool, in County Durham, for whom a new museum building was designed by architect Sir Norman Foster for a site on Hartlepool's dockside. In 1992 the Teesside Development Corporation offered the museum, on behalf of Hartlepool council, a total of £14.4 million towards construction and running costs. However, the National <b>Audit</b> <b>Office</b> later reported that the Corporation's offer breached government rules and negotiations were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In 1841, a new Master of the Mint, William Ewart Gladstone was appointed. Gladstone thought {{highly of}} Pistrucci and corresponded {{with him in}} Italian, but was unwilling to grant him any new {{commissions}} while the Waterloo Medal remained outstanding. By 1844, the continued expense of Pistrucci was a concern to the <b>Audit</b> <b>Office.</b> Gladstone restored cuts in Pistrucci's pay {{that had been made}} for failure to train an apprentice, and offered him a bonus of £400 to complete the medal. Pistrucci was to work solely on the one project. He vacated his home at the Royal Mint, moving to Old Windsor, where he set up a workshop to attempt the medal's completion. Although Pistrucci worked constantly on the medal during some periods, he was slowed by a fall in his cottage, which incapacitated him for much of 1846. On 1 January 1849, Pistrucci submitted the matrices of the medal to the Royal Mint, and was paid £1,500.|$|E
30|$|Auditor size (BIG 4) {{will be used}} as control {{variable}} through a dummy variable. Large <b>auditing</b> <b>offices</b> can draw on expertise of their international network that will result in higher audit quality (Carson 2009; Francis and Wang 2008). Research indicates that Big- 4 auditors possess more reputational incentives than smaller auditors and thus are less inclined to impair their independence for one client (Francis 2004). Becker et al. (1998) studied differences between firms being audited by the biggest <b>audit</b> <b>offices</b> and smaller <b>audit</b> <b>offices</b> in the context of EM, finding that smaller offices report discretionary accruals that as a percentage of total assets are on average 1.5 to 2.1 % higher than the discretionary accruals reported by clients of large auditing firms.|$|R

25|$|The {{new line}} {{will be built}} using slab track, {{although}} overtaking tracks and connections to the existing network are being built with conventional ballast. The {{distance between track centres}} will be 4.70metre and the planning width of a straight section of track is 13.30metres. In the Thuringian section of the line, the track distance was adjusted to 4.50metre in a change of plans in 1998. The planning width was reduced to 12.10metres and the cross-section of the tunnel was reduced from 101 to 92square metres. The additional cost of maintaining the larger track distances in Bavaria was estimated by the Federal <b>Audit</b> <b>Office</b> in 2014 to be at least €35 million. The Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt—EBA) stated that in Bavaria, in contrast to Thuringia, changes to the planning approval decisions would have led to a risk of third-party objections. The Federal <b>Audit</b> <b>Office</b> considered this to be inaccurate, since the reduction in the distance between the tracks in Bavaria would have reduced {{the extent to which the}} environment was affected.
