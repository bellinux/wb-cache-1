The process of assessing <b>authorised</b> <b>releases</b> in Scotland has recently begun. All authorised discharges from non-nuclear sites to the marine environment have been identified.

40|$|Abstract. In the UK, {{research}} {{funded by}} the Environment Agency/English Nature has provided a series of spreadsheet-based assessment tools for calculating doses received by biota in coastal, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. The approach uses the reference organism concept where the organism of interest (feature species) is equated to a particular reference organism (based on its physical geometry and ecology). This paper describes the stages followed to collate additional species-, and site-, specific data and to undertake assessments to determine whether Natura 2000 sites are adequately protected from <b>authorised</b> <b>releases</b> of ionising radiation. The feature species used for the assessment were species listed under the EC Birds and Habitats Directives. The paper will describe the overall assessment process followed by the UK Environment Agency, demonstrating the staged assessment process adopted; how each feature species is mathematically aligned with the most appropriate reference organism geometry; and provide {{an example of the}} assessment conducted for the Natura 2000 sites located in the Humber Estuary, UK. 1...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemistry)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. Radiostrontium (90 Sr and 89 Sr) {{has been}} {{released}} to the environment by global fall-out following atmospheric nuclear explosions, by waste discharges and fall-out from the Chernobyl. 89 Sr, with a half-life of 50. 5 days, quickly decays to undetectable levels, while 90 Sr is radiobiologically more important because of its longer half-life of 28. 78 years, and because it behaves chemically similar to Ca, and accumulates in bones and teeth. Cost effective and relatively simple procedures for determination of radiostrontium are desirable. An accurate determination of radionuclides from various sources in the environment is essential for assessment of the potential hazards and suitable countermeasures both in case of accidents, <b>authorised</b> <b>releases</b> and routine surveillances. Reliable radiochemical separation and detection techniques are needed for accurate determination of alpha and beta emitters. Rapid analytical methods are needed {{in case of an}} accident for early decision-making. At the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station (KNPS), 90 Sr analysis are performed on liquid effluent samples making use of the traditional fuming nitric acid method, and subsequent counting of particulate samples on an alpha/beta proportional counter. This method is often at times very time – consuming, and involves many precipitation steps. The use of fuming nitric acid is also very dangerous and could lead to severe personnel injuries {{in the event of an}} accident. This project focussed on the application of Sr-Spec resin in the analysis of 90 Sr. This work presents the methods for 90 Sr analysis for both effluent samples as well as environmental samples. This research also focussed on the calibration of the different radiometric instruments, which are the Liquid Scintillation Counter, the Alpha/Beta Counter as well as the Gamma Detector...|$|E

40|$|Online at stacks. iop. org/JRP/ 21 / 337 Measurements of tritium (3 H) {{activity}} in marine {{species in the}} Severn Estuary (UK) show concentrations significantly above those predicted by standard models. Concentration factors of 104 between seawater and marine species are observed; standard models assume a concentration factor of 1. In addition, {{the vast majority of}} activity is present in the form of organically bound tritium (OBT). The critical group dose from tritium—to consumers of local flounder— is estimated as ∼ 36 µSv per annum. The measurements are related to the <b>authorised</b> <b>release</b> of wastes, via the sewer system, from the Amersham plc plant at Cardiff. The radiochemical plant manufactures a wide range of isotopically labelled compounds for use in life science research.
