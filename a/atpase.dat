5|$|The 19S {{particle}} in eukaryotes {{consists of}} 19 individual proteins and is divisible into two subassemblies, a 9-subunit base that binds {{directly to the}} α ring of the 20S core particle, and a 10-subunit lid. Six of the nine base proteins are <b>ATPase</b> subunits from the AAA Family, and an evolutionary homolog of these ATPases exists in archaea, called PAN (Proteasome-Activating Nucleotidase). The association of the 19S and 20S particles requires the binding of ATP to the 19S <b>ATPase</b> subunits, and ATP hydrolysis {{is required for the}} assembled complex to degrade folded and ubiquitinated proteins. Note that only the step of substrate unfolding requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, while ATP-binding alone can support all the other steps required for protein degradation (e.g., complex assembly, gate opening, translocation, and proteolysis). In fact, ATP binding to the ATPases by itself supports the rapid degradation of unfolded proteins. However, while ATP hydrolysis is required for unfolding only, it is not yet clear whether this energy may be used in the coupling of some of these steps.|$|E
5|$|The 20S {{proteasome}} is both ubiquitous {{and essential}} in eukaryotes. Some prokaryotes, including many archaea and the bacterial order Actinomycetales also share homologs of the 20S proteasome, whereas most bacteria possess heat shock genes hslV and hslU, whose gene products are a multimeric protease {{arranged in a}} two-layered ring and an <b>ATPase.</b> The hslV protein has been hypothesized to resemble the likely ancestor of the 20S proteasome. In general, HslV is not essential in bacteria, and not all bacteria possess it, whereas some protists possess both the 20S and the hslV systems. Many bacteria also possess other homologs of the proteasome and an associated <b>ATPase,</b> most notably ClpP and ClpX. This redundancy explains why the HslUV system is not essential.|$|E

In {{addition to these}} actions on DNA, the thyroid hormones also act within the cell membrane or within cytoplasm via reactions with enzymes, including calcium <b>ATPase,</b> adenylyl cyclase, and glucose transporters.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of TnI is to control striated muscle contraction and relaxation. Troponin I interacts with all major regulatory proteins in the sarcomeric thin filaments of cardiac and skeletal muscles: troponin C, troponin T, tropomyosin and actin. When cytosolic Ca2+ is low, TnI binds the thin filament {{to block the}} myosin binding sites on actin. The rise of cytosolic Ca2+ results in binding to the N-terminal domain of troponin C and induces conformational changes in troponin C and the troponin complex, which releases the inhibition of myosin-actin interaction and activates myosin <b>ATPase</b> and cross bridge cycling to generate myosin power strokes and muscle contraction.|$|E
5|$|Although the receptors for systemins and HypSys remain poorly understood, we have {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the signal transduction that occurs once the peptide had bound to its receptor. Jasmonic acid is an essential, albeit late component, in the systemin and wound-signalling pathways. In tomato, the signal is transduced from the receptor by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Cosilencing of two MAPKs, MPK1 and MPK2, in tomato compromised their defence response against insect larvae compared to wild type plants. Cosilencing these genes also decreased production of jasmonic acid and of jasmonic acid-dependent defence genes. Applying methyl jasmonate to cosilenced plants rescued them, indicating that jasmonates are the signal responsible for causing changes in gene expression. The alkalisation of the apoplast is a downstream effect of signalling processing by MAPKs. Applying fusicoccin, which activates the H+ <b>ATPase</b> inhibited by systemin, along with systemin still activates MAPKs, even though the pH of the apoplast does not change.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEvolution of P 5 type <b>ATPases</b> {{marks the}} origin of eukaryotes but still they remain the least {{characterized}} pumps in the superfamily of P-type <b>ATPases.</b> Phylogenetic analysis of available sequences suggests that P 5 <b>ATPases</b> should be divided into at least two subgroups, P 5 A and P 5 B. P 5 A <b>ATPases</b> {{have been identified in}} the endoplasmic reticulum and seem to have basic functions in protein maturation and secretion. P 5 B <b>ATPases</b> localize to vacuolar/lysosomal or apical membranes and in animals play a role in hereditary neuronal diseases. Here we have used a bioinformatical approach to identify differences in the primary sequences between the two subgroups. P 5 A and P 5 B <b>ATPases</b> appear have a very different membrane topology from other P-type <b>ATPases</b> with two and one, respectively, additional transmembrane segments inserted in the N-terminal end. Based on conservation of residues in the transmembrane region, the two P 5 subgroups most likely have different substrate specificities although these cannot be predicted from their sequences. Furthermore, sequence differences between P 5 A and P 5 B <b>ATPases</b> are identified in the catalytic domains that could influence key kinetic properties differentially. Together these findings indicate that P 5 A and P 5 B <b>ATPases</b> are structurally and functionally different...|$|R
5|$|C-terminal truncation: The C-terminal end {{segment is}} the most conserved region of TnI. As an {{allosteric}} structure regulated by Ca2+ in the troponin complex, it binds and stabilizes the position of tropomyosin in low Ca2+ state implicating {{a role in the}} inhibition of actomyosin <b>ATPase.</b> A deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids was found during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. It was also seen in myocardial stunning in coronary bypass patients. Over-expression of the C-terminal truncated cardiac TnI (cTnI1-192) in transgenic mouse heart resulted in a phenotype of myocardial stunning with systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. Replacement of intact cTnI with cTnT1-192 in myofibrils and cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal tension development but decreased the rates of force redevelopment and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} subcomponents {{are often}} referred to by their Svedberg sedimentation coefficient (denoted S). The proteasome most exclusively used in mammals is the cytosolic 26S proteasome, which is about 2000 kilodaltons (kDa) in molecular mass containing one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded; openings at the two ends of the core allow the target protein to enter. Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory subunit that contains multiple <b>ATPase</b> active sites and ubiquitin binding sites; it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core. An alternative form of regulatory subunit called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially {{the same manner as}} the 19S particle; the 11S {{may play a role in}} degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a virus.|$|E
5|$|Two {{special classes}} of protein {{deal with the}} ionic {{gradients}} found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps. Both pumps and channels are integral membrane proteins that pass through the bilayer, but their roles are quite different. Ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher chemical potential. The energy source can be ATP, {{as is the case}} for the Na+-K+ <b>ATPase.</b> Alternatively, the energy source can be another chemical gradient already in place, as in the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter. It is through the action of ion pumps that cells are able to regulate pH via the pumping of protons.|$|E

These were the chlorophytes Ostreococcus tauria and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and the streptophytes Physcomitrella patens (a moss), Selaginella moellendorffii (a primitive vascular plant), and Arabidopsis thaliana (a model flowering plant). Each organism contained sequences for all five subfamilies of P-type <b>ATPases.</b> Our analysis demonstrates when specific subgroups of P-type <b>ATPases</b> disappeared in the evolution of Angiosperms. Na/K-pump related P 2 C <b>ATPases</b> were lost with the evolution of streptophytes whereas Na+ or K+ pumping P 2 D <b>ATPases</b> and secretory pathway Ca 2 +-ATPases remained until mosses. An N-terminally located calmodulin binding domain in P 2 B <b>ATPases</b> can only be detected in pumps from Streptophytae, whereas, like in animals, a C-terminally localized calmodulin binding domain might be present in chlorophyte P 2 B Ca 2 +-ATPases.

5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the {{interstitial}} fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and nitrous oxide into the CSF.

Thus, this plant harbors a primary transport capability not seen in any other eukaryotic organism sequenced so far. The sequences group in all five subfamilies of P-type <b>ATPases.</b> The most prominent subfamilies are P 1 B <b>ATPases</b> (heavy metal pumps; seven members), P 2 A and P 2 B <b>ATPases</b> (Ca 2 + pumps; 14 in total), P 3 A <b>ATPases</b> (plasma membrane H+ pumps; 12 members including a truncated pump, which might represent a pseudogene or an ATPase-like protein with an alternative function), and P 4 <b>ATPases</b> (12 members). P 4 <b>ATPases</b> have been implicated in aminophosholipid flipping but it is not known whether this is a direct or an indirect effect of pump activity. Despite this apparent plethora of pumps, Arabidopsis appears to be lacking Na+ pumps and secretory pathway (PMR 1 -like) Ca 2 +-ATPases.

TFSSs encode {{two or three}} <b>ATPases</b> generating energy for the secretion process. These enzymes exhibit highest sequence conservation among type four secretion components. Results Here, we report the biochemical characterization of three <b>ATPases</b> namely TraE, TraJ and TraK (VirB 4, VirB 11 and VirD 4 homologs of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfer system, respectively) from the transfer system of Aeromonas veronii plasmid pAC 3249 A. <b>ATPases</b> were expressed as His-tag fusion proteins in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis experiments were performed with the purified <b>ATPases.</b> TraE and TraK showed strong binding to TNP-ATP and TNP-CTP (fluorescent analogs of ATP and CTP respectively) whereas TraJ showed weak binding. The optimum temperature range for the three <b>ATPases</b> was between 42 °C and 50 °C.

We and others have demonstrated that proteasome components bind to sites of gene transcription, regulate covalent modifications to histones, and are involved in the assembly of activator complexes in mammalian cells. The mechanisms by which the proteasome influences transcription remain unclear, although prior observations suggest both proteolytic and non-proteolytic activities.
