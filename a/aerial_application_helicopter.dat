30|$|If {{the use of}} {{chemical}} PPPs is unavoidable, they should be applied making the best possible use of the available technology and economically justifiable options for risk management. The goal is to stop PPP residues—to the extent possible—from entering into or spreading to non-target areas, natural assets (e.g., groundwater and surface waters) and habitats adjacent to the application areas. Although this will never be completely feasible, further improvements are possible through technical risk management. Technology should ensure that the PPPs are applied as accurately as possible and without losses and spillage—whether they are in solid form (seed coating and granulates) or in liquid form (for spraying). In contrast, <b>aerial</b> <b>applications</b> (e.g., by <b>helicopter)</b> are difficult to control and are, therefore, generally banned in Germany under the Plant Protection Act. There are a few exceptions, for example treating the crown zone of forests or steep vineyard slopes [9, 56]. When applying PPPs on arable land and for special crops (fruits, vines, and hops), it is usually necessary to use mobile spraying gear with drift-reducing nozzle technology. Introducing the best available nozzle technologies is thus {{an effective way to}} reduce environmental pollution by PPP residues. The German NAP formulates the same target but without specifying any measures to be adopted. Possible options include the introduction of an appropriate innovation and subsidy programme or granting tax credits for the adoption of modern technology.|$|R
40|$|Wire strikes are a {{significant}} cause of helicopter accidents. The aircraft most at risk are aerial applicators. The present study examines {{the effectiveness of a}} wire alert delivered by way of the lightbar, a GPS-based guidance system for <b>aerial</b> <b>application.</b> The alert lead-time needed to avoid an invisible wire is compared with that to avoid a visible wire. A flight simulator was configured to simulate an agricultural <b>application</b> <b>helicopter.</b> Two pilots flew simulated spray runs in fields with visible wires, invisible wires, and no wires. The wire alert was effective in reducing wire strikes. A lead-time of 3. 5 sec was required for the alert to be effective. The lead- time required was the same whether the pilot could see the wire or not...|$|R

Many countries have severely limited <b>aerial</b> <b>application</b> of pesticides and other products because of environmental and public health hazards like spray drift; most notably, the European Union banned it outright with a few highly restricted exceptions in 2009, effectively ending the practice in all member states.|$|R

30|$|The eucalypts at the {{incursion}} {{site had}} an average height of 20 – 30  m, so the only effective insecticide application method was by aerial spraying. Given {{the nature of the}} environment, it was important to minimise spray drift. Prior modelling using specialised software (spray drift AGDISP) enabled subsequent <b>aerial</b> <b>applications</b> to be undertaken with minimum drift, thus maximising efficacy for a successful eradication within a semi-rural environment. Moreover, the spot-spraying technique allowed better targeted treatment than broadcast spraying, which provided a safer option for isolated trees close to houses. Spot-spraying was also applied to trees that had been sprayed using a conventional boom because it provided good coverage of insecticide throughout the canopy and on the lower leaf surfaces (Strand et al. 2014) where larvae were often observed. The spot-spraying technique used here was a modification of the spot-gun, developed to control invasive wilding pines (Gous et al. 2014) and is the first time this technology has been used for <b>aerial</b> <b>application</b> of insecticide. The <b>aerial</b> <b>application</b> targeted the feeding life stages, both adults and larvae.|$|R
