5|$|Later, in April 2003, No Doubt {{went into}} hiatus to take <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>to</b> {{spend time with}} their {{families}} before starting to compile Everything in Time; The Singles 1992–2003, a greatest hits album featuring songs from their previous studio albums; and Boom Box, a box set compiling The Singles 1992–2003, Everything in Time, The Videos 1992–2003 and Live in the Tragic Kingdom, which would all be released on the same date. The main reason to go into hiatus was that, in early 2003, lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she released two solo albums: Love. Angel. Music. Baby. on November 22, 2004 and The Sweet Escape on December 4, 2006.|$|E

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{principal}} of Comilla Victoria College, Khan developed {{a special interest in}} grassroots actions. Between 1954 and 1955, he took <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>to</b> work as director of the Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) Programme. However, he was not satisfied with the development approach adopted in the programme that was limited to the training of villagers. In 1958, he went to Michigan State University to acquire education and training in rural development. Returning in 1959, he established the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development (PARD) at Comilla on 27 May 1959 and was appointed as its founding director. He also laid foundations for the Comilla Cooperative Pilot Project in 1959. In 1963, he received a Ramon Magsaysay Award from the Government of the Philippines for his services in rural development. Khan became Vice-chairman of the board of Governors of PARD in 1964, and in the same year, was awarded an honorary Doctorate of law by Michigan State University. In 1969, he delivered a series of lectures at Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, based on his experience with rural cooperatives. During the visit, he established collaborative links with Arthur Lewis.|$|E

During this time, he worked on the proof of consistency of the axiom of choice and of the continuum hypothesis; he went on to show that these hypotheses cannot be disproved from the common system of axioms of set theory.|$|E

25|$|Church {{doctrine}} protected {{human life}} {{so it was}} problematic if a victim were to die, especially before they confessed. In difficult cases, when a victim would not readily confess or {{was too weak to}} continue in an uninterrupted torture session, breaks were allowed between torture sessions because Inquisition regulations only allowed one torture session per victim. That way, a torture session could resume after <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>to</b> allow time for the victim to recover or reconsider their opposition to confessing, and it was considered to have been the continuation of the previous torture session and not a new one.|$|E
25|$|Before {{recording}} {{their next}} album, the band {{decided to take}} <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>to</b> find time to focus on other projects. Nicke Andersson worked on his side project The Solution with Scott Morgan, releasing the album Communicate! in 2004; he also contributed backing vocals for The Cardigans album Long Gone Before Daylight.

25|$|The Haunted's fifth studio album, The Dead Eye, was {{released}} on 30 October 2006 in Europe and {{so far has been}} a huge success, showing a more sinister side to Dolving's vocals and a more technical, haunting musical display.

They recently toured Europe for the Cursed Earth tour with bands like Wolf, Municipal Waste, and Lyzanxia and took <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>to</b> later return to play in tours and some shows in Russia.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Art of Life, which also topped the Oricon, the members of X Japan took <b>a</b> <b>break,</b> <b>to</b> start solo projects. Around that time, the group also dropped most of its {{original}} visual kei aesthetics, except hide who would still perform in wildly colorful outfits and with his trademark red, later pink, hair. Dahlia, which would become the band's last album, was released on November 4, 1996 and once again, it reached the number one spot. In September 1997 it was announced that X Japan would disband, they performed their farewell show, aptly titled The Last Live, at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997.|$|E
25|$|In May, vocalist/guitarist Alex Gaskarth {{revealed}} that the band {{had been working on}} new material and were planning to take <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>to</b> write new songs. In August, the band {{said they were going to}} record their next album in the winter. In October and November, the group went on the Compromising of Integrity, Morality, & Principles in Exchange for Money tour in the US. While on the Milwaukee date of the tour, Gaskarth mentioned that the band would record their next album following the tour's conclusion.

25|$|In {{spite of}} this revelation, rather than being granted <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>to</b> recover and {{possibly}} undergo surgery Sakuraba scheduled to return to action on December 31, 2006 against Yoshihiro Akiyama at K-1 Dynamite!!. During the bout, Sakuraba was hit with several punches and he rushed to get the takedown, but in doing so he slipped from Akiyama's body. As the sequence repeated itself over and over while Sakuraba took punishment, he opted to drop to his back and attempt a kneebar from there, but {{his grip on the}} judoka inexplicably failed again. Having Sakuraba trapped against the ropes and struggling for his submission, Akiyama was free to attack with ground and pound for the referee stoppage. Words were exchanged between Sakuraba and referee Yoshinori Umeki prior to the stop, which was brought on by the sounding of a bell at the behest of Akira Maeda, the event coordinator, the referee separating the fighters following the bell rather than initiating the stop himself.|$|E
25|$|After <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>to</b> recuperate, {{the band}} {{teamed up with}} {{engineer}} Joe Gibb to create a high-tech studio setup. Brown had been soaking up the Leeds dance scene, while Hussey's explorations were towards folk music. The band, asked to perform a lucrative headlining gig at Finsbury Park in 1991, brought out quite a different side, joined by Maartin Allcock of Fairport Convention and Anthony Thistlethwaite of The Waterboys. Many long-standing fans left the gig worried {{about the direction of}} the forthcoming release, Masque (produced by Mark Saunders). Masque was originally intended to be a solo release by Hussey, however the remaining band members contributed to the recording, and the album was released under the group name as a result. Adams left the group subsequent to the release of the album. Reduced to a duo, the Mission began searching for new members, even placing an ad in the Melody Maker.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time that an {{intimate}} early scene between Andrew Garfield and Lily Cole was being shot on top of the travelling Imaginarium wagon, second unit work around London was also being done for several more nights, until 20 December; this change in schedule was to allow Heath Ledger <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>to</b> travel back to Australia to visit his family. After the entire cast returned from Christmas break, the production resumed shooting for 2008 back at Battersea for one full day; this was Tom Waits' first day on set, as he would mainly be required for the subsequent Vancouver shoot, not the London section. From 5–6 January, the production filmed scenes with the Imaginarium at Leadenhall Market; shooting on this sequence managed an average of 70 set-ups a day. The production had originally planned to shoot the Leadenhall scenes at Bond Street, but this was scrapped, due to security concerns.|$|E
