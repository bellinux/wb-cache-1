40|$|A {{variety of}} mobile devices are {{available}} today with varied functionalities ranging from basic phone to integrated cameras, touch screens and full-fledged mobile operating systems. The ability to easily program recent versions of mobile devices (like PDAs, smartphones, etc.) {{make them a}} very attractive option to run custom applications, especially, those {{that need to be}} executed on the go. One such critical application area is in-field analytics, where we should not only provide easy access to information, but also enable information analysis to some extent. In this project we present a real-time scalable interactive visual analysis system for network data with other correlated information. It leverages the portability of small screen devices, while banking on its increased computational capabilities on par with a PDA. We use network information collected from Purdue’s Ross-Ade Stadium during football games combined with associated video data analysis. Our previous version of the system [6] was based on OpenGL ES and hence did not scale very well across devices. The current system primarily targets smartphones of various resolutions with button-based user inputs. It is designed in OpenVG to make it scalable across <b>all</b> <b>screen</b> <b>resolutions</b> and to provide a consistent interface across various devices. Using the overview+detail [8] approach, it provides fast access to summarized information at a glance and allows a user to explore the information space in detail for detection and analysis of anomalies...|$|E
40|$|Multiresolution {{analysis}} is a design method {{for most of}} the practically relavant discrete wavelet transform. Multiresolution approaches provide a powerful tool for image processing. Combined 2 -D and 1 -D directional filter banks are used for the visual quality improvement and have higher PSNR than the predictable separable wavelet transform. Multiresolution image that makes image look good on <b>all</b> <b>screen</b> <b>resolution.</b> Multiresoution keeps each screen pixel filled with at least one image pixel, upto maximum resolution of the image. Here in addition being proposed multi wavelet transform that exploits the multiresolution image and can efficiently represent the sharp edges of the image. The development in this paper draws the results regarding the multi wavelets appear to excel at preserving high frequency content. In particular, multi wavelets better capture the sharp edges and geometric patterns that occur in images...|$|R

50|$|After {{the end of}} the {{official}} support the game's community tried to take over the support and produced unofficial patches which are still updated. Among other things, the unofficial patch supports <b>all</b> possible <b>screen</b> <b>resolutions,</b> fixes maximization problems on Windows 8 / 8.1 / 10 and enabled DirectX 9 support to fix problems with only integrated graphics card being detected on Nvidia Optimus laptop under Windows 10. On 16 October 2015, Dr.MonaLisa (the creator of Unofficial Patches) released Unofficial Version 1.5.5 which brings back the old Multiplayer Lobby, which is now hosted on a new server.|$|R
