A great number of noise-reducing design features have been developed, but they are all, {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, sensitive to variations in operational conditions. The present paper is concerned with optimal design and experi-mental verification of the cross-angle in an axial piston pump. The cross-angle is a small fixed incline of the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> in the direction that is perpendicular to the traditional displacement direction. It enables effective noise reduction throughout the whole range of displacement angles. Simulation-based optimization is used to design a pump with optimal cross-angle and a matching valve plate.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{reducing}} the noise generated by a tilt-rotor aircraft during descent involves active control of the blade pitch of the rotors. This method is related to prior such noise-reduction methods, of a type denoted generally as higher-harmonic control (HHC), in which the blade pitch is made to oscillate at a harmonic of the frequency of rotation of the rotor. A tilt-rotor aircraft is so named because mounted at its wing tips are motors that can be pivoted to enable the aircraft to take off and land like a helicopter or to fly like a propeller airplane. When the aircraft is operating in its helicopter mode, the rotors generate more thrust per unit rotor-disk area than helicopter rotors do, thus producing more blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise. BVI is {{a major source of}} noise produced by helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft during descent: When a rotor descends into its own wake, the interaction of each blade with the blade-tip vortices generated previously gives rise to large air-pressure fluctuations. These pressure fluctuations radiate as distinct, impulsive noise. In general, the pitch angle of the rotor blades of a tilt-rotor aircraft is controlled by use of <b>a</b> <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> connected to the rotor blades by pitch links.

40|$|There are {{two main}} design issues in digital {{prototyping}} of <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> type axial piston machines. First, {{the design of the}} rotating group with its lubricating interfaces is critical to the operation of the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> type axial machine. <b>Swash</b> <b>plate</b> type axial piston machines have three main lubricating interfaces - the Piston/Cylinder, the Cylinder block/Valve plate, and the Slipper/Swash plate interface. These lubricating interfaces fulfill simultaneously a bearing and sealing function. The three interfaces represent the most critical design issue within the design process of the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> type axial piston machine because these interfaces determine the performance and reliability of the machine and are the main source of energy dissipation. Ivantysynova and her research group (2001, 2002, 2005, 2010, and 2012) have developed fully coupled fluid structure interaction models based on non-isothermal flow through the lubricating gap for the three lubricating interfaces of <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> type axial piston machines. The models consider the macro and micro motion of movable parts such as the piston, slipper, and cylinder block as well as the deformation of solid bodies due to pressure and temperature for all three interfaces. These models were developed separately for each interface. However, viscous friction forces generated in one interface are transferred to other interfaces, i. e. the friction force generated between piston and cylinder will load the cylinder block and therefore must be considered when calculating the cylinder block valve plate interface. Also, the friction force generated in the gap between the slipper and <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> will act on the piston/slipper assembly and therefore must be considered when balancing forces acting on the piston. ^ The second design issue involves the valve plate design in the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> type axial piston machine. The valve plate is a non-rotating component in the axial piston machine that is located adjacent to the cylinder block. The valve plate connects the pump ports to the individual cylinder chambers. Proper valve plate design is essential for the high performance axial piston machine because the valve plate regulates the displacement chamber pressure profile in the axial piston machine. The pressure profile in the displacement chamber is important in regards to the axial piston machine operation because the pressure profile has a very significant influence on the resulting fluid film of each of the three interfaces, on moments acting on the <b>swash</b> <b>plate,</b> and flow ripple in the low/high pressure ports. The pressure in the displacement chamber transforms to the primary force acting on the piston/cylinder, cylinder block/valve plate, and slipper/swash plate interface. Because of the time dependent change of pressure in each cylinder chamber the resulting forces and moments are pulsating. In addition, the force acting on the slipper/swash plate transforms to the moments acting on the <b>swash</b> <b>plate,</b> which influence the controllability of the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> angle. The pulsating forces and moments acting on the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> not only have an influence on the controllability of the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> angle, but also represent one of the main sources of noise generated in the axial piston machine. The moment acting on the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> oscillates the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> and the end case simultaneously, which in the end results in audible noise. This noise source {{is often referred to as}} structure-borne noise (SBN). The other noise source, fluid-borne noise (FBN), is also related to the valve plate because FBN results mainly from flow ripple in the low/high pressure port. Flow ripple in the low/high pressure port is affected by the number of pistons of the axial piston machine, but it also has a strong relationship with the displacement chamber pressure. Therefore, the valve plate design significantly influences both SBN and FBN. And for this reason, much valve plate design research has been conducted in order to reduce noise in the axial piston machine. There are two types of valve plate noise reduction techniques: passive and active noise reduction technique. Of these two noise reduction techniques, the passive noise reduction technique has the advantage that it does not require any additional power source or system. However, this technique has the disadvantage that it is not effective for a wide range of operating conditions. Relief groove, pre-compression filter volume (PCFV), and cross port are examples of passive noise reduction techniques. In order to study these phenomena more accurately, Seeniraj and Ivantysynova developed a simulation tool, VpOptim, for valve plate simulation and optimization. VpOptim can be used for valve plate optimization by implementing relief grooves and the PCFV in the valve plate. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
50|$|Pressure. In {{a typical}} pressure-compensated pump, the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> angle is {{adjusted}} through {{the action of}} a valve which uses pressure feedback so that the instantaneous pump output flow is exactly enough to maintain a designated pressure. If the load flow increases, pressure will momentarily decrease but the pressure-compensation valve will sense the decrease and then increase the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> angle to increase pump output flow so that the desired pressure is restored. In reality most systems use pressure as a control {{for this type of}} pump. The operating pressure reaches, say, 200 bar (20 MPa or 2900 psi) and the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> is driven towards zero angle (piston stroke nearly zero) and with the inherent leaks in the system allows the pump to stabilise at the delivery volume that maintains the set pressure. As demand increases the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> is moved to a greater angle, piston stroke increases and the volume of fluid increases; if the demand slackens the pressure will rise, and the pumped volume diminishes as the pressure rises. At maximum system pressure the output is once again almost zero. If the fluid demand increases beyond the capacity of the pump to deliver, the system pressure will drop to near zero. The <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> angle will remain at the maximum allowed, and the pistons will operate at full stroke. This continues until system flow-demand eases and the pump's capacity is greater than demand. As the pressure rises the swash-plate angle modulates to try to not exceed the maximum pressure while meeting the flow demand.|$|R
