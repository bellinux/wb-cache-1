40|$|This {{paper offers}} a game theoretic model of {{liquidity}} provision through repeated central bank tenders, {{in the spirit}} of the operational framework of the Eurosystem. Banks are required to satisfy reserve requirements subject to an <b>averaging</b> <b>provision</b> over individual maintenance periods, and transactions may hang over into the respective subsequent period. It is shown that liquidity shocks are absorbed by the system by exponentially declining oscillations around the stationary equilibrium. When a policy rate cut is expected, bidders strategically reduce demand prior to the decision, which may unbalance the system. The anticipation of strategic behavior may generate an oscillation even before the maintenance period in which the decision is expected. When the recently released ECB proposal is implemented in the model, then the bidders' strategic motives are effectively eliminated. It is shown that, alternatively, bidding behavior can be corrected using a simple reimbursement scheme. JEL Classification: E 51, G 28...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{debate over}} the {{pro-cyclical}} effects of capital regulation has overlooked the important role that bank loan loss provisions play in the overall minimum capital regulatory framework. Inadequate assessment of expected credit losses leads to under-provisioning and to the shortage of loan loss reserves at times of crisis. As a consequence, capital has to offset both expected and unexpected losses, aggravating {{the negative impact of}} minimum capital requirements over the economic activity during recessions. In addition, when expected losses are properly reflected in lending rates but not in provisioning practices banks earnings fluctuations magnify true bank profitability oscillations. The often unsatisfactory institutional arrangement for loan loss provisioning may be seen as an effort to mitigate an agency problems between bank stakeholders (outsiders versus insiders). We test our hypothesis over a sample of 1176 large commercial banks, 372 of which from non-G 10 countries, over the period 1988 - 1999. After controlling for different country specific macroeconomic and institutional features, we find robust evidence that the relationship between loan loss provisioning and banks' pre-provision income shows the desirable positive sign for G 10 banks. The same sign is, instead, negative for non-G 10 banks, which on <b>average</b> <b>provision</b> too little in good times and are forced to increase provisions in bad times. We also find that the protection of "outsiders" claims over banks' profits has negative effects on loan loss provisioning...|$|R

I then go on to analyse the technical features of unsecured interbank markets in the euro area in order to determine whether a screen-based framework leads to more efficient liquidity management than achieved in over-the-counter markets. In accordance with the <b>averaging</b> <b>provision</b> mechanism, minimum reserves during the maintenance period in Italy, where the interbankmarket is electronic-based, are taken as indicators of efficiency in this market. On the evidence of the data, it seems that Italian banks can reduce the opportunity cost of maintaining minimum reserves, also performing intertemporal arbitrages between theinterbank market and their reserve accounts. Finally, the focus comes on cross border differences in the use of collateral within the euro area in order to analyse the projects currently debated for the reform of collateral lists...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} recognised that the operational {{framework for the}} monetary policy of the Eurosystem 1 has been functioning well since {{the launch of the}} euro in 1999. There has been little need to conduct fine-tuning operations, because of the <b>averaging</b> <b>provision</b> of the minimum reserve system {{and the quality of the}} Eurosystem’s liquidity forecasts. Also, credit institutions have had only limited recourse to the standing facilities, which shows that the money market has been working efficiently. And the small and fairly stable spread between the ECB’s fixed or minimum bid rate on its main refinancing operations and the short-term money market rates displays the ability of the ECB to influence short-term interest rates. Despite th{{is generally}} positive assessment, some possible measures have been examined with the aim of further improving the efficiency of the operational framework. There are three changes to be considered: (1) changing the timing of the reserve maintenance period, so that it would always start on the settlement day of the main refinancing operation following the Governing Council meeting at which the discussion of monetary policy is pre-scheduled, so that – as a rule – the implementation of changes to the standing facility rates would be aligned with the start of a new reserve maintenance period...|$|E

40|$|Objectives:To {{investigate}} whether {{the provision of}} dental services is influenced by economic incentives in a third-party funded dental service in the Republic of Ireland. Methods:Four treatment items were identified as outcome variables. These items were characterised by variation in regulation among administrative regions or variation in regulation over time. The items were Extra Oral Radiographs, Endodontics, Prolonged Periodontal Treatment, and Surgical Extractions. Claims data {{were obtained from the}} Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS), formerly known as the General Medical Services Payments Board (GMSPB). Population data were obtained from the Central Statistics Office. Data were obtained from the Principal Dental Surgeons in Ireland who apply local regulatory or price controls for certain items of treatment.

40|$|Recent {{debate about}} the {{pro-cyclical}} effects of bank capital requirements, has ignored the important role that bank loan loss provisions play in the overall framework of minimum capital regulation. It is frequently observed that under-provisioning, due to inadequate assessment of expected credit losses, aggravates the negative effect of minimum capital requirements during recessions, because capital must absorb both expected, and unexpected losses. Moreover, when expected losses are properly reflected in lending rates, but not in provisioning practices, fluctuations in bank earnings magnify true oscillations in bank profitability. The relative agency problems faced by different stakeholders, may help explain the prevailing, and often unsatisfactory institutional arrangements. The authors test their hypotheses {{with a sample of}} 1, 176 large commercial banks - 372 of them in non-G 10 countries - for the period 1988 - 99. After controlling for different country-specific macroeconomic, and institutional features, they find robust evidence among G 10 banks, of a positive association between loan loss provisions, and banks'pre-provision income. Such evidence is not confirmed for non-G 10 banks, which on <b>average,</b> <b>provision</b> too little in good times, and are forced to increase provisions in bad times. The econometric evidence shows that the protection of outsiders'claims - the claims of minority shareholders in common law countries, and of fiscal authorities in countries with high public debt - on bank income, has negative effects on the level of bank provisions.

The range of eligible collateral is very wide. Assets eligible for monetary policy purposes are also eligible for intraday credit. Under Eurosystem rules, credit can only be granted by the national central bank of the Member State where the participant is established. Banks’ treasury managers have a keen interest in the use of automated processes for the optimisation of payment and liquidity management.

These awards are usually symbolic {{since they have}} no immediate monetary value for a supplier and no direct cost to a buyer. Giving these awards can be beneficial for a buyer: if suppliers care about being rewarded, symbolic awards can incentivize a supplier to exert higher effort. On the other hand, in a market with multiple buyers and suppliers, an award may have another effect, which we denote “competition effect”. When good suppliers are scarce, a public award can intensify the competition {{to do business with}} a good supplier. We develop a theoretical model that captures a supplier's value for the award in a setting with two buyers and two suppliers. We show that the <b>average</b> <b>provision</b> of quality is higher when awards are available whether these are private (only observable to the recipient) or public (observable to everyone). In addition, public awards result in buyers paying a higher price to get a good supplier. We then test these results with a laboratory experiment. Our experimental results show that private symbolic awards have incentive effects and lead to higher provision of quality and higher buyer's profits. When the awards are public this profit premium disappears. This happens for two reasons, first because buyers have to pay higher prices to get the good suppliers, and second because making the award public crowds out the intrinsic value of the award for suppliers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAim: The aim of {{our study}} {{was to assess the}} {{nutritional}} status and eating behavior of young children and identify the prevalence of macro- and micronutrient diet deficiencies in Ukraine. Materials and methods: Three hundred and fifty children aged from 9 months to 3 years from central, eastern and western regions of Ukraine were involved in the cross-sectional study. Basic child's data were collected, health status was assessed by a physician, and parents used a 3 -day food diary and a food questionnaire for self-completion. Data from the diaries and questionnaires were analyzed with DietPlan 6 software. Results: The diet composition was mostly adequate for age. Overall <b>average</b> <b>provision</b> with energy (1165. 67 [29. 67 – 4951. 33]kcal/day), protein (40. 53 [0. 63 – 230. 37]g/day) and carbohydrates (153. 63 [3. 53 – 708. 7]g/day) exceeded the corresponding standards. The diet of the majority of children did not comply with the recommended intake of zinc (91 %), iron (68 %), calcium (61 %), iodine (49 %), vitamins A (99 %), D (97 %), B 6 (89 %), B 12 (71 %), E (70 %) and B 1 (61 %). Excessive weight was significantly associated with higher levels of energy, protein, carbohydrates and fat consumption. Overweight was reliably correlated with a higher diet's energy and carbohydrates content. Conclusions: The contemporary diet of young children in Ukraine, like in many other developed countries, is generally unbalanced, containing an excess of energy and protein as well as inadequate amount of many minerals and vitamins...|$|R

40|$|Background: There is {{difficulty}} in defining occupational health services among stakeholders of the service. Concurrently, {{there are concerns}} {{about the state of}} occupational health provision in the UK. Aims To determine stakeholders' perception of the services that occupational health encompasses and the level as well as the rationale behind the provision of these services. Methods: The research was undertaken as a postal questionnaire survey of the FTSE 350 companies and selected public sector organizations in the UK. This was followed up by telephone calls to a random selection of non-respondents to obtain non-respondent data. Results: There is a difference in opinion among managers and occupational health professionals about the services provided by occupational health. Taking into account non-respondent data to partially adjust for overestimation biases, the level of provision of occupational health services among the FTSE 350 companies is 69 % and in public sector organizations is 95 %, giving an <b>average</b> <b>provision</b> of 72 %. Sixteen per cent of respondents thought there was a trend towards outsourcing of services. The most frequently cited reason for provision of an occupational health service was that it was for the benefit of employees. Conclusions: There remains room for improvement in the level of occupational health services provision in large UK private sector organizations. By bridging the gap between the different stakeholders' perceptions of the remit and benefits of the service, a higher level of provision in the private sector similar to that of public sector organizations can be achieved. © The Author 2007.

40|$|Although a long {{tradition}} exists of studying the economics of education, performance comparisons of different kinds have traditionally been difficult to undertake. An important impediment has been the lack of comparable data. Tertiary education is no exception and data availability {{has proven to be}} problematic in several respects. Thus, early studies focused on traditional universities although higher education institutions (HEIs) represent a diverse group of organizations providing education. Apart from the difficulty of including different types of education providers, the field has also faced the problem of country comparison. At best, researchers have been able to access data within one country or a handful of countries. To a large extent, this study remedies the shortcomings of earlier studies. The study suggests evaluating HEI performance in a production theory context, applying the well-known Data Envelopment Analysis method to a cross section of 944 HEIs in 17 European countries. The DEA approach is particularly suitable in this context where little is known about production technologies and economic behaviour of the HEIs. Our country comparison is based on a large database, developed by the EUMIDA consortium. The consortium developed a census about basic indicators of HEI inputs and outputs. Experts from each country gathered data from national statistics offices, ministries and specific universities and then harmonized the appropriate data according to the agreed upon definitions of indicators. The data collection includes all HEIs which grant postgraduate and graduate education. Hence, the EUMIDA database offers unique micro-data about decision-making units in the higher education sector across Europe.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Use and cost of services for 265 HIV-infected adults without AIDS (World Health Organization [WHO] stage 1, 2, or 3) and 27 with AIDS (WHO stage 4) receiving HAART between 1995 and 2000 in Cape Town were compared with HIV-infected controls matched for baseline WHO stage, CD 4 count, age, and socioeconomic status, who did not receive antiretroviral therapy (ART; No-ART group). Costs of service provision (January 2004 prices, US$ 1 = 7. 6 Rand) included local unit costs, and two scenarios for HAART prices for WHO recommended first-line regimens: scenario 1 used current South African public-sector ART drug prices of $ 730 per patient-year (PPY), whereas scenario 2 was based on the anticipated public-sector price for locally manufactured drug of $ 181 PPY. All analyses are presented in terms of patients without AIDS and patients with AIDS. For patients without AIDS, the mean number of inpatient days PPY was 1. 08 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 97 - 1. 19) for the HAART group versus 3. 73 (95 % CI: 3. 55 - 3. 97) for the No-ART group, and 8. 71 (95 % CI: 8. 40 - 9. 03) versus 4. 35 (95 % CI: 4. 12 - 5. 61), respectively, for mean number of outpatient visits PPY. <b>Average</b> service <b>provision</b> PPY was $ 950 for the No-ART group versus $ 1, 342 and $ 793 PPY for the HAART group for scenario 1 and 2, respectively, whereas the incremental cost per life-year gained (LYG) was $ 1, 622 for scenario 1 and $ 675 for scenario 2. For patients with AIDS, mean inpatients days PPY was 2. 04 (95 % CI: 1. 63 - 2. 52) for the HAART versus 15. 36 (95 % CI: 13. 97 - 16. 85) for the No-ART group. Mean outpatient visits PPY was 7. 62 (95 % CI: 6. 81 - 8. 49) compared with 6. 60 (95 % CI: 5. 69 - 7. 62) respectively. <b>Average</b> service <b>provision</b> PPY was $ 3, 520 for the No-ART group versus $ 1, 513 and $ 964 for the HAART group for scenario 1 and 2, respectively, whereas the incremental cost per LYG was cost saving for both scenarios. In a sensitivity analysis based on the lower (25 %) and upper (75 %) interquartile range survival percentiles, the incremental cost per LYG ranged from $ 1, 557 to $ 1, 772 for the group without AIDS and from cost saving to $ 111 for patients with AIDS. CONCLUSION: HAART is a cost-effective intervention in South Africa, and cost saving when HAART prices are further reduced. Our estimates, however, were based on direct costs, and as such the actual cost saving might have been underestimated if indirect costs were also included...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses Côte d’Ivoire and Nigeria {{survey data}} on both {{supply and demand}} {{characteristics}} to examine how structural and demographic factors influence family planning provision and cost. The model, which {{takes into account the}} endogenous influence of service <b>provision</b> on <b>average</b> cost, explains <b>provision</b> well but poorly explains what influences service cost. We show that both size and specialization matter. In both countries, vertical (exclusive family planning) facilities provide significantly more contraception than integrated medical establishments. In the Nigeria sample, larger facilities also offer services at lower average cost. Since vertical facilities tend to be large, they at most incur no higher unit costs than integrated facilities. These results are consistent across most model specifications, and are robust to corrections for endogenous facility placement in Nigeria. Model results and cost recovery information point to the relative efficiency of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, which operates large, mostly vertically organized facilities...|$|R

40|$|To control Medicaid's {{increasing}} expenditure on reimbursement of outpatient prescription drugs, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 {{included a}} rebate program that featured a most favored customer (MFC) clause. This clause guarantees that Medicaid gets a fixed rebate on each unit of purchase by Medicaid consumers. The rebate is calculated as {{the difference between}} the minimum price and the average manufacturer price (minimum price provisioning or MPP) or a proportion of the average manufacturer price (<b>average</b> price <b>provisioning</b> or APP). We characterize the optimal pricing strategy of a third-degree price discriminating monopolist in response to the imposition of MPP or APP rules. Under MPP, the minimum price gross of rebate always increases whereas prices gross of rebate in {{at least some of the}} markets always decrease. In contrast, under APP, these prices may move in the same direction in all markets, with all increasing in some circumstances and all decreasing in others. We also examine the effects of such provisions on social welfare and provide some useful sufficient conditions for directional changes in social welfare. For example, imposing MPP increases social welfare if it results in higher aggregate demand. Beyond the Medicaid setting, minimum price policies are relevant in a number of applications, including external referencing in drug pricing, price protection in long-term trading contracts and shifts of consumers between markets. We analyze a modified version of our Medicaid MPP model suitable for such settings...|$|R
