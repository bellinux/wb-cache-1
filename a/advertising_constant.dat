40|$|We {{investigate}} the dynamic advertising policies of two competing firms in a duopolistic industry, assuming a predatory phenomenon between their advertising campaigns. The resulting {{model is a}} differential game which is not linear-quadratic. We show that there exists a Markovian Nash equilibrium, and that it leads to time <b>constant</b> <b>advertising</b> strategies. According to this model, predatory advertising produces a negative externality: the interference between the advertising campaigns decreases the total demand of the market...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} media competition with free entry when media operators are financed both from advertisers and customers. The relation between advertising receipts and sales receipts, which are both complementary and antagonist, is different if media operators impose a price or a quantity to advertisers. When consumers dislike advertising, media operators are better off setting an advertising price than an advertising quantity. We establish {{a relationship between the}} equilibrium levels (advertising and entry) and the advertising technology. In particular, media operators? profit is not affected by the introduction of advertising when they impose advertising quantities and when <b>advertising</b> exhibits <b>constant</b> returns to scale in the audience size. Under constant or increasing returns to scale in the audience size, we find an excessive level of entry and an insufficient level of advertising...|$|R

We establish {{a relationship between the}} equilibrium levels of prices, advertising and entry, the welfare maximizing levels and the <b>advertising</b> technology. Under <b>constant</b> or increasing returns to scale in the audience size, we find an excessive level of entry and an insufficient level of advertising. We then extend the analysis along several dimensions: the price as a strategic variable on the market for advertising, free media platforms and the media quality dimension.

40|$|In today's {{world of}} DVR and ad blockers, {{advertisers}} struggle {{to capture the}} full attention of their audiences. Advertisers are forced {{to break out of}} the norm in order to communicate their messages. Sporting events have become a great avenue for advertisers. This study looks at which form of in-game promotions are most effective, in terms of brand awareness and purchase behavior. The forms of in-game advertising were separated into three categories: on-screen, live action, and constant. Surveys were administered at two University of Missouri Men's basketball games, in which participants were asked questions about various brands that were advertised at the game, as well as questions regarding their need for cognition, or their tendency to engage in and enjoy thinking. This study determined that brands that advertise with on-screen and live action promotions are recalled almost 25 percent of the time more than those who <b>advertise</b> with <b>constant</b> promotions. Conversely, constant promotions yielded the more favorable purchase behavior. Both advertisers and sports teams can benefit from the information included in this study. By having a better understanding of which types of promotions yield which results, advertisers can more effectively communicate their message to their audience. Sports teams will have more leverage in negotiations with advertisers by gaining knowledge of which forms of promotions are most effective with different types of thinkers...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} much {{practical}} interest in Web advertising {{as a component of}} marketing on the Internet, there is little theory or evidence about how it works in the context of Web content. This paper reports a laboratory experiment that examines the impact of advertising format (less or more intrusive), medium (print or Web) and Web content structure (linear or non-linear) on a broad range of measures of advertising effectiveness and evaluation of Web content. Several hypotheses based on human information processing considerations are developed and tested. The results show that <b>advertising</b> effectiveness is <b>constant</b> across <b>advertising</b> formats, media, and Web content structures. Evaluation of content was found to be unaffected by medium or Web content structure, but positive related to the presence of advertising, and negatively associated with the level of intrusiveness of advertising format...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} effects of recessions in {{developed}} nations since 1989 to determine how advertising expenditures are related to recessions and whether expenditures for different media are affected differently. The study finds that <b>advertising</b> expenditures (in <b>constant</b> currency) declined an average of 5 % when a 1 % decline occurred. The relations between {{the gross domestic product}} and advertising expenditures were not universal across the nations, however. It appears that nature of the economies, the degree of economic fluctuation, segments of industry affected, national economic policies, and other factors may play roles in the advertising expenditure choices. The study also finds that print media are more affected by recessions than broadcast media. The effect of the economic downturns on newspaper and magazine advertising expenditures were 4 times that of the effect on television advertising expenditures. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} model of a {{monopolist}} firm which advertises a product in a segmented market where a constant exogenous interference is present. Using the framework of Nerlove- Arrow advertising model, we describe the interference using a constant negative addendum in the goodwill ODE. This effect may vary over the different market segments. Hence, we admit that the firm goodwill concerning any segment may become negative and we associate 0 demand with negative goodwill values. By using the simplest demand model, i. e. a piece- wise linear function, we formulate a nonsmooth infinite horizon optimal control problem. The features of an optimal advertising policy depend on the different effects in each segment of the advertising effort and of the exogenous interference. We describe an optimal solution for a single wide-spectrum medium, which requires a <b>constant</b> <b>advertising</b> effort after some finite time. We characterize the segment sets which may be a possible target for the firm using a given advertising medium...|$|R
40|$|The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) {{architecture}} is a scalable solution for providing Quality of Service (QoS) over packet switched networks. By its very definition, Diffserv {{is not intended}} to provide strict performance guarantees to its subscribers. We purpose in this paper a particular form of relative performance guarantees. Specifically, the network manager’s goal is to maintain pre-defined ratios between common congestion measures over the different service classes. We assume that each service class is <b>advertised</b> with a <b>constant</b> price. Thus, in order to induce its goal, the manager dynamically allocates available capacity between the service classes. This scheme is studied within a network flow model, with self-optimizing users, where each user can choose the amount of flow to ship on each service class according to its service utility and QoS requirements. We pose the entire problem as a non-cooperative game. Concentrating on a simplified single-link model with multiple service classes, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium where the relative performance goal is obtained. Accordingly, we show how to compute and sustain the required capacity assignment. The extension to a general network topology is briefly outlined...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose the}} model of a firm that advertises a product in a {{homogeneous}} market, where a constant exogenous interference is present. Using the framework of Nerlove and Arrow's advertising model, {{we assume that the}} interference acts additively on goodwill production as a negative term. Hence we allow, that the goodwill may become negative and we associate a zero demand with negative goodwill values. We consider a piecewise linear demand function and formulate a nonsmooth optimal-control problem with an infinite horizon. We obtain that an optimal advertising policy exists and takes one of two forms: either a positive and <b>constant</b> <b>advertising</b> effort, or a decreasing effort starting from a positive level and eventually reaching the zero value at a finite exit time. In the former scenario, the demand is always positive and the firm stays in the market in the long run; in the latter, the demand becomes zero in the short run, and afterward, the firm goes out of business. In both cases we have an explicit representation of the optimal control, which is obtained through the study of an auxiliary smooth optimal-control problem. It is interesting that the fundamental choice between staying in the market and going out of business at some time depends both on the interference level and on the initial goodwill level...|$|R
40|$|Marketing {{decision}} makers often employ stereotypes in their <b>advertising</b> messages, but <b>constant</b> exposure to negative messages is offensive to older consumers and contributes toward ageism. The general {{problem is that}} many senior adults feel dissatisfied with advertising directed toward them and may not purchase products that they could otherwise enjoy. Based on the tenets of social identity theory, {{the purpose of this}} study was to explore the perceptions of a group of senior consumers toward the stereotypes used to portray older adult models featured in magazine advertisements by uncovering the factors that influence purchasing decisions and the stereotypes that are most offensive and least offensive. Study participants included 30 self-selected volunteers living in Maryland and ranging in age from 70 to 85 years. Each participant ranked 40 magazine advertisements that featured a variety of potentially offensive age-related stereotypes. Analysis of the data included correlation, factor analysis, and factor scores. Three unique factors emerged from the data, which were termed Pioneers, Unpredictables, and Cupids. Pioneers, Unpredictables, and Cupids had 17, 18, and 15 distinguishing advertisements, respectively, each at a 95 % confidence level. Participants found stereotypes portraying older adults as sickly or weak to be the most offensive. Stereotypes highlighting active lifestyles and loving relationships were least offensive. This study has implications for social change by increasing awareness of the negative effects of ageism in magazine advertisements. Understanding how senior adults perceive stereotypes presented in advertisements may challenge generalizations and facilitate their happiness, health, and positive identity formation...|$|R
40|$|It {{is clear}} that Americans are getting fatter, both adults and children. This {{development}} has led some {{to call for a}} ban on food advertising directed at children. There are numerous practical and constitutional difficulties with such a policy. This article poses a more fundamental question - even if feasible, would restricting food advertising do anything to reduce obesity or even slow its trends? The article also considers whether the social costs of banning advertising could outweigh the social benefits of such an action. This article provides {{a review of the literature}} on the fundamental causes of the American obesity problem as well as the purported contribution of children 2 ̆ 7 s advertising to the problem. The final conclusion is inescapable - the available evidence does not support the theory that children 2 ̆ 7 s exposure to food advertising has significantly contributed to increased children 2 ̆ 7 s obesity. Although children 2 ̆ 7 s obesity rates have skyrocketed during the past two decades, the available evidence indicates that children 2 ̆ 7 s exposure to food <b>advertising</b> has remained <b>constant</b> or has even declined during that same period. This article first describes the existing theories and empirical evidence regarding the causal factors in the American obesity problem. Second, the article examines in detail the claim that the rise in children 2 ̆ 7 s obesity has been caused in whole or in part by food advertising directed at children. Available evidence and observations regarding the exposure of children to food advertising fail to support the hypothesis that increased food advertising directed at children has significantly contributed to the rise in childhood obesity. As a result, there is also little reason to believe that greater restrictions on advertising directed at children will do much at all to staunch the increase in children 2 ̆ 7 s obesity. Third, the article reviews the existing literature on the positive effects that advertising can have on increasing consumer knowledge and choice. Thus, even though there is little evidence that advertising is the cause of the obesity problem, it is likely that advertising can play a positive role in being part of the solution to obesity by providing more information to consumers and by providing incentives to create and market healthier food alternatives...|$|R
