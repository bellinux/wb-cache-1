500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 31 March 2005 {{following}} a urinary tract infection, he developed septic shock, {{a form of}} infection with a high fever and low blood pressure, but was not hospitalised. Instead, he was monitored {{by a team of}} consultants at his private residence. This was taken as an indication by the pope, and those close to him, that he was nearing death; it would have been in accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican. Later that day, Vatican sources announced that John Paul II had been given the Anointing of the Sick by his friend and secretary Stanisław Dziwisz. The day before his death, one of his closest personal friends, Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka visited him at his bedside. During {{the final days of the}} pope's life, the lights were kept burning through the night where he lay in the Papal apartment on the top floor of the Apostolic Palace. Tens of thousands of people assembled and held vigil in St. Peter's Square and the surrounding streets for two days. Upon hearing of this, the dying pope was said to have stated: [...] "I have searched for you, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come to me, and I thank you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Out of high school, Anderson was {{considered}} capable of playing any of four {{positions on the}} court, from point guard to power forward, drawing comparisons to basketball legends Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. Anderson's high school coach Bob Hurley said, [...] "I think he's a modern-day Magic Johnson. I think that let him play the point. He gets everybody shots. You don’t have him back defensively balancing the floor, you’re wasting him. But you let him {{do a lot of}} what the point guard stuff entails. But then also defensively you don’t bother guarding him on the little guy. Put him on maybe the three man or even sometimes the four man if he’s a step-out player. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a guy like Larry Bird who anticipates. He gets a lot of deflections and steals. He’s long, he blocks shots. And then when he gets a defensive rebound, you got a fast-break started already." [...] During his sophomore year in UCLA, CBSSports.com wrote that Anderson was [...] "starting to look more and more like the Magic Johnson of the 2013–14 season in college basketball." [...] ESPN analyst Dick Vitale warned against calling him the next Magic Johnson, but stated that [...] "he has the mini-version of that kind of skill.” USA Today commented that he was [...] "kind of a poor man's Magic Johnson".|$|E
