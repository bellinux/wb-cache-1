40|$|Abstract—Road {{congestion}} {{results in}} a huge {{waste of time and}} productivity for millions of people. A possible way to deal with this problem is to have transportation authorities distribute <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> to drivers, which in turn can decide (or be aided by a navigator) to route around congested <b>areas.</b> Such <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> can be gathered by relying on static sensors placed at specific road locations (e. g., induction loops, video cameras) or by having single vehicles report their location, speed and travel time. While the former approach has been widely exploited, the latter has seen birth only more recently, and, consequently, its potential is less understood. For this reason, in this paper we study a realistic test case that allows {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} such a solution. As part of this process: a) we designed a system that allows vehicles to crowd-source <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> in an Ad-Hoc manner, allowing them to dynamically reroute based on individually collected <b>traffic</b> <b>information,</b> b) we implemented a realistic network-mobility simulator that allowed us to evaluate such a model, and c) the main focus of this paper: we performed a case study that evaluates whether such a decentralized system can help drivers to minimize trip times. This study is based on traffic survey data from Portland, Oregon and our results indicate that such navigation systems can indeed greatly improve traffic flow. Finally, to test the feasibility of our approach we implemented our system and run some real experiments at UCLA’s C-Vet test-bed...|$|R

This dissertation conducts a systematic study of terminal <b>area</b> <b>traffic</b> management using optimization methods. The critical {{role that the}} airport plays in national airspace system is introduced. The challenges in managing complex terminal traffic are explained. The necessity and importance {{of the study is}} addressed. To assist human air traffic controllers in managing complex terminal traffic, our solution strategy is to calculate each flight's optimal arrival/departure schedule, to minimize the overall flight delay and runway congestion in the entire airport. Three solutions are developed in the thesis, including the static solution, the dynamic solution, and the stochastic solution. The static solution uses one computation and attempts to optimize the schedules of many flights arriving/departing the airport within a wide time window. The accuracy of its solution heavily relies {{on the quality of the}} predicted traffic situation acquired right before the computation. On the contrary, the dynamic solution attempts to divide the entire traffic flow into a series of small pieces, and optimize flight schedules piece by piece. It collects the latest <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> before each computation and experiences far less computational load. Both static and dynamic solutions assume the <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> to be explicitly known. They are inherently deterministic solutions. The third solution proposed in this thesis is a stochastic solution. It assumes that <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> is not known with certain due to a variety of random factors in actual flight operations.

To analyse the factors that influence route choice behaviour, several types of discrete choice models (ordered probit, multiple logit and bivariate ordered probit) have been estimated. Bivariate models are needed to model the (endogenous) dependency of the use of radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and variable message sign information.
