5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930, and particularly its edicts concerning on-screen violence, Warners allowed Cagney <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace.</b> They cast him in the comedy Blonde Crazy, again opposite Blondell. As he completed filming, The Public Enemy was filling cinemas with all-night showings. Cagney began to compare his pay with his peers, thinking his contract allowed for salary adjustments based on the success of his films. Warner Bros. disagreed, however, and refused to give him a raise. The studio heads also insisted that Cagney continue promoting their films, even ones he was not in, which he opposed. Cagney moved back to New York, leaving his brother Bill to look after his apartment.|$|E
25|$|Warners {{allowed him}} <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> a screwball comedy, Footsteps in the Dark (1941), {{but it was}} not a success. Far more popular was the {{military}} drama, Dive Bomber (1941); this was his last film with Curtiz.|$|E

25|$|For <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> {{he did a}} musical, So This Is Paris (1955), then it {{was back}} to more typical fare: Six Bridges to Cross (1955), as a bank robber; The Purple Mask (1955), a swashbuckler; The Square Jungle (1955), a boxing film.|$|E
25|$|Warners let him try a screwball comedy as <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> Four's a Crowd (1938). Despite the {{presence}} of de Havilland and direction of Curtiz, {{it was not a}} success. More popular was a melodrama with Bette Davis, The Sisters (1938). He had a strong dramatic part in the all-male anti-war film, The Dawn Patrol (1938), alongside David Niven, then made his first Western, Dodge City (1939), with Curtiz and de Havilland.|$|E
25|$|A {{change of}} metre in Plautus often accompanies the exit or {{entrance}} of a character, and thus frames a scene. At {{other times it}} indicates <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> such as when Amphitruo's slave Sosia suddenly changes from iambic octonarii to a more excited cretic metre when he begins to describe a battle. In Terence different metres accompany different characters: for example, in each of Terence's plays, the woman loved by a young man uses iambic septenarii; in the Heauton Timorumenos, Eunuchus, and Phormio, {{one of the two}} young men is associated with trochaics, the other with iambics. Thus there can be frequent changes of metre within a single scene.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>Change</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pace's</b> {{music is}} drawn {{from a number of}} {{different}} bands, ranging from pop bands such as the Beatles, to metal bands such Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin and to the piano pop/rock of artists such as Five for Fighting and Ben Folds. The band however cites their major influence as alternative rock band Third Eye Blind. They have also been noted by AllMusic reviewer Jo-Ann Greene as showing: [...] "the sparkle of U2, the attitude of Green Day, a stinging arena rock-styled lead guitar solo, and a splash of new wave synth, deftly delivered by Dave Holdredge." ...|$|R
25|$|For <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> Warners {{put him in}} {{a medical}} melodrama, Green Light (1937), playing a crusading doctor, a role {{originally}} intended for Leslie Howard. He then made another swashbuckler, replacing Patric Knowles in what was essentially a supporting role in The Prince and the Pauper (1937). He appeared opposite Kay Francis in Another Dawn (1937), a melodrama set in a British colony. Warners then gave Flynn his first starring role in a comedy, The Perfect Specimen (1937), with Joan Blondell under the direction of Curtiz. During this period Flynn published his first book, Beam Ends (1937), an autobiographical account of his sailing experiences around Australia as a youth. He also travelled to Spain, in 1937, as a war correspondent during the Spanish Civil War.|$|E

The game's pacing in {{the introduction of new}} super powers and ease of movement about the city by unconventional means were critical factors during development. The desolate urban atmosphere was inspired by comics such as DMZ and [...] Amon Tobin was among the artists that helped to compile its soundtrack, which aimed to reflect the environment.|$|E
500|$|... "Adam's Song" [...] {{peaked at}} number {{two on the}} US Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart; {{it was also a}} top 25 hit in Canada and Italy, but did not {{replicate}} its success on other charts. It received praise from music critics, who considered it <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> from the trio's more lighthearted singles. The single's music video, a hit on MTV, was directed by Liz Friedlander. Though the song was intended to inspire hope to those struggling with depression, it encountered controversy when a student of Columbine High School committed suicide with the track on repeat in 2000.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} awarded 2 stars in an Allmusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine who stated [...] "Sophisticated Lou pales when {{compared}} to the great Lush Life, but it remains a fairly successful effort, and it's <b>a</b> nice <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> after several albums of funky soul-jazz".|$|R
500|$|The {{workload}} {{also took}} its toll on young Everett, who around this time acquired the nickname [...] "Ever-at-it", which would be used throughout his life. [...] For <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> Everett traveled to Washington, D.C., where he visited with Daniel Webster and other Federalist Party luminaries from Massachusetts. [...] In late 1814 Everett was offered a newly endowed position as professor of Greek literature at Harvard.

500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, all Daddies {{activity}} was put on further hold as the members returned to their family lives and full-time jobs, while Perry chose to resume his education at the University of Oregon, eventually graduating in 2004 with a B.S. in molecular biology. In February 2002, the Daddies spontaneously regrouped to play a sporadic series of music festivals in the Northwest, though immediately announced no future plans for recording new material or carrying out any extensive tours. Favoring <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> from their formerly exhaustive touring habits, the Daddies began scheduling their performances entirely around the band members' desire and personal availability, playing as few as eight to ten shows a year and limiting their appearances largely to Northwest shows or commissions for one-off [...] "swingin' hits" [...] concerts at various fairs and festivals across the United States.|$|E
500|$|In 1996 Penman {{published}} {{the first in}} the series of medieval mystery novels. Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of burning out. For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So I decided I needed <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace,</b> and since I am a long-time mystery fan, it occurred to me that a medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, S. James Snyder, in {{his review}} for the New York Sun, wrote, [...] "If this is meant as <b>a</b> lighthearted <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> for Mr. Araki, after Mysterious Skin, then perhaps he took things too far in the {{opposite}} direction. This isn't just light and fluffy; it floats away".|$|R

500|$|The {{series is}} {{primarily}} a vehicle for Fry, and was his first television drama series for ITV since the conclusion of Jeeves and Wooster in 1993. Most of the main cast had worked with Fry before: Slattery had been in Footlights with Fry, and he and Law appeared with him in Peter's Friends; Imrie appeared in Gormenghast though the two did not share any scenes. Already being acquainted allowed the cast to appear more relaxed {{in front of the}} camera. Norris had not made any appearances {{with the rest of the}} cast beyond a credit with Imrie in Hospital!, a one-off Channel 5 comedy. However she is married to Wheeler, and he had previously written for Wire in the Blood, in which she formerly starred. She took the role as <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> from the [...] "ice maiden" [...] characters she often portrays.|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, Jackman {{confirmed}} that Aronofsky would direct the film.

It's going to be the best one, I hope... Well, I would say that, but I really do feel that, and I feel this is going to be very different. This is Wolverine. This is not Popeye. He's kind of dark... But, you know, this is <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace.</b> Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll give you a good clue. [...] going to make it fantastic. There's going to be some meat on the bones. There will be something to think about as you leave the theater, for sure". The film was scheduled to begin principal photography in March 2011 in New York City before the production moves to Japan for the bulk of shooting.|$|E
500|$|Both Steinbeck and Ricketts had {{achieved}} {{some measure of}} security and recognition in their professions by 1939: Steinbeck had capitalized on his first successful novel, Tortilla Flat, {{with the publication of}} The Grapes of Wrath, and Ricketts had published Between Pacific Tides, which became the definitive handbook {{for the study of the}} intertidal fauna of the Pacific Coast of the coterminous United States. Steinbeck was exhausted and looking for a new start; Ricketts was looking for a new challenge. The two men had long thought of producing a book together and, in <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> for both of them, they began work on a handbook of the common intertidal species of the San Francisco Bay Area. The book came to nothing, but it spurred them into making a trip to the Sea of Cortez. Initially they planned a motoring trip to Mexico City as a break from their work on the handbook, but as time went on they became more interested in a collecting trip around the Gulf of California. Ricketts noted in his journal: ...|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Richard S.

5000|$|Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 {{star rating}} out of 5, stating: [...] "Overall, 'Game Ogre' was <b>a</b> fun <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> for <b>a</b> series that hasn't taken many risks other than its premise, and {{it paid off}} beautifully.

500|$|Halo Wars {{music was}} {{composed}} by Stephen Rippy, the composer {{for all of}} the Age of Empires games. Rippy wanted to write new material while maintaining continuity by reusing iconic elements of the Halo trilogy's music, written by Martin O'Donnell and partner Michael Salvatori. Consultation with O'Donnell and Salvatori finished before Rippy became involved in the project, but the composer sent a compact disc of his work to O'Donnell halfway through the writing process. Before starting work on Halo Wars, Rippy listened to previous Halo soundtracks and searched for useful material in discarded Ensemble projects; [...] "I'm a big fan of both cataloging that stuff and stealing from it without remorse," [...] Rippy said. [...] "Sometimes you don't know what you've got until you really, really need it." [...] Rippy and audio lead Kevin McMullan examined O'Donnell's tracks to identify elements to reuse in Halo Wars. Foregoing his usual method of writing melodies before determining the method of sound production, Rippy built melodies around synthesizer patches or drum loops. He felt that scoring for science fiction was <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> from his previous work, which was written for historical settings.|$|E
500|$|... "Fly on the Wall" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. Heather Phares of Allmusic {{said the}} song was a [...] "G-rated version" [...] of Britney Spears' song [...] "Toxic" [...] and provided hints of Cyrus' future musical direction. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe said [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] was <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> for Cyrus and called it [...] "the album's most interesting tune." [...] Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times said the song {{is a result of}} regular Walt Disney Company standards, yet [...] "the CD's best cut." [...] Along with [...] "Full Circle," [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said {{the song was}} a [...] "more worthy" [...] follow-up to [...] "See You Again". Mordechai Shinefield of The Village Voice stated the song was [...] "blazingly brilliant" [...] and that it was [...] "the best, angriest song [...]" [...] Johnny Dee of Virgin Media said the song and [...] "7 Things" [...] were [...] "feisty pop belters" [...] that would encourage a long-term career. Ratliff negatively compared [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] to the Pussycat Dolls and said that although Cyrus' voice is generally rich with a deep range, it became [...] "pinched and stingy" [...] in the single. However, he also said the song was [...] "teen-accurate".|$|E
500|$|Every {{aspect of}} the film was {{constantly}} analyzed, with storylines, jokes, and characters regularly being rewritten. Although most animated films do not make extensive changes to the film during active production due to budget restrictions, The Simpsons Movie crew continued to edit their film into 2007, with some edits taking place as late as May, {{two months before the}} film was released. James L. Brooks noted, [...] "70 percent of the things in —based on where we were eight weeks ago—are no longer in the movie." [...] Groening said that enough material for two more movies was cut. Various new characters were created, and then cut because they did not contribute enough. Originally Marge was the character who had the prophetic vision in church. The writers however considered this to be too dark and it was changed to Grampa. The role of Lisa's love interest Colin was frequently revised. He was previously named Dexter and Adrien, and his appearance was completely altered. One idea was to have Milhouse act as Lisa's love interest, but the writers realized [...] "the audience was not as familiar with [...] long-standing crush on [...] as [...] thought". A car chase in which Homer throws flaming mummies out of a truck at the EPA was replaced with [...] "more emotional and realistic" [...] scenes at the motel and carnival that allowed for <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Bum Bum" [...] {{represents}} <b>a</b> major <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> for {{the club}} queen with its slow, tropical beats and explicit Trey Songz feature.

[...] "'Cause every queen needs a king that wants her body all day and night." ...|$|R
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} finds Clarkson taking {{her time in}} love, and crooning about praising her lover. Sam Wilbur of AOL Radio is {{contented}} with the song's central theme, writing [...] "It's a simple, laid back love song that is <b>a</b> nice <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> for Clarkson who, along with 'Catch My Breath,' is singing more about love and happiness, instead of break-ups and heartbreak." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cruse's cartooning first {{attracted}} nationwide {{attention in}} the 1970s, when he contributed to underground comix publications.
