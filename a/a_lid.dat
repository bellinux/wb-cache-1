5|$|For the Royal Air Force, Proud had caves {{dug into}} the sides of a wadi to hide two of the Hurricanes. The third was hidden in a hole beside the runway, the same shape as the {{aircraft}}, and covered by <b>a</b> <b>lid</b> and some tents. Dummy aircraft and hangars were constructed to draw fire; these were marked as real on marked-up air photographs captured with a Luftwaffe airman. The aircraft all survived the siege, important both for air defence and for maintaining {{the morale of the}} defending troops.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottom end}} {{of the body is}} an ampulla (a flask-like swelling), which anchors the animal in the tube and enables it to retract its body very quickly when threatened. When the lophophore is {{extended}} {{at the top of the}} body, cilia (little hairs) on the sides of the tentacles draw food particles to the mouth, which is inside and slightly to one side of the base of the lophophore. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing <b>a</b> <b>lid</b> above the mouth or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The food then moves down to the stomach, which is in the ampulla. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath smokies, {{for which}} Arbroath is {{well-known}} nationally and internationally, are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004, which limits Arbroath smokie production to within 4km of Arbroath. Smokies {{are made from}} haddock using traditional methods {{dating back to the}} late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with <b>a</b> <b>lid.</b> After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area. However, one larger processor, RR Spink, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains. It appears that, nowadays, the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie. The company holds the Royal Warrant as a fishmonger to the Queen.|$|E
40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that the periodogram ordinates of <b>an</b> <b>lid</b> mean-zero Gaussian sequence at the Fourier frequencies constitute <b>an</b> <b>lid</b> exponential vector, hence the maximum of these periodogram ordinates has a limiting Gumbel distribution. We show for <b>a</b> non-Gaussian <b>lid</b> mean-zero, finite variance sequence that this statement remains valid. We also prove that the point process constructed from the periodogram ordinates converges to a Poisson process. This implies the joint weak convergence of the upper order statistics of the periodogram ordinates. These results are {{in agreement with the}} empirically observed phenomenon that various functionals of the periodogram ordinates of <b>an</b> <b>lid</b> finite variance sequence have very much the same asymptotic behavior as the same functionals applied to <b>an</b> <b>lid</b> exponential sample...|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{atmospheric}} convection—the ordinary {{process of}} lower, warm air rising—inversions leave cooler air suspended below warm air, preventing the lower air from rising and trapping airborne pollutants that would ordinarily disperse in the atmosphere. Such weather events are common, {{but they are}} usually followed by a strong cold front that brings an influx of clean air and disperses pollutants before they {{have enough time to}} become highly concentrated; in this case, a cold front approaching west through southern Canada was delayed. When explained in less formal terms, the process of an inversion causing a smog event has been compared to <b>a</b> <b>lid</b> that holds in pollutants or a balloon that fills with pollutants. In general, smog events occur not because of a sudden increase in a region's output of pollution, but rather because weather conditions like stagnant air prevent the dispersal of pollutants that were already present.|$|E

25|$|Crickets are {{a common}} subject of children's books on nature and advice on keeping pet crickets are plentiful. An ideal home habitat for a cricket is a large {{transparent}} jar or a small terrarium {{with at least two}} inches of damp soil on the bottom. There must be plenty of shelter where the crickets can hide; children's books and industrial breeders recommend egg-crate shells.

Two figurines were decorated with lines and had completely black heads and legs; the other two were not coloured, but they had traces of ocher red.|$|E
25|$|Food is {{prepared}} {{as if for}} an oven or stove top. However, because food cooks faster when it is in smaller pieces, food placed inside a solar cooker is usually cut into smaller pieces than it might otherwise be. For example, potatoes are usually cut into bite-sized pieces rather than roasted whole. For very simple cooking, such as melting butter or cheese, <b>a</b> <b>lid</b> may not be needed and the food may be placed on an uncovered tray or in a bowl. If several foods are to be cooked separately, then they are placed in different containers.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{pit latrine}} can be {{improved}} {{in a number of}} ways. One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure. This improves airflow and decreases the smell of the toilet. It also can reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass). In these types of toilets <b>a</b> <b>lid</b> need not be used to cover the hole in the floor. Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains into the hole and a reinforcement of {{the upper part of the}} pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability.|$|E

25|$|The {{eggs are}} laid in compact clusters. They may be round or {{barrel-shaped}} with <b>a</b> <b>lid</b> or a cap {{at the top}} (known as the operculum). They also contain a ring of small protuberances near the cap called micropylar processes. They permit the passage of sperm into the egg for fertilization and enable gaseous exchange from within the egg and the outside world for the embryos. The eggs are white or cream colored when freshly laid but can change color as the embryo matures. When hatching, the prolarva (the advanced embryo) exit the egg by opening the lid through peristaltic movements {{and with the help}} of a T-shaped internal structure in the egg (known as the egg burster).|$|E
25|$|Manchuria's economy boomed while {{chaos and}} {{uncertainty}} reigned {{in the rest}} of China. An especially ambitious project was to break the Japanese monopoly on cotton textiles by creating a large mill, which, much to Japan's sorrow, succeeded. The government also invested in other enterprises, among them quite a number of Sino-Japanese companies. During this time the Fengtian Army successfully kept <b>a</b> <b>lid</b> on Manchuria's many bandits. Various railway lines were built, among them the Shenyang-Hailong line, which opened in 1925. In 1924 Wang amalgamated three regional banks into the Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces, and became its General Director. By this he tried to create a development bank {{and at the same time}} keep accurate records of military spending.|$|E
25|$|CCT is {{required}} {{in order to ensure that}} folding takes place correctly. CCT is a group II cytosolic molecular chaperone (or chaperonin, a protein that assists in the folding of other macromolecular structures). CCT is formed of a double ring of eight different subunits (hetero-octameric) and it differs from other molecular chaperones, particularly from its homologue GroEL which is found in the Archaea, as it does not require a co-chaperone to act as <b>a</b> <b>lid</b> over the central catalytic cavity. Substrates bind to CCT through specific domains. It was initially thought that it only bound with actin and tubulin, although recent immunoprecipitation studies have shown that it interacts with a large number of polypeptides, which possibly function as substrates. It acts through ATP-dependent conformational changes that on occasion require several rounds of liberation and catalysis in order to complete a reaction.|$|E
