5000|$|The <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> must {{necessarily}} {{coincide with}} the payment period. If not, either the payment period or the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> must be modified. For example, if the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> given is the <b>effective</b> <b>annual</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> but cash flows are received (and/or paid) quarterly, the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> per quarter must be computed.

50|$|The {{indexed annuity}} is {{virtually}} identical to a fixed annuity {{except in the}} way interest is calculated. As an example, consider a $100,000 fixed annuity that credits a 4% <b>annual</b> <b>effective</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> The owner receives an interest credit of $4,000. However, in an equity-indexed annuity, the interest credit {{is linked to the}} equity markets. For example: Assume the index is the S&P 500, a one-year point-to-point method is used, and the annuity has an 8% cap. The $100,000 annuity could credit anything between 0% and 8% based on the change in the S&P 500. The cap, 8% in this example, is determined by how much is afforded by budget which is usually at or near the 4% fixed rate. If fixed rates increase, it would be expected that the cap would increase as well.|$|E

5000|$|Ontario {{enacted the}} Payday Loans Act, 2008 [...] {{to limit the}} fees charged on loans in Ontario to $21 per $100 {{borrowed}} {{for a period of}} two weeks.

5000|$|Norwegian {{student loans}} are similar [...] "subsidized" [...] federal loans in the United States, {{in the sense}} that no {{interest}} is paid until graduation or an interruption of the education.

5000|$|Newfoundland and Labrador has enacted no {{legislation}} on the matter, thereby leaving any restrictions {{up to the}} federal government's cap of 60%. Since the <b>effective</b> <b>annual</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on payday loans are typically over 5,000% (Manitoba with the lowest rate of $17 per $100 borrowed, (1.17^(365/14)-1)* 100)), this makes payday loans effectively illegal in the provinces. However, it appears that a payday loan industry exists in Newfoundland and Labrador, with the provincial prosecutors determining [...] "the prosecution of those offences {{was not in the}} public interest." ...|$|R
25|$|Prior to 2009 {{regulation}} of consumer credit was primarily {{conducted by the}} states and territories. Some states such as New South Wales and Queensland legislated <b>effective</b> <b>annual</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> caps of 48%. In 2008 the Australian states and territories referred powers of consumer credit to the Commonwealth. In 2009 the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (Cth) was introduced, which initially treated payday lenders no differently from all other lenders. In 2013 Parliament tightened regulation on the payday lending further introducing the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Act 2012 (Cth) which imposed an effective APR cap of 48% for all consumer credit contracts (inclusive of all fees and charges). Payday lenders who provided a loan falling within {{the definition of a}} small amount credit contract (SACC), defined as a contract provided by a non authorised-deposit taking institution for less than $2,000 for a term between 16 days and 1 year, are permitted to charge a 20% establishment fee in addition to monthly (or part thereof) fee of 4% (effective 48% p.a.). Payday lenders who provide a loan falling within the definition of a medium amount credit contract (MACC), defined as a credit contract provided by a non-deposit taking institution for between $2,000–$5,000 may charge a $400 establishment fee in addition to the statutory <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> cap of 48%. Payday lenders are still required to comply with Responsible lending obligations applying to all creditors. Unlike other jurisdictions Australian payday lenders providing SACC or MACC products are not required to display their fees as an <b>effective</b> <b>annual</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> percentage.|$|R
40|$|Controlled {{laboratory}} conditions using monetary incentives {{have been}} utilized {{in previous studies}} that examine individual discount rates, and researchers have found several apparently robust anomalies. We conjecture that subject behavior in these experiments may be affected by (uncontrolled) factors other than discount rates. We address some experimental design issues and report {{a new series of}} experiments designed to elicit individual discount rates. Our primary treatments include: (i) informing subjects of the <b>annual</b> and <b>effective</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> associated with alternative payment streams, and (ii) informing subjects of current market <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> We also test for the effect of real (vs. hypothetical) payments and for the effect of delaying both payment options (vs. offering an immediate payment option). The statistical analysis uses censored data techniques to account for the interactions between field and lab incentives. Each of the information treatments appears to reduce revealed discount rates. When both types of information are provided, annual rates in the interval of 15 %– 17. 5 % are revealed, whereas rates of 20 %– 25 % are revealed in the control session. Each of the treatments also lowers the residual variance of subject responses. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1999 experimental economics, discount rates, censored dependent variable,...|$|R
