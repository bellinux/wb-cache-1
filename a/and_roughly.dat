5|$|A set of {{elements}} under two binary operations, + and −, {{is called a}} Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R <b>and,</b> <b>roughly</b> speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the operations of a mathematical group or monoid. Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity.|$|E

Gradually, the power line turns to the southeast, as it crosses under several 735kV power lines.|$|E

5|$|In South Korea, {{eight people}} were killed and damage figures equated to US$71million. Widespread power outages took a toll on as many as 422,000homes and heavy rains flooded {{numerous}} fields of crops. Minor damage occurred in North Korea, though the damage wrought by Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in the month was exacerbated by Saomai's impacts. In Russia, where the typhoon made landfall as an extratropical storm, nine {{people were killed}} due to car accidents spurred by rainfall caused by the Saomai. Overall, Saomai's affects resulted in the death of 28people <b>and</b> <b>roughly</b> US$295million in damage.|$|E
5|$|In the Philippines, Elsie worsened the {{situation}} already {{left in the}} wakes of typhoons Angela and Dan. Although it was stronger than the previous two, Elsie caused far less damage due to the relatively sparse population {{in the area of}} landfall. During the storm's passage, 47 people were killed and another 363 were injured. Damages throughout the country amounted to $35.4million <b>and</b> <b>roughly</b> 332,000 people were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|Northern Ireland {{was created}} as a {{division}} of the United Kingdom by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and until 1972 it was a self-governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War and Belfast suffered four bombing raids in 1941. Conscription was not extended to Northern Ireland <b>and</b> <b>roughly</b> an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the south.

5|$|The domesticated cat and {{its closest}} wild {{ancestor}} are both diploid organisms that possess 38 chromosomes <b>and</b> <b>roughly</b> 20,000 genes.

5|$|Due to the {{impending}} threat of Manuel, several Mexican municipalities were put under disaster alerts. Upon making its first landfall, Manuel caused extreme flooding in southern Mexico. Property and agricultural damage {{as a result}} of the system was widespread, <b>and</b> <b>roughly</b> one million people were estimated to have been directly affected. In Guerrero, 97people perished, including 18in Acapulco. Seventy-one others died due to a mudslide in La Pintada. In Guerrero alone, around 30,000homes were damaged and 46rivers overflowed their banks. There, 20,000persons were evacuated to shelters. Statewide, repairs to damage from the storm totaled MXN$3billion ($230 million USD). Other impacts from Manuel spread as far east as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, where 300families were displaced. In the region, at least 11,591homes were destroyed by the floods. Meanwhile, the nation sustained additional impacts from Atlantic Hurricane Ingrid.|$|E

5|$|Governor Mike Easley {{declared}} a state of emergency in advance of the storm, and 200National Guard troops were dispatched to Charlotte, Raleigh, Kinston and Lumerton, while 800more were on standby. On Ocracoke Island, authorities ordered mandatory evacuations, while on Bogue Banks voluntary evacuations were in place. Officials in Wrightsville Beach drove along the streets with loudspeakers mounted on trucks, warning tourists that a storm was approaching. The storm forced the University of North Carolina at Wilmington to suspend a planned opening for students moving into residence halls. Campgrounds at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore were closed by the National Park Service and three boat ramps were closed. Duke Power Co. prepared for Charley by lowering the level of hydroelectric lakes to make room for excessive rainfall. The state Department of Environment and Natural Resources advised hog farmers to pump out their waste lagoon. About 60 Red Cross shelters were opened during the storm and during the peak of Charley, <b>and</b> <b>roughly</b> 1,600people sought protection.|$|E
5|$|Having {{between a}} fifth or sixth of the arable or good {{pastoral}} land <b>and</b> <b>roughly</b> {{the same amount}} of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture. Most farms were based around a family unit and used an infield and outfield system. Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the storm, urgent requests {{for food and}} clean water were made by residents in the hardest hit areas. By the afternoon of October23, the Red Cross began deploying relief supplies to the affected region; 300 tents and 150 bags of rice were planned to be distributed to Kyaukphyu where at least 5,000 people were left homeless. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a total of 176,823 people were affected by the storm and 70,795 were left homeless. By October30, the number affected and homeless had risen to 1.1million <b>and</b> <b>roughly</b> 100,000 respectively. Red Cross officials also reported that an estimated 60,000 people were in need of assistance throughout Myanmar. Later that day, a relief charity was opened in Rangoon to aid victims of the storm; in short order, the charity had received donations of 10million kyat ($10,000USD). By October25, temporary shelter camps set up by relief agencies housed an estimated 5,000 people.|$|E

5|$|In Central America, Ida brought heavy {{rainfall}} {{to parts of}} Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras. Several people were reported missing in Nicaragua, however post-storm reports denied these claims. Thousands of buildings collapsed or sustained damage <b>and</b> <b>roughly</b> 40,000 people were left homeless. Damages from Ida in Nicaragua amounted to at least 46million córdoba ($2.12million US$). Aside from {{heavy rainfall}} in Mexico and Cuba, little impact from Ida was reported in either country. In the United States, the remnants caused substantial damage, mainly in the Mid-Atlantic States. One person was killed by Ida after drowning in rough seas, while six others {{lost their lives in}} various incidents related to the nor'easter. Widespread heavy rainfall led to numerous reports of flash flooding in areas from Mississippi to Maine. Overall, the two systems caused nearly $300million in damage throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Late on August22, Bret turned northwestward in {{response}} to a mid-tropospheric ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and a mid-tropospheric circulation over the Rio Grande Valley. Several hours before landfall, the hurricane weakened to Category3 intensity and its forward motion slowed. At around 7:00pm CDT (0000UTC; August23), Hurricane Bret passed over Padre Island, Texas, with winds of 115mph (185km/h) and a barometric pressure of 951mbar (hPa; 28.08inHg), which marked its landfall. The hurricane rapidly weakened upon moving inland, <b>and</b> <b>roughly</b> 12 hours after landfall, Bret weakened to a tropical storm. It further degenerated into a tropical depression by the evening of August23. The remnants of Bret persisted until August26, at which time they dissipated over the mountains of northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Most of the fins {{are fairly}} narrow; in adults the {{pectoral}} fins are broad <b>and</b> <b>roughly</b> triangular. The moderately tall first dorsal fin is placed about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins, and its trailing margin is nearly vertical near the apex. The second dorsal fin is about three-quarters {{as high as the}} first and larger than the anal fin. The caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe; in young sharks the lower caudal fin lobe is much less distinct. This species is gray above, with darker saddles and scattered black spots that fade with age; the underside is off-white.|$|E
