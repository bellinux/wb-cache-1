60|$|Wolfenden {{swore to}} himself softly. He {{could have been}} there. He made <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> leave a card at the Embassy that afternoon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drummond'll be good next year," [...] said Trevor. And he made <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> tell Allardyce, {{who would}} succeed {{him in the}} command of the school football, {{to keep an eye}} on the player in question.|$|E
60|$|Half-a-dozen men of {{more or less}} {{importance}} made <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> nod to Kingston Brooks {{next time}} they saw him, and Mr. Bullsom trudged up his avenue with fresh schemes maturing in his mind. In the domestic circle he further unburdened himself.|$|E
60|$|I made <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> never <b>to</b> seem fairly {{friendly}} to an explorer. If you do, he always decides {{to stay the}} night.|$|R
5000|$|As I went to {{the front}} I was making <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> not <b>to</b> look up [...] "subdolous." [...] That trick of his, closing an {{argument}} by using a word he knew damn well I had never heard, was probably subdolous.|$|R
60|$|Canon Spratte {{smiled and}} made <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the remark, which {{he thought would}} do very well from his own lips.|$|R
60|$|At {{the time}} I did not fancy her {{appearance}} and made <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> {{the effect that}} I would never like Miss Ashley. I {{had no use for}} cool, businesslike women--women should have no concern with business. Nellie would never have troubled her dear, curly head over it.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he passed}} into the parish of Bratham, and his eye fell upon a neat red brick cottage, a garden planted with sunflowers, and a bright gravel path running to the rustic gate. He thought the garden charmingly old-fashioned, and had just entered <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> ask Angela who lived there, when the door opened, and figure he knew emerged, bearing a mat {{in one hand and}} a mopstick in the other. He was some way off, and at first could not quite {{distinguish}} who it was; but before she had come to the gate he recognized Pigott. By this time she had stepped into the road, and was making elaborate preparations to dust her mat so that she did not see him, till he spoke to her.|$|E
60|$|His mood, as the {{automobile}} whirred {{its way down}} the hill toward the town, was sunny. He looked on life benevolently and found it good. The view appealed to him more than it had managed to do on other days. As a rule, {{he was the man}} of blood and iron who had no time for admiring scenery, but to-day he vouchsafed it a not unkindly glance. It was certainly a dandy little place, this island of his. A vineyard on the right caught his eye. He made <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> uproot it and run up a hotel in its place. Further down the hill, he selected a site for a villa, where the mimosa blazed, and another where at present {{there were a number of}} utterly useless violets. A certain practical element was apt, perhaps, to color Mr. Scobell's half-hours with nature.|$|E
60|$|Lucy Coulson did not inquire {{whether he}} was acquainted with the lady in question, but made <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the fact.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon I'll {{stay here}} to see the thing out," [...] {{answered}} Williamson. Edwards made <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the frontiersman's evasive answer.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly {{they got}} into a hansom, and Mrs. d'Aubigne having given the address in Pimlico, of which George {{instantly}} made <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note,</b> they started.|$|R
60|$|The curtain {{had risen}} again, indeed, {{and the action}} was soon fast enough for the most {{impatient}} that day. No sooner had the town heard with bated breath of the expulsion of the first citizen from the inner sanctuary of the post-office, than the news of another event began to go the rounds. Mr. Worthington had other and {{more important things to}} think about than minor postmasters, and after his anger and--yes, and momentary fear had subsided, he forgot the incident except to make <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> remember to deprive Mr. Prescott of his postmastership, which he believed could be done readily enough now that Jethro Bass was out of the way. Then he had stepped into the bank, which he had come to regard as his own bank, as he regarded most institutions in Brampton. He had, in the old days, been president of it, as we know. He stepped into the bank, and then--he stepped out again.|$|E
50|$|As the new day is dawning, sleepless Paula {{is aware}} of the fact that the biggest revelation yet in the lives of her two {{children}} is imminent. She also makes <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> explain to them that they should decide wisely whether to tell anybody the news or not as the implications would be far-reaching: Grandma Helen, for one, might feel cheated out of her grandchildren. On the other hand, Paula can well imagine that her mother-in-law, by sheer maternal instinct, has known about their secret all along.|$|E
50|$|After her tryst with Dr. Pomatter, Jenna {{arrives at}} the diner for work to {{discover}} Becky and Cal having sex behind the counter. Jenna confronts Becky on the immorality of their affair, but Becky, aware of Jenna’s affair, defends herself, claiming that Jenna’s actions are no more moral simply because of her worse home situation (“I Didn’t Plan It”). Jenna and Dr. Pomatter continue their affair {{over the next few}} weeks, as do Becky and Cal, and Dawn and Ogie’s relationship progresses as well (“Bad Idea (Reprise)”). Jenna’s relationship with Dr. Pomatter, which has become apparent to many people including Dr. Pomatter’s nurse and Joe, comes to a brief halt when Dr. Pomatter is out of town and does not show up to one of their appointments. When he shows up to the next one, Jenna confronts him over their failure to communicate and considers if the whole affair is a mistake, but they both assure each other of their importance in a world where neither of them is truly valued (“You Matter To Me”). Jenna begins writing <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> her baby, inspired by the happiness that Dr. Pomatter has instilled in her.|$|E

40|$|D R. B. HURRIES {{from his}} {{laboratory}} {{to avoid being}} late for consultation rounds. The medical student exhaustive-ly presents the new case, carefully recounting all details in his 12 -page consultation note for the medical record. By {{the end of the}} recitation, Dr. B has difficulty identify-ing any question the requesting service might have had when first asking for assistance. Pleased to notice that some of his bench research relates even tangentially to one of the cases, he makes <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> cite it in his consultation. At the end of the student's presentation, the clinical fellow summarizes the status of the eight other patients being followed by the consultative service. For each pa-tient, he gives a rapid summary of all laboratory values obtained in the preceding 24 hours as well as the genera...|$|E
40|$|As an {{academic}} engaging with the tortuous process of bidding for funding, in scanning the contents page of this volume, my eye was immediately {{drawn to a}} study on rhetorical patterns in research grant proposals (Koutsantoni) and I have made <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> revisit this chapter at a later date. Moreover, as a researcher of undergraduate writing, a postgraduate writer, and a teacher of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) this book ticks all boxes for me. I imagine that every reader of this journal will have some interest in academic writing, even if only as a reader and writer of research articles. This comprehensive volume covers a range of disciplines (e. g. Biology, Economics, History), examines highly specific genres (e. g. the PhD literature review, undergraduate discursive essays) and expands our knowledge of specific features of writing (e. g. restrictive adverbs, engagement features, conjunctive ties) ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} a hard day. Sally and her {{children}} have just returned to the UK from a holiday abroad. It was just a short break. The flight took over six hours, but the luxury hotel in a tropical location was worth it. They are all tired, but it's {{time to get back}} to the real world [...] or Sally's version of it. The first task is to find something to eat. A quick look in the fridge and freezer confirms the need for a shopping trip. Both fridge and freezer contain plenty of food, but following the break abroad some items are after the 'use by' date and others just don't appeal. After clearing both fridge and freezer, Sally takes the children and drives the family WD to the store, making <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> avoid 'buy one, get one free' offers and (especially after the recent appeal by the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown) not to throw any more food away...|$|E
60|$|Making <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of both, Ralph hurried out. A {{policeman}} directed him to {{the tall}} office building in which his friend had rooms, and he was soon on his way thither.|$|R
60|$|He set {{off at a}} pace which {{rendered}} protest unavailing. Mr. Tredgold turned, and, making <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of {{the fact}} that Miss Drewitt had suddenly added inches to her stature, walked on by her side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Calm yourself, my good woman, calm yourself," [...] {{said the}} senior partner. He {{perceived}} that the evil prophesied {{by his son}} had come upon him, and he made <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of this fresh instance of Ezra's powers of foresight.|$|R
40|$|Authors {{are listed}} alphabetically. The authors gratefully {{acknowledge}} the editor, associate editor, and {{reviewers for their}} helpful suggestions and comments on previous versions of the article. 3 This article examines how unexpected changes in the marketing mix of one product in a retail setting can influence demand for other, unrelated items. Results from two laboratory studies show that spillover effects can occur in response to {{both positive and negative}} changes in either the price or quality of a product, such that positive changes increase total spending on other items and negative changes reduce it. The results also demonstrate that an attributional process underlies these effects, indicating that consumers experience specific affective responses directed at the retailer that lead them either to reward or punish the retailer accordingly. 4 Consider a consumer who makes an urgent late-night visit to a local supermarket to purchase a pain reliever. Upon arriving she notices that the store is offering routine discounts on a number of unrelated goods such as milk and paper towels, and she makes <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> pic...|$|E
40|$|Inviting {{artificial}} intelligence into our bodies has appeal - {{but it also}} carries certain risks. I have often {{wondered what it would}} be like to rid myself of a keyboard for data entry, and a computer screen for display. Some of my greatest moments of reflection are when I am in the car driving long distances, cooking in my kitchen, watching the kids play at the park, waiting for a doctor 2 ̆ 7 s appointment or on a plane thousands of metres above sea level. I have always been great at multitasking but at these times it is often not practical or convenient to be head down typing on a laptop, tablet or smartphone. It would be much easier if I could just make <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> record an idea and have it recorded, there and then. And who wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t want the ability to 2 ̆ 2 jack into 2 ̆ 2 all the world 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge sources in an instant via a network? Who wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t want instant access to their life-pages filled with all those memorable occasions? Or even the ability to slow down the process of ageing, as long as living longer equated to living with mind and body fully intact, as outlined in the video below. Transhumanists would have us believe that these things are not only possible but inevitable. In short: we Homo sapiens may dictate the next stage of our evolution through our use of technology...|$|E
40|$|A 47 -year-old perimenopausal woman, in {{your office}} for a well-woman examination, has a {{newspaper}} clip-ping given to her by a friend. The clipping reviews a re-cent article published in a well-known national medical journal that warns {{against the use of}} hormonal replace-ment therapy (HRT) because of an increased risk of breast cancer. 1 Although she is at low risk for this can-cer, and findings of her breast examination are normal, she resists your recommendation to begin HRT. When you discuss with her the results of an article showing that postmenopausal use of estrogen reduces the risk of severe coronary heart disease, 2 she counters with an-other article from the same issue that concludes that cardiovascular mortality is increased in estrogen users. 3 As you review these studies, you fail to recognize that all have serious flaws. Also, you do not have available arti-cles that are more methodologically sound that show the overwhelming benefit of HRT 4 - 6 with no increased risk in breast cancer 7 - 9 She leaves triumphantly from your office without a prescription, and you feel confused about the overall benefit of HRT. After you make <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> read more about HRT, you see your next patient, a 28 -year-old man with allergic rhinitis. He hands you a study he obtained from the Internet, which concludes that the latest anti-histamine is far superior in efficacy to all of the other antihistamines currently available on the market. He asks you for this new prescription, realizing that his health insurance company will not approve it unless you justifY to them why he should take this particular anti-histamine. You promise to review the article and call him later in the week with his prescription. The mother of your next patient, a 12 -year-old boy, requests a test that you have never heard of She hands you yet another article, which suggests that physicians who do not offer this test are guilty of negligence.
