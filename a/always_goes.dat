She is ranked in the top 10 {{throughout}} the whole country in standardized exam results of every subject—she <b>always</b> <b>goes</b> to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages.

25|$|As {{with most}} wine regions, {{the style of}} {{winemaking}} varies by winemaker and by vintage. In general, many Pomerol winemakers practice 15 to 21 days maceration and press when the wine has reached full dryness. The wine almost <b>always</b> <b>goes</b> through malolactic fermentation. The wine will receive 18 to 20 months of aging in barriques prior to bottling and release.|$|E
25|$|After {{harvest the}} grapes are destemmed and crushed {{with a short}} {{maceration}} period, often with the must warmed up to aid in extraction of color and phenolics before the wines are pressed and put into barrel. The wine almost <b>always</b> <b>goes</b> through malolactic fermentation. Some Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil producers with vineyards planted in lighter soils will produce an early maturing wine, with an even shorter maceration period and much less oak aging, that can be released {{as early as the}} summer after vintage while other examples will see 15 to 18 months of aging before being bottled.|$|E

500|$|The episode drew {{criticism}} from the lesbian community, however. Kate Murray of lesbian-based website AfterEllen.com regarded Emily's willingness {{to have sex with}} JJ as the use of a [...] "classic and highly offensive stereotype" [...] and felt that this [...] "undermine {{what it means to be}} a lesbian". She thought that the episode fell short of the previous episode, [...] "Naomi", which focused on Emily and Naomi's relationship, suggesting that this could be because [...] "Naomi" [...] was written by a 19-year-old female, Atiha Sen Gupta, while [...] "JJ" [...] was written by Elsley, a 47-year-old male. The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, was critical of the episode, writing, [...] "Welcome to the wonderful world of television, where being a lesbian and sleeping with men <b>always</b> <b>goes</b> hand in hand." [...] She did believe, however, that Emily's coming out to JJ was [...] "very funny" [...] and Effy's nonchalance about Naomi's sexuality was [...] "cool".|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera <b>always</b> <b>goes</b> {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E
500|$|Kenshin {{has been}} highly {{popular with the}} Rurouni Kenshin reader base, having ranked first in every Weekly Shōnen Jump {{popularity}} poll of the series, always with {{more than double the}} votes of the second place character. Two polls by the official Rurouni Kenshin anime featured Kenshin as one of the series' most popular characters. In the first, Kenshin was at the top, while in the second, he placed second. His Battōsai incarnation was also fifth in the latter poll. Kenshin has also been featured various times in the Animages Anime Grand Prix polls, ranking {{as one of the most}} popular male anime characters. In a Newtype poll in March 2010, Kenshin was voted the eighth most popular male anime character from the 1990s. An abundance of merchandise have been released in Kenshin's likeness including keychains, action figures, and plush dolls. Since the manga was published, non-functional and functional sakabatō have been produced for purchase by collectors and fans. In a poll by Anime News Network, Kenshin was voted as the second best male anime character with long hair, being surpassed by Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist. In 2014, IGN ranked him as the fifth greatest anime character of all time, saying that: [...] "Although Kenshin's momentary lapses make him a complete badass and set the stage for some of the most epic sword battles ever animated, Kenshin <b>always</b> <b>goes</b> back to his sweet persona once the danger is gone." [...] Kenshin was also fifth in IGN's Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with writer Chris Mackenzie describing him as: [...] "A classic example of a classic anime type, the peace-loving killing machine." [...] Kenshin's Amakakeru Ryū no Hirameki technique has ranked third in a Japanese survey that featured the most popular moves in manga and anime. In a poll by Anime News Network, he was voted as the top [...] "guy". In a Japanese TV special from August 2017, Kenshin was voted as the 16th [...] "strongest hero" [...] from the Showa Era as well as the 15th one from the Heisei Era.|$|E

500|$|A {{fundamental}} {{characteristic of the}} aesthete is immediacy. In Either/Or, there are several levels of immediacy explored, ranging from unrefined to refined. Unrefined immediacy is characterized by immediate cravings for desire and satisfaction through enjoyments {{that do not require}} effort or personal cultivation (e.g. alcohol, drugs, casual sex, sloth, etc.) Refined immediacy is characterized by planning how best to enjoy life aesthetically. The [...] "theory" [...] of social prudence given in Crop Rotation is an example of refined immediacy. Instead of mindless hedonistic tendencies, enjoyments are contemplated and [...] "cultivated" [...] for maximum pleasure. However, both the refined and unrefined aesthetes still accept the fundamental given conditions of their life, and do not accept the responsibility to change it. If things go wrong, the aesthete simply blames existence, rather than one's self, assuming some unavoidable tragic consequence of human existence and thus claims life is meaningless. Kierkegaard spoke of immediacy this way in his sequel to Either/Or, Stages on Life's Way, [...] "The esthetic sphere is the sphere of immediacy, the ethical the sphere of requirement (and this requirement is so infinite that the individual <b>always</b> <b>goes</b> bankrupt), the religious the sphere of fulfillment, but, please note, not a fulfillment such as when one fills an alms box or a sack with gold, for repentance has specifically created a boundless space, and as a consequence the religious contradiction: simultaneously to be out on 70,000 fathoms of water and yet be joyful. Just as the ethical sphere is a passageway-which one nevertheless does not pass through once and for all-just as repentance is its expression, so repentance is the most dialectical. No wonder, then, that one fears it, for if one gives it a finger it takes the whole hand. Just as Jehovah in the Old Testament visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the latest generations, so repentance goes backward, continually presupposing the object of its investigation. In repentance there is the impulse of the motion, and therefore everything is reversed. This impulse signifies precisely the difference between the esthetic and the religious as the difference between the external and the internal."

2500|$|While Leone {{developed}} Vincenzoni's idea into a script, the screenwriter {{recommended the}} comedy-writing team of Agenore Incrucci and Furio Scarpelli {{to work on}} it with Leone and Sergio Donati.

[...] Donati agreed, saying, [...] "There was next to nothing of them in the final script. They only wrote the first part. Just one line." [...] Vincenzoni claims that he wrote the screenplay in 11 days, but he soon left the project after his relationship with Leone soured. The three main characters all contain autobiographical elements of Leone. In an interview he said, [...] " [...] has no spirit, he's a professional in the most banal sense of the term. Like a robot. This isn't the case with the other two.
