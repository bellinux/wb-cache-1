40|$|Although {{useful in}} the {{management}} of malignant testicular tumours, <b>alphafoetoprotein</b> and human chromonic gonadotrophin are not perfect parameters of tumour bulk. In a series of 65 patients with marker-positive advanced disease, 23 showed the phenomenon of discordance of markers or dissociation from tumour response. Transplantable human malignant teratoma xenografts were established in immune-suppressed mice as models of the human disease. In the model system, it was demonstrated that tumour AFP concentration was reflected by AFP titres in the blood, but that tumour AFP (or blood AFP) did not correlate well with tumour size. One xenograft line illustrated the evolution of marker-negative tumour cells from a patient who was initially AFP-positive...|$|E
40|$|Cancers {{of unknown}} origin {{represent}} approximately 5 % of all cancers {{and are therefore}} as frequent as some solid tumors such as gastric or pancreatic cancers. The diagnosis of cancer of unknown origin {{should be based on}} a detailed pathological examination including immunohistochemical techniques and electron microscopy; hormonal receptors should also be measured. Besides detailed medical history and physical examination, only a few additional tests should be carried out: routine chemistry including the assay of HCG, <b>alphafoetoprotein</b> and specific antigen of the prostate, chest X-ray, thyroid scan, mammography and abdominal CT scan. Other tests are generally not of sufficient specificity and sensitivity. Unknown primary tumors arising in the cervical area are frequently squamous cell carcinomas corresponding to occult primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive mucosae and are efficiently treated by cervicofacial radiotherapy or lymph node dissection. Women presenting with axillary lymph nodes with no obvious primary tumor should be treated according to the guidelines used for breast cancer. The patients with inguinal lymph nodes of unknown origin are usually treated with radiation therapy. The syndrome of germinal tumors of extragonadic origin are usually treated with radiation therapy. The syndrome of germinal tumors of extragonadic origin corresponds to cases of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinomas in patients under 50 years of age and with one of the following characteristics: involvement of the median organs, lung involvement, lymph node involvement or increase of <b>alphafoetoprotein</b> or HCG. The therapeutic approach recommended for these patients consists of the chemotherapeutic combination used for testicular cancer. For all other patients, the prognosis remains poor. Patients with local symptoms may be treated by radiation therapy; others may receive a combination of fluorouracil, doxorubicin and mitomycin. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Two human primary {{liver cancer}} cell-lines, PLC/PRF/ 5 and Hep 3 B, grown both in vitro and as xenografts in nude mice {{were used to}} {{evaluate}} the chemotherapeutic potential of a new quinazoline antifolate CB 3717. Xenograft growth rate was followed both by serial serum <b>alphafoetoprotein</b> (AFP) measurement and direct volume estimation. A dose regime of 200 mg CB 3717 kg- 1 body wt day- 1 for 5 days caused a significant reduction in growth rate, as measured by relative serum AFP, of both xenografts; PLC/PRF/ 5 derived xenograft growth was also inhibited by 125 mg CB 3717 kg- 1 day- 1 for 5 days. Cell culture experiments showed that the ID 50 for the cell lines fell within the range of serum CB 3717 concentration achieved by a dose of 300 mg m- 2 given to patients. Treatment with CB 3717 stimulated the incorporation of exogenous thymidine into DNA by the tumour cells, presumably because of inhibition of the de novo pathway and reduction of endogenous thymidine triphosphate pools. These results suggest that CB 3717 may be a useful new therapeutic agent in human primary liver cell carcinoma and that blocking the salvage pathway may further increase efficacy...|$|E
40|$|Rat, mouse, pig {{and chicken}} <b>alphafoetoproteins</b> (AFP), rat serum albumin and egg albumin, or their fluoresceinated conjugates {{were added to}} {{cultures}} of several cloned cell lines isolated from a nickel-induced rat rhabdomyosarcoma. The intracellular uptake of assayed proteins was revealed by the indirect immunoperoxidase technique and/or by direct fluorescence microscopy. All the clones examined bound AFP, and all but one internalized the protein. The protein localized in the membrane and the cytoplasm, as well as along straight processes interconnecting cells. Nuclei were always AFP negative. The protein uptake of fluoresceinated conjugates of AFP and serumalbumin was already visible 15 min after incubation and progressed with time to reach a plateau 4 - 5 h later. Ultrastructural radioautographs of cells incubated with [3 H]-AFP (rat) showed protein accumulation in several organelles and particularly in lipid droplets. Parallel to these observations, the intracellular presence of AFP within myofibrillar structures was demonstrated in tongue sections of rat foetuses and neonates. The results presented here provide experimental evidence of the reappearance in cloned cell lines derived from a primary rhabdomyosarcoma of a property pertaining to foetal striated muscle. © 1983 The Macmillan Press Ltd.

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA {{was found}} to be {{integrated}} into seven sites in the DNA of the PLC/PRF/ 5 hepatoma cell line as determined by digestion with the restriction endonuclease HindIII which does not cut hrough the viral genome. The integration pattern was stable in the cell line, in tumours induced in athymic mice by this line and in cell lines derived from such tumours. Syntheses of hepatitis B surface antigen and <b>alphafoetoprotein</b> were maintained in the induced tumours and derived cell lines. A defective HBV DNA molecule (approx. 2 - 8 kilobase pairs) appears to be integrated in a head-to-tail tandem arrangement and it is proposed that such defective molecules may be involved in the process of neoplastic transformation by HBV. The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line PLC/PRF/ 5 synthesizes and secretes 20 nm hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) particles of identical composition to those found in the serum of carriers (Monjardino & Crawford, 1979; Skelly et al., 1979), but not he other major virus gene products (core antigen and DNA polymerase). HBV DNA is present in this cell line integrated into the host cell DNA at a number of sites but free viral genomes have not been detected (Brechot et al., 1980; Chakraborty et al., 1980; Edman et al., 1980; Marion e...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the prognostic value of pretreatment FDG {{positron emission tomography}} computed tomography (PET-CT) in patients with hepatocarcinoma treated by liver transplantation (LT). METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed the data of 27 patients (mean age 58 +/- 9 years) who underwent FDG PET-CT before LT for hepatocarcinoma. Mean follow-up was 26 +/- 18 mo. The FDG PET/CT was performed according to a standard clinical protocol: 4 MBqFDG/kg body weight, uptake 60 min, low-dose non-enhanced CT. The authors measured the SUVmax and SUVmean of the tumor and the normal liver. The tumor/liver activity ratios (RSUVmax and RSUVmean) were tested as prognostic factors and compared to the following conventional prognostic factors: MILAN, CLIP, OKUDA, TNM stage, <b>alphafoetoprotein</b> level, portal thrombosis, size of the largest nodule, tumor differentiation, microvascular invasion, underlying cirrhosis and liver function. RESULTS: Overall and recurrence free survivals were 80. 7 % and 67. 4 % at 3 years, and 70. 6 % and 67. 4 % at 5 years, respectively. According to a multivariate Cox model, only FDG PET/CT RSUVmax predicted recurrence free survival. Even though the MILAN criteria alone were not predictive, {{it is worth noting}} that none of the patients outside the MILAN criteria and with RSUVmax < 1. 15 relapsed. CONCLUSION: FDG PET/CT with an RSUVmax cut-off value of 1. 15 is a strong prognostic factor for recurrence and death in patients with HCC treated by LT in this retrospective series. Further prospective studies should test whether this metabolic index should be systematically included in the preoperative assessment. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AIM : FDG uptake {{has been}} shown to predict the outcome in large series of {{patients}} with hepatocarcinoma (HCC) in Asia, but few data are available regarding European populations. Our aim was to evaluate the prognostic value of pretreatment FDG PET-CT in patients treated by liver transplantation. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 27 patients (24 M and 3 W, mean age 58 ± 9 years). The mean follow-up was 26 ± 18 months (min 1 month, max 66 months). All patients had an FDG PET-CT before the transplantation. The FDG PET/CT was performed according to a standard clinical protocol: 4 MBqFDG/kg body weight, uptake 60 min., low-dose non-enhanced CT. We measured the SUVmax and SUVmean of the tumor and the normal liver. The tumor/liver activity ratios (RSUVmax and RSUVmean) were tested as prognostic factors and compared to the following conventional prognostic factors: MILAN, CLIP, OKUDA, TNM stage, <b>alphafoetoprotein</b> level, portal thrombosis, size of the largest nodule, tumor differentiation, microvascular invasion, underlying cirrhosis and liver function. Results : The DFS was 87. 2 % at 1 y and 72. 1 % at 3 y. The OS was 85. 2 % at 1 y and 80. 7 % at 3 y. According to an univariate Cox model, RSUVmax, RSUVmean and healthy liver were predictors of DFS and RSUVmax, RSUVmean, size of the largest nodule, CLIP, liver involvement> 50 %, and healthy liver predicted the OS. According to a multivariate Cox model, only RSUVmax predicted DFS and RSUVmax and liver involvement> 50 % predicted OS. An ROC analysis of the ratios showed that the 1. 15 cut-off for RSUVmax was best for predicting both the DFS (Cox regression:HR 14. 4, p= 0. 02) and OS (HR 5. 6, p= 0. 049). The Kaplan-Meier curves and Logrank tests confirmed those results. Even though the MILAN criteria alone were not predictive, {{it is worth noting that}} none of the patients outside the MILAN criteria and with RSUVmax< 1. 15 relapsed. Conclusions: The RSUVmax is a strong prognostic factor for recurrence and death in patients with HCC treated by liver transplantation with a cut-off value of 1, 15. further prospective studies should test whether the metabolic index should be systematically included in the preoperative assessment.
