500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> in and figured {{it out on the}} date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It reminds me of the way we used to do the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about. They'd work it out right there in the room".|$|E
500|$|The play {{opened for}} tryouts in New Haven, Connecticut on March 22, 1945. [...] The first act was well-received; {{the second act}} was not. [...] Casto {{recalled}} that the second act finished about 1:30a.m. [...] The staff immediately sat down for a two-hour conference. [...] Five scenes, half the ballet, and two songs were cut from the show as the result. [...] John Fearnley commented, [...] "Now I see why these people have hits. [...] I never witnessed anything so brisk and brave in my life." [...] De Mille said of this conference, [...] "not three minutes had been wasted pleading for something cherished. [...] Nor was there any idle joking.... We cut and cut and cut <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> to bed." [...] By the time the company left New Haven, de Mille's ballet was down to forty minutes.|$|E
500|$|In October 1969, Hendrix and Cox began jamming and {{recording}} demos with drummer Buddy Miles. [...] Miles had played with various R and soul musicians, {{as a member}} of the Electric Flag and fronting the Buddy Miles Express, both blues rock-R fusion groups. [...] Miles was also a frequent jam partner of Hendrix and played the drums the year before on the two-part song [...] "Rainy Day, Dream Away"/"Still Raining, Still Dreaming" [...] for Electric Ladyland. Cox and Miles expressed an interest in performing {{and recording}} a new album with Hendrix. Hendrix's manager, Michael Jeffery, saw the opportunity to record a live album during a New Year's performance at the Fillmore East and the trio began preparing for the upcoming concerts and new album. Between then and the end of December, the trio rehearsed at Juggy Sound Studios and recorded several demos at the Record Plant Studios in New York City, where Hendrix recorded much of Electric Ladyland. [...] After Hendrix's December 10, 1969, acquittal in his Canadian trial, the trio rehearsed their material at Baggy's Studios up until their first concert appearance on December 31. [...] In an interview, Hendrix explained, [...] "We spent 12 to 18 hours a day practicing this whole last week, straight ahead, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into a funky little club and jammed down there to test it out". [...] Early versions of some of the songs which eventually appeared on Band of Gypsys from two of the rehearsal sessions were released as The Baggy's Rehearsal Sessions by Dagger Records in 2002.|$|E

2500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Flawless" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava. It was released on December 13, 2013 on the album Beyoncé on the iTunes Store, which contained a video for every song. [...] Beyoncé worked on the choreography for the video with Les Twins and Chris Grant. [...] "We had done half the video, and we watched it, and Beyoncé knew that it needed a dance moment that would be iconic, that people could pick up on. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> back and reshot that part. Because after seeing the video, and after the song coming together, she was like, 'This needs a cool dance that anybody can do'", said Beyoncé's creative director Todd Tourso.|$|E
2500|$|Parker later {{spoke of}} how his musical {{relationship}} with Canyons came to be: [...] "They used to run a label which Tame Impala used to sort of be on. We released a 12” vinyl with them once, on one side it had three Tame Impala songs {{and on the other}} it was the same three songs remixed by Canyons and that was really cool, it was a really casual relationship. We always talked about releasing things but we never got round to it because I’d just go round to his house and talk about music for a while. So we never actually got anything pressed until we had signed with Modular <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> back and did stuff with Canyons." ...|$|E
2500|$|Off-screen, Hay was {{described}} as being a very serious and private man, some thought he may have a dark side due to his demeanour. Peter Ustinov, who made his film debut in The Goose Steps Out as a straight man to Hay, said in a 1990 interview when asked about working with him [...] "Well, Will Hay wasn't very funny but I found that very few comics are." [...] as well as [...] "And Will Hay was always {{wrapped in a blanket}} at certain hours and had his tea, and we all stopped talking while he was having his tea, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> on shooting. I don't remember him saying anything memorable, nothing I could remember at all. He was very funny when you saw him on the screen, but in life all those people are very, very strange." ...|$|E

5000|$|Korine {{worked with}} editor Chris Tellefsen to {{synthesize}} the pre-planned footage with the [...] "mistakist" [...] footage. Korine comments, [...] "We go from scenes that are completely thought out, almost formal, scenes that resonate in this classical film sense, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> to other scenes where it's like, total mistakes, stuff shot on video {{where the kids}} forget there's a camera there {{and talk about how}} much they hate niggers." ...|$|R
2500|$|Now I {{will never}} forget this incident... We were at al-Malikiyya, the other {{frontier}} base and word came through about 6 {{o'clock in the morning}} that one of our patrols had been blown up and Millie Law [...] had been killed. Now Gerald Whitfeld [...] had told these mukhtars that if any of this sort of thing happened he would take punitive measures against the nearest village {{to the scene of the}} mine. Well the nearest village to the scene of the mine was a place called al-Bassa and our Company C were ordered to take part in punitive measures. And I {{will never forget}} arriving at al-Bassa and seeing the Rolls Royce armoured cars of the 11th Hussars peppering Bassa with machine gun fire and this went on for about 20minutes <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> in and I remembered we had lighted braziers and we set the houses on fire and we burnt the village to the ground... Monty had him [...] up and he asked him all about it and Gerald Whitfeld explained to him. He said [...] "Sir, I have warned the mukhtars in these villages that if this happened to any of my officers or men, I would take punitive measures against them and I did this and I would've lost control of the frontier if I hadn't." [...] Monty said [...] "All right but just go a wee bit easier in the future." ...|$|E
