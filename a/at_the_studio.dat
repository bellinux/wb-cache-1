5|$|In September 2013, Miyazaki {{announced}} that he was retiring from the production of feature films due to his age, but wished to continue working on the displays <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Studio</b> Ghibli Museum.

5|$|Hess {{acquired}} full {{ownership of}} the Jets on February 9, 1984, when Helen Dillion sold her 25%interest to him. Before the season, New York traded quarterback Richard Todd to the New Orleans Saints. New York began its season with veteran Pat Ryan as starting quarterback; O'Brien was spending most weekdays waiting to testify about an altercation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Studio</b> 54 nightclub, at which Jets players had been present and, by some accounts, involved. The Jets had a second consecutive mediocre season, finishing 7–9 after starting the season 6–2.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Carter {{began dating}} Dori Pierson, {{whom he had}} met through a cousin of hers {{who worked with him}} at Surfing Magazine. Pierson's {{connections}} at Walt Disney Studios led to chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg hiring Carter on a standard contract. Carter began writing television films for the studio, penning The B.R.A.T. Patrol in 1986 and Meet the Munceys in 1988. These scripts led to Carter being associated with contemporary youth comedy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio,</b> and although he enjoyed the work he felt that his real strengths and interests lay in serious drama instead.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began at}} Leavesden Studios near London. Warner Bros. {{purchased}} Leavesden {{as a permanent}} studio site after previously renting space there for its production of the Harry Potter films. Though Liman intended to film the beach battle on location, the studio instead had a beach set built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> site. The set was surrounded by chroma key green screens, which the visual effects artists later used to extend the beach with plates shot at Saunton Sands in North Devon. It was intended for the battle scenes to be reminiscent of coastal battles during World War II such as the Invasion of Normandy and the Battle of Dunkirk.|$|E
50|$|Hiller {{created the}} MUSICOMP ("MUsic SImulator-Interpreter for COMpositional Procedures") {{programming}} language for music composition with Robert Baker {{in order to}} create their Computer Cantata (1963) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>studios.</b> MUSICOMP was used by Brün in generating his Non Sequitur VI (1966).

5|$|The Disney {{animation}} {{training program}} started <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> before {{the development of}} Snow White in 1932 eventually led to Walt Disney helping found the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). This university, formed via the merger of Chouinard Art Institute and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music, included a Disney-developed animation program of study among its degree offerings. CalArts became the alma mater {{of many of the}} animators who would work at Disney and other animation studios from the 1970s to the present.|$|E
5|$|The {{school is}} known for its annual musicals, which often sell out. The school also reaches out to {{professionals}} who volunteer their time; the assistant director <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Studio</b> Theater (also the son of Frances G.

5|$|While {{living in}} Los Angeles, Earp became an unpaid film {{consultant}} for several silent cowboy movies. In 1916, {{he went with}} his friend Jack London, whom he knew from Nome, to visit the set of former cowboy, sailor, and movie actor-turned-film director Raoul Walsh, who was shooting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> of Mutual Film conglomerate in Edendale, California. Walsh took the two men to dinner at Al Levy's Cafe on Main and Third Street. During the meal, the highest paid entertainer in the world, Charlie Chaplin, dropped by to greet Wyatt Earp. Chaplin was impressed by both men, but particularly the former Tombstone marshal.|$|E

5|$|After Banner, Briskin {{returned}} to work at Columbia Pictures, where he began producing for them in 1926, and in 1928 he was given control over 18 of their productions. By 1929, Briskin had risen to be a top executive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio,</b> sharing honors with studio head Harry Cohn, in giving the closing address at Columbia's annual sales meeting in July 1929. By the end of 1929, Briskin was the assistant general manager of Columbia, and {{on a visit to}} New York City signed several Broadway playwrights to long-term contracts with the studio, including Elmer Harris, Jo Swerling, and Paul Hervey Fox. Not only was Briskin active in the production office at Columbia, but he also played on Columbia's baseball team, which competed in the Motion Picture Baseball League. It was while working at Columbia that Briskin met Frank Capra. In 1930, Briskin's brother Irving, who he had employed while at Banner, joined him as a producer at Columbia.|$|E
5|$|All That Is Within Me is {{the fifth}} studio album by American Christian rock band MercyMe. Produced by Brown Bannister, it was {{released}} on November 20, 2007 through INO Records. The album, intended by the band to be a worship album split between covers and original songs, was recorded following the band's tour with Audio Adrenaline in promotion of their previous studio album Coming Up to Breathe (2006). Although the band intended to write material for a new album during the tour, they had only written one song {{by the time they}} entered their recording studio, Cider Mountain Studio in Athol, Idaho. The band wrote so many songs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> that they decided not to include any cover songs; all of the songs on the album but were written or co-written by the band. The album was described as being a rock and worship album, being aimed directly at a Christian audience.|$|E
5|$|Baker {{has been}} married three times; she first married Louie Ritter in 1953, but the {{marriage}} ended within a year, after which she enrolled at the Actors Studio in New York City. Baker alleged that Ritter had raped {{her when she was}} still a virgin {{in the early stages of}} their relationship. Her second was to director Jack Garfein, a Holocaust survivor she met <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Studio</b> and for whom she converted to Judaism (having been raised a Catholic). They had one daughter, Blanche Baker (born 1956), also an actress; and a son, Herschel Garfein (born 1958), who is a composer and faculty member at the Steinhardt School of Music at New York University.

5|$|By 1955 the {{original}} sound negatives began to deteriorate, though a four-track copy had survived in good condition. Using the remaining Fantasound system <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio,</b> a three-track stereo copy was transferred across telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood. This copy was used when Fantasia was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in SuperScope, a derivative of the anamorphic widescreen CinemaScope format, on February 7, 1956. The projector featured an automatic control mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens, which allowed {{the picture to}} switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to the wide ratio of 2.35:1 in twenty seconds without {{a break in the}} film. This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels. Only selected parts of the animation were stretched, while all live action scenes remained unchanged. This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers, as the widescreen format led to the cropping and reframing of the images.|$|E
5|$|Deal was {{satisfied}} with the material recorded up to this point, but realized {{she would not be}} able to tour without a band. She returned to New York to look for a backing group in March 2000. After a chance meeting with members of Fear, she invited drummer Andrew Jaimez, bassist Mando Lopez, and guitarist Richard Presley to jam with her <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> she was renting. Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, Lopez, and Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon after. About a month after Kim Deal's arrival, Jose Medeles replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not have enough time for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical projects. The new line-up spent the rest of the year writing and rehearsing.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{pages were}} filmed per day, {{six days a}} week, with three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular time}} with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with the dog and often groomed the dog <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more believable, but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.|$|E
