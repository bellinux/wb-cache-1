The Earth has an internal heat content of 1031joules (3·1015TW·hr), approximately 100 billion times current (2010) worldwide <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> About 20% of this is residual heat from planetary accretion, and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past. Natural heat flows are not in equilibrium, and the planet is slowly cooling down on geologic timescales.

The objective of this research was to model and analyse a district heating network and develop an optimisation method to calculate the minimum capital investment, heat losses and pump <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> Firstly, modelling and analysis of a district heating network was conducted to obtain district heating design cases with minimum <b>annual</b> total <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> <b>annual</b> total exergy consumption and annualised cost. Then through the analysis, a two-stage programming model was developed which synthesised design and optimal operation of a district heating network. The optimisation was used to minimise <b>annual</b> total <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> <b>annual</b> total exergy consumption or annualised cost of the heat network by selecting suitable pump and pipe sizes, taking into account different parameters such as target pressure loss, temperature regime and operating strategy.

In all cases, a variable flow and variable supply temperature operating method was found to be beneficial. Design cases with minimum <b>annual</b> total <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> and annualised cost used rather small pipe diameters and large pressure drops. To achieve the minimum annual total exergy consumption a design case with larger pipe diameters and smaller pressure loss was found to be desirable. It was observed that by reducing the water temperature and increasing temperature difference between supply and return pipes, the <b>annual</b> total <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> <b>annual</b> total exergy consumption and the annualised cost were reduced.
