500|$|In May 2012 Daft Punk's {{collaboration}} with Giorgio Moroder was announced—Moroder had recorded a monologue {{about his life}} {{for use in a}} track on the album. Rodgers was also present during the Moroder recording session. Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer: [...] "They did not let me get involved at all. Thomas <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to tell the story of}} my life. Then they would know what to do with it." [...] Daft Punk had been in contact with Moroder in relation to a possible contribution for the Tron: Legacy score, but this never happened.|$|E
500|$|During the {{pregnancy}} storyline, Martha was also {{diagnosed with breast}} cancer. The storyline was introduced {{just over a year}} after Gordon's partner, Chris Burkhardt, died from acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 23. Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given". Gordon said [...] "The producer <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do this storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based on what I had been through, I definitely think this one tops all of them". Gordon added that anyone going through Martha's ordeal would find it hard, but [...] "you just look to your friends and family and do your best in that situation and then move on".|$|E

I {{actually}} had arranged a meeting, just because I was so infatuated {{with her and}} I wanted to meet {{the person who had}} produced all this music. We got along, and we were kind of friendly, and actually, after I met her the first time, she <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be her band leader. But the Nazz had just signed a record contract and I couldn't skip out on the band, even though it was incredibly tempting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lee's {{first film}} for Hammer was The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), {{in which he}} played Frankenstein's monster, with Peter Cushing as Baron Victor Frankenstein. It was the first film to co-star Lee and Cushing, who {{ultimately}} appeared together in over twenty films and became close friends. When he arrived at a casting session for the film, [...] "they <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> the part, I said yes and that was that". A little later, Lee co-starred with Boris Karloff in the film Corridors of Blood (1958), but Lee's own appearance as Frankenstein's monster led to his first appearance as the Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula in the film Dracula (1958, known as Horror of Dracula in the United States). A critically acclaimed film that saw Lee fix {{the image of the}} fanged vampire in popular culture, Dracula has been ranked among the best British films. Lee accepted a similar role in an Italian-French horror picture called Uncle Was a Vampire (1959).|$|E
2500|$|Nancy's {{hair has}} {{dominated}} her many styles {{and she has}} had several different hair colours. When asked about her character's [...] "crazy" [...] hair styles Fox revealed that the ideas for the styles are a collaboration of her own ideas and the production teams': [...] "I had a brown bob forever and I was sick to death of it, so when {{we came out of}} the Jake storyline last year, they wanted to change the image. They <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to dye it any colour, so I thought 'let's go red'". Fox said that her initial Hollyoaks image featuring green hair was [...] "definitely not a good look". She added that during her tenura Nancy has had a [...] "few hair disasters", especially the in between stages when she [...] "went back to black from red and then to blonde". She said that since her character has been through so much she no longer feels it necessary to [...] "desperately shock" [...] everyone with her hair styles as she has had to grow up and evolve. Fox said she enjoys Nancy's style which has [...] "evolved" [...] as she has [...] "been a Goth, she’s been a New Romantic and now I like to call her Dusty Springfield on acid! It’s a bit Duffy, a bit ’50s-style, and now I’ve got the red hair it gives us more to play with". Fox added that [...] "one of my favourite things about being in a soap for a long time - I do get to change my image a lot". She said that she enjoys the feedback she receives from her style changes and when her latest style was aired and she had [...] "cut it into a short bob, I got so many tweets from people - some negative, but mostly positive thankfully". She said that she would be open to changing her image in future. Fox has also commented on Nancy's large tattoo on her back, which she deemed to be [...] "too masculine". Fox said that when she was initially on the serial she found it [...] "great to be different" [...] but felt that it was difficult playing the [...] "alternative" [...] character of Nancy when her colleagues were such [...] "gorgeous, glamourous women". The tattoo has since disappeared. Of the character's dress sense the Hollyoaks wardrobe department said [...] "Nancy Hayton has a unique distinctive look on Hollyoaks. She wears rich colours and vibrant patterns, which compliment [...] her slim shape".|$|E
60|$|We strolled round, {{before we}} came out. Just by the {{entrance}} to the choir an official stopped me, and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to go and see a lot of fal-lal things he had got on show--relics and bones, and old masters, and such-like Wardour-street rubbish.|$|E

60|$|His answer {{startled me}} into perfect silence. Mr. Sherwin kept a large linen-draper's shop {{in one of}} the great London thoroughfares! The boy {{mentioned}} the number, and the side of the way on which the house stood--then <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to know anything more. I could only tell him by a sign that he might leave me, and that I had heard enough.|$|E
6000|$|Savvee or catchee are {{practically}} the only words {{which have been}} introduced straight from pigeon English. Of course, pickaninny has happened along, but some of its uses are delicious. Having bought a fowl from a native in a canoe, the native <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> [...] "Pickaninny stop along him fella." [...] It was not until he showed me a handful of hen's eggs that I understood his meaning. My word, as an exclamation with a thousand significances, could have arrived from nowhere else than Old England. A paddle, a sweep, or an oar, is called washee, and washee is also the verb.|$|E
60|$|The train gives a last sigh, {{and draws}} to a last {{standstill}} {{in the tiny}} terminus station. An old fellow fluttering with rags as a hen in the wind flutters, <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> the Albergo, the inn. I said yes, and let him take my knapsack. Pretty Sorgono! As we went down the brief muddy lane between hedges, to the village high-road, we seemed almost to have come to some little town in the English west-country, or in Hardy's country. There were glades of stripling oaks, and big slopes with oak trees, and on the right a saw-mill buzzing, and on the left the town, white and close, nestling round a baroque church-tower. And the little lane was muddy.|$|E

I said that I {{was not a}} slave-woman, and that I would be sold to no man. My high-school teacher was a haole old maid who said love of woman was so beyond price that it must never be sold. Perhaps that is why she was an old maid. She was not beautiful. She could not give herself away. My kanaka mother {{said it was not}} the kanaka way to sell their daughters for a money price. They gave their daughters for love, and she would listen to reason if Yap Ten Shin {{provided}} luaus in quantity and quality. My pake father, as I have told you, was liberal. He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> Yap Ten Shin for my husband. And I said yes; and freely, of myself, I went to him. He it was who was kicked by a horse; but he was a very good husband before he was kicked by the horse.|$|E

It was only {{supposed}} to be a year but it ended up being 7. I ended up staying there for a while, did some school, did some skating, and tried the Swedish food. It was good.|$|E

Here, he {{attended}} Hopkins High School where he would create the foundations of Doomtree with P.O.S, Paper Tiger, MK Larada and Lazerbeak. When asked on meeting P.O.S on his first day at Hopkins, Marquez stated: [...] "He had a little patch of blue in his hair, and he came up and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to buy this homemade punk zine he had for $1.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1976, Peters had a {{supporting}} role in the TV miniseries The Moneychangers. When asked why she took the role, she said: [...] "I'll be darned if I know. A moment of madness, I think. I ran into my old friend Ross Hunter, who was producing The Moneychangers for NBC-TV, and he <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be in it. It seemed like fun. It's a nice part - not too big - and I greatly admire Christopher Plummer, whom I play opposite." ...|$|E
