50|$|<b>A</b> split <b>decision</b> is {{different}} from <b>a</b> majority <b>decision.</b> <b>A</b> majority <b>decision</b> occurs when two judges pick the same fighter as the winner, and the third judge scores the fight as a draw (evenly for both fighters). The official result (i.e., a win or loss) is the same in both split and majority decisions, but the margin of victory is greater in <b>a</b> majority <b>decision.</b> <b>A</b> split <b>decision</b> is the closest possible result for a fight {{in which there is}} an official winner and loser.|$|R
