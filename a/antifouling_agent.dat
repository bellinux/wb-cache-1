50|$|Copper-based {{paint is}} a common marine <b>antifouling</b> <b>agent.</b> In the United States, copper-based paint {{replaced}} tributyltin, which was banned due to its toxicity, {{as a way for}} boats to control organic growth on their hulls. In 2011, Washington state became the first U.S. state to ban the use of copper-based paint for boating, although it only applied to recreational boats. California has also pursued initiatives to reduce the effect of copper leaching, with the U.S. EPA pursuing research.|$|E
50|$|Antifouling {{paints and}} other related {{coatings}} are routinely used to prevent the buildup of microorganisms and other animals, such as barnacles for the bottom hull surfaces of recreational, commercial and military sea vessels. Ablative paints are often utilized for this purpose to prevent the dilution or deactivation of the <b>antifouling</b> <b>agent.</b> Over time, the paint will slowly decompose in the water, exposing fresh antifouling compounds on the surface. Engineering the antifouling agents and the ablation rate can produce long-lived protection from the deleterious effects of biofouling.|$|E
30|$|In {{the past}} decades, great {{attention}} has been paid to search for natural products as antifoulants (Raveendran and Mol 2009). It is well known that marine organisms (macro- and microorganisms) have been shown to be rich sources of bioactive secondary metabolites. Many of marine macroorganisms are able to stay free from biofouling and their secondary metabolites are believed to be chemical defensive substances. These natural compounds are easily biodegradable and leave no residue in the environment, thus have been considered as a potential resource for environmentally friendly natural <b>antifouling</b> <b>agents</b> (Culioli et al. 2008; Gao et al. 2014). In recent years, marine microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria, have also been explored for <b>antifouling</b> <b>agents,</b> because they could supply large amount of natural products (Fusetani 2011; Newman and Cragg 2004). The marine natural products with antifouling activity identified so far cover variety of structural types, including phenolics, terpenoids, steroids, furanones, alkaloids, peptides, lactones and fatty acids (Qian et al. 2010; Fusetani 2011; Raveendran and Mol 2009).|$|R

5000|$|Most {{antifouling}} coatings {{are based}} upon chemical compounds that inhibit fouling. When incorporated into marine coatings, these biocides leech into the immediate surroundings and minimize fouling. The classic synthetic <b>antifouling</b> <b>agent</b> is TBT. Natural biocides typically show lower environmental impact but variable effectiveness. Natural biocides are found {{in a variety of}} sources, including (sponges, algae, corals, sea urchins, bacteria, and sea-squirts), and include toxins, anaesthetics, and growth/attachment/metamorphosis-inhibiting molecules. [...] As a group, marine microalgae alone produce over 3600 secondary metabolites that play complex ecological roles including defense from predators, as well as antifouling protection, increasing scientific interest in the screening of marine natural products as natural biocides. Natural biocides are typically divided into two categories: terpenes (often containing unsaturated ligand groups and electronegative oxygen functional groups) and nonterpenes.|$|E

To avoid this common complication of implant surgery, it is preferable to use new biomaterials with antibacterial properties. Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop a method of combining the antibacterial properties of antibiotic-loaded poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) nano-and micro-spheres and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as an <b>antifouling</b> <b>agent,</b> with titanium (Ti), as the base material for implants, in order to obtain surfaces with antibacterial activity. The Ti surfaces were linked to both PHB particles and PEG by a covalent bond. This attachment was carried out by firstly activating the surfaces with either Oxygen plasma or Sodium hydroxide.

30|$|Discussion The {{leaching}} of the biocides, {{their potential}} ecotoxic effects and persistence show {{clearly that the}} environmental risk for surface waters and soils seems to be high for certain biocides; whereas for others the risk seems to be significantly lower. With respect water quality criteria, polluted facades runoff has to be diluted before runoff can enter the discharge. Diuron and carbendazim are however also used as pesticides and preservatives for other materials and cybutryn is also used as an <b>antifouling</b> <b>agent.</b> All pathways have to be evaluated {{in order to identify}} relevant sources and to act more efficiently with respect to water and soil protection.|$|E
40|$|Seaweeds are {{potential}} sources of high biotechnological interest due to production of a great diversity of compounds exhibiting {{a broad spectrum of}} biological activities. On the other hand, there is an urgent need for management options for a sustainable approach to the use of marine organisms as a source of bioactive compounds. This review discusses the bioprospection for bioactive seaweed compounds as pharmaceuticals and <b>antifouling</b> <b>agents,</b> encompassing their potential and possible obstacles and alternatives. In spite of their potential, research on pharmaceuticals and <b>antifouling</b> <b>agents</b> from seaweeds includes mainly the search for molecules that exhibit these biological activities, but lacks of consideration of fundamental and limiting aspects such as the development of alternatives to sustainable supply. However, for the complete development of pharmaceuticals and antifouling compounds in Brazil, marine bioprospection should be more comprehensive, associating the search for molecules with an analysis of their supply. In this way, it is possible to promote sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity, as well as to assert the economic development of Brazil...|$|R

ZnO occurs naturally as the mineral zincite and is available commercially as either micron or submicron-sized milled powders or as pyrolyzed nano-sphere dispersions.

40|$|Adhesion of {{microorganisms}} to surfaces in marine environments leads to biofouling. The deleterious effects of biofilm {{growth in the}} marine environment are numerous and include energy losses due to increased fluid frictional resistance or to increased heat transfer resistance, the risk of corrosion induced by microorganisms, loss of optical properties, and quality control and safety problems. <b>Antifouling</b> <b>agents</b> are generally used to protect surfaces from such a biofilm. These agents are toxic and can be persistent, causing harmful environmental and ecological effects. Moreover, the use of biocides and regular cleaning considerably increase the maintenance costs of marine industries.
