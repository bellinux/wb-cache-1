5|$|In 1915 Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie, who {{had served}} as Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, was close to retirement. The current Lord Chancellor Lord Haldane {{believed}} that the duties of a Lord Chancellor were too much for one man, and should be divided between a Lord Chancellor and a Minister of Justice. As such he looked for a Permanent Secretary who was a qualified lawyer <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> help him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war, appointing Schuster in early 1915. The two did not work together, however, until Haldane became Lord Chancellor {{for a second time}} in 1924; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Cumberland Presbytery, also {{within the}} Kentucky Synod, faced a {{shortage}} of ministers and decided to license clergy candidates who were less educated than was typical <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not subscribe completely to the Westminster Confession. In 1805, the synod suspended many of these ministers, even bringing heresy charges against a number of them, and by 1806 the synod had dissolved the presbytery. In 1810, ministers dissatisfied with {{the actions of the}} synod formed the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (CPC). The CPC subscribed to a modified form of the Westminster Confession that rejected the Calvinist doctrines of double predestination and limited atonement.|$|E
5|$|Mother 3 is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console in 2006. The {{music for the}} game was composed exclusively by Shogo Sakai, who he had previously composed music for games such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and Kirby Air Ride. Series developer Shigesato Itoi stated that Sakai was given the position because he understood Mother 3 the most, given {{that he could not}} use Keiichi Suzuki or Hirokazu Tanaka, the composers for the first two games, as they were both busy with other projects. Itoi also said that given the massive amount of songs in the game, over 250, he needed someone who {{had a lot of time}} to dedicate to the project <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> focus exclusively on it.|$|E

5|$|The {{network was}} also used heavily by {{government}} officials and rescue personnel, who used PDAs or laptops to {{log on to the}} network. It was used by rescue workers who were floating {{in the middle of the}} river <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> receive the signal to communicate with the headquarters in charge of the rescue operations. The wireless service was integral in sending large GIS files to the scene for rescuers to use in locating survivors. It was also utilized by the Minnesota Department of Transportation, the American Red Cross, and media outlets, both local and national. Retroactively, various Minneapolis officials deemed the presence of the network essential to the success of the response to the collapse.|$|E
5|$|Sharon Elizabeth Hall {{was born}} on November 30, 1939, in Independence, Missouri. When she was in junior high, Doris and Eugene Hall moved the family to Washington, {{but by the time}} Sharon was fifteen they had {{returned}} to Missouri, where Sharon attended William Chrisman High School. Sixteen-year-old Sharon met twenty-two-year-old college student James Kinne at a church function in the summer of 1956, and the couple dated regularly until Kinne returned to Brigham Young University in the fall. Sharon, reportedly deeply interested in finding a partner with prospects <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> take her away from Independence, soon wrote a letter to Kinne at school informing him that she was pregnant by him. Kinne took leave from his college and returned to Independence, where he married Sharon on October 18, 1956. The couple's marriage license identified sixteen-year-old Sharon as being eighteen and a widow; though she later refused to address the assertion, Sharon told people at the time that she had been married when she lived in Washington, to a man who later died in a car accident. The new couple held a second, more formal wedding the next year in the Salt Lake Temple, after Sharon had completed the process of converting to Mormonism.|$|E
25|$|Early in the Geonic era, the {{majority}} of the questions asked them were sent from Babylonia and the neighboring lands. Jewish communities in these regions had religious leaders who were somewhat acquainted with the Talmud, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> on occasion visit the Jewish academies in Babylon. A literature of questions and answers developed, known as the responsa literature.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} days of Islam, fatwās were {{pronounced}} by distinguished scholars to provide guidance to other scholars, judges and citizens on how subtle points of Islamic law should be understood, interpreted or applied.

Within sixteen months of his arrival in Iowa, however, Taylor abandoned the Iowa Republican Party for an independent course that emphasized racial solidarity rather than party membership.|$|E

Thus the city, encouraged by its immense wealth and almost impregnable fortifications, {{as well as by the}} secret support of Denmark and Emperor Maximilian himself, had supported the latter's election.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{military}} endeavours, Charles {{is considered to be}} a founding figure of the European Middle Ages.

Pope Gregory III, whose realm was being menaced by the Lombards, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> no longer rely on help from Constantinople, asked Charles to defend the Holy See and offered him the Roman consulship, though Charles declined.|$|E

25|$|The medical treatises of Charaka and Sushruta mention {{wildlife}} {{from the}} point of view of the meats the forests yielded and their associated attributes. The stratification of Hindu society into the caste system saw the warrior caste or kshatriya setting itself apart on hereditary lines; one assertion of which was the right to eat certain animals. The treatises espoused rules as to when, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> or could not eat flesh of particular animals; for example, the flesh of the lion and tiger were to be consumed solely by regents and that too on rare occasions.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{law of the}} Urapmin {{was characterized}} by many rules about religious behavior and an elaborate taboo system, focused especially on eating and land use, as well as regulating what could be touched <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> know what information. According to Urapmin tradition, Afek gave ownership of the wild (sep) to the motobil (nature spirits), who themselves gave ownership of the villages (abiip) to humans. Natural resources, including streams, large trees, hunting ground, and game {{were believed to be}} owned by the motobil, and humans could only use what they were given permission to respectfully.|$|E
25|$|The early 1970s saw the {{emergence}} of a new crop of West Indian cricketers, ones eager to shake the tag of Calypso, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> dominate world cricket. However, it is said that when you have 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don't have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the cricket field. That man was Clive Lloyd. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd's first major challenge came in the 1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia.|$|E

25|$|The island, which {{depended}} on an agricultural economy, had an illiteracy rate of over 80% {{at the beginning}} of the 19th century. Most women were home educated.

The only women who had access to the libraries <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> afford books were the wives and daughters of Spanish government officials or wealthy land owners. Those who were poor had to resort to oral story-telling in what are traditionally known in Puerto Rico as Coplas and Decimas.|$|E

Apart from the nearly 600 nursing sisters who were awarded the King's South Africa Medal without a clasp, the medal was always awarded {{with at least}} one clasp and in most cases with both. With the {{exception}} of, for example, nurses who were all awarded the medal without a clasp, or wounded men who returned to action in 1902 after having been out of action for the whole of 1901 <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> therefore possibly receive the medal with only the 1902 clasp, the rest of the recipients were awarded the medal with both clasps.|$|E
25|$|In {{his efforts}} to fashion general history into a {{specific}} fictional story, Shakespeare may have consulted the Gesta Romanorum, a well known thirteenth-century collection of tales, legends, myths, and anecdotes written in Latin, which took figures and events from history and spun fictional tales around them. In Shakespeare's lifetime, a writer known for doing likewise was Matteo Bandello, who based his work on that of writers such as Giovanni Boccaccio and Geoffrey Chaucer, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> have served as an indirect source for Shakespeare. So, too, could the first major English author to write in this style, William Painter, who borrowed from, amongst others, Herodotus, Plutarch, Aulus Gellius, Claudius Aelianus, Livy, Tacitus, Giovanni Battista Giraldi, and Bandello himself.|$|E
