500|$|Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, {{wrote in}} her {{autobiography}} My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that the episode's script gives the audience a [...] "visual and aural feast". She said the background designers [...] "must have gone on another field trip for this one" [...] because they captured {{the look of a}} typical musical recording studio. The recording studio in the episode, where Lurleen records her new songs with the Simpson family, features two rooms, one for the artist and one for the engineer, with a pane of glass between them. Cartwright said the designers added their own [...] "special touch" [...] by putting a few cracks on the walls, designing a slightly dilapidated ceiling, and by making it look as if the soundproofing on the walls is falling off. The property designers went on <b>a</b> <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Sun Studio to receive inspiration for the props in the recording studio, such as the [...] "in session" [...] red light, the mixing board, the musical instruments, and the volume-unit meters that indicates how loud the artist is singing. For the interior design of the recording studio, the color designers mixed colors such as orange, mauve, gray, and brown to make them complement each other. The colors in the engineer's booth were darker to make Homer's white suit stand out from the background. The appearance of the engineer at the recording studio was based on John Boylan, an American music producer who produced the highly successful album The Simpsons Sing the Blues. Lurleen's mobile home was designed to be [...] "very confined" [...] and [...] "tiny" [...] so that the compositions of Homer and Lurleen would be tighter, thus giving the scene an intimate, romantic feeling.|$|E
