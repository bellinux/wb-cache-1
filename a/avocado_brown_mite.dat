40|$|Mites are {{microscopic}} arthropods {{that are}} {{classified in the}} order Acarina. They are not insects but are related to ticks and spiders. There are over 40, 000 described species of mites in the world. Some of them live freely in soil or water; some are found on plants and some are associated with other animals. Due to their small size {{most of them are}} difficult to see with the naked eye. Mites that are plant pests include spider mites (family Tetranychidae), false spider mites (family Tenuipalpidae), tarsonemid mites (family Tarsonemidae) and the rust or gall mites (family Eriophyidae). These mites cause damage by piercing plant cells and sucking out their contents. In heavy infestations mites may even kill the host plant. Spider mites are given their name as they often spin characteristic protective silk webs. This family has more than 1000 species, which include some species of quarantine importance, and many species that may cause heavy losses to major food crops and ornamental plants. These include the infamous two-spotted mites Tetranychus urticae, and other major economic spider mite pests, which have been recorded in the Northern Territory e. g. oriental red mite, Eutetranychus orientalis- primarily a pest of citrus; vegetable spider mite, Tetranychus neocaledonicus; and <b>avocado</b> <b>brown</b> <b>mite,</b> Oligonychus punicae.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper Fleschner et al. (1956) review the {{literature}} on dispersal of tetranychid mites by air currents and present the results of original research on these four species: Metatetranychns citri (McGregor), the citrus red mite; Oligonychuspunicae (Hirst), the <b>avocado</b> <b>brown</b> mite; Eotetranychussexmaculatus (Riley), the six-spotted mite; and Tetranychus telarius (L.), the two-spotted spider mite. These authors found that the first three species listed above behaved similarly in regard to dissemination by air currents. As mite populations on infested trees reached high levels or peaks, large numbers of adult females were observed to spin down from leaves and hang freely suspended in air, each by a single silken filament. The mites were then disengaged from the trees and dispersed by gentle to moderate breezes, often to heights {{much greater than the}} trees, with the silken filaments presumably acting much like parachutes and imparting considerable lift to the mites.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the trends and {{regional}} patterns of organophosphate (OP) use in California almond orchards from 1992 to 2000, and to identify factors that may have influenced those trends, including weather, pest pressure, and use of alternative practices to control pests. Background Growers use OP pesticides to control arthropod pests in almonds. An OP may be applied to dormant orchards during the winter (called a dormant OP spray). These dormant OPs are usually applied with a narrow-range oil, which is added to improve the effectiveness of the OP and because the oil itself kills some arthropods by suffocating them. Dormant OPs with oils are used primarily to control peach twig borer (PTB), San Jose scale (SJS), European red <b>mite,</b> and <b>brown</b> <b>mite.</b> Dormant sprays have traditionally been considered the most effective way to control all these pests. Applications during the winter are considered less disruptive to non-target organisms, such as natural enemies, than applications during the spring and summer since most organisms are less active during the winter. Thus, in the past a dormant OP spray was routinely applied. However, recen...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of phytoseiid populations was made of two well- cultivated and regularly sprayed apple orchards with two unsprayed orchards in Cache Valley, northern Utah. Two phytoseiid species, Typhlodromus mcgregori Chant and T. occidentalis Nesbitt were observed on the apple leaves, under the bark, and occasionally in the litter and soil. Amblyseius cucumeris (Oudemans) occurred in the soil and litter and occasionally under bark. T. mcgregori was dominant in the unsprayed orchards, and T. occidentalis in the sprayed. Of the phytophagous mites, which served as food for the phytoseiids, the two-spotted mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch was dominant. Other phytophagous <b>mites</b> were the <b>brown</b> <b>mite,</b> Bryobia rubrioculus (Scheuten), the European red mite, Panonychus ulmi (Koch), and the McDaniel mite, Tetranychus mcdanieli McGregor. The study suggests T. mcgregori to be a non-specific, facultative predator of phytophagous mites. T. mcgregori was adversely affected by standard pesticide practices, but T. occiden talis survived in larger numbers. The phytoseiids seem well adjusted to {{the environment of the}} unsprayed orchards and to contribute to the low phytophagous mite populations in those orchards. In the sprayed orchards, the phytoseiids failed to control the high populations of phytophagous mites which developed. No statistical differences were found in the efficiencies of the mite brushing machine and Berlese funnels in removing either phytoseiid or phytophagous mites from apple leaves...|$|R

40|$|Ambrosia beetles {{share one}} special feature with humans, {{the ability to}} farm. These weevil-sized beetles colonize wood but rather than {{consuming}} this rather nutrient-poor material, they inoculate the tree with {{a particular type of}} fungus, which then becomes the food for the beetle larvae. Many tree species have evolved specialized chemical defences against this type of insect infestation and normally the fungal symbiont is only weakly pathogenic. However, there are some notable exceptions to this rule where perfectly healthy trees have succumbed to ambrosia beetle infestation and their fungal symbionts have acted as aggressive pathogens. One classic example occurs in the south-eastern states of the USA, where cultivated avocado and its wild relatives are afflicted by a lethal disease called laurel wilt. The culprit is the beetle Xyleborus glabratus, which transmits the fungus Raffaelea lauricola. X. glabratus is native to Asia and entered the USA as a stowaway in wooden crates. X. glabratus {{is considered one of the}} most serious biosecurity threats to the Australian avocado industry. In a pre-emptive move to prevent X. glabratus entering Australia, scientists from Brisbane have visited their counterparts in the USA to learn about laurel wilt disease. As a result of this collaboration, a diagnostic manual for laurel wilt has been produced, which will become the national standard for Australia. During preparation of this manual, new molecular diagnostic assays for both X. glabratus and R. lauricola were developed. Armed with these new assays, ambrosia beetle surveys were done in subtropical and tropical avocado production areas of the east coast of Australia and thankfully no X. glabratus found, confirming Australia’s pest-free status. However, there is no room for complacency, as two more ambrosia beetle species were discovered (Euwallacea sp. aff. fornicatus and Microperus sp.) were found on the Sunshine Coast and Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. Infestations of these beetles were associated with avocado canopy thinning and most likely yield loss. The fungal symbionts of these ambrosia beetles were isolated and shown to be new species in the genera Fusarium and Bionectria. When pure cultures of these fungi were injected into the stems of young <b>avocado</b> plants, large <b>brown</b> lesions were produced in the sapwood, confirming that these fungi were causing disease...|$|R
40|$|Fighting mite with mite Cue: Cassava {{is a vital}} {{food crop}} for more than 200 million people in Africa. Its starchy roots provide food {{security}} in areas of low rainfall, and its leaves are also a nutritious vegetable. But cassava crops across the continent are threatened by a tiny, but deadly enemy - the cassava green mite. This insect pest came to Africa from South America in the early 1970 s, and was first detected near Kampala in Uganda. Over the next 20 years it spread across Africa?s cassava growing belt, causing huge losses in yield of up to 80 per cent in some areas. Attacking the pest by using chemical sprays is difficult, not least because the mites live {{on the underside of}} cassava leaves. But in Uganda, and other countries, cassava farmers are increasingly using a different approach to pest control, as Wambi Michael discovered when he met with Stella Adumo, Senior Technician at Uganda?s National Agricultural Research Organisation laboratories in Kawanda. Wambi began by asking Stella to describe the damage caused by the mite. IN:	?It is a very serious pest in almost ? OUT:	? and the yield improves drastically. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 44 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Stella Adumo, Senior Technician at the NARO laboratories in Kawanda, Uganda. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Adumo	It is a very serious pest in almost all cassava growing areas. It is a dry weather pest, and it attacks almost every variety of cassava. And it is a pest which attacks the tip of the plant. When it attacks the tip of the cassava plant it causes chlorosis of that plant, that is, the plant loses colour and becomes yellowish. In severe cases you will find that there will be drying of the leaves and defoliation. The effect of this pest goes down even to the root system. The tubers get drastically reduced, and in cases where tubers have already been manufactured, you realise even rotting of the tubers. Michael	So how can the pest be identified? Adumo	This pest is found under the leaves of the cassava plant, and in most cases it is at the growing shoot. When you turn the leaf upside down, you find that they are under the leaves of the cassava plant, and they are very tiny in size and greenish in colour. Michael	So what biological control methods have been adopted in Uganda to control the cassava green mite? Adumo	Biological control is using natural enemies to control pests and weeds, and for this case, it uses a predatory mite that is called Typhlodromalus aripo. It is a mite that feeds on the cassava green mite. It sucks out all the fluid and renders the pest dead. Michael	How can the beneficial insects be identified? Adumo	The beneficial insect, as I said, is also a mite, but it is a predatory mite. The pest is greenish in colour. The natural enemy is brownish in colour and slightly bigger than the pest, and a farmer can only identify it when he checks at the tip of a cassava plant. These natural enemies live at the tip of a cassava plant, and when the farmer opens the tip of a cassava plant they will be very shifty, running up and down, they are very fast, because they have a good searching ability. Michael	How can farmers encourage beneficial insects to control this problem? Adumo	These natural enemies have already been released in the field and they are multiplying out in the field. Now a farmer has to have proper management practices in the field in order to promote the development of this natural enemy. They should avoid unnecessary burning, because in most cases the unnecessary burning destroys the natural enemies that are already out in the field. Now if a farmer has that problem of green mite, try the next field, check the tip of the plant, check for that <b>brown</b> <b>mite.</b> If they find it there, break the tip, move to the affected area where {{there is a lot of}} pest and just place that tip on top of the affected plant. The natural enemy will automatically crawl from this tip to the plant which is affected and will work on the cassava pest which is there, and destroy it. Michael	So the beneficial insect; isn?t it in any way dangerous to the environment? Adumo	Uganda is not the first place where we have released this natural enemy. It has been tried in other countries, and the fact is that it does not affect any other insect, any other plant except its host, and that is the green mite. It is host specific, it cannot attack any other but it only attacks the cassava green mite. Michael	So this beneficial insect, what impact has it had on the cassava production in the country? Adumo	In many areas they had realised low yields of cassava. But when the natural enemy reached in some of those areas the yields of cassava were raised, and also the planting material was improved. Another thing we realised is, this insect is cost effective. When you release it in the field it multiplies on its own, so the farmer does not have the bother of again going back and releasing in the same place. So a farmer just benefits as the insect multiplies and destroys the pest. Michael	So there is no cost related to spraying the cassava? Adumo	There is not cost at all, because this is a natural, a living thing. When it multiplies it moves under ? remember one thing. Cassava has a very heavy canopy, so when you think about spraying it is even difficult to spray under the leaves where the insect is. Now with this natural enemy, it goes searching all over the area, under the leaves and it attacks the pest which is damaging the crop, and you find automatically that the crop improves and the yield improves drastically.

40|$|Introduction: Ornithonyssus bacoti, {{known as}} {{tropical}} rat mite, is a blood-feeding ectoparasitic arthropod {{belonging to the}} family Macronyssidae. At night the parasites search for their hosts and seek dark hiding places during the daytime. O. bacoti primarily infests rodents, {{but it has been}} reported also in other small mammals and in humans if suitable preferential hosts are unavailable {{or in the case of}} close contact with infected animals and environments (Beck W, 2008, Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease, 6 : 245 – 249). In humans the mite is responsible for dermatologic lesions known as rat mite dermatitis. This study reports O. bacoti infestation in pet Campbell's dwarf hamsters and in the owners. Materials and Methods: In the month of December 2012 a Campbell's dwarf hamster with dermatological problems was presented. The subject, a female about 1 year old, was housed in a hamster cage with two other females of the same age. All subjects had been purchased from the same pet shop, at different times between October and December of 2012. After about two weeks from the introduction of the third hamster, the owners noticed a gradual increase in itching in one of the two hamster previously owned. At the same time, one of the six members of the family, a child of 11 years showed dermatologic symptoms including pruritus, papules and scabs on the trunk, arms and legs. The affected child lived in a room where the hamster cage was housed. After two further weeks, two other members of the family showed the same clinical signs. For mite collection, on the infested pet the Scotch test was performed, while the cage was inspected and mites collected with a needle. Isolated mites were preserved in 80 % ethanol, mounted by using Hoyer's medium application according to conventional techniques, and microscopically observed for species identification. Results: At the scotch test, the hamster was positive for mites. From the bottom of the cage, a large number of mites were collected. Mites were highly variable in size and in color, from reddish to dark <b>brown.</b> All isolated <b>mites</b> were adult females ranging from 937 to 1339 µm in length X 453. 2 - 957. 9 µm in width (mean 1033. 8 µm X 556. 2 µm). On the basis of morophology and chaetotaxy, isolated mites were identified with the species O. bacoti. Conclusion: Hamsters were treated with an acaricide, cage were thoroughly cleaned and decontaminated with an acaricide containing permethrin. The house was also disinfected and a professional exterminator was recommended...|$|R
