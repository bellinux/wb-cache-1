5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> able to join the eternal.|$|E

500|$|Fulcher {{explains}} {{that there is}} a final scene. The actors ready, and the scene begins: Kathy is on a bed, and pours Champagne. She is joined by Simon, still half-costumed, who chains her to the bed. Simon claims to be Krampus, and the scene ends with Kathy screaming as [...] "Krampus" [...] cackles. The actor playing [...] "Krampus" [...] leaves. The cameras keep rolling as plastic is put under [...] "Kathy" [...] for a scene she did not know about. A new actor is dressed as the Krampus, and Kathy is roughly gagged. The new Krampus advances, armed with a machete; the older Dennis {{explains that}} [...] "Kathy" [...] understands, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> witnessing genuine fear. The tape cuts just as the machete is about to fall. Dennis says that he is surprised the tape has surfaced again, but that it was [...] "one of the better ones"; The Devil of Christmas, unbeknownst to [...] "Kathy", was a snuff film. Dennis's interviewer terminates the police interrogation.|$|E

2500|$|After Hamas leader Khaled Mashal paid an {{official}} visit to Turkey, relations began to cool off. In January 2010, Israel protested when an episode ("Ambush") of the Turkish soap opera Valley of the Wolves depicted Israeli intelligence spying inside Turkey and kidnapping Turkish babies. The series depicted a fictional Mossad {{attack on the}} Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv in which the ambassador {{and his family are}} taken hostage. On 11 January 2010, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon met with Turkish ambassador Ahmet Oğuz Çelikkol, who was seated on a stool that was lower than Ayalon's. Ayalon allegedly turned to his aide and quipped, [...] "The main thing is that you see that he is seated low <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> high ... that there is one flag on the table (the Israeli flag) <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not smiling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ilyusha, Ilyushechka, {{or simply}} Ilusha in some translations, {{is one of}} the local schoolboys, and the central figure of a crucial subplot in the novel. His father, Captain Snegiryov, is an impoverished officer who is insulted by Dmitri after Fyodor Karamazov hires him to {{threaten}} the latter over his debts, and the Snegiryov family is brought to shame as a result. The reader is led to believe that it is partly because of this that Ilyusha falls ill, possibly to illustrate the theme that even minor actions can touch heavily on the lives of others, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> [...] "all responsible for one another".|$|E
2500|$|Voris {{has also}} {{rejected}} LGBT claims that homosexuals are [...] "born that way," [...] stating instead that the Church teaches {{there is only}} one rightly ordered sexuality — heterosexuality — <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all born heterosexual, but circumstances happen to alter and distort that rightly ordered sexuality. [...] "No one wants to admit that their entire self-perception around which they have built and fashioned their lives, thoughts, opinions, worldview, etc. has been a big lie," [...] he said in [...]" [...] He continued, [...] "But that doesn't alter the objective fact that it is a lie. Conceiving of oneself in terms of being a homosexual isn't the only damage that can emerge from a pained childhood. Pain and its avoidance can manifest in all kinds of ways, not just this one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sanders rarely {{speaks about}} religion. He {{describes}} himself as [...] "not particularly religious" [...] and [...] "not actively involved" [...] with organized religion. A press package issued by his office states [...] "Religion: Jewish". He has said he believes in God, though not necessarily in a traditional manner: [...] "I think everyone believes in God in their own ways," [...] he said. [...] "To me, it means {{that all of us}} are connected, all of life is connected, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all tied together." [...] In October 2015, on the late-night talk show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel asked Bernie, [...] "You say you are culturally Jewish and you don't feel religious; do you believe in God and do you think that's important {{to the people of the}} United States?"

30|$|In view {{of these}} dense forest stands {{adjacent}} to savannah land, the natural assumption {{would be that}} the forest “climax” type, favored by climate, was slowly encroaching on the grassland, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> witnessing an ecological transition. This explanation is, however, inaccurate. The African continent is an old insular shelf that came into existence in primeval times. The forest has had ample time to occupy all areas having favorable environmental conditions. One has only to realize the speed with which it is capable, even today, of invading recent alluvial deposits to agree that this is so.|$|R

The most seductive charm and figure, joined with a sharp mind, a high character, a precocious intelligence and great memory; she like much by her softness and by the grace and distinction of her person. Her mother {{put her in a}} convent, and soon she became in the idol of the community: students and mistresses were delighted with her cheerfulness, her talents, her projections; the upper cited as a marvel <b>that</b> everyone spoiled <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> delighted.|$|R
2500|$|Scientists {{who agree}} with the {{consensus}} view have sometimes expressed concerns over what they view as sensationalism of global warming by interest groups and the press. For example, Mike Hulme, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research, wrote how increasing use of pejorative terms like [...] "catastrophic", [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "irreversible", had altered the public discourse around climate change: [...] "This discourse is now characterised by phrases such as 'climate change is worse than we thought', that we are approaching 'irreversible tipping in the Earth's climate', <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> 'at {{the point of no}} return'. I have found myself increasingly chastised by climate change campaigners when my public statements and lectures on climate change have not satisfied their thirst for environmental drama and exaggerated rhetoric." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{characters}} that Madonna developed for the film was a Russian immigrant living in Brooklyn and working in Manhattan, called Evgeni. The character was inspired by Eugene Hütz, who played the lead role in Filth and Wisdom. Another motivation behind the project was the celebrity aspect of Edward and Simpson, who {{became the subject of}} intense media scrutiny and public vilification and were ostracised by the Royal Family. Madonna, being interested in the cult of celebrity, found that many of the rumors surrounding Simpson's life are untrue and she could not find any empirical evidence supporting them. Hence she wanted to portray Simpson as a human being with flaws, imperfections and a vulnerable side. [...] "The message of the film is to realise that in the end happiness lies in your own head <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in fact in charge of our destiny," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} John Stalker, Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester {{in the early}} 1980s and himself a Detective Inspector in 1973, has stated that the depiction of the police [...] "has {{got nothing to do}} with real policing in the 1970s. It could not be more inaccurate in terms of procedure, the way they talk or the way they dress. In all the time I was in the CID in the 1970s I never saw a copper in a leather bomber jacket and I never heard an officer call anyone 'guv'.... Actually, there were a few police officers in London who started to behave like Regan and Carter in The Sweeney, but that was a case of life following art, not the other way round". The journalist who interviewed Stalker, Ray King, remarks that the depiction of the police can be defended if we assume that Sam is indeed in a coma <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> seeing his imaginary idea of 1973, filtered through 1970s cop shows.|$|E
