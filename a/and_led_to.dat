He left his post as superintendent after six years to become a professor at Danville Theological Seminary in Danville, Kentucky.|$|E

Four people were killed in the disaster and seventeen were injured, as an entire corner of the building slid away.

5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change. Temperatures have increased {{in the last century}} while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. These changes have impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme weather events, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E
5|$|Benbow's {{fame and}} success earned him both public notoriety and a {{promotion}} to admiral. He was then {{involved in an}} incident during the Action of August 1702, where {{a number of his}} captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships.

5|$|Between World WarI and World WarII Australia {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the Great Depression {{which started in}} 1929. This limited Australian defence expenditure <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{a decline in the}} size and effectiveness of the armed forces during the 1930s. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British policy towards Nazi Germany, supporting first the appeasement of Hitler and the British guarantee of Polish independence.|$|E
5|$|Busch drew on {{contemporary}} parochial and city life, satirizing Catholicism, Philistinism, strict religious morality and bigotry.

5|$|Each of {{the three}} climactic eruptions {{released}} vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America, falling many hundreds of miles away.

5|$|Emergency {{medicine}} is a specialty that was first {{developed in the}} United States in the 1960s. For the United States, {{the high number of}} traffic and other accident fatalities in the 1960s spurred a white paper from the National Academy of Sciences; it exposed the inadequacy of the current emergency medical system <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the establishment of modern emergency medical services. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore followed shortly thereafter, developing their respective emergency medicine systems in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Gale-force winds {{covered the}} far {{northern}} Atlantic between Western Europe and Atlantic Canada, {{due to the}} intensity of this storm, with hurricane-force winds confined near its center of circulation. After reaching its peak intensity, the system weakened as it moved into the far northeast Atlantic, dissipating by 17 January. This storm caused blizzards across much of Scotland <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the final breakup of the oil tanker MV Braer, which had been stranded in rocks off the Shetland Islands by a previous storm nearly a week beforehand.|$|E

When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the Burnet Lecture and Medal, which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.|$|E
