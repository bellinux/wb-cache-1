40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{use of an}} {{intramedullary}} <b>alignment</b> <b>rod</b> in {{the distal}} part of the femur {{is an important step}} in performing total knee-replacement arthroplasty. On the basis of our observation of a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation in some patients after insertion of the rod, a prospective study was done of the circulatory and blood-gas changes that were associated with insertion in thirty-five patients. We examined the effects of the use of an eight-millimeter solid <b>alignment</b> <b>rod,</b> with and without venting; an eight-millimeter fluted <b>alignment</b> <b>rod,</b> with venting; and an eight-millimeter fluted or solid <b>alignment</b> <b>rod,</b> inserted through a 12. 7 -millimeter drill-hole, but without other venting.

30|$|Limb {{alignment}} is evaluated fluoroscopically using a long rigid <b>alignment</b> <b>rod</b> {{between the}} centre of the femoral head and {{the centre of}} the ankle. The rod, representing the weight-bearing line, should pass through the knee joint at the preoperatively defined position for the mechanical axis. If adequate correction has been achieved, the osteotomy is stabilized with either a TomoFix (Depuy/Synthes) Lateral Distal Femur plate (LDF) (ipsilateral version) or with a TomoFix Medial Distal Femur Plate (MDF) (contralateral version). The decision is based on personal choice of the surgeon. However, the MDF plate is less pronounced after insertion and therefore more suitable in shorter and smaller femurs.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to a high spatial resolution and well characterised dose response, {{one of the major}} advantages of radiochromic film as a dosimeter is that sheets of film can be cut into pieces suitable for use as calibration films, and for in vivo and phantom measurements. The cutting of film is typically done using scissors or a guillotine, and this process can be time-consuming, limited in precision, requires extensive handling and does not allow holes to be cut from the film without cutting from an existing edge. This study investigated the use of a Brother ScanNCut hobby cutting system for EBT 3 film preparation. The optimal operating parameters (blade size, pressure, speed) that resulted in precise cuts with minimal delamination at cut edges were identified using test cutting patterns. These parameters were then used to cut a large film insert for a stereotactic head phantom for comparison against an insert cut with scissors. While the hobby cutting system caused a wider region of delamination at the film edge (1. 8 mm) compared to scissors (1 mm), the hobby cutting system was found to be able to produce reproducible cuts more efficiently and more accurately than scissors. The use of the hobby cutting system is recommended for complex phantom inserts (containing sharp corners or holes for <b>alignment</b> <b>rods)</b> or in situations where large numbers of film pieces need to be prepared...|$|R
40|$|Most {{orthopedic}} surgeons use conventional {{instruments to}} achieve accurate bone cuts in total knee arthroplasty. An intramedullary <b>alignment</b> <b>rod</b> is usually used {{to place the}} cutting jig at a valgus correction angle so that the distal femoral cut is made perpendicular to the mechanical axis of the femur. Over the tibial side, many surgeons use an extramedullary alignment guide to place the cutting jig perpendicular to the tibial mechanical axis; some surgeons prefer to use an intramedullary guide. The criticism is that outliers are not uncommon with conventional instruments, even in experienced hands. If the mechanical lower limb alignment within 3 ° valgus and 3 ° varus from neutral was considered as normal, 20 – 33 % of total knee arthroplasty would be outside of this range with conventional instruments [1 – 4]. Factors such as the bowing of the femur and tibia could affect {{the accuracy of the}} bone cuts in both the coronal and sagittal planes [5, 6]...|$|E
40|$|Inserting the femoral {{intramedullary}} <b>alignment</b> <b>rod</b> during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) {{can generate}} high intramedullary pressure, {{which increases the}} risk of intraoperative complications caused by fat embolism. Despite modifications to the surgical procedure, the best method to prevent this increase in pressure remains unknown. The reamer/irrigator/aspirator is a surgical instrument designed for use during femoral canal entry to increase the canal size and remove intramedullary fat and may prevent this pressure increase. We posed two hypotheses: (1) using the reamer/irrigator/aspirator system will result in lower maximum femoral intramedullary pressure than using only conventional instrumentation during the initial steps of a TKA; and (2) using the reamer/irrigator/aspirator system in the initial steps of TKA will result in a mean maximum intramedullary pressure less than 200  mm Hg. We simulated a TKA on 14 cadaveric femurs to compare the femoral intramedullary pressure using both methods. Considerable decreases in femoral intramedullary pressure of 86 % proximally and 87 % distally were obtained by using the reamer/irrigator/aspirator system. The mean maximum pressure using the reamer/irrigator/aspirator system was less than 200  mm Hg. Additional clinical studies are needed to confirm any reduction in complications using the reamer/irrigator/aspirator system...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{tweezers}} {{have been}} an important tool in biology and physics for studying single molecules and colloidal systems. Most of current optical tweezers are built with microscope objectives, which are: i) expensive, ii) bulky and hard to integrate, iii) sensitive to environmental fluctuations, iv) limited in terms of working distances from the substrate, and v) rigid with the requirements on the substrate (transparent substrate made with glass and with a fixed thickness). These limitations of objective-based optical tweezers prevent them from being miniaturized. Fiber optical tweezers can provide a solution for cost reduction and miniaturization, and these optical tweezers can be potentially used in microfluidic systems. However, the existing fiber optical tweezers have the following limitations: i) low trapping efficiency due to weakly focused beams, ii) lack {{of the ability to}} control the positions of multiple particles simultaneously, and iii) limited functionalities. The overall objective of this dissertation work is to further the fundamental understanding of fiber optical tweezers through experimental study and modeling, and to develop novel fiber optical tweezers systems to enhance the capability and functionalities of fiber optical tweezers as microscale and nanoscale manipulators/sensors. The contributions of this dissertation work are summarized as follows: i) An enhanced understanding of the inclined dual-fiber optical tweezers (DFOTs) system has been achieved. Stable three dimensional (3 D) optical trapping of a single micron-sized particle has been experimentally demonstrated. This {{is the first time that}} the trapping efficiency has been calibrated and the stiffness of the trap has been obtained in the experiments, which has been carried out by using two methods: the drag force method and power spectrum analysis. Such calibration enables the system to be used as a picoNewton-level force sensor in addition to a particle manipulator. The influence of system parameters on the trapping performance has been carefully investigated through both experimental and numerical studies. ii) Multiple traps have been created and carefully studied with the inclined DFOTs for the first time. Three traps, one 3 D trap and two 2 D traps, have been experimentally created at different vertical levels with adjustable separations and positions. iii) Multiple functionalities have been achieved and studied for the first time with the inclined DFOTs. Particle separation, grouping, stacking, rod <b>alignment,</b> <b>rod</b> rotation, and optical binding have been experimentally demonstrated. The multiple functionalities allow the inclined DFOTs to find applications in the study of interaction forces in colloidal systems as well as parallel particle manipulation in drug delivery systems. iv) Far-field superfocusing effect has been investigated and successfully demonstrated with a fiber-based surface plasmonic (SP) lens for the first time. A planar SP lens with a set of concentric nanoscale rings on a fiber endface has been developed. For the first time, a focus size that is comparable to the smallest achievable focus size of high NA objective lenses has been achieved with the fiber-based SP lens. The fiber-based SP lens can bridge the nanoscale particles/systems and the macroscale power sources/detectors, which has been a long standing challenge for nanophotonics. In addition to optical trapping, the fiber-based SP lens will impact many applications including high-resolution lithography, high-resolution fluorescence detection, and sub-wavelength imaging. v) Trapping ability enhanced with the fiber-based SP lens has been successfully demonstrated. With the help of the fiber-based SP lens, the trapping efficiency of fiber optical tweezers has been significantly enhanced, which is comparable with that of objective-based optical tweezers. A submicron-sized bacterium has been successfully trapped in three dimensions for the first time with optical tweezers based on single fibers...|$|E

40|$|We present {{simultaneous}} experimental {{measurements of}} the dynamics of anisotropic particles transported by a turbulent flow and the velocity gradient tensor of the flow surrounding them. We track both rod-shaped particles and small spherical flow tracers using stereoscopic particle tracking. By using scanned illumination, we are able to obtain a high enough seeding density of tracers to measure the full velocity gradient tensor near the <b>rod.</b> The <b>alignment</b> of <b>rods</b> with the vorticity and the eigenvectors of the strain rate show agreement with numerical simulations. A full description of the tumbling of rods in turbulence requires specifying a seven-dimensional joint probability density function (PDF) of five scalars characterizing the velocity gradient tensor and two scalars describing the relative orientation of the rod. If these seven parameters are known, then Jeffery's equation specifies the rod tumbling rate and any statistic of rod rotations can be obtained as a weighted average over the joint PDF. To look for a lower-dimensional projection to simplify the problem, we explore conditional averages of the mean-squared tumbling rate. The conditional dependence of the mean-squared tumbling rate on the magnitude of both the vorticity and the strain rate is strong, as expected, and similar. There is also a strong dependence on the orientation between the rod and the vorticity, since a rod aligned with the vorticity vector tumbles due to strain but not vorticity. When conditioned on the <b>alignment</b> of the <b>rod</b> with the eigenvectors of the strain rate, the largest tumbling rate is obtained when the rod is oriented at a certain angle to the eigenvector that corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue, because this particular orientation maximizes the contribution from both the vorticity and strain...|$|R

40|$|The Rod and Frame Test {{has been}} used to assess the degree to which {{subjects}} rely on the visual frame of reference to perceive vertical (visual field dependence-independence perceptual style). Early investigations found children exhibited a wide range of alignment errors, which reduced as they matured. These studies used a mechanical Rod and Frame system, and presented only mean values of grouped data. The current study also considered changes in individual performance. Changes in <b>rod</b> <b>alignment</b> accuracy in 419 school children were measured using a computer-based Rod and Frame test. Each child was tested at school Grade 2 and retested in Grades 4 and 6. The results confirmed that children displayed a wide range of alignment errors, which decreased with age but did not reach the expected adult values. Although most children showed a decrease in frame dependency over the 4 years of the study, almost 20 % had increased alignment errors suggesting that they were becoming more frame-dependent. Plots of individual variation (SD) against mean error allowed the sample to be divided into 4 groups; the majority with small errors and SDs; a group with small SDs, but alignments clustering around the frame angle of 18 °; a group showing large errors in the opposite direction to the frame tilt; and a small number with large SDs whose alignment appeared to be random. The errors in the last 3 groups could largely be explained by <b>alignment</b> of the <b>rod</b> to different aspects of the frame. At corresponding ages females exhibited larger alignment errors than males although this did not reach statistical significance. This study confirms that children rely more heavily on the visual frame of reference for processing spatial orientation cues.

In contrast with the DNS results, this model exhibits a strong <b>alignment</b> of the <b>rods</b> with the direction of the fastest stretching of the symmetric part of the random matrix.

40|$|Granular gases are a most {{peculiar}} state, superficially {{similar to}} molecular gases: They are loose ensembles of moving grains, rarely interacting {{with each other}} and with container walls. The most investigated scenario is the “granular cooling”, the collective loss of energy from an initially excited state. We present an experimental study of the cooling of a 3 D granular gas of rodlike grains in micro-gravity. Driven steady states of non-spherical grains are characterized by a lack of energy equipartition between the degrees of freedom of translation and rotation. Excitation by vibrating walls additionally introduces strong gradients in the direction and magnitude of translational velocities. We show that the degrees of freedom equilibrate during granular cooling in the homogeneous cooling state. The energy loss follows a t− 2 scaling.

Orientation of the colloidal gold rods is obtained by stretching the PVA films. The polarization absorbance spectra of aligned systems show only one resonance band instead of two absorbance bands as found for randomly distributed gold rods. The visible and near-infrared spectra reveal that the rods are completely oriented when the film is stretched 4 - 6 times its original length. No significant effect of the aspect ratio is observed on the film elongation required for complete alignment.

The atomic structure and chemistry of the nanorods are determined {{using a combination}} of high angle annular dark field imaging, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and density functional calculations. It is found that the structure of the BiFeO 3 matrix is strongly modified adjacent to the precipitates; the readiness of BiFeO 3 to adopt different structural allotropes in turn explains why such a large axial ratio, uncommon in precipitates, is stabilized. In addition, a correlation is found between the <b>alignment</b> of the <b>rods</b> and the orientation of ferroelastic domains in the matrix, which is consistent with the system's attempt to minimize its internal strain. Density functional calculations indicate a finite density of electronic states at the Fermi energy within the rods, suggesting enhanced electrical conductivity along the rod axes, and motivating future investigations of nanorod functionalities...|$|R
30|$|Another form of {{outstanding}} uniformity is the rotational <b>alignment</b> of the <b>rods.</b> Such <b>alignment</b> {{would only be}} possible under epitaxial relations. However, this is rather surprising considering a lattice mismatch of 29 % between InN and sapphire, known to produce structural defects (misfit dislocations) in films. Typically in such cases, the wire structure shows a wider cone shaped base, where the strain is gradually relieved [21, 22]. No such effect, or any other effect of strain has been observed in our case. In a theoretical work, Ertekin et al. showed that nanowire heterostructures are more effective at relieving mismatch strain coherently compared with films. The critical diameter for coherent growth of nanowires on lattice-mismatched substrates was predicted {{to be up to}} one order of magnitude larger than that of thin film growth [23].

40|$|Two-dimensional {{networks}} made {{of metal}} nanowires are excellent paradigms {{for the experimental}} observation of electrical percolation caused by continuous jackstraw-like physical pathways. Such systems became very interesting as alternative material in transparent electrodes, which are fundamental components in display devices. This work presents the experimental characterization of low-haze and ultra-transparent electrodes based on silver nanowires. The films are created by dip-coating, a feasible and scalable liquid film coating technique. We have found dominant alignment of the silver nanowires in withdrawal direction. The impact of this structural anisotropy on electrical anisotropy becomes more pronounced for low area coverage. The <b>rod</b> <b>alignment</b> does not influence the technical usability of the films as significant electrical anisotropy occurs only at optical transmission higher than 99 %.

40|$|We {{present a}} tensor {{constitutive}} model for predicting stress and flow-induced structure formation in dilute wormlike micellar solutions. The micellar solution {{is treated as}} a dilute suspension of rigid Brownian rods whose length varies dynamically. Consistent with the mechanism presented by Turner and Cates [J. Phys. :~Condens. Matter 4, 3719 (1992) ], flow-induced <b>alignment</b> of the <b>rods</b> is assumed to promote increase of rod length that corresponds {{to the formation of}} flow-induced structures observed in experiments. At very high deformation rate, hydrodynamic stresses causes the rod length to decrease. These mechanisms are implemented in a phenomenological equation governing the evolution of rod length, with the number density of rods appropriately modified to ensure conservation of surfactant mass. The model leads first to an increase in both shear and extensional viscosity as deformation rate increases and then to a decrease at higher rates. If the rate constant for flow-induced rod growth is sufficiently large, the model predicts a multivalued relation between stress and deformation rate in both shear and uniaxial extension. Predictions for shear and extensional flow at steady state are in reasonable agreement with experimental results. By design, the model is simple enough to serve as a tractable constitutive relation for computational fluid dynamics studies...|$|R
40|$|One {{possible}} {{route to}} the elusive biaxial nematic phase is through rod–disc dimers in which the rod and disc mesogenic units are linked via a flexible spacer. We have developed a continuous generic model of such rod–disc dimers in which neighbouring like groups tend to align {{parallel to each other}} while unlike groups tend to be orthogonal. A torsional potential controls the relative orientations of the groups within a single dimer; depending on the strength of the torsional potential, the groups may be orthogonal or parallel in the conformational ground state. Monte Carlo simulations show that a rigid rod–disc dimer is most likely to form a biaxial nematic phase if the anisotropies of the two groups are the same. Introduction of flexibility is found to have little effect on the qualitative behaviour of the dimer as the relative anisotropy of the two mesogenic groups is changed. However, when the torsional potential strongly favours the <b>alignment</b> of the <b>rod</b> and disc within a single molecule with their symmetry axes parallel there is a dramatic change. The system then exhibits a strong hysteresis in the molecular shape and biaxiality and the biaxial nematic–isotropic transition becomes strongly first order, in marked contrast to the second-order character usually found for this transition. This first-order transition is observed to occur for a range of relative anisotropies of the two groups rather than at a single point...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to characterize the}} optical properties of plasmonic anisotropic nanostructures through modeling and verification. Two nanostructures with important applications are selected for characterization. First, uniaxially aligned gold nanorods (AuNRs) embedded in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films are realized by determining suitable heating conditions during stretching, using PVA of high molecular weight mixed with plasticizer to improve the plastic deformability, and stretching the composite film. A high stretch ratio of seven is attained and the induced <b>alignment</b> of the <b>rods</b> is quantified statistically by an order parameter of 0. 92 and an average angle of 3. 5 °. The stretched composite film is shown to have dichroic optical properties, which confirmed the good alignment. Since the statistical quantification requires destructive examinations, a novel non-destructive method is developed based on a probabilistic approach, computational simulations, and spectrometric measurements. The new method yields results {{in agreement with the}} statistical method and applies to all dichroic particles. The second nanostructure is a gold nanostar (AuNS) – polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite platform. This nanostructure is characterized by using a typical AuNS of average dimensions and idealized as consisting of a sphere and radially oriented truncated cones representing its core and branches. Using branches defined parametrically by their number, length, aperture angle and orientation, and gradually attaching branches to a core, their ensemble spectra of increasing complexity are simulated. The absorptive contribution of each component is analyzed, demonstrating the large tunability of the AuNS and allowing for finding {{the most effective way to}} tune its fundamental resonant excitation.

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{transition from}} vesicles to inverted hexagonally packed (hollow) rods was studied for asymmetric diblock copolymers of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) in dilute solutions. The self-assembled aggregates were {{prepared by the}} addition of water to the copolymer solutions in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to induce the aggregation of the PS blocks, and the morphological transition was induced by an increase in the water content. Many intermediates, such as vesicles with hollow regions in the wall running parallel to the surfaces, as well as various quasihexagonal structures, were trapped. The mechanism of the transition involves a thickening of the vesicle walls accompanied by the formation of the hollow rods in the walls and a decrease {{in the size of the}} original water core. Evidence is presented that the transition proceeds in three steps. In the first step, hollow regions form in the walls of the vesicles. The second step involves further thickening of the walls and some <b>alignment</b> of the <b>rods</b> in a hexagonal pattern leading to the formation of quasihexagonal structures. Finally, the fully developed structures of inverted hexagonally packed rods form. This mechanism, especially in the initial step, is different from those found either in polystyrene-b-poly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) diblocks or in small molecule amphiphile systems, both of which involve fusion of vesicles. A comparison of the mechanisms is presented. Because of the ease of trapping of intermediates, the present study of the morphological transition may improve our understanding of the later stages of the process of the biomembrane fusion and the lipid lamellar (L) to inverted hexagonal (HII) phase transition.

The influences of growth speed and Fe substitution on the grain <b>alignment</b> in the <b>rods</b> {{were evaluated by}} means of x-ray pole figure studies. The obtained results showed that both applied growth speed and Fe substitution {{play a crucial role}} on grain alignment, which is strongly connected with the current-carrying capacity of the rods. It was found that the rods grown at 15  mm h− 1 (G 15) have stronger orientation than the rods grown at 30  mm h− 1 (G 30). However, in contrast to the G 15 rods, an increased substitution rate improved the orientation of the G 30 rods. Another important observation is that the increase on the substitution caused a decrease on the grain size of all the rods. The decrease of critical temperature values of the rods upon substitution was ascribed to both grain size effect and formation of a nonsuperconducting Fe-rich phase detected in scanning electron microscope/energy-dispersive x-ray analyses. The thermal conductivity values of the G 15 and G 30 rods were found to be in the range of 0. 9 – 1. 9 and 1. 1 – 1. 18  W m− 1  K− 1 at 150  K, respectively. The higher values of figure of merit (ZT), at all temperature ranges, were obtained from the highest substituted rods (x =  0. 1) for both of the applied growth speeds.

As their name suggests. these substances retain crystalline. anisotropic microstructure but deform as a liquid: the microstructure {{results from the}} anisotropic shape and interactions of the constituent molecules. The molecules are modeled as Brownian. interacting, rigid rods in a kinetic theory formulation. A solution of such rods undergoes a phase transition from a disordered (isotropic) state to an ordered (nematic) state as the density of rods is increased: such a solution also exhibits interesting, complex. non-Newtonian rheological behavior. Liquid-crystalline substances are used {{in a number of}} high-performance industrial applications because the aligned, liquid-crystalline structure yields superior mechanical properties in the final product. The properties can be compromised by any interfaces or defects present in the system. The processing of these systems is poorly understood, and further progress requires accurate modeling of the coupled evolution of the microstructure and non-Newtonian flow field. The main goal of this thesis is the simulation of liquid-crystalline phenomena featuring sharp nonhomogeneities in structure on the length scale of a single rod. Such critical phenomena include the interfaces and defects that are prevalent in isotropic-nematic coexistence, phase transitions. aligning boundaries such as walls. and nonhomogeneous flows. In order to capture this level of detail, simulations evolve the rod distribution function, which describes the distribution of rod positions and orientations, coupled with the velocity field. The evolution equation for the distribution function is known as the Doi diffusion equation. Prior studies of rigid rod behavior have typically avoided this level of detail: instead. a series of approximations and assumptions have been used to simplify the diffusion equation and avoid evolving the distribution function since it is a quantity that varies in both spatial dimensions and orientation dimensions. These prior studies evolve the order tensor (the second moment of the distribution function) and invoke closure approximations to obtain a closed form for an evolution equation for this tensor. However, these techniques suffer from inaccuracy, often of unknown magnitude, because of the closure approximations, and they lose the ability to describe phenomena where gradients in structure on the length scale of a single rod are important or where variations in density are important. This thesis avoids these approximations and their attending limitations. A parallel, finite-element method is used to discretize the rod distribution function and the rod interaction potential. However, these simulations differ from traditional finite-element-based simulations of complex fluids because of the coupling between the physical space for rod location and orientation space for <b>rod</b> <b>alignment</b> and because of the difficulty of computing extended rod-rod interactions in a tractable manner. Instead of approximating the rod-rod interaction potential via Taylor expansions as previous studies have done, novel numerical methods are developed to meet these challenges and allow rapid, parallel computation of the full, nonhomogeneous Doi diffusion equation. These methods are applied to the equilibrium phase behavior of solutions of rigid rods in both periodic systems and system bounded by hard walls. Newton's method is used to solve the nonlinear set of equations for extrema of the system free energy, and the properties of the Jacobian matrix describe a local free energy surface. Simulation results show that periodic, isotropic-nematic coexistence states are stable in a given concentration range; the bulk phase properties and interfacial properties are independent of the average concentration or size of the system if the solution is stable. Results for confined systems show a number of surprising results when hard wall boundary conditions are used; in particular, the phase behavior of an extremely large system bounded by walls does not converge to the phase behavior of a homogeneous system without bounds, because the walls fundamentally alter the free energy surface of the system. Spinodal decomposition, the phase transition from an unstable isotropic state to a stable nematic state, is also studied. Prior studies of this process have been limited to linear stability analyses and have yielded sharp conflicts about the dominant mechanism of the process. The linear stability analysis is re-examined and prior conflicts are resolved by numerically showing that the process mechanism is a strong function of the system concentration and diffusivities for rotational and translational rod motion. A semi-implicit, finite-element-based time stepper is then used for full dynamic simulations of the spinodal decomposition process. These simulations mark the first results for the nonhomogeneous Doi diffusion equation in the spinodal decomposition process, and the results show how restricted rod motion can cause the process to become kinetically trapped in nonhomogeneous intermediate states. The method is also applied to the related problem of coarsening between large nematic domains of aligned rods, and results show the effects of domain misalignment on the final structure. This dynamic method is then extended to simulations of rigid rods in wall-driven, rectilinear shear flow and pressure-driven flow between parallel plates. These simulations mark the first results for the full nonhomogeneous Doi diffusion equation in nonhomogeneous shear flow. Silmulation results show that the accurate treatment of wall-rod interactions is critically important: aphysical anchoring conditions at walls can suppress out-of-plane instabilities in planar shear flow. Also. simulations of pressure-driven flow show that misaligned domains marked by "'twist" interfaces can spontaneously form as a result in gradients in the shear rate: this concept lends important insight into the formation of domains in macroscopic rheological experiments. Results also show that miisaligned. tumnbling domains are not stable. Phase diagrarns for wall-driven. rectilinear shear flow and pressure-driven. rectilinear shear flow are given for varying shear rate and system size. by Micah James Green. Thesis (Ph. D.)
