60|$|The Judge, {{beyond all}} question, {{was a man}} of eminent respectability. The church {{acknowledged}} it; the state acknowledged it. It was denied by nobody. In all the very extensive sphere of those who knew him, whether in his public or private capacities, there was not an individual--except Hepzibah, and some lawless mystic, like the daguerreotypist, and, possibly, a few political opponents--who would have dreamed of seriously disputing his claim to a high and honorable place in the world's regard. Nor (we must do him the further justice to say) did Judge Pyncheon himself, probably, entertain many or very frequent doubts, that his enviable reputation accorded with his deserts. His conscience, therefore, usually considered the surest witness to a man's integrity,--his conscience, unless it might be for the little space of five minutes in the twenty-four hours, or, now and then, some black day in the whole year's circle,--his conscience bore an accordant testimony with the world's laudatory voice. And yet, strong as this evidence may seem to be, we should hesitate to peril our own conscience on the assertion, that the Judge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consenting</b> world were right, and that poor Hepzibah with her solitary prejudice was wrong. Hidden from mankind,--forgotten by himself, or buried so deeply under a sculptured and ornamented pile of ostentatious deeds that his daily life could take no note of it,--there may have lurked some evil and unsightly thing. Nay, we could almost venture to say, further, that a daily guilt might have been acted by him, continually renewed, and reddening forth afresh, like the miraculous blood-stain of a murder, without his necessarily and at every moment being aware of it.|$|E

CONCLUSIONS: The guidelines issued by the Department of Health are not being adhered to, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consenting</b> doctor needs {{to be aware of the}} medical and legal responsibilities in taking informed consent...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Interest in biobanking for {{collection}} of specimens for non-communicable diseases research {{has grown in}} recent times. This paper explores the perspectives of Nigerians on donation of specimen for the biobanking research. Methods We conducted 16 Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with individuals from different ethnic, age and socio-economic groups in Kano (North), Enugu (Southeast), Oyo States (Southwest) and Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (Central) of Nigeria. We used topic guides and prompt statements to explore the {{knowledge and understanding of}} interviewees to general issues about biobanking of biospecimens, their use and specifically about role of biobanking in non-communicable diseases research. Results A total of 123 individuals participated in 16 focus group discussions in 2011. Our participants had limited knowledge of the concept of biobanking but accepted it once they were educated about it and saw it as a worthwhile venture. Half of our study participants supported use of broad consent, a quarter supported restricted consent while the remaining quarter were in favour of tiered consent. Most discussants support shipment of their samples to other countries for further research, but they prefer those collaborations to be done only with competent, ethical researchers and they would like to receive feedback about such projects. The majority preferred health care as a benefit from participation, particularly for any unexpected condition that may be discovered {{during the course of the}} research instead of financial compensation. Participants emphasized the need to ensure that donated samples were not used for research that contradicts their religious beliefs. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that our participants accepted biobanking once they understand it but there were different attitudes to elements of biobanking such as type of consent. Our study highlights the need to carefully document population attitudes to elements of modern scientific research <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consenting</b> process. </p...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Alopecia areata is a unique, {{idiopathic}} disease {{in which there}} is patchy hair loss. The variable and uncertain natural history of alopecia areata is accounting for the multiplicity of uncritical claims for a large variety of therapeutic procedures. Aim: to find the therapeutic comparison between tacrolimus 0. 1 % ointment and minoxidil 2 % solution. Material and Methods: Patients attending skin out patient department in Navodaya medical college hospital and research centre, Raichur were screened <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consenting</b> consecutive cases of Aopecia Areata (AA) from December 2010 to November 2011 were chosen for study. There were 75 patients in the study. It is a randomized, single blind, intension to treat study. The eligible patients for the study were randomly allocated into two groups-Group A and Group B (38 in Group A and 37 in Group B). Patients in Group A were treated with 2 % Minoxidi solution to be applied twice daily over the alopecia patch, where as Patients in Group B were treated with Tacrolimus 0. 1 % ointment applied twice daily. Patients were followed up at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks. Alopecia Grading Score (AGS) was calculated at baseline and 12 weeks. Regrowth Score (RGS) was calculated at 12 weeks. Results: Total 69 patients completed the study (35 in Group A and 34 in Group B). In our study RGS â‰¥ 3 was observed in 65. 71 % of patients treated with Tinoxidil 2 % solution and 44. 12 % of patients treated with Tacrolimus 0. 1 % ointment. Conclusion: In our study Minoxidil 2 % solution had better stimulatory effect on hair growth compared to Tacrolimus 0. 1 % ointment in the treatment of mild to moderate patchy alopecia areata. The combination treatment may yield a better clinical response than either of the agents used singly...|$|E
