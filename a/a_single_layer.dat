5|$|The {{core of a}} {{follicle}} {{is surrounded}} by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> of follicular cells. When stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), these secrete the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. They do this by transporting and metabolising the thyroglobulin contained in the colloid. Follicular cells vary in shape from flat to cuboid to columnar, depending on how active they are.|$|E
5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally in <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer,</b> in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life {{of three to}} four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E

5|$|Most platyhelminths have no anus and regurgitate undigested {{material}} {{through the}} mouth. However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts {{have more than}} one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be difficult for them. The gut is lined with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in the gut or pharynx (throat).|$|E

5|$|The {{cervical}} canal {{is lined}} with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, {{which can lead to}} cancer of the cervix. Cervical cytology tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E
5|$|As a vespid wasp, P. exclamans nests are {{typically}} {{made up of}} paper with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> of cells with open combs. Although nest size varies, the upper limit is around 500 cells. Although many vespid wasp nests have an outer envelope of paper, P. exclamans nests do not. As indicated by Strassmann and Orgren, “Nests are approximately circular, and have a single off-center pedicel usually located towards {{the top of the}} nest. Cells near the pedicle are the oldest.” P. exclamans are particularly able to colonize new sites as foundresses often disperse into new territories. P. exclamans have often been found to have nests located near man-made structures and tend to more readily build nests in and near these man-made structures. Out of six wasp species, P. exclamans {{was the only one that}} occupied artificial nesting sites. It prefers well-lit, open sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} has been {{reported}} as ranging in color from pinkish, to pinkish-brown, to rosy brown, to vinaceous-fawn. The variation in spore print color results in part from differences in moisture content when recorded. Spores are roughly oblong to oval, smooth, hyaline (translucent) to pale brown, and measure 11–17 by 4–5.5µm. They are covered in a gelatinous sheath. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, two- and four-spored, thin-walled, and measure 25–35 by 10–14µm. Pleurocystidia (found on the tube walls) are roughly cylindrical to fuse-shaped with rounded tips, and measure 37–50 by 5–8µm. Cheilocystidia (on the tube edges) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and measure 23–40 by 6–8µm. Caulocystidia {{at the top of}} the stipe have various shapes and dimensions of 25–45 by 10–15µm; at the stipe base, the caulocystidia are 30–40 by 7–23µm and are mostly club-shaped to roughly spherical to tear-shaped. The cap cuticle comprises <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> of tangled hyphae that are 4–6µm thick.|$|E

5|$|Crucibulum {{species have}} light tan to cinnamon-colored fruiting bodies, {{known as a}} {{peridium}}, that are cup- or crucible-shaped. Depending on the species, {{the size of the}} peridium may range from 2–4tall by 1.5–3mm wide at the mouth (for C.parvulum) to 5–10mm tall by 5–8mm wide (for C.laeve). Viewed microscopically, the wall of the peridium is made of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> of tissue, in contrast to the three-layered peridium wall in Cyathus species. The outer surface of the peridium has hyphae that agglutinate so as to form a texture with visible filaments, a condition known as fibrillose; this outer layers of hairs typically wears off with age to leave a relatively smooth surface. Young specimens have a thin layer of tissue called an epiphragm that covers the top of the peridium; it wears off at maturity to expose the peridioles within. There are usually 4–6 peridioles (up to 15 have been noted for C.laeve) that are disc-shaped, whitish in color, and attached to the endoperidium by a strand called a funicular cord. Made of mycelia, The funicular cord tends to wither away and disappear as the fruiting body ages. Spores from Crucibulum species typically have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape, and are thick-walled, transclucent (hyaline) or light yellow-brown in color, with dimensions of 5–15 by 5–8µm. the spores of C.cyathiforme are notably slightly or strongly curved.|$|E
