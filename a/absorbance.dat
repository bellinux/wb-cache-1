5|$|When {{the glass}} {{electrode}} cannot be employed, as with non-aqueous solutions, spectrophotometric methods are frequently used. These may involve <b>absorbance</b> or fluorescence measurements. In {{both cases the}} measured quantity {{is assumed to be}} proportional to the sum of contributions from each photo-active species; with <b>absorbance</b> measurements the Beer-Lambert law is assumed to apply.|$|E
5|$|A base such as spermine {{has a few}} {{different}} {{sites where}} protonation can occur. In this example the first proton can go on the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, <b>absorbance,</b> fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation {{is very important for}} biological function, so mathematical methods have been developed for the determination of micro-constants.C NMR Data Processed by the New Computer Program HypNMR2000.

5|$|Measurement of {{antioxidant}} {{content in}} food {{is not a}} straightforward process, as antioxidants collectively are {{a diverse group of}} compounds with different reactivities to various reactive oxygen species. In food science, the oxygen radical <b>absorbance</b> capacity (ORAC) was once an industry standard for antioxidant strength of whole foods, juices and food additives. However, the United States Department of Agriculture withdrew these ratings in 2012 as biologically invalid, stating that no physiological proof in vivo existed to support the free-radical theory or roles for ingested phytochemicals, especially for polyphenols. Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from in vitro experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or biology.|$|E
50|$|The {{value of}} the acid {{dissociation}} constant, pKa, must be known. The molar <b>absorbances,</b> εHA and εA− of the two species HA and A− at wavelengths λx and λy must also have been determined by previous experiment.

5|$|Scientific {{quantities}} {{are often}} expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a logarithmic scale. For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the <b>absorbance</b> of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E

25|$|Infrared-based breath analyzers project an {{infrared}} beam of radiation through the captured breath {{in the sample}} chamber and detect the <b>absorbance</b> of the compound {{as a function of}} the wavelength of the beam, producing an <b>absorbance</b> spectrum that can be used to identify the compound, as the <b>absorbance</b> is due to the harmonic vibration and stretching of specific bonds in the molecule at specific wavelengths (see infrared spectroscopy). The characteristic bond of alcohols in infrared is the O-H bond, which gives a strong <b>absorbance</b> at a short wavelength. The more light is absorbed by compounds containing the alcohol group, the less reaches the detector on the other side—and the higher the reading. Other groups, most notably aromatic rings and carboxylic acids can give similar <b>absorbance</b> readings.|$|E

30|$|To {{determine}} {{the contributions of}} other compounds towards the reduction of XTT, the following substances were added to 1  ml of 10  mM potassium citrate buffer (pH  7.4) containing 500  μM XTT: 200  μM NADH, or 200  μM NADPH, or 50  mM ascorbic acid, or 5  mM catechin, or 50  μM CuCl 2, or 7.8  mM gallic acid. The mixtures were incubated at 25 °C in the dark, and the <b>absorbances</b> at 470  nm were measured at 5 and 60  min after the reaction began, using the corresponding reduction factor. The equivalent reduction factors were determined by subtracting the final <b>absorbances</b> from the initial <b>absorbances</b> and using the coefficient of molar extinction of XTT (ϵXTT[*]=[*] 2.16 X 104 M- 1  s- 1) as reported by Sutherland and Learmonth (1997).|$|R

25|$|PAHs possess very {{characteristic}} UV <b>absorbance</b> spectra. These often possess many <b>absorbance</b> {{bands and}} are unique for each ring structure. Thus, {{for a set}} of isomers, each isomer has a different UV <b>absorbance</b> spectrum than the others. This is particularly useful in the identification of PAHs. Most PAHs are also fluorescent, emitting characteristic wavelengths of light when they are excited (when the molecules absorb light). The extended pi-electron electronic structures of PAHs lead to these spectra, as well as to certain large PAHs also exhibiting semi-conducting and other behaviors.|$|E

Therefore, the Spectronic 20 can be used to analyze more complex solutions. For example, if a sample solution has two light-absorbing compounds in it, then the user performs measurements at two different wavelengths and constructs standard curves for each compound. Then the concentration of each compound can be calculated algebraically.|$|E

40|$|Computing dissimilarity {{profiles}} between spectra {{within a}} chromatographic peak and comparing {{them to a}} base profile for a pure peak can be a sensitive method for detecting coelution. The power of this method is limited by noise and non-idealities. For high maximum <b>absorbances,</b> non-idealities prevail over noise. In current practice, either the maximum <b>absorbances</b> are limited, or the base profile is computed from injections of pure standards. The first approach leads to a loss in detection power, the second requires substantial extra work, since the standards have to be obtained {{and they have to}} be measured separately for each peak of interest in the chromatogram. Here, we show that an approximation to the base profile can be computed from realistic simulations of homogeneous data accounting for potential non-idealities. This is demonstrated using several graphical displays. As a result, higher maximum <b>absorbances</b> leading to better impurity detection can be used without extra experimentation.

40|$|The {{value of}} biotin-avidin (B-A) ELISA for the {{detection}} of grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) in Xiphinema was estimated with field populations and greenhouse subpopulations. Samples consisted of increasing numbers of adults ranging from 1 to 64 in multiples of two. Tests with virus-free X. index populations reared on grapevine and fig plants as negative controls did not reveal a noticeable effect of the host plant. ELISA <b>absorbances</b> of virus-free X. index samples were greater than corresponding <b>absorbances</b> of X. pachtaicum samples. Differences occurred between two X. index field populations from GFLV-infected grapevines in Champagne and Languedoc. In most tests, 1 -, 2 -, 4 -, and 8 -nematode samples of virus-free and virus-infected populations, respectively, could not be separated. Consequently, B-A ELISA was not a reliable method for GFLV detection in samples of less than 10 X. index adults, but comparison of the <b>absorbances</b> obtained with increasing numbers may allow differentiation of the viral infectious potential of several populations...|$|R

A universal detector that complements UV-Vis <b>absorbance</b> detection is the Charged aerosol detector (CAD). A kind of commonly utilized detector includes refractive index detectors, which provide readings by measuring the changes in the refractive index of the effluent as it moves through the flow cell. In certain cases, it is possible to use multiple detectors, for example LCMS normally combines UV-Vis with a mass spectrometer.|$|E
50|$|Also to {{be noted}} is KD*P, {{potassium}} dideuterium phosphate, with slightly different properties. Highly deuterated KDP {{is used in}} nonlinear frequency conversion of laser light instead of protonated (regular) KDP {{due to the fact}} that the replacement of protons with deuterons in the crystal shifts the third overtone of the strong OH molecular stretch to longer wavelengths, moving it mostly out of the range of the fundamental line at ~1064 nm of neodymium-based lasers. Regular KDP has <b>absorbances</b> at this wavelength of approximately 4.7-6.3%/cm of thickness while highly deuterated KDP has <b>absorbances</b> of typically less than 0.8%/cm.|$|R

25|$|The spectroscopic {{properties}} of FAD and its variants allows for reaction monitoring {{by use of}} UV-VIS absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. Each of the different forms of FAD have distinct <b>absorbance</b> spectra, making for easy observation of changes in oxidation state. A major local <b>absorbance</b> maximum for FAD is observed at 450nm, with an extinction coefficient of 11,300. Flavins in general have fluorescent activity when unbound (proteins bound to flavin nucleic acid derivatives are called flavoproteins). This property can be utilized when examining protein binding, observing loss of fluorescent activity when put into the bound state. Oxidized flavins have high absorbances of about 450nm, and fluoresce at about 515-520nm.|$|E
