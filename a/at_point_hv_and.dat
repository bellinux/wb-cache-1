40|$|Most commercially {{available}} nanoelectrospray ionization (NSI) sources possess well-defined electrical ground {{points in the}} mobile phase flow path. Inclusion of a ground point eliminates possible safety hazards involving source high voltage. Most home-built sources, however, lack a specifically defined ground point; the ground point often resides in injection valves, auto-samplers, or chromatographic pumps. Poorly placed ground-points affect analytical performance because high-voltage (HV) source current flows to this <b>point.</b> <b>HV</b> for on-line NSI is commonly provided through an electrode contacting the mobile phase upstream from the emitter. Current flow between <b>HV</b> supply, ground <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> nanoelectrospray plume (e. g., the current that flows from emitter to inlet) engenders the functional equivalent of a voltage-divider circuit. Relative impedance between the ground <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>HV</b> supply, <b>and</b> the impedance between the <b>HV</b> supply <b>and</b> NSI plume, determines effective spray voltage at the emitter tip. If relative impedance to the ground point is too low, effective voltage at the emitter sinks below the HV supply, affecting plume stability or even preventing spray formation; this obstacle is amplified in gradient elution because mobile phase surface tension changes during the analysis. Periodic or chaotic spray drop-out is a typical result. Plume formation and stability with gradient elution will be investigated using zero-dead-volume, optically clear, platinum electrode assemblies for <b>HV</b> <b>and</b> ground connections. Figure 1 shows a 150 μm platinum wire for HV contact at the junction between 75 and 50 μm ID fused-silica tubing. HV contact is made through a 150 μm platinum wire.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to study the effect of heat {{treatment}} of carburizing carbon steel by using three parameters (carburizing hour, carburizing temperature, and quenching medium). This study was conducted using a furnace. This process is carried out at temperatures from 850 °C to 950 °C (1123 – 1223 K) for three various duration time which are 8, 10 and 12 hours. From the experiment, the thickness of carbon layer varied according to the parameters that been used. For carburizing temperature at 950 °C, the thickness of carbon layer was between 40 μm to 80 μm for oil as quenching medium, 60 μm to 100 μm for water as quenching medium and 20 μm to 60 μm for air as quenching medium. This experiment also been conducted for different carburizing temperature but with one quenching medium which is oil. The thickness of carbon layer was between 20 μm to 60 μm for 850 °C, 30 μm to 70 μm for 900 °C and 40 μm to 80 μm for 950 °C. For carburizing temperature at 950 °C, surface hardness values of carburized specimens were between 185. 9 <b>HV</b> <b>and</b> 386. 2 <b>HV</b> for oil as quenching medium, 234. 7 <b>HV</b> <b>and</b> 398. 4 <b>HV</b> for water as quenching medium <b>and</b> 120. 7 <b>HV</b> <b>and</b> 241. 5 <b>HV</b> for air as quenching medium.

40|$|There are few {{data in the}} EEG {{literature}} {{describing the}} time course of hyperventilation-(HV) induced changes in blood gases, despite this being a routine activating procedure.

40|$|Two {{closely related}} {{sympatric}} species of phytophagous lady beetles, Henosepi-lachna vigintioctomaculata (Motschulsky) and H. pustulosa (Kono) (henceforth abbreviated respectively as <b>Hv</b> <b>and</b> Hp), {{are found in}} Japan, distributed mainly in the central to northern regions. The distinction between two species is clear in typical forms by external morphology, especially leg coloration, and food plants in natural conditions, the former preferring the potato while the latter mainly thistles. In addition to them, however, there is another puzzling form called Western Tokyo form (abbreviated Ht). This form is morphologically similar to Hp while resembles Hv in food plants and is distributed in the southern KantO djstrict, where both <b>Hv</b> <b>and</b> Hp have not been recorded. Moreover, both <b>Hv</b> <b>and</b> Hp, especially the latter, show a conspicuous differentiation in some external features as dealt with in a coming paper.

40|$|There is {{significant}} {{variability in the}} ability of listeners to perceive degraded speech. Existing research has suggested that vocabulary knowledge is one factor that differentiates better listeners from poorer ones, though the reason for such a relationship is unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether a relationship exists between vocabulary knowledge and the type of lexical segmentation strategy listeners use in adverse conditions. This study conducted error pattern analysis using an existing dataset of 34 normal-hearing listeners (11 males, 23 females, aged 18 to 35) who participated in a speech recognition in noise task. Listeners were divided into a higher vocabulary (<b>HV)</b> <b>and</b> a lower vocabulary (LV) group based on their receptive vocabulary score on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). Lexical boundary errors (LBEs) were analysed to examine whether the groups showed differential use of syllabic strength cues for lexical segmentation. Word substitution errors (WSEs) were also analysed to examine patterns in phoneme identification. The type and number of errors were compared between the <b>HV</b> <b>and</b> LV groups. Simple linear regression showed a significant relationship between vocabulary and performance on the speech recognition task.

There was no significant difference in the proportion of target phrases to which <b>HV</b> <b>and</b> LV listeners responded.

5|$|The <b>HV's</b> (<b>and</b> ARBiH's strategic) {{success was}} a result of a series of {{improvements}} to the armies themselves, and crucial breakthroughs made in the ARSK positions that were subsequently exploited by the <b>HV</b> <b>and</b> the ARBiH. The attack was not immediately successful <b>at</b> all <b>points,</b> but seizing key positions led to the collapse of the ARSK command structure and overall defensive capability. The HV capture of Bosansko Grahovo just before Operation Storm, and the special police's advance to Gračac, made it nearly impossible to defend Knin. In Lika, two guard brigades quickly cut the ARSK-held area (which lacked tactical depth and mobile reserve forces), isolating pockets of resistance, positioning a mobile force for a decisive northward thrust into the Karlovac Corps area of responsibility (AOR), and pushing ARSK towards Banovina. The defeat of the ARSK at Glina and Petrinja, after a tough defence, defeated the ARSK Banija Corps as well, as its reserve was pinned down by the ARBiH. The RSK relied on the Republika Srpska and Yugoslav militaries as its strategic reserve, but they did not intervene in the battle.|$|R
