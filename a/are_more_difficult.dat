5|$|In {{some cases}} {{parallelism}} is transparent to the programmer, {{such as in}} bit-level or instruction-level parallelism, but explicitly parallel algorithms, particularly those that use concurrency, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to write than sequential ones, because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race conditions are the most common.

5|$|The {{spelling}} system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered, {{with elements}} of French, Latin, and Greek spelling {{on top of}} the native Germanic system. Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace. Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced. There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.|$|E
5|$|The two armies {{suffered}} between 46,000 and 51,000 casualties.

5|$|Unlike most of {{the larger}} Orkney islands, the {{derivation}} of the name 'Shapinsay' is not obvious. The final 'ay' is from the Old Norse for island, but the first two syllables <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to interpret. Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests the root may be hjalpandis-øy (helpful island) owing {{to the presence of}} a good harbour, although anchorages are plentiful in the archipelago. The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to Scalpandisay, which may suggest a derivation from Judge's island. Another suggestion is Hyalpandi's island, although no one of that name is known to be associated with Shapinsay.|$|E
5|$|Although calcium is in {{the same}} group as {{magnesium}} and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organocalcium compounds are not similarly widespread because they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to make and more reactive, although they have recently been investigated as possible catalysts. Organocalcium compounds tend to be more similar to organoytterbium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of Yb2+ (102pm) and Ca2+ (100pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, calcium dicyclopentadienyl, Ca(C5H5)2, must be made by directly reacting calcium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the C5H5 ligand with the bulkier C5(CH3)5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.|$|E
5|$|Army Group South's Donets Campaign {{had cost}} the Red Army some 70,000–80,000 {{personnel}} casualties. Of these troops lost, an estimated 45,200 {{were killed or}} went missing, while another 41,200 were wounded. Between April and July 1943, the Red Army took its time to rebuild its forces {{in the area and}} prepare for an eventual renewal of the German offensive, known as the Battle of Kursk. Overall German casualties <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to come by but clues are provided by examining the casualties of the SS Panzer Corps, taking into consideration that the Waffen-SS divisions were frequently deployed where the fighting was expected to be the harshest. By 17 March, it is estimated that the SS Panzer Corps had lost around 44% of its fighting strength, including around 160 officers and about 4,300 enlisted personnel.|$|E

5|$|Organostrontium {{compounds}} contain {{one or more}} strontium–carbon bonds. They {{have been}} reported as intermediates in Barbier-type reactions. Although strontium {{is in the same}} group as magnesium, and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organostrontium compounds are not similarly widespread because they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to make and more reactive. Organostrontium compounds tend to be more similar to organoeuropium or organosamarium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of these elements (Sr2+ 118pm; Eu2+ 117pm; Sm2+ 122pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, strontium dicyclopentadienyl, Sr(C5H5)2, must be made by directly reacting strontium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the C5H5 ligand with the bulkier C5(CH3)5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.|$|E
5|$|The Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 2003 {{reported}} that observations {{of four of}} the Mira variables in Microscopium were very urgently needed as data on their light curves was incomplete. Two of them—R and S Microscopii—are challenging stars for novice amateur astronomers, {{and the other two}} U and RY Microscopii <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> still. Another red giant, T Microscopii, is a semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 7.7 and 9.6 over 344 days. Of apparent magnitude 11, DD Microscopii is a symbiotic star system composed of an orange giant of spectral type K2III and white dwarf in close orbit, with the smaller star ionizing the stellar wind of the larger star. The system has a low metallicity. Combined with its high galactic latitude, this indicates that the star system has its origin in the galactic halo of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, {{on the same side of}} the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E

5|$|HST uses {{gyroscopes}} {{to detect}} and measure any rotations so it can stabilize itself in orbit and point accurately and steadily at astronomical targets. Normally, three gyroscopes are required for operation; observations are still possible with two, but the area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted, and observations requiring very accurate pointing <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult.</b> There are further contingency plans for observations with just one gyro, but if all gyros fail, continued scientific observations will not be possible. In 2005, {{it was decided to}} switch to two-gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission. The switch to this mode was made in August 2005, leaving Hubble with two gyroscopes in use, two on backup, and two inoperable. One more gyro failed in 2007. By the time of the final repair mission in May 2009, during which all six gyros were replaced (with two new pairs and one refurbished pair), only three gyros were still working. Engineers determined that the gyro failures were caused by corrosion of electric wires powering the motor that was initiated by oxygen-pressurized air used to deliver the thick suspending fluid. The new gyro models were assembled using pressurized nitrogen and they should be much more reliable.|$|E
5|$|Spatial {{economics}} {{deal with}} distance and area, {{and how these}} may affect a market through transportation costs and geographical limitations. The development of spatial economics is usually ascribed to German economist Johann Heinrich von Thünen; however, Cantillon addressed spatial economics nearly a century earlier. Cantillon integrated his advancements in spatial economic theory into his microeconomic analysis of the market, describing how transportation costs influence the location of factories, markets and population centres—that is, individuals strive to lower transportation costs. Conclusions on spatial economics were derived from three premises: cost of raw materials of equal quality will always be higher near the capital city, due to transportation costs; transportation costs vary on transportation type (for example, water transportation was considered cheaper than land-based transportation); and larger goods that <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to transport will always be cheaper closer to their area of production. For example, Cantillon believed markets were designed as they were to decrease costs to both merchants and villagers {{in terms of time}} and transportation. Similarly, Cantillon posited that the locations of cities were the result in large part of the wealth of inhabiting property owners and their ability to afford transportation costs—wealthier property owners tended to live farther from their property, because they could afford the transportation costs. In Essai, spatial economic theory was used to derive why markets occupied the geographical area they did and why costs varied across different markets.|$|E
5|$|The player {{generally}} has {{to explore the}} dungeon to reveal its contents similar to a fog of war. Many roguelikes include factors related to light sources such as a torch to provide illumination to see monsters in nearby squares, and line of sight can also limit what monsters are visible. Dungeons tend to be connected by stairs; lower dungeon levels generally <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than higher ones, so that a character that is underdeveloped may have difficulty by progressing too fast. Dungeon levels and the population of monsters and treasure within them are generated randomly using procedural generation, so that no game is the same on subsequent playthroughs. Most roguelikes have an ultimate goal of either claiming an item located at the deepest level of the dungeon, or to defeat a specific monster that lives on that level. Typical roguelikes include a scoreboard, ranking the player's performance once their game is over (be it through permadeath or completing the objective) based {{on the amount of}} treasure, money, and experience earned, and how fast the player completed the game in such cases.|$|E
