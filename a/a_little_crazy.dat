25|$|My {{favorite}} {{king was}} King Melchior, {{because he was}} the oldest and had a long white beard. My brother's favorite was King Kaspar. He insisted that this king was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>crazy</b> and quite deaf. I don't know why he was so positive about his being deaf. I suspect it was because dear King Kaspar never brought him all the gifts he requested. He was also rather puzzled by the fact that King Kaspar carried the myrrh, which appeared to him as a rather eccentric gift, for he never quite understood what the word meant.|$|E
500|$|Conan O'Brien {{conceived}} the idea {{when he saw}} a billboard that just had the word [...] "Monorail" [...] on it, with no other details or explanation. He first pitched this episode at a story retreat to Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who said the episode was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>crazy</b> and thought he should try some other material first. O'Brien had previously pitched episodes where Lisa had a rival and where Marge gets a job at the power plant and Mr. Burns falls in love with her; both went well. James L. Brooks [...] "absolutely loved" [...] this episode when O'Brien presented it.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} given in February 2015, Kane {{said that he}} was in a relationship with Katie Goodland, whom he has known since childhood. He told Esquire magazine, [...] "We went to school together, so she's seen my whole career. Of course, she's finding it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>crazy.</b> I think she's even been in the papers a couple of times taking the dogs out". They have two Labrador dogs Brady and Wilson, named after NFL quarterbacks Tom Brady and Russell Wilson. Kane and Goodland announced the birth of their first child, Ivy Jane Kane, on 8 January 2017. On 1 July, Kane announced his engagement to Goodland on his Twitter account.|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Makinoha is {{definitely}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>crazier</b> than his first impression. He's not only crazy, but he's also very strategic. He's {{the kind of}} guy who never makes the same mistake twice. He cares for Nao but has also seen her as an obstacle, often building androids to combat her (known as [...] "Robo-Nao"). However, when his schemes backfire, he usually finds himself begging for Nao's mercy, which is only occasionally given.|$|R
5000|$|Nishnabotna Township is {{probably}} best known outside the immediate region for a reference by the New Yorker cartoonist George Booth, a native of Missouri. In a single-panel cartoon, one threadbare and addled character says to another as they cross a crowded street in New York City: [...] "Mother always says that. Mother always {{says you have to}} be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>crazy</b> to live in New York. Mother is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>crazy,</b> but she doesn't live in New York. Mother lives in Nishnabotna, Missouri." ...|$|R
500|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Andrew Hanson {{questioned}} whether the writers had been using drugs lately because of the surge of drug-related episodes; though he loved it, he acknowledged that the episode was one [...] "you are either going to love or hate", explaining that it [...] "got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>crazy</b> using Oliviaâ€™s mind as a setting, [...] it stays grounded through the emotional current running underneath... {{you have to give}} Fringe credit for taking a risky, bold move." [...] SFScope writer Sarah Stegall called the episode [...] "brilliant, risky, fascinating, and dangerous. It's not a tack this show can afford to take very often, but I like it when it does." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to Ruby's {{introduction}} in {{the third}} season, series creator Eric Kripke summarized the character as [...] "ruthless and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>crazy</b> and rough around the edges", calling her [...] " [...] little unhinged" [...] because she lacks the [...] "moral conscience" [...] that Sam and Dean have. Katie Cassidy, the actress who portrayed Ruby {{in the third}} season, described her as a [...] "kick-ass, bad-ass" [...] ally of Sam and Dean's who [...] "also likes to stir up a little trouble." [...] According to Cassidy, Ruby is [...] "mysterious", [...] "manipulative", and in control of her situation, being [...] "always 10 steps ahead of everybody else". On this, Cassidy proclaimed that Ruby [...] "knows what she wants, and she's out to get it". Actress Genevieve Cortese, who played the character in the fourth season, deemed Cassidy's incarnation [...] "very tough" [...] and [...] "hard to get close to".|$|E
500|$|Season two {{also showed}} Lana's {{transition}} from the [...] "girl next door" [...] to a more [...] "self-reliant young woman". At {{the beginning of the}} season Lana is forced to come to terms with her diminished feelings for Whitney, as well as her growing feelings for Clark. It takes time before Lana is strong enough to finally tell Whitney the truth, in a video message, about the way she feels. The Talon, a local coffee shop co-owned by Lana, becomes her new grounding force as Whitney and her aunt have left Smallville. Kreuk thinks that it can be hard to believe that a sixteen-year-old girl could become co-owner of a coffee shop, but she believes that it helps to provide more independence for the character and establish her more within the show. Eventually, in order to really get to know herself, and find her role in life, Lana leaves Smallville for Paris. In season four, Kristin Kreuk felt like Lana is [...] "going <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>crazy</b> and is uncertain about her direction, and feels people aren't validating her beliefs".|$|E
5000|$|Speaking about [...] "Treatment" [...] in an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Labrinth has stated that [...] "It's a record that, for me, everybody's been through that moment where love sends them <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>crazy</b> and I thought I needed to write about it".|$|R

500|$|Asche {{is married}} to Angela Albers, whom he presumably met in college at Nebraska. He {{is a fan of}} {{football}} and an ardent supporter of the Nebraska Cornhuskers; he routinely drives six hours to attend their home football games. He also [...] "appreciates the speed and violence of hockey"; conversely, he does not like basketball. During the offseason, he resides in O'Fallon, Missouri, which is barely over [...] from his birthplace of St. Charles, Missouri. According to his MLB.com biography, his hobbies include golfing, fishing, and completing crossword puzzles. In an interview, Asche said his favorite television show was Parks and Recreation, and his favorite food was chicken parmesan. He is close to his family, and noted that he started playing baseball around age five or six, with his first experience being playing in the back yard with his father and brother. When he was first called up to the major leagues, he noted, [...] "Emotions were crazy. Trying to hold back tears seeing your parents in the stands for the first time was tough, then playing on top of that made it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>crazy</b> to start. But that is all part of it. I think the phone call I got to make to my parents the day I was called up was the most memorable part ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{image of}} Mochrie's face is used {{extensively}} in Animutation, {{a style of}} Flash animation. Neil Cicierega, the father of Animutation, would place Mochrie in almost every Animutation he made, making the inclusion of him in Animutation somewhat of a running gag. Mochrie is aware of his status among Animutation artists and fans, having been quoted, [...] "It was very odd when I first saw the animutations. Obviously, the animators are more than <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>crazy,</b> but I am very proud of my standing in the animutation arena and hope that some day I can make millions off of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{contest for}} fans {{to create an}} album cover image for 20 Y.O. was {{announced}} on July 18, 2006, through Yahoo!. Fans were able to create and submit their own album-cover design, with four winners being chosen by Jackson herself. The first million copies of the album would be published with these fan-created covers. The concept of the contest was to create an image that best celebrated Jackson's past twenty years. The singer hand-picked dozens of images that span over twenty years of Jackson's career were made available for download for use in creating the design. [...] "They told me that I should pick maybe 20, 30 photos, but I think I went <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>crazy.</b> I picked way more than that. I gave them {{some of the new}} stuff I just shot for the album cover shoot. So they have some really recent photos as well as some stuff from 20 years ago", Jackson confessed. For the official artwork for the album, Jackson appears sporting big hair and a wrist full of bracelets.|$|E

2500|$|While Bill Naito's {{business}} ventures were often financially risky, {{it was clear}} that the potential for profit was not his primary motive, or at least not his only motive. [...] He was widely recognized for taking on ventures that were at least as beneficial to the community as they were potentially moneymaking. When asked about his own salary by The Oregonian in 1985, he replied, [...] "I'm <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>crazy.</b> My pay may not be the best in town, but I offer good economic advice. My objective is not to make a pile of money. That's one objective, but another is satisfaction." [...] In the early 1980s he built the 300-unit McCormick Pier Apartments along the Willamette River waterfront, just north of Old Town, replacing a derelict warehouse district and providing needed middle-income housing in an area where other developers had concluded it could not succeed. [...] He lobbied in favor of a proposal for historic Union Station to be acquired by the city (and thereby preserved), which came to fruition in 1987.|$|E

5000|$|Owners of small, {{independent}} {{book stores}} {{have said they}} find shoplifting particularly bothersome. According to Paul Constant, a Seattle book-store employee, [...] "I know a few booksellers who have literally been driven <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>crazy</b> {{at the thought of}} their inventory evaporating out the door, and with good reason: An overabundance of shoplifters can put bookstores out of business. One local bookstore owner can famously talk about shoplifters with total strangers for hours, with the detail and passion that some people reserve for sexual conquests." ...|$|R

50|$|The series revolves, {{in one of}} Baghdad's lanes, and it is {{a popular}} one. All of its people are from the low-class (working poor). Its main character, Haji Radhi (Saleem Al-Basri) is a Hairstylist that doesn't know how to read and write, so he's an illiterate. His assistant, A'bousi (Hammoudi Al-Harithi) is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>crazy,</b> but he dropped school at fifth grade, so he knows the basics of reading and writing. Most of the people of this lane are illiterates, so they go to an anti-illiteracy school. And they have lots of adventures with each other, because they're all friends.|$|R
