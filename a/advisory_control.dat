40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research concerning the type, category and fields of applications of Decision Support Systems (DSS) and their contribution to decision-making in agriculture, mainly in the fields of planning and management of farms, farm regions and agricultural resources. More specifically, the paper includes a taxonomy survey that has been based on an analysis of all published works on applications of DSS from 1987 to 2001, as well as a categorized presentation of these applications. The relevant classification of DSS is made by treating subject (theoretical DSS or applicative), the source of publication (proceedings, scientific journal or dissertation), the type of DSS (Decision Support System, Expert System or Knowledge Based DSS), the operational research model that each one DSS uses, the operational field (DiagnosticÃâForecasting, <b>Advisory,</b> <b>Control,</b> EducationalÃâInformational, Operational), the category of decisions (Strategic or Tactic planning decision) and the year of application. The basic concepts and characteristics of DSSs along with the important role that they play in the decision-making process in agriculture, are also described {{at the beginning of this}} paper.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), which provides an aggregated model of urban traffic dynamics linking network production and density, offers a new generation of real-time traffic management strategies to improve the network performance. However, the effect of route choice behavior on MFD modeling in case of heterogeneous urban networks is still unexplored. The paper advances in this direction by firstly extending two MFD-based traffic models with different granularity of vehicle accumulation state and route choice behavior aggregation. This configuration enables us to address limited traffic state observability and to scrutinize implications of driversâ route choice in MFD modeling. We consider a city that is partitioned in a small number of large-size regions (aggregated model) where each region consists of medium-size sub-regions (more detailed model) exhibiting a well-defined MFD. This paper proposes a route guidance <b>advisory</b> <b>control</b> system based on the aggregated model as a large-scale traffic management strategy that utilizes aggregated traffic states while sub-regional information is partially known. In addition, we investigate the effect of equilibrium conditions (i. e. user equilibrium and system optimum) on the overall network performance, in particular MFD functions...|$|E

In this article we address three issues that are perceived as important: the exploration of boards in small firms, the exploration of board processes, and the understanding of board effectiveness based on measures of actual board task performance. The lack of research attention on these issues is largely based on difficulties in getting access to reliable data. We have collected data from a sample of small Norwegian firms. Constructs and relationships are validated and tested through LISREL analyses. We found that concepts related to board processes had considerable impact on actual board task performance, but also that the impacts of various process concepts (e. g. commitment, information seeking and openness) have different impacts on different board tasks (e. g. networking, <b>advisory</b> and <b>control).</b> Traditional board demographic variables were used as control variables, but generally they had only minor influence on board task performance.
