5|$|After the massacre, General Henry Atkinson was {{informed}} that Dodge was to take over General Alexander Posey's brigade at Fort Hamilton. While Dodge {{was on his way}} to visit the brigade, he heard a rifle shot from a group of Native Americans. Dodge quickly returned to his command post and gathered as many men <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to pursue the enemy. With Dodge in quick pursuit, a group of approximately 25 Native warriors criss-crossed the Pecatonica River until, finding flight hopeless, they prepared to make a stand at the Battle of Pecatonica.|$|E
5|$|Against {{his wishes}} Braham was rested from {{operations}} and posted from No 141 Squadron on 1 October 1943 {{to attend a}} staff officer course at Camberley. Braham resisted the move as much <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> He complained directly to Air Marshal Roderick Hill, commanding Fighter Command at that time. Hill refused to countenance Braham's request and denied his plea for one last operation. Within days Braham was posted to No. 9 Group RAF.|$|E
5|$|Asher Keddie played Dr. Carol Frost. Poker player Daniel Negreanu has a cameo. Phil Hellmuth {{wanted to}} join him but was unable because he {{committed}} to an event in Toronto. X-Men co-creator Stan Lee said he would cameo, but Lee ended up not appearing in the film <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not attend filming in Australia.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, Edward {{witnessed}} trench warfare first-hand {{and visited}} {{the front line}} as often <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> {{for which he was}} awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, made him popular among veterans of the conflict. Edward undertook his first military flight in 1918, and later gained a pilot's licence.|$|E
5|$|Following the war {{council of}} 20 June, Schuyler ordered St. Clair {{to hold out}} as long <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and to avoid having his avenues of retreat cut off. Schuyler took command of a reserve force of 700 at Albany, and Washington ordered four regiments {{to be held in}} {{readiness}} at Peekskill, further down the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|Ian Garrad, {{impatient}} to establish whether the conversion was feasible, commissioned racing driver and fabricator Ken Miles to build another prototype as quickly <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> Miles was {{provided with a}} budget of $800, a Series II Alpine, a Ford V8 engine and a 2-speed automatic transmission, and {{in about a week}} he had a running V8 conversion, thus proving the concept.|$|E

5|$|In 1776 Bewick {{became a}} partner in Beilby's workshop. The joint {{business}} prospered, becoming Newcastle's leading engraving service with an enviable reputation for high quality work and good service. In September 1776 he went to London for eight months, finding the city rude, deceitful and cruel, and much disliking the unfairness of extreme wealth and poverty side by side. He returned to his beloved Newcastle as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but {{his time in the}} capital gave him a wider reputation, business experience, and an awareness of new movements in art.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, {{at the age}} of 26, Soyer severed his {{spinal cord}} during an {{accident}} while riding his motorbike on his parents' farm. He was keen to exercise as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> during his rehabilitation. He tried several sports, including wheelchair tennis, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball, following his accident in an attempt to find one that made him feel able-bodied. He drove dune buggies and tried kayaking, and in 2007 was learning how to para-glide.|$|E
5|$|In late 1923, having {{decided not}} to return to Cambridge, Allen took {{a job in the}} City (London's {{financial}} district) working for the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation as an underwriter. Not particularly well-off financially, he had to work full-time and throughout his career could not afford to take too much time away from business. He played cricket as often <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> in the summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket—including for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—and country house cricket.|$|E

50|$|It was {{the final}} major {{championship}} for Sam Snead, 70, a three-time Masters champion. He withdrew after a first round 79 <b>as</b> <b>he</b> assessed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not make the cut.|$|R

5|$|Ivan Vladislav left a mixed heritage, varying from a {{reputation}} of being a ruthless murderer to a hero defending his country as best <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> The descendants of Ivan Vladislav entered the Byzantine nobility and rose to the highest ranks of the hierarchy. Two women of his family became empresses of the Byzantine Empire and others became military commanders or high-ranking officials. He was an ancestor of the Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos.|$|E
5|$|Kumaritashvili grew up {{in nearby}} Bakuriani, which {{is known for its}} many ski slopes. He enjoyed several winter sports and started luge when he was 13 years old. While {{attending}} the Georgian Technical University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics in 2009, Kumaritashvili maintained a rigorous training and competition schedule. Though his family endured economic hardship, Kumaritashvili attended as many luge events <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> often driving for days to reach World Cup events. As a devout member of the Georgian Orthodox Church, he prayed at church before every competition.|$|E
5|$|Mahendra's {{passion for}} cinema {{prompted}} him to leave for India and join the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune in 1966. He had to take up cinematography <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not gain admissions to other disciplines. At the institute he was exposed to world cinema as he got an opportunity to watch films made by François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, both associated with the French New Wave movement. In 1969, Mahendra graduated from the institute with a gold medal.|$|E

5|$|Navarro, for his part, {{pressured}} by Madero, {{tried to keep}} the ceasefire for as long <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> This proved to be quite costly to the defenders. The rebel forces captured the outer defenses of the city unopposed, as no federal officer was willing to countermand the orders to hold fire. Instead, the troops withdrew deeper into the city.|$|E
5|$|On 25 October 1984, {{nineteen}} prisoners {{appeared in}} court on charges {{relating to the}} death of prison officer James Ferris, sixteen charged with his murder. A pathologist determined that the stab wounds Ferris suffered would not have killed a healthy man. The judge acquitted all sixteen <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not correlate the stabbing to the heart attack.|$|E
5|$|On lap 22, Zorzi {{pulled off}} to {{the left side of the}} main straight, just after the brow of a hill and a bridge over the track.

Zorzi did not immediately get out of his car <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not disconnect the oxygen pipe from his helmet.|$|E

5|$|Oryol {{took the}} lead after Borodino was sunk; she was joined by Nebogatov's Second Division after Tōgō ordered the Japanese battleships to {{disengage}} in the gathering darkness. Nebogatov assumed command of {{the remains of the}} fleet and they continued towards Vladivostok. The ships were discovered by the Japanese early the following morning and attacked by Tōgō's battleships around 10:00. The faster Japanese ships stayed beyond the range at which Nebogatov's ships could effectively reply and he decided to surrender his ships at 10:30 <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> neither return fire nor close the range.|$|E
5|$|Over dinner, Leslie tells Dave {{that she}} will not move to San Diego with him, as her life is in Pawnee. Dave, {{although}} sad, understands her choice and the two split up amicably. At Pawnee's tree lighting ceremony, Leslie is congratulated by everyone, including Leslie's mother Marlene, who is proud that her daughter successfully fought off the media. Leslie returns to {{work the next day}} much to Ron's immense relief, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> barely handle just a portion of her daily duties. Everyone is visibly glad that Leslie is back.|$|E
5|$|Paulet was {{something}} of an eccentric. On one occasion, while his ship was moored at Spithead, he asked his admiral for permission to take leave to visit London. This was refused, with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get in his barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart {{and went off to}} London anyway.|$|E
