In particular spectroscopic approaches observing volcanic {{gases in the}} ultra-violet spectral range evolved from an art to mature techniques, which are routinely applicable in automated installations. Using spatio-temporal correlation techniques also absolute <b>amouts</b> of trace gas fluxes can be determined. This is e. g. demonstrated by the NOVAC network. In addition systems operating in the infra-red (IR) spectral range have also made enormous progress. Here two varieties are in use: Absorption spectroscopy using direct sunlight and Emission spectroscopy using thermal emission from the trace constituents to be studied. Although neither of the two IR varieties is yet applicable in automated routine observation these techniques have considerable potential as well. For instance thermal emission spcetroscopy would also allow observations at night. Moreover, novel techniques for remote sensing of volcanic emissions, the SO 2 -Camera and imaging-DOAS (I-DOAS), where the I-DOAS technique trace gas distributions using the DOAS principle, came into widespread use recently.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{frontline}} of the Cold War divided North East Asia (NEA), turning former regional cooperation into military confrontation. Against this background the United Nation Development Program (UNDP) ceased the opportunity {{of the end of}} the bipolar world order to start the Tumen River Area Development Programme (TRADP), which succeeded in 1995 in bringing together the riparian states of the river, China, Russia and North Korea, plus South Korea and Mongolia, into a regime of cross-border cooperation with defined institutions and development goals. Based on the favorable situation in natural resources as well as in location, the two main goals of the TRADP were fixed as Strenghtening of the economic power of the region? and ?Development of the role of the region as eurasian Entrepot. During the programme, which ran from 1991 until 2000, the main focus was on the hardware development especially of the transportation infrastructure. The problems of reciprocal mistrust and xenophobia, different expectations of possible gains, and most important of the remains of the cold war in the region, as exemplified in the division of the Korean peninsula, did however prevent major positive developments of the area. At the end of the year 2000, the Tumen River Area added several new roads, rail connections, airports and port installations to its infrastructure. Major successes in the deepening of the interregional cooperation or the attraction of large <b>amouts</b> of Foreign Direct Investment or transcontinental cargo can unfortunately not be recorded. Structure of the dissertation: After an introduction and some methodological and technical remarks, Ch. 2 describes the economic and political development of NEA and especially the Tumen River Area. Ch. 3 shows the development of the regional transportation infrastructure and its special importance for interregional cooperation. In Ch. 4 a brief discussion of the members states of TRADP and the new geo-political role of NEA in the 90 s provides the framework for the development of the programme. Ch. 5 analyses the history of the TRADP from its beginnings in 1990 until the planned end at the end of 1999, including results in some major non-infrastructural areas, which are related in Ch. 6. TRADP was prolonged for a year, so Ch. 7 presents the developments of the year 2000, which were influenced by the restart of the innerkorean dialogue as well as by the growing criticism of TRADPs activities and lack of results by the members countries. The final Ch. 8 presents a summary of the discussion of the development of TRADP and the reasons for its failure and ends with a look at the chances and challenges of NEA in the new millenium...|$|R

40|$|Heavy metal {{pollution}} in arable land {{has been a}} serious problem in Taiwan. Many reclamation methods like acid extraction or soil removing all cost lots of money. The most of the polluted heavy metals are deposited and associated with soil amorphus and crystal iron and manganese oxides which cause the low removal efficiency in acid extracting systems. Four experiments were conducted by supplying sugar carbon source, inorganic nutrients (ammonium sulphate and monopotasium sulphate), and yeast to two multi-heavy metals polluted soils to activate soils microorganism activites to lower soil pH and Eh for reducing soil iron and manganese oxides. The {{results showed that the}} addition of sugar dramatically decreased soil pH and Eh and cuased substantial <b>amouts</b> of soil inorganic components releases including fertility components, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Mn and heavy metals, Cu, Ni, and Zn. The results showed that during the incubation soil pH can be decreased to 4. 3, and the system redox potential lowered down to - 200 mV. The removal part of Ni, Zn, and Cu even reached 83. 6 %, 66. 6 %, and 46. 7 %, respectively. All results also evidenced by the reduced of heavy metals in forms with amorphus and crystal iron and manganese oxides and increased the more removal forms such as exchangeable and acid extractable forms. The removal efficeincy was increased with the addition of inorganic nutrients in addtion to the addition of sugar. The use of yeast reduced the removal efficiency of heavy metals by the higher soil pH and Eh, and lower chelating organic acids concentrations companying companying higher acetic acid concentration. The concentration of chelating organic acids can reach: citric acid, 0. 9 mM; oxalic acid, 0. 7 mM; malic acid, 2 mM; succinic acid 21 mM, Tartaric acid 3. 2 mM. The concentration of acetic acid in treatments adding with yeast reached 40 mM, the highest concentration for no yeast treatemnts reached 20 mM. Another evidence for supporting that the increasing the release of soil inorganic components release by addtion of sugar and inorganic nutrients are the decreases of soil organic matter content and cation exchangeable capacity. Results also illustrated that the removal efficieny of heavy metals is highest in static system, follwing the shaking system, the vacuum sucking system is lowest. 早期工業發展造成重金屬污染農田是不爭的事實。以往各項工程式的重金屬污染農田復育方式，酸洗、翻轉稀釋，均要花費大量金錢。但對於台灣中部受電鍍廢水污染農地的中酸性土壤，所含之重金屬以鐵錳氧化物結合型態存在，酸洗移除不易。試以提供碳源活化土壤中微生物相，並以厭氣孵育方式促進鐵、錳還原。 	本論文以四個試驗研究：一、探討碳源、無機養分及外來酵母添加對重金屬移除效果與土壤性質變化；二、比較震盪均勻混合與靜置處理上對重金屬型態變化之差異；三、以管柱試驗模擬現地處理重金屬型態與抽出量；四、土壤微生物所代謝之有機酸產量對土壤重金屬抽出量之影響。兩種試驗土壤取自彰化縣北部兩處受多種重金屬污染農田。 	結果顯示單獨添加蔗糖及再添加無機養分皆可降低土壤pH及氧化還原電位 (Eh) ，而促進重金屬及一些無機養分溶出，無機養分磷、鉀、鈣、鎂、鐵及錳溶出量高於一般肥力測定值。土壤pH在孵育其間下降至 4. 3 ，系統也處於還原狀態 200 mV~ - 200 mV，足以使鐵錳還原。重金屬的溶出以銅、鋅及鎳最顯著經由四星期孵育分別溶出可達 46. 7 %、 66. 6 %、 83. 6 %。加入蔗糖及無機養分 (氮、磷、鉀) 之處理結果優於只添加蔗糖處理。C/N 100 與C/N 50 之配方重金屬抽出量與有機酸產量略高。震盪與靜置比較試驗中發現，靜置處理對重金屬的溶出量較高，尤其磷、鐵及錳最明顯，鋅、銅及鎳次之。主要將與無定型(AmFe) 或結晶型(CyFe) 鐵錳結合之重金屬隨孵育試驗過程釋出，或形成交換態 (EC) 等弱鍵結態。管柱試驗因氧化與還原反覆交替，其重金屬溶出量遠比密閉處理低。添加酵母菌處理其土壤pH及Eh程度低於未添加處理，其重金屬及土壤養分成分釋出量亦較低。由有機酸測定顯示添加蔗糖及無機養分具有鉗合能力之有機酸含量個別高達：citric acid, 0. 9 mM; oxalic acid, 0. 7 mM; malic acid, 2 mM; succinic acid 21 mM, Tartaric acid 3. 2 mM。添加酵母菌處理其具鉗合力有機酸濃度較低而acetic acid濃度最高可達 40 mM，未添加酵母菌處理acetic acid也可高達 20 mM。經過四週孵育發現土壤有機質及土壤陽離子交換容量也明顯降低。中文摘要……………………………………………………………… [...] .

40|$|There is a {{trend in}} the dairy {{industry}} towards the storage of bulk raw milk at refrigerated temperatures for attended periods of time before processing. This practice has the disadvantage of providing conditions favourable {{for the growth of}} psychrotrophic (cold-tolerant) microorganisms. Most raw milk psychrotrophs are heat sensitive Gram-negative bacteria, many of which produce heat-resistant extracellular proteaes. The heat-stability of these enzymes enables them to retain some activity in milk following conventional pasteurization, as well as ultra high temperature (UHT) pasteurization. The heat-resistant proteases have been implicated in such defects as the development of off-flavours, gelation and clearing of milk, and reductions in cheese yields. [...] The heat-stable extracellular proteases of six psychrotrophic pseudomonads isolated from raw milk were purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography using CBZ-DL-phenylalanine TETA Sepharose- 4 B. The yields of purified enzymes were 38 to 59 % before concentration by ultrafiltration. The molecular weights, which were determined by gel-filtration, were 38 to 40 kD, and the proteins had isoelectric points (pI) from 5. 7 to 6. 2. The optimum pH for proteolytic activity was between 7 and 8, while the optimum temperature ranged from 30 to 40 °C. A dramatic loss of activity was noted for each protease at 45 °C. [...] Each of the proteases were metalloproteases as indicated by their sensitivity to the metal chelating agent EDTA. Restoration of activity to EDTA-treatcd proteases was achieved by the addition of Mg, Mn or Ca ions. The predominant metal ion present in the three proteases examined was Ca (5 - 8 g-atoms/mole) followed by Mg and Zn, with trace <b>amouts</b> of Mn. The amino acid content of each of the proteases were similar, with high numbers of aspartic acid, serine, glycine, and alanine residues. The N-terminal amino acid determined for three of the proteases was found to be threonine. The T 16 protease contained two aminosugars, glucosamine and galactosamine, and was classified as a glycoprotein. [...] Five of the six proteases exhibited a preference for α-casein as a protein substrate, while T 16 showed greatest activity towards κ-casein. None of the proteases was able to break down the whey proteins, α-lactalbumin, or β-lactoglobulin. Collagenase and elastase activities were noted for each protease. The T 16 protease was quite stable, with a D-value at 150 °C of 2. 2 min. The presence of Ca or Mg ions stabilized the T 16 protease against inactivation at 90 °C for 10 min while lactose had no effect. The secondary structure of the T 16 protease consisted of "random coil" (67 %) and β-structure(33 %) with no α-helix. Upon heating from 45 to 55 °C the secondary structure-tended to become more random. [...] All of the proteases cross-reacted with the anti-serum to the T 16 protease, including the protease of psychrotrophic pseudomonads from Ontario, British Columbia, Ireland, U. S. A., Australia and the Neterlands. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed using anti-Tl 6 IgG, which was sensitive to a minimum concentration of 720 μg/ml of purified T 16 protease.

40|$|A new {{technology}} for fabrication of joints {{based on the}} principle of isothermal solidification is presented. Diffusion soldering has a relatively low cost since a small <b>amout</b> of material is used and a small energy consumption is involved due to the low fabrication temperature. This preliminary study contributes to the search of new alternatives technically and economically viable to replace the use of aggressive materials for the environment such as lead as solder material and fluxes and solvent constituted by CFC. Indium as joint material is used to interconnect Cu pieces. The features of the intermetallics formed make possible the fabrication of thermally and mechanically stable bonds...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA kind {{of novel}} high {{temperature}} resistance water shutoff agent with high viscosity was synthesized using sulfonated tannin extract as main agent, paraformaldehyde as crosslinking agent, polyhydric phenol as stabilizer, urea as tackifier. Then {{the effects of}} <b>amout</b> of the components, pH and salinity on the gel performance of water shutoff agent were determined. The results have show that the gelling time and strength of resulting products are 48 h and 78 KPa under the conditions of sulfonated tannin extract 10 g, hydroquinone 3 g, paraformaldehyde 1. 2 g, urea 1. 4 g, pH = 7, salinity of 3000 mg/L, according with the demand of fieldwork...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Pangang Group {{developed}} {{production process}} of low cost medium-Ti Q 345 B. And {{the influence of}} N content on the precipitation of Ti was researched. Theoretically, the optimum N content for medium-Ti Q 345 B should be within 50 ppm. Then industrial production of Q 345 B with two different N contents was carried out. The results implicated that the microstructure, yield strength and elongation of Q 345 B met the requirements when N content was within 50 ppm; and when N content went beyond 50 ppm, trace of bainite microstructure appeared, the elongation {{was close to the}} lower limit, and microscale TiN were observed in large <b>amout</b> under SEM...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A gear {{microscopic}} surface pitting lubrication {{model was}} established, {{and the oil}} condition of it was introduced. Based on the multi-grid method, a numerical solution of spur gear oil condition lubrication was obtained. The result show that with the provided oil film thickness increases, the film thickness of the meshing point also increases. However, when it is added to a certain degree, the film thickness will no longer change, the phenomenon is worthy of discussion. The result shows that lack oil lubrication is detrimental to the gear, {{but it will not}} be better as the <b>amout</b> of oil adds, there exists a critical point...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, due to {{the support}} of our country, PV-storage {{microgrid}} develops rapidly. However, the flexible network operation modes of PV-storage microgrid change flexibly and the operating characteristics with a large <b>amout</b> of sources is highly complicated. Based on the existing microgrid coordinate control methods, this paper proposes multilayer PV-storage microgrid algorithm for fitting dispatch of distributed network, which achieves maximum output of renewable energy when meeting the scheduling requirements of network, by building PV-storage microgrid type dynamic simulation system {{in a variety of}} conditions in PSCAD. Simulation results show that the heuristic algorithm proposed can achieve microgrid stable operation and satisfy the demands of the dispatch in distributed network...|$|E
