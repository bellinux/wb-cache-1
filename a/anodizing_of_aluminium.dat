An increased local film thickness is associated with an increased local electrode temperature. It was found that the higher the local temperature, the greater the local film thickness. This is explained by considering thermal enhancement of the field-assisted oxide dissolution at the pore bases, which necessitates a local current density rise to maintain the local anodizing equilibrium.

40|$|Abstract. High {{strength}} {{aluminium alloys}} {{are widely used}} in the civil and military aerospace industry due to their low weight and high mechanical properties, achieved by selected alloying elements and heat treatments. The resulting multiphase alloy system, a solid solution of alloying elements in the aluminium matrix {{and a variety of}} second phase material, requires specific anticorrosion measures in order to prevent localized corrosion, which is promoted by microgalvanic coupling between the different metallographic phases. Traditionally, the anticorrosion performances are achieved by chromic acid anodizing (CAA), followed by painting. However, environmental issues and associated costs for the disposal of chromate wastes, require the development of new approaches for <b>anodizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloys. In this work, the potential for tailoring the porous anodic film morphology through the film thickness by controlled variations of the anodizing potential is inspected.

Oxide layers of different thicknesses were created on all three experimental materials. Aluminium was anodized in a bath of 10 % H 2 SO 4, magnesium in the bath of 1 mol/dm 3 NaOH, and zinc in the bath of 0. 5 mol/dm 3 NaOH. Processes were carried out at laboratory temperature.

When using lower current of 0. 08 and 0. 2 A for magnesium anodizing, dark colored layer was created comparing to higher current of 0. 5 A. More rough appearance of the oxide layer was produced with increasing voltage. Further, it was observed for magnesium that the resulting layer comprises of two sublayers. For zinc, black colored layer was created when the voltage 20 V and current from 0. 4 to 0. 5 A were used. In the layer, two sublayers were also observed.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to reveal the processing differences in achieving nanoporous anodized aluminium from aluminium alloys and their application for cobalt nanowires electrodeposition. The following types <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> were tested: pure Al (99. 99 %), commercial AA 1050 alloy, commercial 6082 alloy and commercial 6060 alloy. Because of the differences in the surface temperature and high voltages during the anodizing steps, some stresses can be built up in the material. Therefore a strict temperature control should be was done to limit thermal stresses in materials. Alloying elements (Si, Mg) cause precipitates that are observed on the surface, especially for 6060 alloy. Nevertheless, a nanoporous structure can be obtained at the end of second anodization step on all aluminium alloys investigated.

As a result of these structural changes, a switch in the magnetic easy axis, from parallel to perpendicular to the NWs axis, occurs depending on the applied potential.

40|$|The {{growth of}} barrier-type anodic alumina films formed by {{anodizing}} relatively rough substrates {{has been shown}} to proceed by high field ionic conduction. As a result of the ionic transport and the induced plasticity, smoothing of the oxide surfaces and the metal/oxide interfaces arises.

Recently, the development of porous anodic alumina has been demonstrated to proceed by coupled ionic migration and material flow resulting from the field-induced mechanical stress. For rough metal surfaces, the electric field distribution is non-uniform across the specimen surface. Considering the square-dependence of the electrostrictive stress on the electric field and the distribution of the electric field across surface, a significant gradient of mechanical stress may arise across the anodic oxide layer during anodizing. As a result, stress-driven transport may participate, in addition to high field ionic conduction, to the smoothing of the specimen surface.
