5|$|In the 2008 general election, Gibbs faced Republican Don Ytterberg, {{whom he had}} outraised roughly $80,000 to $50,000 by mid-October.

A vast Roman temple in the Corinthian order is penetrated by a cross range articulated with pilasters in very low relief.

Weiss, in turn, was gunned down shortly {{thereafter}} {{by members of the}} Louisiana State Police acting as Long's bodyguards. His alleged motivation for the attack was that his father-in-law, Judge Benjamin Pavy, was going to be gerrymandered out of office by Long. Long lingered for two days at the nearby Our Lady of the Lake Hospital before he died on September10. His body lay in state <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Capitol</b> where approximately 100,000peoplesome {{from as far away as}} Arkansas, Mississippi and Texaspaid their respects.

However, he found it very difficult to adapt to campaigning via television, an increasingly important medium, and his attacks mostly fell flat.|$|E
