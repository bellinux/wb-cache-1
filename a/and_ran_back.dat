5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered his men who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When his men {{reached the top of the}} hill and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> down the hill.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the ban on}} {{privately owned}} diesel {{locomotives}} operating on BR tracks, railway enthusiasts {{did not have to}} wait that long after the final withdrawal of the class to see a Deltic back on the mainline. Following participation in the hastily arranged 'Farewell to the Deltics' open day at British Rail Engineering Limited's Doncaster Works on 27 February 1982, 55 002 left Doncaster under its own power <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> up the ECML to the National Railway Museum light engine; it was to be some years before a Deltic was officially allowed to run again on the mainline.|$|E
25|$|Cynthia Ann's brother John Richard Parker was ransomed back in 1842 {{along with}} his cousin, James Pratt Plummer. He was unable to adapt to white society <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> to the Comanche. He later was left to die after he {{contracted}} smallpox during a Comanche raid into Mexico. The war party left a captive Mexican girl to care for him, and he restored her to her family after recovering, and spent {{the remainder of his}} life in Old Mexico after marrying her. During the American Civil War, he served in a Mexican Company within the Confederate Army. He later lived as stockman and rancher in Mexico, where he died in 1915.|$|E

25|$|Grigg intercepted <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> briefly {{towards his}} own line to link with his colleagues and {{to clear the}} onrushing Scots... It was obvious from the stand as soon as Ella {{received}} the ball that, provided Campese and Steve Tuynman could exchange passes out on the left, a try was on... Ella gave Campese room and Tuynman hung about waiting to play his part. Campese drew the last serious defender to him, flicked the ball to Tuynman and moved into place for the return. It worked like a dream and there was Campese with half the pitch to run and only John Beattie near him. Beattie did well to stay the same three metres behind Campese as they hurtled down the touchline, {{but there was never}} a doubt that Campese would score...Campese's effort won the try-of-the-tour award from the brewers.|$|E
25|$|The Tigers {{had their}} first shutout {{of the season in}} week four, when they {{traveled}} to the Orange Bowl and defeated the Miami Hurricanes, 41–0. On its first possession LSU drove down to the Miami 49-yard line, where a pass from Rabb was intercepted <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> to the LSU 42-yard line. The Hurricanes went three-and-out on their offensive possession and attempted a field goal, but the kick was short. After punts by both teams, the Tigers scored their first touchdown of the game on a 51-yard run by Don Purvis. Miami was forced to punt on the first play of the second quarter and it was downed at the LSU 5-yard line. LSU was also forced to punt, but the Hurricanes fumbled on the return and the Tigers recovered it at Miami's 27-yard line. After a first down run by Cannon, Rabb threw a touchdown pass to Billy Hendrix to make the score 13–0 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|At daybreak, {{the signal}} was given from the fort {{and all three}} Portuguese forces {{assaulted}} the Dutch position. On the right flank, Vicente attacked along the coast. When the Dutch fired a cannon volley, almost all the Kaffirs {{and some of the}} Lascarins abandoned the fight <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>back.</b> The rest of them continued the charge and captured the rampart with two cannons. The Dutch captain, Marte, was killed in this battle and his units withdrew towards the beach. Some of them were heading for the three launches that were tied up on the beach, but the Portuguese reached them first and cast them adrift, preventing the Dutch from escaping. After receiving reinforcements, Dutch troops reorganized and counterattacked the rampart now held by Portuguese. Although the Portuguese held their position, they suffered many casualties including two of their captains and two ensigns. Gradually the Dutch gained the upper hand and Portuguese forces started to withdraw. The commander of Galle, Lourenço Ferreira de Brito, observed the situation from the fort and came to their aid with a detachment under Bartolomeu d’Eça. With fresh troops the Portuguese regained the rampart while Lourenço Ferreira retired back to the fort with the wounded.|$|E

In 2004 {{he said he was}} still suffering the effects of the attack, which the police regard as attempted murder, including poor hearing and eyesight, epileptic fits, and a memory so poor that he was left unable to read a book or drive. A third constable, Michael Shepherd, had his protective helmet pierced by an iron spike. Several of the officers and firemen turned <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> toward the crowd to try to save Blakelock and Coombes. Trevor Stratford told a reporter in 2010: [...] "I remember running in with another fire officer to get Dick Coombes. I literally slid into the group, like a rugby player charging into a ruck.

The defence line at The Nek was now defended by nine New Zealanders, under the command of a sergeant; they had three machine-guns but the crews had all been killed or wounded. As the survivors arrived from Baby 700 their numbers rose to around sixty. Bridges in his divisional headquarters starting receiving messages from the front; just after 17:00 Lieutenant-Colonel George Braund on Walker's Ridge advised he was holding his position and [...] "if reinforced could advance". At 17:37 Maclagen reported they were being [...] "heavily attacked", at 18:15 the 3rd Battalion signalled, [...] "3rd Brigade being driven back". At 19:15 from Maclagen again [...] "4th Brigade urgently required". Bridges sent two hundred stragglers, from several different battalions, to reinforce Braund and promised two extra battalions from the New Zealand and Australian Division which was now coming ashore.|$|E
500|$|June's 2004 season {{had been}} {{described}} as average, and he was considered likely to lose his starting assignment in a battle with Gardner and Kendyll Pope in 2005. [...] Pope was suspended for the season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. June beat Gardner for the starting position, although some speculate that he won the job due to Gardner's injury {{at the end of}} training camp. June recorded an interception that he ran back for a touchdown in {{the first game of the}} season against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday Night Football. On October 9, he recorded two interceptions <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> one for a touchdown to help Indianapolis reach a 50 record with a 283 victory over the San Francisco 49ers. [...] The following week on Monday Night Football, June recorded two more interceptions, one of which changed the momentum of the game because quarterback Marc Bulger was injured trying to chase June. Both interceptions led to touchdowns as the Colts beat the St. Louis Rams 170. After six games, June was the NFL leader in interceptions, but he was diagnosed with a sports hernia. June's fast start prompted talk of him breaking the all-time NFL linebacker single-season interception record of eight and being the first linebacker to lead the league since 1959. In a game that was considered a bad performance by the Colts despite its victorious result, June had a season-high fourteen tackles to help the Colts raise their record to 90 in a 3117 victory over the Houston Texans. June sat out the December 11 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, which resulted in the Colts raising their record to 130, clinching their third straight AFC South title, a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. [...] There was great speculation about whether June and other injured players would rest up for the 2005–06 NFL playoffs or whether the team would attempt to post the first perfect 160 regular season. [...] June was able to play, but the Colts lost their next game on December 18 to fall to 131. After being named to the 2006 Pro Bowl during the following week, June was listed as inactive for the 15th game of the season and did not travel with the team to Seattle. He also sat out the final game of the season. After the conclusion of the regular season, June was selected as a first time Pro Bowl starter at linebacker. In the opening round of the playoffs, the Colts forced a fumble by Jerome Bettis that was nearly run back for a winning touchdown in the final minute of play, but Ben Roethlisberger made a game-saving tackle on Nick Harper for the Pittsburgh Steelers's 2118 victory. Gary Brackett forced the fumble, although at least one source credited June with the tackle. [...] June also had an interception and four solo tackles in the loss. June was named second-team All-Pro at outside linebacker. Despite missing three games due to injury, June finished third on the team with 109tackles and led the team with 5interceptions. He was also the team's nominee for the Ed Block Courage Award in 2005.|$|E

In a memorable scene, Harrison collapsed in the endzone and spent several minutes regaining his breath as his teammates celebrated. It was the longest play in Super Bowl history (surpassing Desmond Howard's 99-yard kickoff return in Super Bowl XXXI, being broken by Jacoby Jones in 2013 with a 108-yard kickoff return) and helped the Steelers defeat the Arizona Cardinals 27–23.

2500|$|The {{last two}} V8's, the T and the 100hp were not successful. [...] Though tested, they never flew. [...] The type T {{introduced}} steel cylinders {{and was an}} overhead-valve engine with vertically mounted valves operated from a central camshaft by thin pull rods and rockers. [...] The carburettor was mounted centrally at the front, feeding a central tube which ran {{to the back of}} the engine, divided <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> along each cylinder bank. Dual magneto/coil and battery ignition was provided. [...] The 100hp engine was also an overhead-valve engine in the sense that the port opened directly into the cylinder head, though the valves were mounted horizontally. [...] This arrangement required an unusual shape of combustion chamber but enabled the valves to be operated directly from a central crankshaft raised on pillars to cylinder head height. Vibrations of this crankshaft and weakness of a new cylinder head restraint system dogged the engine, the last E.N.V. made.|$|E
