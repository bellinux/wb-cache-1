2500|$|The {{first flight}} {{was made at}} Larkhill on 23 February 1914 by Busteed {{and it was then}} {{exhibited}} at the March 1914 Aero Show at Olympia in London. After more flying at Larkhill the prototype, later referred to as the Scout A, was returned to the factory at Filton and fitted with larger wings, increasing the chord by six inches (15cm) and the span from 22ft (6.71m) to 24ft 7in (7.49m). These were rigged with an increased dihedral of °. [...] Other changes included a larger rudder, a new open-fronted cowling with six external stiffening ribs distributed in symmetrically uneven angles around the cowl's sides (especially when seen from [...] "nose-on") and fabric panel-covered wheels. [...] It was evaluated by the British military on 14 May 1914 at Farnborough, when, flown by Busteed, the aircraft achieved an airspeed of 97.5mph (157km/h), with a stalling speed of 40mph (64kph) The aircraft was then entered for the 1914 Aerial Derby but did not take part because the weather {{on the day of the}} race was so poor that Bristol did not wish to risk the aircraft. By this time two more examples (works nos. 229 and 230) were under construction and the prototype was sold to Lord Carbery for £400 without its engine. [...] Carbery fitted it with an 80hp Le Rhône 9C nine-cylinder rotary and entered it in the London–Manchester race held on 20 June but damaged the aircraft when landing at Castle Bromwich and had to withdraw. After repairs, including a modification of the undercarriage to widen the track, Carbury entered it in the London–Paris–London race held on 11 July but had to ditch the aircraft in the English Channel on the return leg; while in France, only one of the two fuel tanks had been filled by mistake. Carbury managed to land <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> and escaped but the aircraft was lost.|$|E

I can keep a lookout as well as any man out of home ports, but I hate to be {{circumvented}} by muffled oars and such ungentlemanlike tricks. Yacht officer--indeed. These seas must be full of such yachtsmen. I consider you played a mean trick on me. I told my old man there was nothing in sight at sunset--and no more there was. I believe you blundered upon us by chance--for all your boasting about sunsets and bearings. Gammon! I know you came on blindly on top of us, and with muffled oars, too. D'ye call that decent?" ...|$|E
50|$|On early Mercury flights, a {{helicopter}} attached a cable to the capsule, lifted {{it from the}} water and delivered it to a nearby ship. This was changed after the sinking of Liberty Bell 7. All later Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules had a flotation collar (similar to a rubber life raft) attached to the spacecraft to increase their buoyancy. The spacecraft would then be brought <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> and lifted onto deck by crane.|$|E

25|$|Historically, two supply <b>ships,</b> <b>a</b> {{freighter}} and a tanker, {{arrive at}} the ice pier each summer, after an icebreaker opens <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> channel through pack ice. The ice pier’s key function {{is to provide a}} platform for freight trucks to come <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> supply <b>ship</b> to receive or offload cargo. Steel cables attached to shoreline hold the dock in a fixed position.|$|R
5000|$|This {{officer is}} engaged {{on his second}} tour of {{operational}} flying. As flight commander he has displayed outstanding enthusiasm and keenness, which has proved a source of inspiration. Undeterred by enemy opposition, he always presses home his attacks with the utmost skill and determination. Recently, over Benghazi, his aircraft was held in searchlight beams and subjected to accurate anti-aircraft fire. Despite this, he made another run over the area and released his bombs <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> moored in the outer Mole. On another occasion, in similar circumstances, at Martuba, Squadron Leader Blackburn bombed the landing ground, starting three fires. His efficiency is of a high standard.|$|E
5000|$|Later, Sea Scouts were {{introduced}} within the Baden-Powell Boy Scouts organization. In {{the first edition}} of 'Scouting for Boys', Baden-Powell mentioned that [...] "A Scout should be able to manage a boat, to bring it properly <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> or pier....". In December 1908, the first Seamanship badge was issued {{as one of the first}} 'Efficiency' badges. A camp for Scouts was held at Bucklers Hard, Hampshire in August 1909 at which boating activities were a focus. In 1911, Baden-Powell wrote the booklet Sea Scouting for Boys. Warington Baden-Powell wrote Sea Scouting and Seamanship for Boys in 1912, with a foreword by Robert Baden-Powell. A special uniform for Sea Scouts was approved in 1910 and, in 1912, the name [...] "Sea Scouts" [...] was officially adopted within Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts Association.|$|E
5000|$|In the 19th century, mines {{were called}} torpedoes, a name {{probably}} conferred by Robert Fulton after the torpedo fish, which gives powerful electric shocks. A spar torpedo was a mine {{attached to a}} long pole and detonated when the ship carrying it rammed another one and withdrew a safe distance. The submarine [...] used one to sink [...] on 17 February 1864. A Harvey torpedo was a type of floating mine towed <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship,</b> and was briefly in service in the Royal Navy in the 1870s. Other [...] "torpedoes" [...] were attached to ships or propelled themselves. One such weapon, called the Whitehead torpedo after its inventor, caused the word [...] "torpedo" [...] to apply to self-propelled underwater missiles {{as well as to}} static devices. These mobile devices were also known as [...] "fish torpedos".|$|E
50|$|Naval {{boarding}} {{is to come}} up against, or <b>alongside,</b> <b>an</b> enemy <b>ship</b> {{to attack}} by placing men aboard the enemy ship. The goal of boarding is to capture, or destroy, the enemy vessel. Larger ships carried specially trained and equipped sailors, or marines, as boarders.|$|R

40|$|The Following thesis {{describes}} the work which was {{undertaken in the}} conception, development, {{and the construction of}} an open sea towed vehicle used to deploy a wide range of oceanographic monitoring equipment. This streamlined submersible vehicle, is towed <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> or small vessel, and remains slightly buoyant at all times, but once it is moving it uses its wings which are configured upside-down with respect to those on an aircraft to pull it down to depth and move it away from the towing vessels wake and wave system, while assuring lateral stability. The Preliminary design requirement called for a light, robust, stable, simple, and low cost platform able to operate in a close to rough sea surface, and can be worked from a relatively small vessels such as those used for surveys of estuaries and coastal. During the design phase of this project, tools such as parametric feature based solid modelling, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis were employed to provide a solution to the problem. A prototype was built using CADCAM technology, and strong composite materials...|$|E
50|$|On 1 November Nile {{captured}} the French privateer Renard off Folkestone. Lieutenant Whitehead was again sick on shore so Nile {{was under the}} command of Mr. Butcher. Renard was armed with two 3-pounder guns, and had a crew of 13 men {{under the command of}} Michael Bernard Hamelin. She had left Calais at 4pm the previous afternoon and when she was captured she was <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> merchant <b>ship.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In New Orleans, Route 33 was {{designated}} to follow <b>an</b> existing road <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> <b>shipping</b> canal from South Carrollton Avenue {{to an area}} on Lake Pontchartrain known as West End.

[...] However, the entire route along the lakeshore and on to Ponchatoula existed only on paper. [...] North of Ponchatoula, {{the remainder of the}} route would have the benefit of following existing roads through the higher terrain there. [...] The construction of the lakeshore highway was intended to provide a direct land connection between New Orleans and Hammond while taking advantage of the scenic beauty of Lake Pontchartrain and the surrounding swampland. [...] In addition, the man-made embankment required to carry the road would serve as a levee to prevent lake water from inundating the extensive residential development envisioned to line the highway.|$|R

5000|$|Edward {{sent his}} ships against the French fleet in units of three, two ships crammed with archers and one full of men-at-arms. The English ships with the archers would come <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> French <b>ship</b> and rain arrows {{down on its}} decks, the men-at-arms would then board and take the vessel. The English archers, with their long bows, could {{accurately}} shoot 20 arrows per minute at a range of up to 300 yards m, whereas the Genoese crossbowmen could only manage two.|$|R
50|$|One {{hour after}} the first patrol boat had sortied, a Soviet-built Nanuchka-type patrol craft began heading out into the Gulf of Sidra. Intruders from VA-34 and Saratogas VA-85 {{attacked}} with Rockeye cluster bombs, but the craft sought refuge <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> neutral merchant <b>ship,</b> and avoided destruction.

50|$|Sydney entered {{port for}} the final time in February 2015, but {{remained}} commissioned as <b>an</b> <b>alongside</b> training <b>ship</b> until 7 November. In May 2017, having not received any offers to convert the hull {{for use as a}} dive wreck, Sydney was sold for scrap.|$|R
50|$|Late in 1961, Antares {{received}} an additional mission {{when she was}} designated <b>a</b> support <b>ship</b> for fleet ballistic missile submarines deployed abroad, and she spent October and November 1961 receiving additional modifications at Norfolk Naval Shipyard and at Charleston, South Carolina, to enable her {{to carry out this}} additional duty. Between January and May 1962, she operated out of Norfolk, Virginia, conducting stores ship training and participating in a multiship exercise in the West Indies. In June 1962, she loaded supplies at Charleston and then steamed to Scotland on her first resupply voyage to the fleet ballistic missile base at Holy Loch. She returned to Norfolk on 25 July 1962 and then conducted local operations and went <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> repair <b>ship</b> for repairs.|$|R
50|$|Apache left Guam on 3 August 1944 {{and served}} in the Tulagi area for two weeks before {{beginning}} repairs <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> repair <b>ship</b> at Noumea on 20 August 1944. She operated out of Noumea through late September 1944 and departed for Auckland, New Zealand, on 23 October 1944. After a brief rest and recreation period at Auckland, Apache returned to Noumea on 8 November 1944 and operated there {{for more than a}} month. On 12 December 1944, she got underway for Hollandia, New Guinea. After two days in port there, she departed for Leyte in the Philippine Islands, and operated there through the end of 1944.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} Roman naval battles against Carthage {{also emphasized}} boarding. Since the Romans were primarily a land-based army, {{they could not}} effectively combat the Carthaginian navy, and subsequently lost several sea battles. The corvus, a boarding ramp with two steel spikes, was the Roman answer to this problem. Roman sailors piloted their <b>ship</b> <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> Carthaginian <b>ship,</b> dropped the corvus from one deck to the other, and sent their soldiers across the board, assaulting the ship. The Carthaginian navy, unprepared for this [...] "land combat" [...] on the oceans, lost several ships to this tactic. This invention secured Roman naval dominance in the Mediterranean Sea for several centuries.|$|R
25|$|Sydney sailed {{into her}} namesake {{city for the}} final time on 27 February 2015. Despite flying a {{decommissioning}} pennant, the ship was not paid off until 7 November 2015; two years later than originally expected. In the interim, she was moored at Fleet Base East as <b>an</b> <b>alongside</b> training <b>ship.</b>|$|R
50|$|Worley’s ship New York's Revenge was sailing <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> second larger <b>ship</b> under captain John Cole called New York Revenge’s Revenge. Cole’s {{ship had}} been the {{prisoner}} transport Eagle, captured by Worley off Virginia the previous month. Johnson's four ships split up and chased them down separately, capturing Cole some hours after Worley when Cole tried to flee the battle. Cole's ship was still carrying prisoners, including 36 women destined top be sold into indentured servitude.|$|R
50|$|Halibut {{arrived at}} Pearl Harbor on 1 December. It was quickly {{determined}} that her damage was too extensive to justify repair.

50|$|The New Orleans-Hammond Lakeshore Highway {{had been}} planned for several years when, in 1921, it was {{designated}} as part of State Route 33, {{one of the original}} 98 routes in the pre-1955 state highway system. Route No. 33. Beginning at South Carrollton Avenue and New Basin Canal New Orleans, both sides of the New Basin Canal as far as the Cemeteries, thence on the West side of the New Basin Canal to West End thence along the shore of Lake Pontchartrain, through La Branche, Ruddock, Straddersic, Ponchatoula, Hammond, Amite, Kentwood, to a point on the Mississippi State line. 1921 legislative route description In New Orleans, Route 33 was designated to follow <b>an</b> existing road <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> <b>shipping</b> canal from South Carrollton Avenue to an area on Lake Pontchartrain known as West End.

5000|$|The bowhook handles lines forward {{when the}} boat is coming <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> pier or <b>ship.</b> The bowhook also tends fenders and forward weather cloths (canvases spread for {{protection}} against the wind). In an open boat, the bowhook usually sits on the forward thwart (cross seat) on the starboard side, outboard. In bad weather, she or he may move to the lee side. The bowhook faces the bow {{and serves as a}} lookout. If the boat is decked over, the bowhook stands on the starboard after deck facing forward.|$|R
25|$|Nelson's {{plan was}} for the British ships to {{approach}} the weaker, {{southern end of the}} Danish defences in a line parallel to the Danish one. <b>As</b> the foremost <b>ship</b> drew <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> Danish <b>ship,</b> it would anchor and engage that ship. The remainder of the line would pass outside the engagement until the next British ship drew alongside the next Danish ship, and so on. The frigate , together with small gun-brigs, would rake the Danish line from the south, and a force of frigates, commanded by Captain Edward Riou of , would attack the northern end of the line. Troops would land and assault the Tre Kroner fortress once the fleet had subdued the Danish line of ships. Bomb vessels would sit outside the British line and bombard the Danes by firing over it. Should the British be unable to subdue the stronger, northern defences, the destruction of the southern ships would be enough to allow the bomb vessels to approach within range of the city and force negotiations to prevent the bombardment of the city.|$|R
2500|$|Boreas was {{commissioned}} {{for the first}} time in August 1757 under Captain Robert Boyle, who was to command her for the next two years. Her rigging and fitout were completed by September and she was sailed to Portsmouth to take on her guns. Flaws in her design were apparent even at this early stage; in December 1757 Captain Boyle advised Admiralty that the fir planks adjacent to the hatchways were already badly worn, as were the strakes along the hull. Boyle unsuccessfully recommended that the hatchway timbers and the hull be re-covered with elm. He also observed that the aft hatchway had been constructed directly above the entrance to the magazine, which [...] "may be of fatal consequence in time of action." [...] Further, the sides of the vessel above the level of the deck were too low, leaving the crew exposed to enemy fire should Boreas run <b>alongside</b> <b>an</b> opposing <b>ship.</b>|$|R
60|$|The patriot fleet now {{numbered}} twenty-five vessels {{against the}} thirty Spaniards, {{most of which}} were greatly superior in size to their opponents. The Dutch at once maneuvered to come to close quarters, and the Spaniards, who had far less confidence in themselves by sea than on land, very speedily began to draw out of the fight. The Good Venture and a Dutch craft had laid themselves <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> large Spanish <b>ship,</b> and boarded her from both sides. Ned and Peters, followed by the English sailors, clambered on board near the stern, while the Dutch fishermen, most of whom were armed with heavy axes, boarded at the waist.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the war and the start of the Siege of Boston, British authorities enlisted the assistance of a loyalist merchant, named Ichabod Jones, to aid in the acquisition of needed supplies. Two of Jones' merchant ships arrived in Machias on June 2, 1775, accompanied by a British armed sloop called the Margaretta (sometimes also spelled Margueritta or Marguerite) that was commanded by Midshipman James Moore. The townspeople of Machias disapproved of Jones' intentions and arrested him. They also tried to arrest Moore, but he escaped through the harbor. The townspeople seized one of Jones' <b>ships,</b> armed it <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> second local <b>ship,</b> and sailed out to meet Moore. After a short confrontation, Moore was fatally wounded, and his vessel and crew were captured.|$|R

5|$|Sabotage {{operations}} were ordered from Berlin {{in the late}} autumn of 1940, but actual work did not start until early 1941. The first {{operations were}} unsuccessful. A first attempt to smuggle a bomb into Gibraltar was aborted, as the timing device was faulty. In February {{there was a large}} explosion in the North Tunnel, and in April a bomb blew up near the airfield. In June 1941, however, the British intelligence foiled a new attempt, by a German agent, to attach <b>a</b> mine <b>alongside</b> <b>an</b> Allied cargo <b>ship.</b> Another attempt failed when Plazas placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive. It was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed. In January 1942, two Spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the North Front landing strip.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of inception, the Coast Guard contributed {{seventeen}} 82-foot Point-class cutters while the Navy added approximately fifty ships known as fast patrol craft (PCFs) or Swifts that could reach a maximum speed of 28 knots. On 16 April 1965 United States Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze requested Coast Guard assistance with Market Time. On 6 May 1965 seventeen Point-class cutters were loaded as deck cargo on merchant ships in New York City, Norfolk, New Orleans, Galveston, San Pedro, San Francisco, and Seattle for transport to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay. At Subic Bay each cutter was armed with an 81 mm mortar and five [...]50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns. Coast Guard Squadron One was organized into Division Eleven with eight cutters and Division Twelve with nine cutters. Division Twelve sailed on 15 July 1965 and arrived at Đà Nẵng on 20 July. Division Eleven sailed on 20 July and arrived at An Thoi on 31 July. Nine additional cutters formed Division Thirteen at Vũng Tàu in early 1966. Each cutter with an eleven-man crew would spend four days on patrol followed by two days <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> support <b>ship.</b> All 26 cutters were turned over to South Vietnamese crews between 16 May 1969 and 15 August 1970.|$|R
5000|$|In 1340 the French put {{together}} an invasion fleet containing French, Castillian and Genoese ships. The 400 or so ships were squeezed into the Zwyn estuary.The English had no purpose-built warships, so had {{to make do with}} deep-draught, round-hulled merchant ships, known as cogs, that were converted for naval duties. Edward assembled a combined fleet at Orwell, in Kent and set up his headquarters on the cog Thomas [...] Although he knew that the French fleet was a far superior force to his own he sailed with his fleet on 22 June 1340 to confront the French fleet a day later. The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of Sluys, possibly trying to prevent Edward from landing his army. The English fleet apparently tricked the French into believing they were withdrawing. However, when the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. Edward sent his ships against the French fleet in units of three, two ships crammed with archers and one full of men-at-arms. Because the ships of the French fleet were so close together it limited their maneuverability. The English ships with the archers would come <b>alongside</b> <b>a</b> French <b>ship</b> and rain arrows down on its decks, the men-at-arms would then just mop up. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in {{what became known as the}} Battle of Sluys. England dominated the English Channel for the rest of the war, preventing French invasions.|$|R
