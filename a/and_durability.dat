A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it {{was found to be}} unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost <b>and</b> <b>durability</b> grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength <b>and</b> <b>durability</b> grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made.|$|E

5|$|After several modifications, {{the first}} {{production}} variants of the PV-12 were completed in 1936. The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire. The Merlin remains most {{closely associated with}} the Spitfire and Hurricane, although the majority of the production run was for the four-engined Avro Lancaster heavy bomber. A series of rapidly applied developments, brought about by wartime needs, markedly improved the engine's performance <b>and</b> <b>durability.</b> Starting at 1,000hp for the first production models, most late war versions produced just under 1,800hp, and the very latest version as used in the de Havilland Hornet over 2,000hp. Lancasters were known to fly entire missions with their engines running at full power with no ill effects.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power <b>and</b> <b>durability</b> of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|However, wall {{construction}} continued {{regardless of}} court politics during this time. The Ordos walls underwent extension, elaboration, and repair {{well into the}} 16th century. Brick and stone started to replace tamped earth as the wall building material, because they offered better protection <b>and</b> <b>durability.</b> This change in material {{gave rise to a}} number of necessary accommodations with regard to logistics, and inevitably a drastic increase in costs. Instead of being able to draw on local resources, building projects now required brick-kilns, quarries, and transportation routes to deliver bricks to the work site. Also, masons had to be hired since the local peasantry proved inadequate for the level of sophistication that brick constructions required. Work that originally could be done by one man in a month with earth now required 100 men to do in stone.|$|E

In late 1915, he was seriously injured in a mishap at a flying demonstration in Abilene, Texas, and thereafter the barnstormer devoted most of his time to architecture and design. He also took some time off beginning in 1917 when America entered the First World War – for nearly two years, he served as chief inspector of aircraft at the nation's first military aviation research and development center, McCook Field in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Sex-positive feminist writer Susie Bright {{called the}} Magic Wand {{one of her}} two {{favorite}} vibrators, and called it a miracle that the device {{was able to bring}} about a orgasm in under sixty seconds.

Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which brought to mind objects featured in the Mütter Museum.

5|$|Casey {{returned}} to Washington, D.C. in October 1940 to become {{chief of the}} Design and Engineering Section in the Construction Division of the Office of the Quartermaster General, under Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell. An enormous construction program was underway {{to meet the needs}} of World War II. Working with a staff that included George Bergstrom, a former president of the American Institute of Architects, Casey set about revising the standard designs for barracks. A number of new features were added to improve comfort, safety, <b>and</b> <b>durability.</b> Substitutions were made for scarce materials. It was discovered that the standard 63-man barracks was now too small. Of the 81 companies in the new triangular division, 51 fitted more easily into 74-man barracks. By slightly increasing the barracks size, substantial savings were made by reducing the overall number of buildings that needed to be constructed, the size of the cantonment areas required, and the length of required roads and utility lines. Casey was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 8 April 1941.|$|E

Increasing MB value does not negatively affect compressive strength of C 30 CSC but decreases compressive strength of C 60 CSC <b>and</b> frost <b>durability</b> of CSC, <b>and</b> the reduction is more pronounced when MB value exceeds 1. 0. Lithology has no prominent influence on frost <b>durability</b> <b>and</b> compressive strength of CSC within the lithologies (dolomite, limestone, granite, basalt, and quartz) studied. Though compressive strength of CSC is a little higher than RSC under equal water to cement ratio, frost durability of CSC is no better than RSC especially for C 30 CSC, and air-entraining agent is suggested for enhancing frost durability of C 30 CSC exposed to freezing environment...|$|R
5|$|Egypt {{is rich in}} {{building}} and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and fashion jewelry. Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification, which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster. Ore-bearing rock formations were found in distant, inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive gold mines in Nubia, {{and one of the}} first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The Wadi Hammamat was a notable source of granite, greywacke, and gold. Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness <b>and</b> <b>durability</b> even after copper was adopted for this purpose.

5|$|Some common uses {{of heavy}} metals {{depend on the}} general {{characteristics}} of metals such as electrical conductivity and reflectivity or the general characteristics of heavy metals such as density, strength, <b>and</b> <b>durability.</b> Other uses depend {{on the characteristics of}} the specific element, such as their biological role as nutrients or poisons or some other specific atomic properties. Examples of such atomic properties include: partly filled d- or f- orbitals (in many of the transition, lanthanide, and actinide heavy metals) that enable the formation of coloured compounds; the capacity of most heavy metal ions (such as platinum, cerium or bismuth) to exist in different oxidation states and therefore act as catalysts; poorly overlapping 3d or 4f orbitals (in iron, cobalt, and nickel, or the lanthanide heavy metals from europium through thulium) that give rise to magnetic effects; and high atomic numbers and electron densities that underpin their nuclear science applications. Typical uses of heavy metals can be broadly grouped into the following six categories.|$|E
5|$|The current match {{ball for}} the Recopa Sudamericana, {{manufactured}} by Nike, is named the Total 90 Omni CSF. It {{is one of}} the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex air chamber improves acceleration. Another feature of the ball is its rubber layer; it was designed to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup.
