The theoretical model was validated using confirmatory factor analysis and hierarchical regression on survey data from 287 {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) in Ghana. The empirical findings suggest that perceived regulatory burden is negatively related to CSP and that the level of institutional ties <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> capability amplify the perceived regulatory burden-CSP relationship such that the relationship is more negative and significant for higher institutional ties <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> capability...|$|R

5|$|By 1300 only Harlech and Conwy {{had been}} {{properly}} completed: Caernarfon's town walls were finished, {{but much of}} the castle was still incomplete and at Beaumaris Castle the inner walls was only half their intended height, with gaps in the outer walls. By 1304 the total building programme in Wales had come to at least £80,000, almost six times Edward's annual income. Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence of wars in Scotland which began to consume his attention <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> <b>resources,</b> and as a result further work on the Welsh castles slowed to a crawl. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, but money remained much more limited than before. By 1330 all new work had finally ceased, and Caernarfon and Beaumaris were never fully completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} slowed during 1296, although debts {{continued to}} build up, and work dropped off further the following year, stopping entirely by 1300, by when around £11,000 had been spent. The halt was primarily {{the result of}} Edward's new wars in Scotland, which had begun to consume his attention <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> <b>resources,</b> but it left the castle only partially complete: the inner walls and towers were {{only a fraction of}} their proper height and the north and north-west sides lacked outer defences altogether. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, but the unfinished castle had already fallen into a poor state of repair. Work recommenced on completing the outer defences, first under James' direction and then, after his death in 1309, Master Nicolas de Derneford. This work finally halted in 1330 with the castle still not built to its intended height; {{by the end of the}} project, £15,000 had been spent, a colossal sum for the period. A royal survey in 1343 suggested that at least a further £684 would be needed to complete the castle, but this was never invested.|$|E

5|$|For the Royal Navy, {{the early}} years of the war had been successful, but the {{commitment}} to a global conflict was creating a severe strain on available equipment, men <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> <b>resources.</b> The navy had expanded from 134 ships at the start of the conflict in 1793, to 633 by 1797, and personnel had increased from 45,000 men to 120,000, an achievement possible only as a result of the impressment service, which abducted criminals, beggars and unwilling conscripts for compulsory service at sea. Wages had not been increased since 1653, and were usually months late, rations were terrible, shore leave forbidden and discipline harsh. Tensions in the fleet had been gradually rising since the start of the war, and in February 1797, anonymous sailors from the Channel Fleet at Spithead sent letters to their former commander, Lord Howe, soliciting his support in improving their conditions. The list was deliberately ignored on the instructions of First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Spencer, and, on 16 April, the sailors responded with the Spithead Mutiny: a largely peaceful strike action led by a delegation of seamen from each ship tasked with negotiating with the authorities and enforcing discipline. For a month the fleet remained at stalemate, until Lord Howe was able to negotiate a series of improvements in conditions that enabled the strikers to return to regular service. The mutiny had achieved almost all of its aims; increasing pay, removing unpopular officers and improving conditions for the men serving in the Channel Fleet and, ultimately, the whole navy.|$|E

Consequently, many water laws were introduced or amended, partly following CONAGUA's guidelines. In 1996, 21 states had transferred service provision to municipal service providers.|$|E

25|$|The second {{defeat at}} Herdonia {{did not make}} the Roman Senate change its warlike stance. Once again, as in the {{aftermath}} of Cannae, the senators resorted to punitive actions against the remnants of the defeated army. More than 4,000 men were rounded up and sent to Sicily where they joined the survivors of Cannae and were sentenced to serve on the island {{until the end of the}} war. This had undesired repercussions. The deportation of the soldiers, most of whom were of Latin origin, caused considerable discontent among the Latin colonies which had already been drained by ten years of continuous warfare on Italian soil. Amidst great want of additional manpower <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> <b>resources</b> twelve out of thirty colonies refused to send any more levies and money to Rome.

25|$|In 1961, NBC {{approached}} Walt Disney about {{acquiring the}} rights to his anthology series, offering to produce the program in color.

Disney subsequently struck a deal with NBC, which began airing the anthology series in the format in September 1961 (as Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color). As many of the Disney programs that aired in black-and-white on ABC were actually filmed in color, they could easily be re-aired in the format on the NBC broadcasts. In January 1962, NBC's telecast of the Rose Bowl became the first college football game ever to be telecast in color.|$|E
