5|$|The game blends investigative {{elements}} with fast-paced action sequences, including chases, combat, interrogations and gunfights. Players use melee {{attacks and}} firearms to fight enemies, and may run, jump or use vehicles {{to navigate the}} world. In combat, auto-aim and a cover system {{can be used as}} assistance against enemies. Should player characters take damage, the character's health will gradually regenerate. Weapons can only be used in appropriate circumstances, such as during firefights. When driving vehicles, players have the option to skip directly to the destination by nominating their partner as the driver. Players can <b>also</b> <b>ask</b> the partner for directions. In addition to storyline cases, players may engage in an optional 40 side-investigations, known as Street Crimes, that are not related to the case that they are working on. Some street crimes will feature characters from previous cases.|$|E
5|$|Nobuo Uematsu was {{the chief}} music {{composer}} of the Final Fantasy series until his resignation from Square Enix in November 2004. Other composers include Masashi Hamauzu, Hitoshi Sakimoto and Junya Nakano. Uematsu was allowed to create much of the music with little direction from the production staff. Sakaguchi, however, would request pieces to fit specific game scenes including battles and exploring {{different areas of the}} game world. Once a game's major scenarios were completed, Uematsu would begin writing the music based on the story, characters, and accompanying artwork. He started with a game's main theme, and developed other pieces to match its style. In creating character themes, Uematsu read the game's scenario to determine the characters' personality. He would <b>also</b> <b>ask</b> the scenario writer for more details to scenes he was unsure about. Technical limitations were prevalent in earlier titles; Sakaguchi would sometimes instruct Uematsu to only use specific notes. It was not until Final FantasyIV on the SNES that Uematsu was able to add more subtlety to the music.|$|E

This relatively recent custom is similar to that of Halloween's trick-or-treating in the United States.|$|E

25|$|An {{applicant}} who {{alleges that}} a public authority's act or decision has infringed {{his or her}} constitutional rights may bring a judicial review case to the High Court challenging it.

All remedies are granted at the Court's discretion.|$|E
25|$|The President has {{the right}} to {{initiate}} the legislative process. He also has the opportunity to directly influence it by using his veto to stop a bill; however, his veto can be overruled by a three-fifths majority vote in the presence of {{at least half of the}} statutory number of members of the Sejm (230). Before signing a bill into law, the President can <b>also</b> <b>ask</b> the Constitutional Tribunal to verify its compliance with the Constitution, which in practice bears a decisive influence on the legislative process.|$|E

25|$|Man {{executed}} colorful sculptures out of stones, driftwood, {{animal remains}} {{and other elements}} washed up by the sea, which sometimes reminded people of Gaudí's work. Tourists would come to visit the open-air museum he had created where the sculptures integrated into the natural landscape. Man's only source of revenue was a small fee (1€ as of 2002) he would ask from everyone visiting the Museum of the German. Man would <b>also</b> <b>ask</b> visitors to do drawings for him in small notebooks. Dozens of such notebooks were found after his death with hundreds of drawings.|$|E
25|$|In each local {{congregation}} of the church, males ages 12 to 18 {{are assigned to}} the Aaronic priesthood and the Young Men organization. The Aaronic priesthood is led by a bishop or branch president and his counselors (known as the bishopric or branch presidency). The Young Men organization in each congregation, {{under the direction of}} the bishopric or branch presidency, is led by an adult man who is called the Young Men President. The president is assisted by two adult men who serve as counselors and may <b>also</b> <b>ask</b> an adult man to be the secretary to the presidency.|$|E
25|$|More precisely, locally homeomorphic here {{means that}} each point m in the {{manifold}} M has an open neighborhood homeomorphic {{to an open}} neighborhood in Euclidean space, not to the unit ball specifically. However, given such a homeomorphism, the pre-image of an -ball gives a homeomorphism between the unit ball and a smaller neighborhood of m, so this is no loss of generality. For topological or differentiable manifolds, one can <b>also</b> <b>ask</b> that every point have a neighborhood homeomorphic to all of Euclidean space (as this is diffeomorphic to the unit ball), but this cannot be done for complex manifolds, as the complex unit ball is not holomorphic to complex space.|$|E

25|$|Its main {{activity}} is {{to rule on}} whether proposed statutes conform with the constitution, {{after they have been}} voted by parliament and before they are signed into law by the President of the French Republic (a priori review); since 1 March 2010, individual citizens party to a trial or lawsuit can <b>also</b> <b>ask</b> for the Council to review whether the law applied in the case is constitutional. In 1971, the Council ruled that conformity with the constitution entails conformity with two texts referred to by the preamble of that constitution: the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the preamble of the constitution of the Fourth Republic, both of which list constitutional rights.|$|E
25|$|All visit, business, transit, student, and {{exchange}} visitor visa applicants must pay a US$160 application fee (up from $140 as of April 2012) to a US Consulate {{in order to}} be interviewed by a Consular Officer who will determine if the applicant is qualified to receive a visa to travel to the U.S (additionally, the officer may <b>also</b> <b>ask</b> the United States Department of State for a Security Advisory Opinion, which can take several weeks to resolve). The application fee is increased to $190 for most work visas (up from $150 as of April 2012) and can be even higher for certain categories. If the applicant is rejected, the application fee is not refunded. Amongst the items included in the qualification decision are financial independence, adequate employment, material assets and a lack of a criminal record in the applicant's native country.|$|E
25|$|Focusing on {{providing}} {{a more realistic}} driving experience, the studio revamped its damage model, adding new elements, such as a wear and tear system, which means car parts lose performance through general use, and a suspension damage system. It also introduced a new team radio philosophy in which the player itself can request information on car damage, gaps, rival position and teammate position. The player can <b>also</b> <b>ask</b> its engineer to instruct their teammates to attack, defend or hold their position. By popular demand, Codemasters retained its unique Flashback feature from previous Grid installments with which the players can rewind their races a few seconds and resume it earlier, if needed. Cockpit view also made a return, after being absent, very much {{to the dismay of}} the core fanbase, in Grid 2. Aside from such elements, the developers generally decided to strip the game down and do away with everything that stood in the way of raw racing. These features included Grid 2’s narrator-driven career mode and superfluous menus. The latter received a more simplistic look.|$|E
