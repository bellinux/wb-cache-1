5|$|Niobium is an {{important}} component of high-performance heterogeneous catalysts for the production of <b>acrylic</b> acid by selective oxidation of propane.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium {{is a key}} {{constituent}} of high performing {{mixed oxide}} catalysts for the heterogeneous catalytic selective oxidation of propane to <b>acrylic</b> acid. The surface elemental composition changes dynamically and reversibly with the reaction conditions. In the presence of steam {{the surface of the}} catalyst is enriched in tellurium and vanadium which translates into the enhancement of the <b>acrylic</b> acid production.|$|E
50|$|Medium {{viscosity}} <b>acrylics</b> - Fluid <b>acrylics,</b> Soft body <b>acrylics,</b> or High Flow <b>acrylics</b> - {{have a lower}} viscosity {{but generally}} the same pigmentation as the Heavy Body <b>acrylics.</b> Available in either Artist quality or Craft quality, the cost and quality varies accordingly. These paints are good for watercolor techniques, airbrush application, or when smooth coverage is desired. Fluid <b>acrylics</b> can be mixed with any medium to thicken them for impasto work, or to thin them for glazing applications.|$|R
5000|$|Examples {{of fluid}} <b>acrylics</b> include Lukascryl Liquid, Lukascryl Studio, Liquitex Soft Body and Golden Fluid <b>acrylics.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Artist <b>acrylics</b> (professional <b>acrylics)</b> {{are created}} and {{designed}} to resist chemical reactions from exposure to water, ultraviolet light, and oxygen. Professional-grade <b>acrylics</b> have the most pigment, which allows for more medium manipulation and limits the color shift when mixed with other colors or after drying.|$|R
5|$|The molybdenum-based mixed oxides are {{versatile}} catalysts in {{the chemical}} industry. Some examples are the catalysts for the selective oxidation of propylene to acrolein and <b>acrylic</b> acid, the ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile. Suitable catalysts and {{process for the}} direct selective oxidation of propane to <b>acrylic</b> acid are being researched.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{vanadate}} is an opaque yellow pigment in artists' oil and <b>acrylic</b> paint. This compound is a non-toxic lightfast {{substitute for}} lemon yellow pigments {{such as the}} cadmium sulfides and the lead/strontium/barium chromates. Unlike lead chromate+lead sulfate lemon, bismuth vanadate does not readily blacken with UV exposure.|$|E
5|$|On display are the {{replicas of}} rockets and {{missiles}} with which Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had worked with. <b>Acrylic</b> paintings {{about his life}} are also displayed along with hundreds of portraits depicting {{the life of the}} mass leader.|$|E
5000|$|Hayat's 6th solo art {{exhibition}} titled [...] "Mindscape" [...] {{held during}} 14-24 January, 2017 in Rome. It showcased 50 of her work, which included <b>acrylics,</b> drawings and cardboard <b>acrylics.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hood {{remained}} {{loyal to}} the traditional art style of Indian art passed down from his ancestors. He started out using <b>acrylics</b> to achieve a look of depth and eventually transitioned to <b>acrylics.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dip powder manicures are an {{alternative}} to traditional <b>acrylics</b> and gel polish. Dip powders have no odor when applied, and may be done more quickly as <b>acrylics</b> and soak off easier then gel polish.|$|R
5|$|In 1976, a fire {{destroyed}} the <b>acrylic</b> outer skin of Buckminster Fuller's dome, {{and the previous}} year the Ontario pavilion was lost due to a major fire. With the site falling into disrepair, and several pavilions left abandoned and vandalized, it began to resemble ruins of a futuristic city.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took {{matters into their own hands}} by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In part because of the defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with <b>acrylic</b> glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Indigenous art of {{the western}} desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began {{painting}} in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used <b>acrylic</b> paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all {{of the founders of}} the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting.|$|E
25|$|Other linings, {{which include}} wool {{mixtures}} and <b>acrylics.</b>|$|R

5|$|In July 1995, the {{sculpture}} {{was removed from}} its pedestal and shipped to Stellar Artworks in Van Nuys, California for cleaning and restoration. It received a glassbead peening to remove the effects of birds, human hands, pollution and precipitation, plus a coat of incralac, a lacquer-based <b>acrylic</b> resin coating. The restoration was funded by an anonymous donor and involved Art Work Fine Art Services, Industrial Craters & Packers, O'Neill Transfer Co., Smith Masonry Contractors and the Regional Arts & Culture Council. This marked {{the sculpture}}'s first restoration since 1985. Allow Me receives cold wax coatings each year to maintain its shine.|$|E
5|$|Most acetate esters, however, are {{produced}} from acetaldehyde using the Tishchenko reaction. In addition, ether acetates {{are used as}} solvents for nitrocellulose, <b>acrylic</b> lacquers, varnish removers, and wood stains. First, glycol monoethers {{are produced}} from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with alcohol, which are then esterified with acetic acid. The three major products are {{ethylene glycol monoethyl ether}} acetate (EEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in semiconductor manufacturing processes, where it is used as a resist solvent). This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, {{have been shown to be}} harmful to human reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The {{ballpark}} {{was built}} to withstand a 100-year flood because it is located on a flood plain. Before its redevelopment, the area, including the original Sulphur Dell ballpark, was prone to regular flooding from the nearby Cumberland River and it flooded during the 2010 Tennessee floods. To prevent water damage, the grandstand has an <b>acrylic</b> floor covering and the field-level suites are equipped with detachable floor boards, food-service tables mounted on casters, and raised floor outlets and electrical switches.|$|E

5|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{physical}} restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5mm thick) that {{were in danger of}} separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate resin. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted <b>acrylic</b> resin.|$|E
5|$|The {{head and}} hands are {{coloured}} using {{a blend of}} oil, water and <b>acrylic</b> colour. From the mould, the body is cast in fibreglass, and the head and hands are fitted to the fiberglass body and dressed in clothes that are often donated by the celebrity. The pose, clothes and expression on the face all contribute to making the figure as realistic as possible. The whole process usually takes {{up to six months}} by a team of 20 people to create and cost about HK$1 million each.|$|E
5|$|The restorers {{washed the}} {{surfaces}} {{using a variety}} of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of calcium carbonate were treated by the application of a solution of dimethylformamide. The final step was the application of a weak solution of <b>acrylic</b> polymer to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.|$|E
5000|$|Student <b>acrylics</b> have working {{characteristics}} {{similar to}} artist <b>acrylics,</b> but with lower pigment concentrations, less-expensive formulas, and fewer available colors. More expensive pigments are generally replicated by hues. Colors {{are designed to}} be mixed even though color strength is lower. Hues may not have exactly the same mixing characteristics as full-strength colors.|$|R

5|$|Tittle {{became the}} first {{professional}} football player featured {{on the cover of}} Sports Illustrated when he appeared on its fifteenth issue dated November 22, 1954, donning his 49ers uniform and helmet featuring an <b>acrylic</b> face mask distinct to the time period. The cover photo also shows a metal bracket on the side of Tittle's helmet which served to protect his face by preventing the helmet from caving in. The 1954 cover was the first of four Sports Illustrated covers he graced during his career.|$|E
5|$|When a more {{exacting}} plan {{is needed}} beyond clinical judgment, the dentist {{will make an}} <b>acrylic</b> guide (called a stent) prior to surgery which guides optimal positioning of the implant. Increasingly, dentists opt to get a CT scan of the jaws and any existing dentures, then plan the surgery on CAD/CAM software. The stent can then be made using stereolithography following computerized planning of a case from the CT scan. The use of CT scanning in complex cases also helps the surgeon identify and avoid vital structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the sinus.|$|E
5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and <b>acrylic)</b> and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E
