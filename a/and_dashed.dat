5|$|The South Africans and Rhodesians {{launched}} a two-pronged {{assault on the}} German positions over the road to Bologna at 22:30 on 15 April 1945. The Cape Town Highlanders' advance up the steep cliffs of Monte Sole was obstructed by a German minefield that guarded the peak. The Rhodesian officer commanding the leading platoon, Second Lieutenant GB Mollett, took a section of men <b>and</b> <b>dashed</b> through the minefield to the summit; for this he later received the Distinguished Service Order. Hand-to-hand fighting on Monte Sole continued until dawn, when the Germans withdrew. The Witwatersrand Rifles meanwhile took Monte Caprara. The Cape Town Highlanders took Monte Abelle late on 16 April, advancing under heavy artillery fire to the summit before clearing it of Germans. The regiment lost 31 killed and 76 wounded during these actions, including three Rhodesians killed and three wounded.|$|E

5|$|To {{the left}} of the 4th Grenadiers were the two squares of the 1st/ and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs who angled further to the west and had {{suffered}} more from artillery fire than the grenadiers. But as their advance mounted the ridge they found it apparently abandoned and covered with dead. Suddenly 1,500 British Foot Guards under Maitland who had been lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys. The chasseurs deployed to answer the fire, but some 300 fell from the first volley, including Colonel Mallet and General Michel, and both battalion commanders. A bayonet charge by the Foot Guards then broke the leaderless squares, which fell back onto the following column. The 4th Chasseurs battalion, 800 strong, now came up onto the exposed battalions of British Foot Guards, who lost all cohesion <b>and</b> <b>dashed</b> back up the slope as a disorganized crowd with the chasseurs in pursuit. At the crest the chasseurs came upon the battery that had caused severe casualties on the 1st and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs. They opened fire and swept away the gunners. The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back. But the skirmishers were replaced by the 52nd Light Infantry, led by John Colborne, which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them. The chasseurs returned a very sharp fire which killed or wounded some 150 men of the 52nd. The 52nd then charged, and under this onslaught, the chasseurs broke.|$|E

25|$|To Wellington's amazement, Clausel quickly rallied his beaten {{army and}} {{launched}} a raid in the north. On 13 August, the French general marched on Valladolid with 25,000 troops. In {{the face of this}} advance, Clinton fell back to Arévalo with 7,000 soldiers while José María Santocildes's Spanish corps abandoned Valladolid. Clausel sent his lieutenant Maximilien Sebastien Foy to rescue the trapped French garrisons. While the Spanish attackers concluded the Siege of Astorga before he could reach it, Foy rescued the garrisons of Toro and Zamora and reunited with Clausel at Valladolid on 4 September. Wellington and 21,000 troops rejoined Clinton at Arévalo on 3 September. The British army commander set out after Clausel, but that general easily shook off his pursuers <b>and</b> <b>dashed</b> out of reach, leaving a garrison of 2,000 men in Burgos. Wellington left Lieutenant General Rowland Hill to defend Madrid with 31,000 Anglo-Portuguese and 12,000 Spanish. This force included Wellington's three best divisions.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} at Saipan, The Mariana Islands, 19 June to 7 July 1944. When his entire company was held up by fire from automatic weapons and small-arms fire from strongly fortified enemy positions that commanded the view of the company, Sgt. (then Pvt.) Baker voluntarily took a bazooka <b>and</b> <b>dashed</b> alone to within 100 yards of the enemy. Through heavy rifle and machine gun fire that was directed at him by the enemy, he knocked out the strong point, enabling his company to assault the ridge. Some days later while his company advanced across the open field flanked with obstructions and places of concealment for the enemy, Sgt. Baker again voluntarily took up a position in the rear to protect the company against a surprise attack and came upon two heavily fortified enemy pockets manned by two officers and ten enlisted men which had been bypassed. Without regard for such superior numbers, he unhesitatingly attacked and killed all of them. Five hundred yards farther, he discovered six men of the enemy who had concealed themselves behind our lines and destroyed all of them. On 7 July 1944, the perimeter of which Sgt. Baker was a part was attacked from 3 sides by from 3,000 to 5,000 Japanese. During the early stages of this attack, Sgt. Baker was severely wounded, but he insisted on remaining in the line and fired at the enemy at ranges sometimes as close as 5 yards until his ammunition ran out. Without ammunition and with his weapon battered to uselessness from hand-to-hand combat, he was carried about 50 yards to the rear by a comrade, who was then himself wounded. At this point Sgt. Baker refused to be moved any further stating that he preferred to be left to die rather than risk the lives of any more of his friends. A short time later, at his request, he was placed in a sitting position against a small tree. Another comrade, withdrawing, offered assistance. Sgt. Baker refused, insisting that he be left alone and be given a soldier's pistol with its remaining eight rounds of ammunition. When last seen alive, Sgt. Baker was propped against a tree, pistol in hand, calmly facing the foe. Later Sgt. Baker's body was found in the same position, gun empty, with 8 Japanese lying dead before him. His deeds were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army.|$|E

500|$|As {{there was}} no spare cockpit in the single-seat Martinsyde, the downed pilot jumped onto McNamara's wing and held the struts.

The two men, who had escaped further injury in the accident, set fire to the Martinsyde <b>and</b> <b>dashed</b> back to Rutherford's B.E.2. Rutherford repaired the engine while McNamara used his revolver against the attacking cavalry, who had opened fire on them. Two other No.1 Squadron pilots overhead, Lieutenant (later Air Marshal Sir) Roy [...] "Peter" [...] Drummond and Lieutenant Alfred Ellis, also began strafing the enemy troops. McNamara managed to start the B.E.2's engine and take off, with Rutherford in the observer's cockpit. In severe pain and close to blacking out from loss of blood, McNamara flew the damaged aircraft [...] back to base at El Arish.|$|E

500|$|Inland, the {{hurricane}} wreaked much more widespread destruction along the more heavily populated coast of Lake Okeechobee. Residents {{had been warned}} to evacuate the low ground earlier in the day, but after {{the hurricane}} did not arrive on schedule, many thought it had missed and returned to their homes. In the weeks prior to storm, heavy rainfall caused the lake to rise [...] between August10 and September10 and filled nearby canals and ditches. Additionally, precipitation from the hurricane itself caused Lake Okeechobee to rise further. When {{the worst of the}} storm crossed the lake, the south-blowing wind caused a storm surge to overflow the small dike that had been built {{at the south end of}} the lake. The resulting flood covered an area of hundreds of square miles with water that in some places was over 20ft (6m) deep. Houses were floated off of their foundations <b>and</b> <b>dashed</b> to pieces against any obstacle they encountered. Most survivors and bodies were washed out into the Everglades where many of the bodies were never found. Agricultural losses in the area surrounding Lake Okeechobee were also significant, with virtually all crops destroyed and over 150tractors suffering damage.|$|E
500|$|Strupper {{also played}} on the 1917 team then {{considered}} the greatest the South ever produced, including {{one of the greatest}} backfields. According to the Times-Picayune, [...] "Strupper, Guyon, Hill, and Harlan form a backfield with no superiors and few equals in football history". Tech gave Vanderbilt its worst loss in school history 83–0. [...] "It was not until 1917 that a Southern team really avenged long-time torment at McGugin's hands. And it took one of history's top backfields–Joe Guyon, Ev Strupper, Al Hill, and Judy Harlan of Georgia Tech–to do it," [...] writes Edwin Pope. The team also defeated the University of Pennsylvania, then one of the Eastern powers, 41–0. It was called by one writer [...] "Strupper's finest hour." [...] In a 98–0 win over the Carlisle Indians in 1917, Strupper drew praise for his performance. The Atlanta Journal wrote:"Everett Strupper played like a veritable demon.

500|$|Carnivàle {{was often}} {{compared}} to David Lynch's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks and John Steinbeck's 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath.

[...] She argued that a [...] "surreal Twin Peaks-style shockfest [...] hardly bears repeating," [...] especially if it [...] "avoid the 'hugging and learning' of mainstream television [...] such a steady diet of anguish <b>and</b> <b>dashed</b> hopes that viewers refuse to take the risk of making an emotional connection." [...] Carnivàle, as The Australian stated, [...] "seems to have been conceived in essentially literary terms" [...] which [...] "can sometimes work on the page but is deadly on the large screen, let alone a small one. It's almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television." [...] A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of Carnivàle as [...] "too artsy and esoteric" [...] because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding [...] "what the heck was going on, [...] can be a problem for a dramatic television series." [...] TV Zone however considered Carnivàle [...] "a series like no other and [...] {{the fact that it is}} so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths." [...] Carnivàle was lauded for bringing [...] "the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life" [...] and for being among the first TV shows to show [...] "unmitigated pain and disappointment", but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the [...] "slowly unfolding sadness" [...] appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show.|$|E
