40|$|<b>Attrition</b> or {{losses from}} the health {{workforce}} exacerbate critical shortages of health workers and can be a barrier to countries reaching their universal health coverage and equity goals. Despite the importance of accurate estimates of the <b>attrition</b> rate (and in particular the voluntary <b>attrition</b> rate) to conduct effective workforce planning, there is a dearth of an agreed definition, information and studies on this topic. We conducted a rapid review of studies published since 2005 on <b>attrition</b> rates of health workers from the workforce in different regions and settings; 1782 studies were identified, of which 51 {{were included in the}} study.

There is a diversity of definitions of <b>attrition</b> and barely any studies distinguish between total and voluntary <b>attrition</b> (i. e. choosing to leave the workforce). <b>Attrition</b> rate estimates were provided for different periods of time, ranging from 3 months to 12 years, using different calculations and data collection systems.

40|$|Namakwa Sands is {{a mining}} company {{operating}} {{on the west coast}} of South Africa, producing zircon, rutile and ilmenite. Heavy mineral sands are extracted by wet gravity, magnetic and electrostatic separation. In order to maintain their zircon product specifications, particularly with respect to radioactivity, the reject stream may still contain significant grades of zircon but is associated with penalty elements such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2), uranium (U) and thorium (Th). The radioactive components U and Th are associated with the mineral monazite and cause issues in handling and disposal of the material. If monazite could be removed from the reject stream, the remaining material could potentially be sold as a low-grade zircon product. Furthermore, monazite is a valuable mineral in itself due to its content of rare earth elements such as cerium and lanthanum, which are valued in the nuclear and wind-power industries. The separation of monazite from the zircon reject stream is therefore desirable to Namakwa Sands from both an economic and an environmental perspective, by reducing the amount of waste and increasing revenue. Flotation of heavy minerals is rarely practiced due to the effectiveness of gravity and electrostatic separation of coarse particles. However, the physical separation at Namakwa Sands is challenged by fine particle sizes and surface coating issues affecting the surface properties and thus the separation. Froth flotation, which operates within finer particle sizes, is a possible separation method that in combination with surface attrition could selectively separate monazite. The objective of this project is to investigate the use of reverse froth flotation to separate monazite from the final zircon reject stream to obtain a higher-grade zircon product that meets product specifications. The accompanying investigation of the mineralogy and surface coatings of the material will also be critical in understanding the effect of the flotation factors on the success of monazite flotation. This project is broadly divided into two phases of flotation experiments with an accompanying mineralogical investigation of the flotation products. In {{the first phase of the}} project, the aim was to find flotation conditions where monazite could selectively be removed from the pulp, i. e. by using reverse flotation. A statistical screening design in the statistical software MODDE (©Umetrics) was used to find the significant parameters and the optimum flotation settings. The investigated parameters were pH, collector type, collector dosage, depressant type, depressant dosage and ultrasonication. The most common monazite collectors in flotation were reported to be oleates, hydroxamates and amine based collectors. More specifically, oleate and hydroxamate collectors have been used for the separation of monazite and zircon, and were therefore the collectors that were used in the first phase. In the second phase of the project, fewer parameters, and narrower intervals were used. More intense mechanical <b>attritioning</b> was also applied in this phase using a custom-built mini pin mill. In two full factorial designs, collector dosage, depressant dosage, pH and attrition intensity were studied. The hydroxamate collector was found not to be selective for any of the minerals, but the oleate collector could selectively recover monazite at a pH of 10 and a collector dosage of 180 g/ton. Further investigation showed that an oleate collector dosage of 315 g/ton resulted in a monazite recovery of 55. 6 %. The best monazite grade was 71. 7 % with the oleate collector at a dosage of 215 g/ton and a pH of 10, however the recovery was low with 28. 4 %. Results showed that selectivity was highly dependent on pH. At a pH value of 9, no selectivity was obtained, and more than 50 % of the pulp was recovered to the concentrate in three minutes. An increase of pH to 11 resulted in only foam recovery. Monazite selectivity was obtained between these two extremes, at a pH of 10. The flotation system was extremely pH-sensitive, which indicates that the point of zero charge for the Namakwa Sands zircon and monazite may lie within this narrow pH interval. The accompanying mineralogical study showed that the final zircon reject composed of mainly zircon, between 70 % and 83 %. The rutile content was around 7 % and the monazite grade varied between 3 % and 6 %. The mineralogy investigation included SEM, QEMSCAN and grain counting results, and besides the bulk mineralogy, surface coatings were studied. Surface coatings on both monazite and zircon were highly associated with SiO 2, which has previously been detected as a common surface coating in the deposit in the form of opaline silica. SEM and QEMSCAN were used as tools to detect the degree of surface coatings before and after <b>attritioning.</b> It did not conclusively show any effect of the surface <b>attritioning,</b> which therefore remains unknown. Furthermore, the bulk mineralogy of flotation products was studied. It was shown that the concentrates from the tests with high monazite selectivity were enriched in garnets. The oleate collector may therefore be selective for both monazite and garnets at a pH of 10. The key finding of this project is that monazite can be successfully separated from zircon with an oleate collector at a pH of 10. A monazite recovery of 55. 6 % was possible; however further research into staged flotation to further improve the zircon-rich tail is needed. The results of surface <b>attritioning</b> are not entirely clear, which gives scope for further investigation into mechanical <b>attritioning</b> methods and intensities.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{correctly}} predict {{the performance of}} beneficiation processes, such as hydrocycloning or ultrasonic treatment of iron ore fines, {{it is important to}} understand possible changes in size distribution, mineral composition and textural peculiarities. During beneficiation processes, iron ore can be subjected to various physical actions which may result in changes in size distribution. In the case of soft or friable ores, <b>attritioning</b> and/or deagglomeration may have a significant effect on both separation performance and product stream specifications. Optical image analysis tools, which give statistical information on a particle by particle basis, can help in better understanding the response of the ores to these processes. An experimental study has been conducted to investigate the response of a haematitic-goethitic iron ore to a combination of stirring and ultrasonic treatment. The effect of stirring and ultrasonic treatment on the size and mineral distribution has been quantified using image analysis and automatic ore texture classification. This approach has been applied to several size coarse fractions of the initial feed and product. The results show that, following treatment, the mass proportion of ore texture classes which contained higher amounts of ochreous goethite and kaolinite had significantly decreased compared with that in the feed, while the proportion of texture classes where haematite was the major mineral had increased. Liberation analysis also showed a significant increase in the proportion of particles with more than 95 per cent haematite and vitreous goethite...|$|E

The increased iron content in ground pepper and cowpea observed {{in the present study}} confirmed the high risk of iron overloading using <b>attrition</b> milling. The level of contamination of ground food increased with use in <b>attrition</b> mills as a result of wear and tear of grinding plates...|$|R
40|$|Teacher <b>attrition</b> is {{generally}} positioned within research addressing teacher shortage, the wastage {{of resources and}} expertise, {{as well as that}} concerning teachers 2 ̆ 7 lowly status and poor working conditions. As such the research is fragmented and diverse. This paper attempts to draw together contemporary international <b>attrition</b> research in order to consider: how teacher <b>attrition</b> may be defined; patterns of attrition; influences upon attrition; the impact of attrition; and strategies employed for decreasing <b>attrition.</b> It concludes that research concerning teacher <b>attrition</b> requires the development of more comprehensive databases on teaching personnel and increased clarity of how <b>attrition</b> is being framed and investigated.

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} an {{assessment}} of the effects of panel <b>attrition</b> on income mobility comparisons for some EU-countries by using the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). There are different possibilities of correcting the <b>attrition</b> problem by means of alternative longitudinal weighting schemes. The sensitivity of mobility estimates to these <b>attrition</b> correction procedures is tested in the paper. Our results show that ECHP <b>attrition</b> is characterised by a certain degree of selectivity but only affecting some variables and countries. Different probability models corroborate the existence of a certain non-random <b>attrition.</b> The model chosen to construct the longitudinal weights to correct <b>attrition</b> offers up rather different results than those obtained when Eurostat’s longitudinal weights are used. Although <b>attrition</b> {{does not seem to have}} a great effect on aggregated mobility indicators, it does have a decisive effect on decomposition exercises. Finally, the tests conducted on income mobility indicators reveal a certain sensitivity to the weighting system used. Income mobility, <b>attrition,</b> European Community Household Panel. ...|$|R
40|$|In a {{fluidized}} bed, <b>attrition</b> both {{increases the}} number of particles and reduces particle size, which may affect reactor performance; fluidizing properties, operating stability and operating costs. Most fluidized applications are conducted at high temperature, {{but in the past}} most <b>attrition</b> correlations were performed at room temperature, so the <b>attrition</b> rate at high temperature could not be predicted. In contrast, this study investigates the <b>attrition</b> rate of fluidized materials at high temperature. Silica sand was used as the bed material; the operating parameters included temperature, particle size, static bed height and gas velocity to assess the <b>attrition</b> rate. Then an appropriate correlation was developed by regression analysis to predict <b>attrition</b> rate at high temperature. Experimental results indicated that the <b>attrition</b> rate increases with increasing temperature. In addition, the particle <b>attrition</b> increased as average particle size decreased because the probability of collision increases with surface area. The <b>attrition</b> rate increased with increasing gas velocity because of increased kinetic stress of particle movement. The actual density and viscosity of air at specific fluidization temperature were modified and an Ar number was introduced to fit our experimental data. The experimental correction agrees with the experimental results, which can predict particle <b>attrition</b> rate at high temperatures...|$|R

In <b>attrition</b> warfare, {{the enemy is}} seen as a collection of targets to be found and destroyed. <b>Attrition</b> warfare exploits maneuver to bring to bear firepower to destroy enemy forces. Maneuver warfare, on the other hand, exploits firepower and <b>attrition</b> on key elements of opposing forces.|$|R
40|$|<b>Attrition</b> from {{psychotherapy}} {{with children}} and adolescents is a significant problem. Models addressing <b>attrition</b> were presented, including the Service Utilization Model (SUM). Youths with Severe Emotional Disturbance (SED) are a significant concern when considering <b>attrition.</b> Continuum-of-care programs, such as the Wraparound Milwaukee Program, have been created to address the high needs of SED youths. This study examined <b>attrition</b> from the Wraparound Milwaukee Program. Univariate relationships between dropping out {{and a number of}} demographic and clinical indicators were performed. A logistic regression analysis examined the effects that three types of predictor variables have upon <b>attrition</b> as predicted by the Service Utilization Model. A second set of logistic regression analyses examined whether the relationships that the predictor variables had with <b>attrition</b> would be moderated by the youths 2 ̆ 7 early treatment response. The <b>attrition</b> rate for youths from the Wraparound Milwaukee Program was 29...|$|R
40|$|As the United States faces a {{critical}} teacher shortage, {{it is important}} to examine all factors that may contribute to the revolving door of teacher <b>attrition.</b> This study explored the climate of elementary schools to determine if there was a correlation between teacher <b>attrition</b> and school organizational climate. Three basic research questions were addressed: 1) Is there a relationship between school organizational climate and teacher <b>attrition?</b> 2) Is a change in campus leadership related to school organizational climate? 3) Is there a relationship between a change in campus leadership and teacher <b>attrition?</b> Thirty-seven elementary schools were examined in terms of their individual teacher <b>attrition</b> rates and their climate survey scores. The data utilized in this study came from one school district's climate survey and teacher <b>attrition</b> rates for the 2000 - 2001 school year. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} factors of organizational climate may predict teacher <b>attrition</b> rates. Specifically, instructiona support may be related to teacher <b>attrition.</b> Major components of instructional support include principal behaviors, respect for teaching and learning, and communication with administrators. Teacher <b>attrition</b> was not related to principal experience. Also, principal experience was not related to factors of school organizational climate...|$|R
40|$|In {{longitudinal}} research, {{the loss}} of sample members between waves is a possible source of bias. It is therefore crucial to analyse <b>attrition</b> {{and to find out}} who remained in the sample. The current paper analyses <b>attrition</b> in the Austrian Generations and Gender Survey, a longitudinal study on family and fertility, by distinguishing between <b>attrition</b> due to non-contact and <b>attrition</b> due to cooperation. The two components of <b>attrition</b> are studied separately by using bivariate as well as multivariate methods. Moreover, overall dropout - the combination of both components - is analysed. Apart from various socio-economic characteristics and data collection information, the study focuses on fertility relevant variables such as fecundity, fertility intentions, sexual orientation and traditional attitudes. The results reveal that fecundity, fertility intentions and homosexual relationship are associated with higher <b>attrition</b> due to refusal in bivariate analyses but have no explanatory power in the multivariate model. On the contrary, pregnancy and traditional attidudes towards marriage are significantly associated with lower <b>attrition</b> due to refusal in the multivariate context. Moreover, various individual and regional characteristics turned out to be significantly associated with dropout, with differences between <b>attrition</b> due to non-contact and <b>attrition</b> due to cooperation...|$|R
40|$|While {{many studies}} have {{reported}} the predictors of teacher <b>attrition,</b> we know little about what predicts the <b>attrition</b> of school leaders. Using the Colorado state data on elementary school principals’ and assistant principals’ career paths from 1999 to 2001 and school achievement-level data, we addressed two research questions: 1) How do the age-specific <b>attrition</b> rates differ by gender and race? and 2) What other conditional factors {{are associated with the}} <b>attrition</b> of school leaders? We found that female and minority groups generally had higher <b>attrition</b> rates at age 40 or younger and at age 56 or older than male and non-minority groups. Our data also indicated that school size and salary increase were associated with the <b>attrition</b> of both male and female leaders. Large schools {{were more likely to have}} higher rates of school leader <b>attrition,</b> and the leaders who expected relatively higher salary increases by transferring were more likely to leave their schools. Lower school achievement predicted higher <b>attrition</b> of female leaders only. These findings have important implications for policy-makers when they plan and implement strategies for preventing high <b>attrition</b> rates of school leaders...|$|R
