In Slovenia, the technical <b>register</b> and fixed <b>assets</b> <b>register</b> of public service infrastructure both represent the same subject from different points of view, but they are usually not interconnected. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of both registers in 13 local communities in Slovenia were used to develop a decision model for the integration of the fixed <b>assets</b> <b>register</b> and the technical register of public service infrastructure.

The study discusses three technical challenges which comprise the incompleteness of the <b>asset</b> <b>register,</b> immovable asset life cycle management, a lack of implementation of the immovable {{asset management}} plan, the asset performance measures and standards for the immovable assets. The National Department of Public Works was targeted as a potential candidate to participate in this research.
