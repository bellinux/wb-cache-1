5|$|The {{ash fall}} created some {{temporary}} major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane {{was closed for}} a week and a half. Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged <b>air</b> <b>filters,</b> and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and rechargeable flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a day-night cycle, and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times because of the toxic air. The player must collect <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood splatter that collects on the gas mask. There is no head up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail — rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to indicate to a player {{if they have been}} exposed to enemy attention. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammunition and they have to reload. Instead of head up display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of the engine air induction system has recently increased because of governmental engine exhaust particulate and evaporative emission regulations. This has created {{a renewed interest in}} optimizing the existing parameters of the air induction mechanism like the <b>air</b> <b>filter,</b> filter box, piping etc for better performance. <b>Air</b> <b>filter</b> provided on the engine intake is subjected to increased levels of abuse due to the diverse driving conditions. The OEM <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> in modern vehicles is usually a paper type <b>air</b> <b>filter.</b> Due to the increased presence of counterfeit <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> in the market, {{there is a possibility that}} filter may be of poorer quality resulting in get premature clogging. The presence of increased number of aftermarket performance filters has prompted automotive enthusiasts to replace their OEM filters with these performance filters for better performance. This study addresses the issue of whether OEM <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> replacement with aftermarket <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> (oiled media filter from K&N) improves fuel economy. The increasing <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> pressure drop in diesel-engine-powered vehicles due to clogging was measured, with primary focus on changes in vehicle fuel economy but also including acceleration and engine temperature.

40|$|Paper {{contains}} {{review of}} studies on influence of motor vehicle engine <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> restriction on vehicle parameters [1, 2, 3]. According to maintenance instructions issued by vehicle manufacturer, engine <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> must be replaced with certain periodicity. Depending on vehicle type, periodicity is between 20 000 – 80 000 km. Correct decision of replacement is connected with technically and economically based system of technical servicing. Unjustified replacement of engine <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> cartridges has impact on maintenance expenses and preservation of resources of nature. More precise way to determine correct moment of necessity of replacement of <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> cartridge is to measure restriction <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> causes in engine air intake.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project {{was to determine the}} percentage impact of dry-medium <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> being used in Fiat Multijet 1. 3 JTD engine on its operational properties (engine flexibility and specific fuel consumption). Experiments were performed according to the requirements of research methods specified in the piston combustion engine standard in force. In order to make comparisons, operational parameters of the power unit (torque, effective power and specific fuel consumption) were measured with dry-medium <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> (with a new filter element) being fitted and with <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> being removed. Each point of respective characteristic curves was determined based on four measurements as their mean value. Also boost pressure, which could be of importance for results, was considered in the experiments. However, the degree of EGR valve lift, the operation of which could also appear to be important, was not taken into account. For each measuring point of respective characteristic curves, the ranges of measurement uncertainties were determined. Expanded standard uncertainties were calculated based on the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement. The experiments being carried out allowed concluding that the engine with <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> was less flexible by approx. 20 % when compared to that without <b>air</b> <b>filter,</b> whereas its specific fuel consumption was greater by approx. 9 %. The degree of <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> pollution affects its flow resistance and, which is related to this, engine torque and its effective power as well as its flexibility decrease but fuel consumption increases...|$|R

25|$|The United Nations {{predicted}} that the initial radioactivity plume from the stricken Japanese reactors would reach the United States by 18 March. Health and nuclear experts emphasized that radioactivity in the plume would be diluted as it traveled and, at worst, would have extremely minor health consequences in the United States.

25|$|Air mass affects output. In space, {{where there}} is no atmosphere, the {{spectrum}} of the sun is relatively unfiltered. However, on earth, <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> the incoming light, changing the solar spectrum. The filtering effect ranges from Air Mass 0 (AM0) in space, to approximately Air Mass 1.5 on Earth. Multiplying the spectral differences by the quantum efficiency of the solar cell in question yields the efficiency. Terrestrial efficiencies typically are greater than space efficiencies. For example, a silicon solar cell in space might have an efficiency of 14% at AM0, but 16% on earth at AM 1.5. Note, however, that the number of incident photons in space is considerably larger, so the solar cell might produce considerably more power in space, despite the lower efficiency as indicated by reduced percentage of the total incident energy captured.|$|E
