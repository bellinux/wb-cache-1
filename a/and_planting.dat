5|$|Botanical gardens {{must find}} a {{compromise}} between the need for peace and seclusion, {{while at the same}} time satisfying the public need for information and visitor services that include restaurants, information centres and sales areas that bring with them rubbish, noise, and hyperactivity.

Some gardens are now heritage landscapes that are subject to constant demand for new exhibits and exemplary environmental management.|$|E

5|$|In the 1880s Ezra Asher Osborn and Elnathan T. Field of New Jersey {{started an}} {{enterprise}} {{to develop the}} Florida coast from Key Biscayne to Jupiter by clearing native vegetation, leveling Indian midden mounds and beach dunes, <b>and</b> <b>planting</b> coconuts. Osborn and Field imported 300,000unhusked coconuts from the Caribbean, of which 76,000 were planted on Key Biscayne. Most of the shoots from the coconuts on Key Biscayne were eaten by rats and marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris). As {{a result of their}} efforts, in 1885 Osborn and Field were allowed to purchase Key Biscayne and other oceanfront land from the Florida Internal Improvement Trust Fund for 70cents an acre.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density on some morphological and agronomic characteristics of grain sorghum in the years 2001 - 2002. Experimental design was a split-split, randomized complete block with three replications. Three nitrogen levels (0, 75 and 150 kg ha - 1) <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> densities (70 x 10, 70 x 20 and 70 x 30 cm) were applied in three grain sorghum cultivars. Generally, nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density had no effect on <b>plant</b> height <b>and</b> stalk length. The effect of nitrogen on grain yield per plant was usually non-significant <b>and</b> increased <b>plant</b> densities tended to increase grain yield per <b>plant.</b> Both nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density have positively affected grain yield per unit area. The effects of cultivar, nitrogen level <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density on flag leaf area were changeable and dependent on both years and locations. One thousand grain weight was mainly determined by both cultivar <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density. It may be concluded that increased nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density levels generally give the best results in grain yield and yield components in sorghum...|$|R

5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, <b>and</b> <b>planting</b> a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger {{was then}} made the Lord Warden in 1792. Pitt was badly {{in debt and}} King George III {{believed}} that the post, which came with a salary of £3,000 a year, would usefully supplement Pitt's income. Pitt made extensive use of the castle and by 1803 he used it as his main residence {{in an effort to}} reduce his living costs. Pitt's niece, Lady Hester Stanhope, joined him at Walmer between 1803 and 1806; together with Pitt, she carried out extensive work on the castle gardens, transforming them from a simple kitchen garden into a set of landscaped ornamental enclosures; Stanhope enlisted the Dover militia to help with the landscaping <b>and</b> <b>planting.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a garden at Little Moreton Hall comes from an early 17th-century set of household accounts referring to a gardener and the purchase of some seeds. Philip Moreton, who ran the estate for his older brother Edward in the mid-17th century, left {{a considerable amount of}} information on the layout <b>and</b> <b>planting</b> of the area of garden within the moat, {{to the west of the}} house. He writes of a herb garden, vegetable garden, and a nursery for maturing fruit trees until they were ready to be transferred to the orchard at the south and east of the house, probably where the orchard is today.|$|E

40|$|Leaves <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> of {{different}} ages of one susceptible (JL 24) and two resistant (ICGV 86031 and ICGV 86388) groundnut genotypes were mechanically inoculated with peanut bud necrosis [tospo]virus, {{and the percentage of}} plants with systemic symptoms (incidence) and the incubation period were determined. The incidence decreased sharply in all three genotypes with the age of the inoculated leaves <b>and</b> <b>plants.</b> The incubation period increased with the age of leaves <b>and</b> <b>plants.</b> Apparently, only young tissue of young plants is susceptible, while mature tissue <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> are highly resistant. This mature tissue <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> resistance occurs irrespective of the susceptibility level of the genotype to peanut bud necrosis virus, however, it develops earlier in the resistant than in the susceptible genotype...|$|R
5|$|As a {{marriage}} gift, the Tsar gave George {{a group of}} islands in the Petalioi Gulf, which the family visited on the royal yacht Amphitrite. George later purchased a country estate, Tatoi, north of Athens, and on Corfu he built a summer villa called Mon Repos. George developed Tatoi, building roads <b>and</b> <b>planting</b> grapes for making his own wine, Chateau Décélie. Intent on not letting his subjects know that he missed Denmark, he discreetly maintained a dairy at his palace at Tatoi, which was managed by native Danes {{and served as a}} bucolic reminder of his homeland. Queen Olga was far less careful in hiding her nostalgia for her native Russia, often visiting Russian ships at Piraeus two or three times before they weighed anchor. When alone with his wife, George usually conversed in German. Their children were taught English by their nannies, and when talking with his children he therefore spoke mainly English.|$|E
5|$|Forglen House is {{a mansion}} house {{that forms the}} centrepiece of the Forglen estate in the parish of Forglen, {{northwest}} of Turriff, Aberdeenshire, in the northeast of Scotland. The lands {{were given to the}} abbots of the Abbey of Arbroath by King William the Lion before 1211 and the Monymusk Reliquary was held there. The original castle, built around 1346, was replaced by a vernacular harled house that was later extended. Significant development of the estate began when it was acquired by the family of Lord Banff and they started the work of landscaping <b>and</b> <b>planting</b> trees. It became their main family seat during the 18th century. After the death of William Ogilvy, the eighth and final Lord Banff, the estate passed by marriage to the Abercromby baronets who continued to enhance the property and maintained it as their main residence. Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet commissioned the Aberdeen City Architect, John Smith to design the present house in 1839.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{dendrochronology}} of wood {{samples from}} Chetro Ketl provided information on species selected, season of cutting, wood modification and use, {{as well as}} an estimate of the number of trees required to build the great house. Trees were harvested for construction at Chetro Ketl annually, which contrasts with the sporadic patterns found at other sites in the canyon. Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites, the tree felling for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the spring and early summer. This may indicate that enough in-house labor was available during the farming season, or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to tree felling irrespective of the agriculture cycle, when most others were busy with field preparation <b>and</b> <b>planting.</b> One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of a couple of weeks per season.|$|E

40|$|Studies have {{indicated}} that consistent or well-constrained (relatively low variability) carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios exist in large-scale ecosystems, including both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Little {{is known about the}} C, N and P stoichiometric ratios that exist in the soils <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> of Chenier Island in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). We examined the distribution patterns and relationships of C, N and P stoichiometry in the soils <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> of Chenier Island, as well as the potential influences of the island's micro-geomorphology. Based on a study of four soil profile categories and Phragmites australis <b>and</b> Suaeda heteroptera <b>plant</b> tissues, our results showed that micro-geomorphology could leave a distinct imprint on the soil <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> elemental stoichiometry of Chenier Island; significant variation in the atomic C:N:P ratios (RCNP) existed in soils <b>and</b> <b>plants,</b> indicating that the RCNP values in both the soil <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> are not well constrained at the Chenier Island scale. RCN and RCP in Chenier Island soils were high, whereas the RNP values were comparatively low, indicating that the ecosystems of Chenier Island are nutrient-limited by N and P. However, the RNP values in P. australis <b>and</b> S. heteroptera <b>plant</b> tissues were high, suggesting that the plants of Chenier Island are nutrient-limited by P. Finally, we suggest that soil <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> N:P ratios may be good indicators of the soil <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> nutrient status during soil development <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> growth, which could be a useful reference for restoring the degraded soils of Chenier Island...|$|R

5|$|While {{ascending}} the mountain, {{the player}} activates helpful power-up abilities by collecting <b>and</b> <b>planting</b> minerals in marked plots. While {{there are over}} 30 abilities in total, the player starts with the basic four: Flagseed creates an additional checkpoint (in lieu of regressing further down the mountain upon losing a heart), Heartseed creates additional hearts from minerals, and the Crystal ability generates minerals from multiple plots. Thornvine's single-use, protective thorny vine can hurt enemies if aligned correctly, though some enemies require more than one hit to die, and the player forfeits all thorns upon losing a heart. As the game progresses, the player collects additional abilities, such as Flailflower, which turns the seed into an anchor for a spiky flail, and Floodfruit, which fills surrounding holes with water for easy passage. Thus the player constantly weighs whether to use minerals offensively (to eliminate enemies), defensively (to bypass difficult sections), or at all.|$|E
