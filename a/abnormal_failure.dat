50|$|Halogen lamps are {{manufactured}} with enough halogen {{to match the}} rate of tungsten evaporation at their design voltage. Increasing the applied voltage increases the rate of evaporation, so at some point there may be insufficient halogen and the lamp goes black. Over-voltage operation is not generally recommended. With a reduced voltage the evaporation is lower {{and there may be}} too much halogen, which can lead to <b>abnormal</b> <b>failure.</b> At much lower voltages, the bulb temperature may be too low to support the halogen cycle, but by this time the evaporation rate is too low for the bulb to blacken significantly. There are many situations where halogen lamps are dimmed successfully. However, lamp life may not be extended as much as predicted. The life span on dimming depends on lamp construction, the halogen additive used and whether dimming is normally expected for this type.|$|E
30|$|It was {{confirmed}} that the TM server prevented a half-finished stack because it rolled back all operations in case of <b>abnormal</b> <b>failure</b> of stack create and rolled back or rolled forward each operation in case of <b>abnormal</b> <b>failure</b> of stack update. Template sharing to end users who have contracts to System Integrators or providers can replicate virtual resource environments on new tenants easily. Our server extracted a template from non-stack environment except for shared resources. Users could update stack as expected because our server reflected actual environment change such as VM shut down or other OpenStack API operations to stack information. Moreover, we showed the effective performance of template management. Template extraction took 1 – 3  sec, stack create took 300  sec and stack update took 210  sec through experiments of sample templates with 10 virtual resources.|$|E

The latter hypothesis is supported by measurement of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which cannot be obtained routinely but may be estimated noninvasively by measuring transthoracic conductance (thoracic fluid content 1 /kΩ) with impedance cardiography. Methods and Results-—Preliminarily, in 9 patients undergoing invasive hemodynamics during cardiopulmonary testing, we demonstrated {{a significant relationship between}} VE/VCO 2 slope and resting end-tidal CO 2 pressure with baseline and peak pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Later, noninvasive hemodynamic evaluation by impedance cardiography was performed before cardiopulmonary testing in 190 {{patients with}} chronic systolic heart failure and normal lung function (aged 673 years, 71 % with ischemia, ejection fraction 327 %, 69 % with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy). In this group, we determined the relationship between abnormal ventilation (VE/VCO 2 slope and resting end-tidal CO 2 pressure) and transthoracic conductance. In the whole population, thoracic fluid content values were significantly related to VE/VCO 2 slope (R= 0. 63, P< 0. 0001) and to resting end-tidal CO 2 pressure (R= 0. 44, P< 0. 001).

Without complementary verification and certification methods {{the benefits of}} these development techniques are reduced. As part of certification, {{it is necessary to}} show a system is acceptably safe which subsumes both the normal and <b>abnormal</b> (<b>failure)</b> cases. However, nonfunctional properties, such as safety and failures, are abstraction breakers, cutting across multiple components. Also, much of the work on component-based engineering has been applied to software-based systems rather than field programmable gate array (FPGA) -based systems whose use is becoming more popular in industry. In this paper, we show how a modular design embedded on a FPGA can be exhaustively analyzed (from a safety perspective) to derive the failure and safety properties to give the evidence needed for a safety case. The specific challenges faced are analyzing the fault characteristics of individual electronic components, combining the results across software modules, and then feeding this into a system safety case. A secondary benefit of taking this approach is that there is less uncertainty in the performance of the device, hence, it can be used for higher integrity systems. Finally, design improvements can be specifically targeted at areas of safety concern, leading to more optimal utilization of the FPGA device.

30|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the development of template management technology to build virtual resources environments on OpenStack. In recent days, Cloud computing has been progressed and also open source Cloud software has become widespread. Authors are developing cloud services using OpenStack. There are technologies which deploy a set of virtual resources based on system environmental templates to enable easy building, expansion or migration of cloud resources. OpenStack Heat and Amazon CloudFormation are template deployment technologies and build stacks which are sets of virtual resources based on templates. However, these existing technologies have 4 problems. Heat and CloudFormation transaction managements of stack create or update are insufficient. Heat and CloudFormation do not have sharing mechanism of templates. Heat cannot extract templates from existing virtual environments. Heat does not reflect actual environment changes to stack information. Therefore, we propose a new template management technology with 4 improvements. It has a mechanism of transaction management like roll back or roll forward in case of <b>abnormal</b> <b>failure</b> during stack operations. It shares templates among end users and System Integrators. It extracts templates from existing environments. It reflects actual environment changes to stack information. We implemented the proposed template management server and showed that end users can easily replicate or build virtual resources environments.

Typically, an ASD system consists of a motor with its speed controlled by a power electronics converter via varying the amplitude and frequency of the input voltage. However, several <b>abnormal</b> insulation <b>failures</b> of random wound motors in ASD applications have been reported.

40|$|Several {{changes in}} cell {{morphology}} take {{place during the}} capping of surface receptors in Entamoeba histolytica. The amoebae develop the uroid, an appendage formed by membrane invaginations, which accumulates ligand–receptor complexes resulting from the capping process. Membrane shedding is particularly active in the uroid region and leads to the elimination of accumulated ligands. This appendage has been postulated to participate in parasitic defense mechanisms against the host immune response, because it eliminates complement and specific antibodies bound to the amoeba surface. The involvement of myosin II in the capping process of surface receptors has been suggested by experiments showing that drugs that affect myosin II heavy-chain phosphorylation prevent this activity. To understand the role of this mechanoenzyme in surface receptor capping, a myosin II dominant negative strain was constructed. This mutant is the first genetically engineered cytoskeleton-deficient strain of E. histolytica. It was obtained by overexpressing the light meromyosin domain, which is essential for myosin II filament formation. E. histolytica overexpressing light meromyosin domain displayed a myosin II null phenotype characterized by <b>abnormal</b> movement, <b>failure</b> to form the uroid, and failure to undergo the capping process after treatment with concanavalin A.

Our aim was to analyse our data in full-term neonates and children with special regard to withdrawal of life support and bad outcome. PATIENTS: All patients with HIE admitted to our unit from 1992 - 96 were analysed. Criteria for HIE were presence of a hypoxic insult followed by coma or altered consciousness with or without convulsions. Severity of HIE was assessed in neonates using Sarnat stages, and in children the duration of coma. In {{the majority of cases}} staging was completed with electrophysiological studies. Outcome was described using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Bad outcome was defined as death, permanent vegetative state or severe disability, good outcome as moderate disability or good recovery. RESULTS: In the neonatal group (n = 38) outcome was significantly associated with Sarnat stages, presence of convulsions, severely <b>abnormal</b> EEG, cardiovascular <b>failure,</b> and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD). A bad outcome was observed in 27 cases with 14 deaths and 13 survivors. Supportive treatment was withdrawn in 14 cases with 9 subsequent deaths. In the older age group (n = 45) outcome was related to persistent coma of 24 - 48 h, severely <b>abnormal</b> EEG, cardiovascular <b>failure,</b> liver dysfunction and MOD.
