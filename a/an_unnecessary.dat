5|$|Chicago {{tight end}} John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's {{bouncing}} kickoff {{and returned it}} 9-yards to his own 45-yard line, with <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15yards and giving the Bears a first down on the Colts' 40-yard line. Chicago could only gain 14yards on their ensuing possession, {{but it was enough}} for Robbie Gould to make a 44-yard field goal, cutting the score to 22–17.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{opening to}} {{positive}} {{reception at the}} 2010 Cannes Film Festival, Money Never Sleeps received polarized reviews from critics, who generally praised the acting, but considered it <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> sequel. Though failing to meet its critical expectations, the film was successful at the box office, topping the United States's ranking during its opening weekend, and earning a worldwide total of $134 million in ticket sales, and more than $15 million on DVD.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, it is {{difficult}} to draw many lessons from Salamis, because of the uncertainty about what actually happened. Once again the Allies chose their ground well in order to negate Persian numbers, but this time (unlike Thermopylae) had to rely on the Persians launching <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> attack for their position to count. (Hale, John R.).|$|E

5|$|Godwin is {{generally}} regarded as {{the founder of the}} school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in Political Justice (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.|$|E
5|$|Specht {{would not}} allow women on the group base, {{considering}} them <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> diversion. According to Knoke, one time Specht's wife came to visit him on the II./JG 11 base but {{was held at the}} guard room on Specht's orders and refused to receive calls from the guard. Instead he asked Knoke to pass a message to her to 'put herself on ice', saying that he would only have time for her after the war. Specht however did not survive, dying five months before the war in Europe came to an end.|$|E

5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E
5|$|As {{the time}} went past 90 minutes, {{an injury to}} Kevin Richardson held up play. TV cameras showed Liverpool midfielder Steve McMahon telling his team-mates there was one minute remaining. The injury itself meant there would, in fact, be two minutes and 39 seconds of injury time played. Liverpool adopted time-wasting tactics, {{including}} <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> backpass from McMahon to Grobbelaar. In the second minute of injury time, Arsenal launched their final attack. A Barnes run was intercepted by Richardson, and he passed the ball back to his goalkeeper John Lukic. Lukic bowled the ball out to Dixon, his long ball to Alan Smith was flicked on, finding Michael Thomas charging through the midfield. Thomas evaded a challenge by Nicol and raced into the penalty area, slipping the ball past the advancing Grobbelaar to score Arsenal's second.|$|E
5|$|In January 1800, {{recognising}} that Valletta was {{in danger}} of surrendering if it could not be resupplied, the French Navy prepared a convoy at Toulon, consisting of Généreux, under Captain Cyprien Renaudin, the 20-gun corvettes Badine, Fauvette and 16-gun Sans Pareille and two or three transport ships. The force was under the command of Contre-amiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée, recently exchanged under parole after being captured off Acre the previous year, and was instructed to approach Valletta along the Maltese coast from the southwest with the intention of passing between the blockade squadron and the shore and entering Malta before the British could discover and intercept them. The convoy sailed on 7 February. In addition to the supplies, the convoy carried nearly 3,000 French soldiers to reinforce the garrison, <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> measure that would completely counteract the replenishment of the garrison's food stocks.|$|E

30|$|INSPIRE, {{acknowledging}} the foundational work accomplished by OGC and ISO, taps into this resource and reuses the coverage concept – however, with several modifications {{in the data}} model which may seem acceptable from a pure GML perspective, but effectively (i) lead to incompatibility with these standards and implementations based on them and (ii) add <b>a</b> <b>unnecessary</b> amount of complexity for all INSPIRE users while benefitting only a few experts.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team erected two posts {{on the summit}} plateau to assist walkers {{attempting}} the descent in foggy conditions. These posts were subsequently cut down by climbers, sparking controversy in mountaineering circles on the ethics of such additions. Critics argued that cairns and posts are <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> man-made intrusion into the natural landscape, which create {{a false sense of}} security and could lessen mountaineers' sense of responsibility for their own safety. Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain (between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities, although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error), the long tradition of placing such aids on the summit, and the potentially life-saving role they could play. A series of solidly-constructed cairns currently (September 2009) marks the upper reaches of the Pony Track.|$|E
5|$|Peckham laid {{stress on}} discipline, which often {{resulted}} {{in conflict with}} his clergy. His first episcopal act was calling a council at Reading in July 1279 to implement ecclesiastical reform, but Peckham's specifying that a copy of Magna Carta should be hung in all cathedral and collegiate churches offended the king as <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> intrusion into political affairs. Another ruling was on non-residence of clergy in their livings. The only exception Peckham was prepared to make on non-residence was if the clerk needed to go abroad to study. At the Parliament of Winchester in 1279, the archbishop compromised and Parliament invalidated any regulation of the council dealing with royal policies or power. The copies of Magna Carta were taken down. One reason the archbishop may have backed down {{was that he was}} in debt to the Italian banking family of the Riccardi, who also were bankers to Edward and the pope, and Peckham was under threat of excommunication from the pope unless he repaid the loans.|$|E
5|$|The Persians {{preferred}} a {{battle in the}} open sea, where they could better utilize their superior seamanship and numbers. For the Greeks, the only realistic hope of a decisive victory was to draw the Persians into a constricted area, where their numbers would count for little. The battle at Artemisium had seen attempts to negate the Persian advantage in numbers, but ultimately the Allies may have realised that they needed an even more constricted channel in order to defeat the Persians. Therefore, by rowing into the Straits of Salamis to attack the Greeks, the Persians were playing into the Allies' hands. It seems probable that the Persians would not have attempted this unless the Persians were confident {{of the collapse of}} the Allied navy, and thus Themistocles's subterfuge appears to have {{played a key role in}} tipping the balance in the favor of the Greeks. Salamis was, for the Persians, <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> battle and a strategic mistake.|$|E
40|$|We study {{asymptotic}} {{properties of}} the modular representation theory of symmetric groups and investigate modular analogs of stabilization phenomena in characteristic zero. The main results are equivalences of categories between certain abelian subcategories of representations of $S_n$ and $S_m$ for different $n$ and $m$. We apply these results to obtain a structural result for $FI$-modules, and to prove a result conjectured by Deligne in a recent letter to Ostrik. Comment: Removed <b>a</b> <b>unnecessary</b> restriction on characteristic. Fixed some few minor errors and clarified the exposition in place...|$|R

5|$|The failed {{offensive}} {{was investigated}} by the HV in 1991 and researched later by retired HV Brigadier Vlado Hodalj. He concluded that the offensive failed because of overall poor planning and preparation, specifically citing the lack of reconnaissance and reserves. Furthermore, Hodalj cited inadequate leadership by the Sisak OG {{as a cause of}} the failure, pointing to inaction in respect of the 10th Brigade's failure to advance and improper employment of the 2nd Guards Brigade in an auxiliary role, protecting the flank of an inexperienced brigade that was committed to the offensive with little, if any, training. Finally, the offensive itself had no clear goal. Croatian Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo also criticised the offensive as <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary,</b> purely tactical and politically counterproductive move, likely unauthorised by appropriate authorities.|$|E
5|$|The goal {{shifted the}} balance of the game in Barcelona's favour, as United had been on top in terms of shots and {{possession}} up to that point. Almost immediately after the restart, Vidić gave away <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> corner. In a rehearsed corner move, Xavi played the ball back {{to the edge of the}} penalty area towards Messi, but the tournament's top scorer was unable to make a proper connection. Nevertheless, Barça retained possession through some sharp inter-passing involving Xavi and Iniesta. When United did manage to regain the ball, however, it was quickly given away by a poor pass from Carrick, while Anderson mis-timed a kick and completely missed the ball. It was now Barcelona's turn to pressurise the United players, forcing them into backward passes or long, hopeful balls forward.|$|E
5|$|The time-line for Salamis is {{difficult}} to establish with any certainty. Herodotus presents the battle as though it occurred directly after the capture of Athens, but nowhere explicitly states as much. If Thermopylae/Artemisium occurred in September, then {{this may be the}} case, but it is probably more likely that the Persians spent two or three weeks capturing Athens, refitting the fleet, and resupplying. Clearly though, at some point after capturing Athens, Xerxes held a council of war with the Persian fleet; Herodotus says this occurred at Phalerum. Artemisia, queen of Halicarnassus and commander of its naval squadron in Xerxes's fleet, tried to convince him to wait for the Allies to surrender believing that battle in the straits of Salamis was <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> risk. Nevertheless, Xerxes and his chief advisor Mardonius pressed for an attack.|$|E

5|$|Work Kommandos {{were very}} variable, but those in {{agriculture}} were generally considered better than ones in factories or mining, where conditions were worse and prisoners were vulnerable to Allied bombing raids. In {{rural areas of}} Germany, French prisoners replaced locals conscripted into the German army as agricultural labourers. Guarding Kommandos came {{to be regarded as}} <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> waste of manpower - it was thought unlikely that a prisoner would attempt to escape in a country where he did not know the language. This meant that, in practice, prisoners were allowed a wider measure of freedom compared to the camps. They were often viewed with curiosity by the German rural population, and the French prisoners were often allowed to mix quite freely with German civilians. Although unlawful, many French prisoners began relationships with German women.|$|E
5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included <b>an</b> <b>unnecessary</b> number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E
