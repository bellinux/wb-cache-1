5|$|The Ravagers and Quill's group {{join with}} the Nova Corps {{to confront the}} Dark <b>Aster</b> at Xandar, with Quill's group {{breaching}} the Dark <b>Aster</b> with the Milano. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Gamora fights and defeats Nebula, who then escapes, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the Dark <b>Aster.</b> The damaged Dark <b>Aster</b> crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, they use it to destroy Ronan.|$|E
5|$|At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton {{the wooded}} cliff and a narrow salt marsh are {{supported}} by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate. The site's principal interest {{and the reason for}} its designation as an SSSI is the presence of a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, and herbs include Field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum). The saltmarsh vegetation, which lies {{at the base of the}} cliff, is predominantly made up of Sea <b>Aster</b> (<b>Aster</b> tripolium) and English Scurvygrass (Cochlearia anglica). There are however two nationally scarce vascular plant species here as wellâ€“ Slender Hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and Long-stalked Orache (Atriplex longipes).|$|E
5|$|Behind the sea wall, {{the marshes}} were drained after the war, and reverted to farmland, but {{the bank was}} {{breached}} in the North Sea flood of 1953, returning the whole area to tidal saltmarsh dominated by sea <b>aster.</b> The {{construction of a new}} sea wall across the reserve created a shallow freshwater lagoon, with a reed bed on its northern side and a vegetation-free brackish marsh.|$|E
40|$|Unlike the oocytes of {{most other}} animal species, unfertilized murine oocytes contain cytoplasmic <b>asters,</b> which act as micro-tubule-organizing centers {{following}} fertilization.

40|$|Abstract. NuMA (Nuclear {{protein that}} {{associates}} with the Mitotic ~paratus) is a 235 -kD intranuclear protein that accumulates at the pericentrosomal {{region of the}} mitotic spindle in vertebrate cells. To determine if NuMA plays {{an active role in}} organizing the microtubules at the polar region of the mitotic spindle, we have developed a cell free system for the assembly of mitotic <b>asters</b> derived from synchronized cultured cells. Mitotic <b>asters</b> assembled in this extract are composed of microtubules arranged in a radial array that contain NuMA concentrated at the central core. The organization of microtubules into <b>asters</b> in this cell free system is dependent on NuMA because immunodepletion of NuMA from the extract results in randomly dispersed microtubules instead of organized mitotic <b>asters,</b> an...|$|R

40|$|Microtubule {{proteins}} {{isolated from}} calf brain will undergo gelation-contraction {{in the presence}} of ATP. We have now examined this process by video-enhanced contrast microscopy. After ATP addition to steady-state microtubules, slow (1 - 5 micron/min), linear movements of particles and microtubules toward aggregation centers occur. The resulting structures resemble mitotic spindle <b>asters.</b> During the time when gel contraction occurs, <b>asters</b> move (at 1 - 5 micron/min) toward other nearby <b>asters.</b> This is accompanied by the apparent shortening of the microtubules running between the <b>asters.</b> This is the first example of isolated microtubules undergoing a process that has similarities to half-spindle shortening during anaphase A. Formation of aster-like structures without preformed microtubule organizing centers raises the possibility that a similar process may contribute to microtubule organization in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Intracellular {{organization}} {{depends on}} a variety of molecular assembly processes; while some of these have been studied in simplified cell-free systems, others depend on the confined geometry of cells and cannot be reconstructed using bulk techniques. To study the latter processes in vitro, we fabricated microscopic chambers that simulate the closed environment of cells. We used these chambers to study the positioning of microtubule <b>asters.</b> Microtubule assembly alone, without the action of molecular motors, is sufficient to position <b>asters.</b> <b>Asters</b> with short microtubules move toward the position expected from symmetry; however, once the microtubules become long enough to buckle, symmetry is broken.

The drier areas contain maritime grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass. The reedbeds are dominated by common reed with saltmarsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also common in the various wetland habitats.|$|E
5|$|The volcano has two {{fields of}} fumaroles (<) {{in the area}} between Uturunku's two summits and has caused {{hydrothermal}} alteration of country rock. These fumaroles form visible clouds of steam. This heat may have been replenished from the APVC melt generating zone or survived since the last eruption of the volcano. Fumarolic activity is distinct enough to be visible from <b>ASTER</b> satellite image but barely visible from the ground.

40|$|Microtubule <b>asters</b> {{forming the}} mitotic spindle are {{assembled}} around two centrosomes {{through the process}} of dynamic instability in which microtubules alternate between growing and shrinking states. By modifying the dynamics of this assembly process, cell cycle enzymes, such as cdc 2 cyclin kinases, regulate length distributions in the <b>asters.</b> It is believed that the same enzymes control the number of assembled microtubules by changing the "nucleating activity" of the centrosomes. Here we show that assembly of microtubule <b>asters</b> may be strongly altered by effects connected with diffusion of tubulin monomers. Theoretical analysis of a simple model describing assembly of microtubule <b>asters</b> clearly shows the existence of a region surrounding the centrosome depleted in GTP tubulin. The number of assembled microtubules may in some cases be limited by this depletion effect rather than by the number of available nucleation sites on the centrosome...|$|R

Synonyms for L.sativa include Lactuca scariola var. sativa, L.scariola var. integrata and L.scariola var. integrifolia. L.scariola is itself a synonym for L.serriola, the common wild or prickly lettuce. L.sativa also has many identified taxonomic groups, subspecies and varieties, which delineate the various cultivar groups of domesticated lettuce. Lettuce is closely related to several Lactuca species from southwest Asia; the closest relationship is to L.serriola, an aggressive weed common in temperate and subtropical zones in much of the world.|$|E

5|$|Lettuce also {{suffers from}} several viral diseases, {{including}} big vein, which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and mosaic virus, which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves. <b>Aster</b> yellows are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves. Fungal diseases include powdery mildew and downy mildew, which cause leaves to mold and die and bottom rot, lettuce drop and gray mold, which cause entire plants to rot and collapse. Crowding lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases. Weeds {{can also be}} an issue, as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground. Transplanted lettuce (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing misshapen lettuce and lower yields. Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult. Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production. However, {{this has led to}} the development of herbicide-resistant weeds and prompted environmental and health concerns.|$|E

5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, sea club-rush, sea <b>aster</b> and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, redshank, great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E
5|$|The exit of Finland {{from the}} war on 3 September {{provided}} the political impetus for abandoning Estonia. The next day, Generaloberst Heinz Guderian suggested {{that it would not}} be possible to hold Ostland and ordered plans for the evacuation operation, codenamed KÃ¶nigsberg, to be drawn up.

After lunch, Guderian ordered that the KÃ¶nigsberg plan nevertheless be secretly initiated. On the next day, Oberst Natzmer visited the headquarters of Army Detachment Narwa to discuss details of the evacuation. On 11 September, the evacuation of Estonia was discussed in the Army Headquarters at length. On 15 September, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army Group, Generaloberst Ferdinand SchÃ¶rner, requested that Guderian convince Hitler to order the evacuation of German troops from the continental part of Estonia, codenamed Operation <b>Aster.</b> SchÃ¶rner emphasised that although the front was still holding, delaying the order would mean the units in Estonia would be trapped. Hitler agreed on 16 September.|$|E
5|$|The first soldier cabins {{were built}} in 1886 as part of Camp Sheridan {{and all of these}} were later removed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{origin of}} the zygotic {{centrosome}} {{is an important step}} in developmental biology. It is generally thought that sperm at fertilization plays a central role in forming the functional centrosome which subsequently organizes the first mitotic spindle. However, this view is not applicable in the case of parthenogenetic eggs which develop without the sperm contribution. To clarify the problem of the {{origin of the}} zygotic centrosome during parthenogenetic development, we studied a hymenopteran,Muscidifurax uniraptor. Antitubulin antibody revealed that after activation several <b>asters</b> assembled in the egg cytoplasm. The number of <b>asters</b> varied in relation to the cell cycle. They became visible from anaphase of the first meiotic division and increased in number as meiosis progressed, reaching a maximum at the first mitosis. From anaphaseâ€“telophase of the first mitosis they decreased in number and were no longer found during the third mitotic division. To elucidate the nature of these <b>asters</b> we performed an ultrastructural study with transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence with antibodies against anti-Î³-tubulin and CP 190. In this way we showed the presence in these <b>asters</b> of centrosomal components and centrioles. Our observations suggest that the cytoplasm ofMuscidifuraxeggs contains a pool of inactive centrosomal precursor proteins becoming able to nucleate microtubules into well-defined <b>asters</b> containing centrioles after activation...|$|R
