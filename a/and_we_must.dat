25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

The growth of television rights saw the format rebranded in the 1990s to include a group stage and permit multiple entrants. Arsenal had qualified for every Champions League season since 1998–99, but the club never progressed further than the quarter-final stage.

[...] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him reconsider retirement. On social networks, NoTeVayasLeo became a global trending topic, and even a playlist on Spotify.

That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up.

500|$|Philip Tilden, Churchill's architect, {{began work}} on the house in 1922 and the Churchills rented a {{farmhouse}} near Westerham, Churchill frequently visiting the site to observe progress. The two-year building programme, the ever-rising costs, which escalated from the initial estimate of £7,000 to over £18,000, {{and a series of}} construction difficulties, particularly relating to damp, soured relations between architect and client, and by 1924 Churchill and Tilden were barely on speaking terms. Legal arguments, conducted through their respective lawyers, rumbled on until 1927. Clementine's anxieties about the costs, both of building and subsequently living at Chartwell also continued. In September 1923 Churchill wrote to her, [...] "My beloved, I beg you not to worry about money, or to feel insecure. Chartwell is to be our home (<b>and)</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> endeavour to live there for many years." [...] Churchill finally moved into the house in April 1924, a letter dated 17 April of that year to Clementine begins, [...] "This is the first letter I have ever written from this place, and it is right that it should be to you".|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{difficulties}} {{with the two}} larger coins, little attention {{was given to the}} half eagle and quarter eagle until late 1907. [...] On November 28, 1907, Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou wrote in a letter that the double eagle design was to be used for the two small gold pieces. [...] On December 2, Mint Director Frank Leach instructed the Philadelphia Mint to prepare coinage dies for the small pieces, using the double eagle design. [...] Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber replied [...] a week later that {{it would be difficult to}} put all the legends that were required by law on the new pieces, such as the name of the country. [...] On the double eagle, [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] is placed on the edge, an impractical setting on pieces about the size of the nickel and dime. [...] Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis forwarded Barber's letter to Leach with his own note, stating, [...] "I know it will be difficult to put the inscription 'E Pluribus Unum' on the periphery of a quarter eagle, but I do not see where else it can [...] <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> try to do it".|$|E

500|$|By {{the middle}} of August 1797, after six weeks of {{constant}} easterly winds that kept his ships trapped in their harbour, De Winter decided that an attempt to join the French at Brest as {{the first stage of}} an invasion of Ireland was impractical and he abandoned the plan. In part this decision was due to the strength of Duncan's reconstituted fleet, which had increased to 17 ships of the line with the addition of the vessels returned from the Nore. Duncan's men were also better trained and more experienced than their Dutch counterparts, having spent considerably longer at sea and having been taught to fire three rounds a minute to the Dutch two. In addition to his concerns about the proficiency of his men, De Winter was also worried about their loyalty: the dominion of France over the Batavian Republic and the country's enforced participation in distant theatres of warfare were unpopular among the Dutch people. Although De Winter was an avowed republican, who had fought in the French Army against the Netherlands between 1793 and 1795, support for the House of Orange remained strong among the Dutch population and with the fleet's sailors. Wolfe Tone wrote in frustration that [...] "The destiny of Europe might have been changed for ever [...] [...] [...] the great occasion is lost, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> do as well as we can." ...|$|E
500|$|Because Mackintosh had {{intended}} to use Aurora as the party's main living quarters, most of the shore party's personal gear, food, equipment and fuel was still aboard when the ship departed. Although the sledging rations intended for Shackleton's depots had been landed, the ten stranded men were left with [...] "only the clothes on their backs". [...] Mackintosh [...] summarised their situation: [...] "We {{have to face the}} possibility that we may have to stay here, unsupported, for two years. [...] We cannot expect rescue before then, and so we must conserve and economize on what we have, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> seek and apply what substitutes we can gather". Their first recourse was to the food and materials from supplies left behind by Scott's and Shackleton's earlier expeditions. [...] These supplies provided a harvest of material, which enabled clothing, footwear and equipment to be improvised, while the party used seal meat and blubber as extra sources of food and fuel. [...] "Joyce's Famous Tailoring Shop" [...] fashioned clothes from a large canvas tent abandoned by Scott's expedition. Even a brand of tobacco—"Hut Point Mixture"—was concocted by Ernest Wild from sawdust, tea, coffee and a few dried herbs. [...] By these means the party equipped itself for the sledging journeys that lay ahead in the second season. On the last day of August Mackintosh recorded in his diary the work that had been completed during the winter, and ended: [...] "Tomorrow we start for Hut Point".|$|E
500|$|Throughout his {{literary}} career, Willis was well liked and {{known for his}} good nature amongst friends. Well traveled and clever, he had a striking appearance at six feet tall and was typically dressed elegantly. Many, however, remarked that Willis was effeminate, Europeanized, and guilty of [...] "Miss Nancyism". One editor called him [...] "an impersonal passive verb—a pronoun of the feminine gender". A contemporary caricature depicted him wearing a fashionable beaver hat and tightly closed coat and carrying a cane, reflecting Willis's wide reputation as a [...] "dandy". Willis put considerable effort into his appearance and his fashion sense, presenting himself {{as a member of}} an upcoming American aristocracy. As Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. once said, Willis was [...] "something between a remembrance of Count D'Orsay and an anticipation of Oscar Wilde". Publisher Charles Frederick Briggs once wrote that [...] "Willis was too Willisy". He described his writings as the [...] "novelty and gossip of the hour" [...] and was not necessarily concerned about facts but with the [...] "material of conversation and speculation, which may be mere rumor, may be the truth". Willis's behavior in social groups annoyed fellow poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. [...] "He is too artificial", Longfellow wrote to his friend George Washington Greene. [...] "And his poetry has now lost one of its greatest charms for me—its sincerity". E. Burke Fisher, a journalist in Pittsburgh, wrote that [...] "Willis is a kind of national pet <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> regard his faults as we do those of a spoiled stripling, in the hope that he will amend".|$|E
