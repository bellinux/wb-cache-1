5|$|<b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> the {{earliest}} cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4.|$|E

25|$|Archimedes' cattle problem; its {{solution}} (absent {{from the}} manuscript) requires solving an indeterminate quadratic equation (which reduces {{to what would}} later be misnamed Pell's equation). <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> such equations were first successfully treated by the Indian school. It is not known whether Archimedes himself had a method of solution.|$|E

25|$|Marlovians {{argue that}} if Frizer, Poley and Skeres could lie about what happened, they {{could just as easily}} have been lying about the {{identity}} of the corpse itself. In other words, that although they claimed it was Marlowe's—and <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> they were the only ones there in a position to identify him—it was in fact someone else's body that the jury was called upon to examine.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} data sources, {{scientists}} {{think that the}} most abundant chemical elements in the martian crust, besides silicon and oxygen, are iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. These elements are major components of the minerals comprising igneous rocks. The elements titanium, chromium, manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, sodium, and chlorine are less abundant but are still important components of many accessory minerals in rocks and of secondary minerals (weathering products) in the dust and soils (the regolith). Hydrogen is present as water (H2O) ice and in hydrated minerals. Carbon occurs as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and sometimes as dry ice at the poles. An unknown amount of carbon is also stored in carbonates. Molecular nitrogen (N2) makes up 2.7 percent of the atmosphere. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> organic compounds are absent except for a trace of methane detected in the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|T-Cell-B-Cell {{discordance}} – A normal {{immune response}} {{is assumed to}} involve B and T cell responses to the same antigen, even if we know that B cells and T cells recognise very different things: conformations {{on the surface of}} a molecule for B cells and pre-processed peptide fragments of proteins for T cells. However, there is nothing <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> that requires this. All that is required is that a B cell recognising antigen X endocytoses and processes a protein Y (normally =X) and presents it to a T cell. Roosnek and Lanzavecchia showed that B cells recognising IgGFc could get help from any T cell responding to an antigen co-endocytosed with IgG by the B cell as part of an immune complex. In coeliac disease it seems likely that B cells recognising tissue transglutamine are helped by T cells recognising gliadin.|$|E

500|$|Alan Baker broadly agrees, stating, [...] "There is no {{evidence}} that this was common practice among gladiators. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> the only time this phrase was used was at an event staged by Claudius." [...] Plass notes that [...] "it is hard to see why or how the phrase came to be used on this occasion if it was not a regular formula. On the other hand, if it was something that Claudius might expect to hear it would more naturally serve in its role as a feed line for his repartee portraying his invincible gaucherie." [...] He comments on the distancing effect of the Latin source and the first person of the Greek source and notes that the interpretation and response by the fighters [...] "seems to be a maneuver within rules governing clemency in the arena".|$|E
2500|$|In the Annals of Ulster {{and in the}} Book of Leinster, Findláech {{is called}} rí Alban, which meant [...] "King of Scotland" [...] in the Gaelic language. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> from other sources, the only rí Alban of the time was Máel Coluim mac Cináeda, i.e. Máel Coluim II, so this title can only mean that Findláech, as ruler of Moray, was {{understood}} by many {{to have been the}} High-King of all northern Britain.|$|E
2500|$|News of the {{shooting}} rampage at Seattle's Jewish Federation building last month involved the usual avoidance of the term [...] "terrorism."

2500|$|Diophantus' {{work has}} had a large {{influence}} in history. Editions of [...] Arithmetica exerted a profound influence {{on the development of}} algebra in Europe in the late sixteenth and through the 17th and 18th centuries. [...] Diophantus and his works have also influenced Arab mathematics and were of great fame among Arab mathematicians. Diophantus' work created a foundation for work on algebra and in fact much of advanced mathematics is based on algebra. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> Diophantus did not affect the lands of the Orient much and how much he affected India is a matter of debate.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, {{others have}} said that the zero {{mortality}} rate from the Fukushima incident confirms their opinion that nuclear fission is the only viable option available to replace fossil fuels. Journalist George Monbiot wrote [...] "Why Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power." [...] In it he said, [...] "As a result of the disaster at Fukushima, I am no longer nuclear-neutral. I now support the technology." [...] He continued, [...] "A crappy old plant with inadequate safety features was hit by a monster earthquake and a vast tsunami. The electricity supply failed, knocking out the cooling system. The reactors began to explode and melt down. The disaster exposed a familiar legacy of poor design and corner-cutting. Yet, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> no one has yet received a lethal dose of radiation." ...|$|E
2500|$|French written lute music began, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> with Pierre Attaingnant's ( [...] 1494 – [...] 1551) prints, which {{comprised}} preludes, {{dances and}} intabulations. Particularly {{important was the}} Italian composer Albert de Rippe (1500–1551), who worked in France and composed polyphonic fantasias of considerable complexity. His work was published posthumously by his pupil, Guillaume de Morlaye (born [...] 1510), who, however, did not pick up the complex polyphony of de Rippe. French lute music declined during {{the second part of}} the 16th century; however, various changes to the instrument (the increase of diapason strings, new tunings, etc.) prompted an important change in style that led, during the early Baroque, to the celebrated style brisé: broken, arpeggiated textures that influenced Johann Jakob Froberger's suites. The French Baroque school is exemplified by composers such as Ennemond Gaultier (1575–1651), Denis Gaultier (1597/1603–1672), François Dufaut (before 1604–before 1672) and many others. The last stage of French lute music is exemplified by Robert de Visée ( [...] 1655–1732/3), whose suites exploit the instrument's possibilities to the fullest.|$|E
