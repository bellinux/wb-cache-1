50|$|Communication {{is the key}} to {{many species}} interactions. In particular, many species rely on vocalizations for {{information}} such as potential mates, nearby predators, or food availability. Human changes in the habitat modify <b>acoustic</b> <b>environments</b> and may {{make it more difficult for}} animals to communicate. Humans may alter <b>acoustic</b> <b>environments</b> by modifying background noise levels, modifying habitat, or changing species composition. These changes in <b>acoustic</b> <b>environments</b> can mask the vocalizations of various species. Because humans can exert such strong changes on <b>acoustic</b> <b>environments,</b> sensory ecologists have been particularly interested in researching and understanding how organisms react to these changes.|$|R

2500|$|Direct-field {{acoustic}} testing, or DFAT, is {{a technique}} used for acoustic testing of aerospace structures by subjecting them to sound waves created by an array of acoustic drivers. The method uses electro-dynamic acoustic speakers, arranged around the test article to provide a uniform, well-controlled, direct sound field at {{the surface of the}} unit under test. The system employs high capability acoustic drivers, powerful audio amplifiers, a narrow-band multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) controller and precision laboratory microphones to produce an <b>acoustic</b> <b>environment</b> that can simulate a helicopter, aircraft, jet engine or launch vehicle sound pressure field. A high level system is capable of overall sound pressure levels in the 125–147dB for more than one minute over a frequency range from 25Hz to 10kHz.|$|E
2500|$|They {{have been}} more {{recently}} found in dense forests like the Amazon where they may replace spoken dialogue in the villages while hunting or fishing {{to overcome the pressure}} of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>environment.</b> The main advantage of whistling speech is that it allows the speaker to cover much larger distances (typically [...] but up to [...] in mountains and less in reverberating forests) than ordinary speech, without the strain (and lesser range) of shouting. More specifically, whistle speech can reach a loudness of 130dB, and the transmission range can reach up to 10km (as verified in La Gomera, Canary Island). The long range of whistling is enhanced by the mountainous terrain found in areas where whistled languages are used. Many areas with such languages work hard to preserve their ancient traditions, in the face of rapidly advancing telecommunications systems in many areas.|$|E

2500|$|The sound {{pressure}} output is measured at (or mathematically scaled to be {{equivalent to a}} measurement taken at) one meter from the loudspeaker and on-axis (directly in front of it), {{under the condition that}} the loudspeaker is radiating into an infinitely large space and mounted on an infinite baffle. Clearly then, sensitivity does not correlate precisely with efficiency, as it also depends on the directivity of the driver being tested and the <b>acoustic</b> <b>environment</b> in front of the actual loudspeaker. For example, a cheerleader's horn produces more sound output in the direction it is pointed by concentrating sound waves from the cheerleader in one direction, thus [...] "focusing" [...] them. The horn also improves impedance matching between the voice and the air, which produces more acoustic power for a given speaker power. In some cases, improved impedance matching (via careful enclosure design) lets the speaker produce more acoustic power.|$|E

50|$|The National Park Service Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division {{actively}} {{protects the}} soundscapes and acoustic environments {{in national parks}} across the country. It is important to distinguish and define certain key terms as used by the National Park Service. Acoustic resources are physical sound sources, including both natural sounds (wind, water, wildlife, vegetation) and cultural and historic sounds (battle reenactments, tribal ceremonies, quiet reverence). The <b>acoustic</b> <b>environment</b> is the combination of all the acoustic resources within a given area - natural sounds and human-caused sounds - as modified by the environment. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>environment</b> includes sound vibrations made by geological processes, biological activity, and even sounds that are inaudible to most humans, such as bat echolocation calls. Soundscape is the component of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>environment</b> that can be perceived and comprehended by the humans. The character {{and quality of the}} soundscape influence human perceptions of an area, providing a sense of place that differentiates it from other regions. Noise refers to sound which is unwanted, either because of its effects on humans and wildlife, or its interference with the perception or detection of other sounds. Cultural soundscapes include opportunities for appropriate transmission of cultural and historic sounds that are fundamental components of the purposes and values for which the parks were established.|$|E
