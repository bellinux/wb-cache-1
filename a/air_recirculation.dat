40|$|An air {{conditioning}} system economizer, investigated in this thesis, consisted of three dampers, an outdoor <b>air,</b> a <b>recirculation,</b> and a discharge damper. The purpose of an economizer is to control {{the ratio of the}} outdoor air flow rate to the <b>recirculation</b> <b>air</b> flow rate. The dampers were opposed blade type and had equal sizes. They were coupled through a control system. Two control strategies were investigated. In the first strategy, the three economizer dampers were coupled so that the outdoor air and discharge damper open as the recirculation damper closes. In a second strategy, the discharge damper was always open during operation and the outdoor <b>air</b> and <b>recirculation</b> dampers were coupled so that the outdoor air damper opens as the recirculation damper closes. The two coupled dampers control strategy will require slightly less power than three coupled damper strategy. The study showed that the linearization of throat area versus control signal is the most important factor for reducing power, whether the three coupled it is or two coupled dampers control strategy is used. linearization provides good control of the air flow rates, from 0 % to 95 %.

5000|$|The harmful {{properties}} of lunar dust {{are not well}} known. However, based on studies of dust found on Earth, {{it is expected that}} exposure to lunar dust will result in greater risks to health both from direct exposure (acute) and if exposure is over time (chronic). This is because lunar dust is more chemically reactive and has larger surface areas composed of sharper jagged edges than Earth dust. If the chemical reactive particles are deposited in the lungs, they may cause respiratory disease. Long-term exposure to the dust may cause a more serious respiratory disease similar to silicosis. During lunar exploration, the astronauts' spacesuits will become contaminated with lunar dust. The dust will be released into the atmosphere when the suits are removed. The methods used to mitigate exposure will include providing high <b>air</b> <b>recirculation</b> rates in the airlock, the use of a [...] "Double Shell Spacesuit", the use of dust shields, the use of high-grade magnetic separation, and the use of solar flux to sinter and melt the regolith.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCapital repairs {{of public}} {{buildings}} and, in particular, insulating external wall increase {{the proportion of}} heat consumption by the ventilation system in the total building energy consumption. Surplus internal heat {{can be observed in}} rooms with high heat generation values (over 30 W/m 2) even during the heating season. Using surplus internal heat to heat the outdoor air during the heating season can help reduce the heat consumption of the ventilation system. The probability of excess internal heat occurrence in public buildings during the heating season has been analyzed. To this end, changes in specific thermal losses in buildings of various volumes occurring over the heating season in various Russian regions with different climate conditions have been compared with specific internal heat generation values typical of public buildings. Specific heat losses have been identified on the basis of rated values of the building's specific heat insulation value. The application area of ventilation systems with local <b>recirculation</b> <b>air</b> diffusers is outlined based on the outcomes of the analysis; it is concluded that these systems have a huge energy saving potential, both in case of reconstruction or deep renovation of an existing building, and when new public buildings are designed. On analysing the characteristics of ventilation systems with local <b>recirculation</b> <b>air</b> diffusers, it has been established that these have an advantage over traditional through-flow ventilation systems, or central recirculation systems. A local <b>recirculation</b> <b>air</b> diffuser delivering outdoor air inside the building at a low temperature (from + 6 °C) has been designed. The supply air is heated to the comfort temperature as it enters the working area by mixing the outdoor air with the internal air, thus assimilating internal surplus heat. A design solution for the <b>recirculation</b> <b>air</b> diffuser is proposed. Computer simulation of air flows generated by the <b>recirculation</b> <b>air</b> diffuser has confirmed that comfort parameters of the supply air jet can be reached at the inlet to the work area when outdoor air is supplied at temperatures starting from + 6 °C...|$|R

Results found fractional and on-off strategies to be effective ways of maintaining carbon dioxide concentrations below 1100 ppm, while timed control strategies produced unacceptable average concentrations above 1200 ppm and 3500 ppm for 1 occupant and 4 occupant scenarios under various driving cycles, consequently resulting in poor air quality...|$|E

40|$|Maintaining {{relative}} humidity below 60 % for residential houses in humid climates promotes a healthy indoor environment.

This new air conditioning system combines a ventilation unit with a conventional <b>recirculation</b> <b>air</b> conditioning unit. Although successful in maintaining indoor humidity levels below 60 %, the new air conditioning system will require more electric energy to provide the additional dehumidification. However, this penalty is shown to be offset by reductions in sensible load during a summer week, which should result in lower energy consumption and peak electric demand during that period. The performance of this new air conditioning system is demonstrated using FSEC 3. 0, a building energy simulation program developed by the Florida Solar Energy Center, to simulate the heat and moisture transport occurring within a prototypical residence located in Austin, Texas...|$|R
40|$|Prior studies {{demonstrate}} that <b>air</b> <b>recirculation</b> can reduce exposure to nanoparticles in vehicle cabins. However when people occupy confined spaces, <b>air</b> <b>recirculation</b> {{can lead to}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) accumulation which can potentially lead to deleterious effects on cognitive function. This study proposes a fractional <b>air</b> <b>recirculation</b> system for reducing nanoparticle concentration while simultaneously suppressing CO 2 levels in the cabin. Several recirculation scenarios were tested using a custom-programmed HVAC (heat, ventilation, air conditioning) unit that varied the recirculation door angle in the test vehicle. Operating the recirculation system with a standard cabin filter reduced particle concentrations to 1000 particles/cm(3), although CO 2 levels rose to 3000 ppm. When as little as 25 % fresh air was introduced (75 % recirculation), CO 2 levels dropped to 1000 ppm, while particle concentrations remained below 5000 particles/cm(3). We found that nanoparticles were removed selectively during recirculation and demonstrated the trade-off between cabin CO 2 concentration and cabin particle concentration using fractional <b>air</b> <b>recirculation.</b> Data showed significant increases in CO 2 levels during 100 % recirculation. For various fan speeds, recirculation fractions of 50 - 75 % maintained lower CO 2 levels in the cabin, while still reducing particulate levels. We recommend fractional recirculation as a simple method to reduce occupants' exposures to particulate matter and CO 2 in vehicles. A design with several fractional recirculation settings could allow air exchange adequate for reducing both particulate and CO 2 exposures. Developing this technology could lead to reductions in airborne nanoparticle exposure, while also mitigating safety risks from CO 2 accumulation.

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new {{operating}} {{strategy for the}} outdoor, discharge, and <b>recirculation</b> <b>air</b> dampers of the economizer in VAV system, called split-signal damper control strategy. The strategy controls the outdoor air by only one damper while keeping the remaining dampers full open. The discharge or <b>recirculation</b> <b>air</b> damper is modulated to control the amount of outdoor air introduced into the system while keeping the two remaining dampers full open. Since at least two dampers are always kept fully open during the occupied times, the strategy can provide a minimum static pressure drop in economizer dampers and results in minimum energy use in return and supply fans. An additional advantage is that the proposed strategy prevents reverse airflow through the discharge air damper of a VAV system that uses a volume matching control strategy. The proposed strategy along with the existing strategies such as the three-coupled dampers used in most existing system and the two-coupled dampers are evaluated on an existing system using 1 -year long measured data set, along with an economizer damper model developed and validated in this paper.
