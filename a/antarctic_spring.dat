40|$|Since 2009, the ultra-wideband snow radar on Operation IceBridge (OIB; a NASA {{airborne}} {{mission to}} survey the polar ice covers) has acquired data in annual campaigns conducted during the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>springs.</b> Progressive improvements in radar hardware and data processing methodologies have led to improved data quality for subsequent retrieval of snow depth. Existing retrieval algorithms differ {{in the way the}} air–snow (a–s) and snow–ice (s–i) interfaces are detected and localized in the radar returns and in how the system limitations are addressed (e. g., noise, resolution). In 2014, the Snow Thickness On Sea Ice Working Group (STOSIWG) was formed and tasked with investigating how radar data quality affects snow depth retrievals and how retrievals from the various algorithms differ. The goal is to understand the limitations of the estimates and to produce a well-documented, long-term record {{that can be used for}} understanding broader changes in the Arctic climate system. Here, we assess five retrieval algorithms by comparisons with field measurements from two ground-based campaigns, including the BRomine, Ozone, and Mercury EXperiment (BROMEX) at Barrow, Alaska; a field program by Environment and Climate Change Canada at Eureka, Nunavut; and available climatology and snowfall from ERA-Interim reanalysis. The aim is to examine available algorithms and to use the assessment results to inform the development of future approaches. We present results from these assessments and highlight key considerations for the production of a long-term, calibrated geophysical record of springtime snow thickness over Arctic sea ice...|$|R

The <b>spring</b> <b>Antarctic</b> ozone depletion affects the Southern Hemisphere lower-stratospheric circulation in late spring/early summer.

This feedback loop, together with the ozone-related photochemical interaction, leads to the upward tendency of lower-stratospheric zonal wind in austral summer. In addition, the stratosphere–troposphere coupling, facilitated by ozone-related dynamics and the Southern Annular Mode, cooperates to relay the zonal wind anomalies to the upper troposphere.

Ribosomal DNA sequence analysis of the natural bacterioplankton communities revealed an initial springtime community composed of three evenly abundant bacterial classes: Cytophaga-Flavobacteria- Bacteroidetes (CFB), Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria.

Here, we focus on the influence of the methane oxidation cycle on 'ozone hole' chemistry through its effect on HOx and ClOx radicals. We demonstrate the great potential importance of the heterogeneous reaction HCl + HOCl yields Cl 2 + H 2 O and the gasphase reaction ClO + CH 3 O 2 yields ClOO + CH 3 O under sunlight conditions in polar spring. Under these conditions, the heterogeneous reaction is the main sink for HOx radicals. Through this channel, the HCl reservoir may be almost completely depleted. The gas phase reaction may control the levels of the CH 3 O 2 radical, provided that high levels of ClO exist. Otherwise this radical initiates a sequence of reactions leading to a considerable loss of active chlorine. Moreover, the production of HOx radicals is reduced, and thereby the efficiency of the heterogeneous reaction limited. The two reactions together may accomplish the complete conversion of HCl into active chlorine, thereby leading to a rapid destruction of ozone...|$|R

The fact that, on occasions, ozone depletion events were observed at all coastal sites simultaneously, suggests the depleted air mass had a scale of at least 1200 km.

40|$|Theories {{have been}} {{proposed}} to relate the reduction of O 3 during <b>Antarctic</b> <b>spring</b> to catalytic cycles involving chlorine and bromine species. A necessary condition for any chlorine-catalyzed scheme is that a large fraction of the chlorine {{must be in the}} form of ClO in the lower stratosphere.

Model calculations based on the above mechanisms predict considerable amounts of OClO and Cl 2 O 2, particularly during the night. Results of calculations of the diurnal variations of ClO, OClO, and Cl 2 O 2 during <b>Antarctic</b> <b>spring</b> are presented for different cases. Results from the calculations suggest that coincident measurements of the total column abundance and diurnal variation of ClO and OClO may help constrain key aspects of the proposed chemical mechanisms. Removal of O 3 by the catalytic cycle involving Cl 2 O 2 could be as important as that involving BrO for present levels of chlorine, provided that Cl 2 O 2 photolyzes rapidly to yield Cl and ClO 2.
