In November, the band performed the first (of many) strangely named concerts: Philadelic Music for Simian Hominids, <b>a</b> <b>multimedia</b> event arranged by the group's former landlord, Mike Leonard, at Hornsey College of Art.

5|$|Prior to the game's release, an {{official}} prelude story {{was published by}} way of <b>a</b> <b>multimedia</b> web site.

Dark Horse later published a 184-page hardcover book featuring concept art and developer commentary. On 20 June 2013, another official prelude story was published, this time set months {{before the start of the}} game, and centring on the character of Nilin.

5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using <b>a</b> <b>multimedia</b> environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E
