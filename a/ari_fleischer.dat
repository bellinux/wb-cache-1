She interrupted him, saying: [...] "Palestinian people are fighting for their land." [...] He responded: [...] "I think that the killing of innocents is a category entirely different.

25|$|In October 2002, {{four months}} before the United States invaded Iraq, Ramadan {{suggested}} U.S. President George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein settle their difference in a duel. He reasoned this would not only serve {{as an alternative to}} a war that was certain to damage Iraq's infrastructure, but that it would also reduce the suffering of the Iraqi and American peoples. Ramadan's offer included the possibility that a group of US officials would face off with a group of Iraqi officials of same or similar rank (President v. President, Vice President v. Vice President, etc.). Ramadan proposed that the duel be held in a neutral land, with each party using the same weapons, and with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan presiding as the supervisor.

Former White House Press Secretary <b>Ari</b> <b>Fleischer</b> said, [...] "She is more popular, and more welcome, in many parts of the country than the president...

[...] While defending Pipes's nomination, White House spokesman <b>Ari</b> <b>Fleischer</b> distanced Bush from Pipes's views, saying that Bush [...] "disagrees with Pipes about whether Islam is a peaceful religion".|$|E

In Palm Beach County, Florida, Buchanan received 3,407 voteswhich some saw as inconsistent with Palm Beach County's liberal leanings, its large Jewish population and his showing {{in the rest of}} the state. As a result of the county's now-infamous [...] "butterfly ballot", he is suspected to have gained thousands of inadvertent votes. Bush spokesman <b>Ari</b> <b>Fleischer</b> stated, [...] "Palm Beach county is a Pat Buchanan stronghold and that's why Pat Buchanan received 3,407 votes there."

2500|$|On June 7, Thomas {{abruptly}} tendered her resignation from Hearst Newspapers. The next day, in {{an interview}} on NBC's Today Show, President Obama called her remarks [...] "offensive" [...] and [...] "out of line" [...] and said her retirement was [...] "the right decision." [...] He remarked that it was a [...] "shame" [...] her celebrated career had to end in such controversy, {{and at the same time}} he recognized her long service covering U.S. presidents, calling her [...] "a real institution in Washington." [...] Her comments also garnered rebukes from numerous others, including White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, former White House Press Secretary <b>Ari</b> <b>Fleischer,</b> former special counsel to and White House spokesman for President Bill Clinton, Lanny Davis, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Hoover Institution senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the White House {{declined}} {{to take a}} stand on the amendment, although Press Secretary <b>Ari</b> <b>Fleischer</b> relayed that President George W. Bush believed that marriage was {{between a man and a}} woman. In his State of the Union address on January 20, 2004, President Bush alluded to the recent court decision in Massachusetts ordering the state to recognize same-sex marriages beginning in May: [...] "Activist judges ... have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives.... If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process." [...] On February 24, after the same Massachusetts court reiterated that it was insisting on marriage and that civil unions were insufficient, Bush expressed support for this amendment for the first time. In August, Vice President Dick Cheney neither endorsed nor condemned the FMA, arguing that same-sex marriage is an issue for the states to decide. In 2009, Cheney stated his support for same-sex marriage on a state-by-state basis.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2007, {{during the}} first week of Scooter Libby's trial, it was {{revealed}} in court proceedings that former White House Press Secretary <b>Ari</b> <b>Fleischer</b> was granted immunity from prosecution by Patrick Fitzgerald in February 2004. Fleischer reportedly acknowledged discussing Valerie Plame with reporters, but promised to cooperate with Fitzgerald's investigation only if granted immunity. When the deal was struck, Fleischer told Fitzgerald that he had discussed Plame with David Gregory of NBC News and John Dickerson of Time in July 2003, days before leaving his job at the White House. Fleischer testified that he first learned about Plame and her CIA affiliation during a July 7, 2003, lunch with Libby. Fleischer also testified that four days later, while aboard Air Force One and during a five-day trip to several African nations, he overheard Dan Bartlett reference Plame. According to Fleischer, Bartlett stated to no one in particular [...] "His wife sent him...She works at the CIA." [...] Shortly after overhearing Bartlett, Fleischer proceeded to discuss Plame with Gregory and Dickerson. According to Fleischer, neither Gregory nor Dickerson showed much interest in the information. Dickerson has denied Fleischer's account. Gregory has declined to comment on the matter. With regard to the immunity deal, Fitzgerald told the court [...] "I didn't want to give [...] immunity. I did so reluctantly." [...] Libby's attorney, William Jeffress, sought to learn more about the deal, telling the court [...] "I'm not sure we're getting the full story here." [...] According to Matt Apuzzo of the Associated Press, [...] "Prosecutors normally insist on an informal account of what a witness will say before agreeing to such a deal. It's known in legal circles as a proffer, and Fitzgerald said [...] he never got one from Fleischer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Testifying as a {{prosecution}} witness, Russert {{said that although}} he and Libby did indeed speak on July 10, 2003, they never discussed Plame during their conversation. Libby had claimed he had forgotten {{by the time of}} the conversation with Russert that he had earlier learned Ms. Plame's job from Cheney around June 12, 2003. Libby also testified to the federal grand jury that when Russert purportedly told him about Plame, he had absolutely no memory of having heard the information earlier from anyone else, including Cheney, and was thus [...] "taken aback" [...] when Russert told him. Libby told the FBI that Russert told him on July 10 or 11, 2003, that she worked at the CIA and [...] "all the reporters knew that." [...] In his opening argument, Fitzgerald, referring to Libby's conversation with Russert on July 10, said: [...] "You can't be startled about something on Thursday [...] that you told other people about on Monday [...] and Tuesday [...]" [...] Former White House press secretary <b>Ari</b> <b>Fleischer</b> testified as {{a prosecution}} witness that on July 7, 2003, Libby told Fleischer, [...] "Ambassador Wilson was sent by his wife. His wife works for the CIA." [...] Fleischer testified that Libby referred to Wilson's wife by her maiden name, Valerie Plame, and [...] "he added it was hush-hush, on the Q.T., and that most people didn't know it." [...] Libby was also alleged by prosecutors to have lied to the FBI and a federal grand jury in claiming that when he mentioned Plame's name to two reporters—Matthew Cooper, then of Time magazine, and Judith Miller, then of The New York Times—he was careful to point out to them he was simply repeating rumors that he had heard from Russert. Cooper and Miller testified that Libby stated no such qualifications to them in telling them about Plame.|$|E
