40|$|African {{manatees}} (Trichechus senegalensis) and crocodiles {{are threatened}} species {{in parts of}} their range. In West Africa, crocodiles may constitute the main predators for manatees apart from humans. Here, we explore the macro-habitat selection of manatees and two species of <b>crocodiles</b> (West <b>African</b> <b>crocodiles</b> Crocodylus suchus and dwarf crocodile Osteolaemus tetraspis) in the Niger Delta (Nigeria), testing the hypotheses that (i) manatees may avoid crocodiles {{in order to minimize}} risks of predation, and (ii) the two crocodile species do compete. The study was carried out between 1994 and 2010 with a suite of different field techniques. We observed that the main macro-habitat types were freshwater rivers and coastal lagoons for manatees, mangroves for West <b>African</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> and rivers and creeks for dwarf crocodiles, with (i) the three species differing significantly in terms of their macro-habitat type selection, and (ii) significant seasonal influence on habitat selection of each species. Null models for niche overlap showed a significantly lower overlap in macro-habitat type use between manatee and crocodiles, whereas the two crocodiles were relatively similar. Null model analyses did not indicate any competitive interactions between crocodiles. On the other hand, manatees avoided macro-habitats where crocodiles, and especially West <b>African</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> are abundant...|$|R

50|$|Paga Crocodile Pond is {{a sacred}} pond in Paga in the Upper East Region of Ghana, which is {{inhabited}} by West <b>African</b> <b>crocodiles.</b> Due to the friendliness of the reptiles, it has become popular among tourists and the pond is now reliant on tourism to ensure the population of crocodiles remain fed and healthy.|$|R
50|$|The pond {{is located}} in Paga in the Upper East Region of Ghana, and is 44 km outside Bolgatanga, the {{regional}} capital.

5000|$|In {{most of its}} range, the West <b>African</b> <b>crocodile</b> inhabits forested regions, but it is {{also found}} widely in more open habitats. In Mauritania it has adapted to the arid desert {{environment}} of the Sahara-Sahel by staying in caves or burrows in a state of aestivation during the driest periods, leading to the alternative common name desert crocodile. When it rains, these desert crocodiles gather at gueltas. In much of its range, the West <b>African</b> <b>crocodile</b> may come into contact with other crocodile species and {{there appears to be a}} level of habitat segregation between them. The Nile crocodile typically prefers large seasonal rivers in savannah or plains, but the West <b>African</b> <b>crocodile</b> generally prefers lagoons and wetlands in forested regions, at least where the two species may come into contact. The details of this probable segregations remains to be confirmed for certain. [...] In a study of habitat use by the three crocodile species in Liberia (West African, slender-snouted and dwarf), it was found that the West <b>African</b> <b>crocodile</b> typically occupied larger, more open waterways consisting of river basins and mangrove swamps, and was the species most tolerant of brackish waters. In comparison, the slender-snouted crocodile typically occupies rivers within forest interiors, while dwarf crocodiles are distributed in smaller rivers (mainly tributaries), streams and brooks also within forested areas.|$|E

50|$|The West <b>African</b> <b>{{crocodile}}</b> or desert crocodile (Crocodylus suchus) is {{a species}} of crocodile related to - and often confused with - the larger and more aggressive Nile crocodile (C. niloticus).|$|E
50|$|The West <b>African</b> <b>crocodile</b> inhabits much of West and Central Africa, ranging east to South Sudan and Uganda, {{and south}} to Democratic Republic of the Congo (in all three {{countries}} {{it may come}} into contact with Nile crocodiles). Other countries where found include Mauritania, Benin, Liberia, Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Gabon, Togo, Ivory Coast and Republic of Congo. As late as the 1920s, museums continued to obtain West <b>African</b> <b>crocodile</b> specimens from the southern Nile, but today the species has disappeared from this river.|$|E

Elephant poaching, particularly {{in the south of}} the country in areas such as Zakouma National Park, is a severe problem. The small group of surviving West <b>African</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in the Ennedi Plateau represents one of the last colonies known in the Sahara today.|$|R
50|$|Three {{species of}} {{crocodiles}} reported are: slender-snouted crocodile (Mecistpos cataphractus), West <b>African</b> dwarf <b>crocodile</b> (Osteolaemus tetraspis) and West African crocodile; {{the first two}} are on the endangered list.|$|R

50|$|The dwarf {{crocodile}} (Osteolaemus tetraspis), {{also known}} commonly as the African dwarf crocodile, broad-snouted crocodile, or bony crocodile, is an <b>African</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{that is also}} the smallest extant crocodile species. Recent sampling has identified three genetically distinct populations. Some feel that the findings should elevate the subspecies to full species status.|$|E
50|$|Evidence exists of Nile {{crocodiles}} from cooler climates, {{like the}} southern tip of Africa, being smaller, and may reach maximum lengths of only 4 m. A smaller population from Mali, the Sahara Desert and elsewhere in West Africa reaches only 2 to 3 m in length, but it is now largely recognized as a separate species, the West <b>African</b> <b>crocodile.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although no {{subspecies}} {{are currently}} formally recognized, {{as many as}} seven have been proposed, mostly due to variations in appearance and size noted in various populations through Africa. These have consisted of: C. n. africanus (informally named the East <b>African</b> Nile <b>crocodile),</b> C. n. chamses (or the West <b>African</b> Nile <b>crocodile),</b> C. n. corviei (the South <b>African</b> Nile <b>crocodile),</b> C. n. madagascariensis (Malagasy or Madagascar Nile crocodile, regionally also known as the Croco Mada, which translates to Malagasy crocodile), C. n. niloticus (would be the nominate subspecies, or the Ethiopian Nile crocodile), C. n. pauciscutatus (Kenyan Nile crocodile), C. (n.) suchus (now widely perceived by crocodilian biologists as a separate species). In a study of the morphology of the various populations, including C. (n.) suchus, {{it was found that the}} appearance of the Nile crocodile sensu lato was more variable than any other currently recognized crocodile species and that at least some of theses variations were related to locality.|$|R

Product formation was inhibited by BPB, a specific PLA 2 inhibitor, confirming that the activity was {{a direct result of the}} presence of serum PLA 2. Kinetic analysis showed that C. niloticus serum produced product more rapidly than M. cataphractus or O. tetraspis. Serum from all three species exhibited temperature-dependent PLA 2 activities but with slightly different thermal profiles.

50|$|The {{research}} {{already has}} yielded pertinent observations that provide inside into crocodile attacks. It was observed that most attacks on humans occur from bites of Saltwater crocodile as against the popular understanding of Nile crocodiles taking the top spot. The broad category of Nile crocodile attacks were segmented into West <b>African</b> <b>crocodile</b> and Crocodylus niloticus (the Nile Crocodile) species {{to get a}} clear understanding of their respective attack zones.|$|E
50|$|The Ogooué Basin is 223,856 km2, {{of which}} 173,000 km2 or 73 percent lies within Gabon.

All three species of <b>African</b> <b>crocodile,</b> for instance, occur in the river: the Nile crocodile, the dwarf crocodile, and the slender-snouted crocodile.

Relict populations of the West <b>African</b> <b>crocodile</b> persisted in the Draa river until the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} {{previously}} thought to extend in range {{into the whole}} of West and Central Africa, but these populations are now typically recognized as a distinct species, the West <b>African</b> (or desert) <b>crocodile.</b> The distributional boundaries between these species were poorly understood, but following several studies, they are now better known. West <b>African</b> <b>crocodiles</b> are found throughout much of West and Central Africa, ranging east to South Sudan and Uganda where the species may {{come into contact with}} the Nile crocodile. Nile crocodiles are absent from most of West and Central Africa, but range into the latter region in eastern and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and along the Central African coastal Atlantic region (as far north to Cameroon). There is likely a level of habitat segregation between the two species, but this remains to be confirmed for certain.|$|R
