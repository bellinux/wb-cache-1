25|$|Title {{insurance}} differs {{in several}} respects from {{other types of}} insurance. Where most insurance is a contract where the insurer indemnifies or guarantees another party against a possible specific type of loss (such as an accident or death) at a future date, title insurance generally insures against losses caused by title problems that have their source in past events. This often results in the curing of title defects or the elimination of <b>adverse</b> <b>interests</b> from the title before a transaction takes place. Title insurance companies attempt to achieve this by searching public records to develop and document the chain of title and to detect known claims against or defects in the title to the subject property. If liens or encumbrances are found, the insurer may require that steps be taken to eliminate them (for example, obtaining a release of an old mortgage or deed of trust that has been paid off, or requiring the payoff, or satisfying involuntary liens such as abstracts of judgment and tax liens) before issuing the title policy. In the alternative, it may except from the policy's coverage those items not eliminated. Title plants are sometimes maintained to index the public records geographically, {{with the goal of}} increasing searching efficiency and reducing claims. In some states title plants are required to index the real-property records geographically and also maintain a name file for judgments, probates and other general matters.|$|E

40|$|The {{imputation}} {{doctrine in}} the common law of agency provides that knowledge of an agent acquired {{in the course of}} the agency relationship is imputed to the principal. An important exception to the imputation doctrine, known as the <b>adverse</b> <b>interest</b> exception, provides that knowledge is not imputed if it is acquired by the agent in a course of conduct that is entirely adverse to the principal. These doctrines play an important role in sorting out liability when senior management of a corporation engages in a financial fraud that harms the company. Typically, new management is brought in and it sues the company 2 ̆ 7 s outside service providers (auditors, attorneys, and investment bankers), alleging that their negligence (or, in some cases, intentional wrongdoing) was a proximate cause of the fraud 2 ̆ 7 s success. The defense invokes the imputation doctrine [...] senior management 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of the fraud should be imputed to the company [...] and in pari delicto. The plaintiff responds that the <b>adverse</b> <b>interest</b> exception makes imputation inappropriate and, therefore, in pari delicto is inapplicable. At this point, the issue is joined and, historically, the outside service providers have prevailed. This settled law may have been altered by the recently adopted Restatement (Third) of Agency. This article explores the history of imputation and the <b>adverse</b> <b>interest</b> exception, the evolution and stance of the Restatement (Third) of Agency as it relates to these issues, and how various policy considerations should inform the legal doctrines at issue...|$|R

40|$|In an {{important}} {{article in the}} Yale Law Journal, James Pfander and Daniel Birk claim that adverseness is not required by Article III for cases arising under federal law. This Article takes the position that Pfander and Birk have not {{made the case for}} reconsidering adversity requirements for Article III cases. Adverseness may be present when there is adversity of legal interests, even when adverse argument is not present. From this perspective, a number of Pfander and Birk’s examples of non-contentious jurisdiction manifested adverseness. In rem-type proceedings such as bankruptcy and prize cases required the determination of <b>adverse</b> <b>interests,</b> in situations where impediments often existed to voluntary extrajudicial resolution. Service or notice in some form was generally provided, which gave opportunities for adverse argument. In addition, the issuance of warrants, while ex parte, involved <b>adverse</b> <b>interests</b> in a context where predeprivation notice would undermine the utility of the proceeding, notice occurred on execution of the warrant, and opportunity for argument was then often available. Pfander and Birk’s examples of pension and naturalization determinations are not as readily characterized as adverse. The Court, however, treated federal judges’ pension determinations as appropriate, if at all, as the work of individual commissioners rather than Article III judges. Naturalization petitions are perhaps Pfander and Birk’s best example of non-contentious jurisdiction, but the Court explicitly approved the practice as appropriate under Article III only after provisions for notice to, and potential appearance by, the United States...|$|E

40|$|This article {{creates a}} meeting ground between two {{distinct}} and fairly elaborate research traditions dealing with social "transitions": the Dutch societal transitions management approach, and the Viennese sociometabolic transitions approach. Sharing a similar understanding of sustainability transitions - namely as major transformational changes of system characteristics - and a background epistemology of complex systems, autopoeisis, and evolutionary mechanisms, they address the subject from different angles: one approach asks how transformative changes happen {{and what they}} look like, and the other approach tries {{answer the question of}} how to bring them about. The Viennese approach is almost exclusively analytical and deals with a macro ("landscape") level of human history with a time scale of decades to centuries; the Dutch approach is based on intervention experiences and deals with a shorter time frame (decades) of micro-meso-macro levels of industrial societies. From both their respective angles, they contribute to some of the key questions of sustainability research, namely: how can a transformative change toward sustainability be distinguished from other types of social change?

40|$|From {{the dawn}} of history, {{different}} ways of preventing human birth have belonged tomajor normative problems. From the normative viewpoint, this prevention is usually called birth control that embraces all the relevant biological, medical, chemical and other methods. From the medical standpoint, birth control is based mainly on three methods: contraception, contra-gestation and abortion. Already primitive peoples practiced their own methods of preventing pregnancy: avoidance of intercourse at certain periods and various means of prevention: magic, medical, chemical, mechanical and surgical. One {{of the most controversial}} problems of anti-procreation is abortion. The practice of abortion is presumaably as old as human history. Three solutions compete in the normative regulations an abortion: ban, admissibility under strictly defined circumstances, and full admissibility. In legal regulations concerning abortion three models can be distinguished: either giving preference to the protecition of the pregnant woman’s interests, or the interests of the foetus, or seeking compromise between those two <b>adverse</b> <b>interests.</b> The Polish law leans towards the third model. Sterilization occupies a separate position in the vast issues of anti-procreation. The moral evalution of and regulations concerning sterilization vary depending on its voluntary or compulsory character, applied to men or women. Speaking in most general terms, anti-procreation in all its manifestations, essentially striving for infertility, is subject to highly diversified assessment and regulations that cannot claim to be universal...|$|E

Although such conflicts may result from the personal or financial self-interest of attorneys, this Article focuses primarily on those conflicts which arise out of the intrusion of competing allegiances caused by clients with adverse or potentially <b>adverse</b> <b>interests.</b> After considering {{the impact of the}} conflict of interest dilemma on the delivery of legal services to the poor, this Article explores whether nonprofit, government-subsidized legal aid organizations should be subject to the same conflicts rules {{as the rest of the}} legal profession.

Moreover, this Article argues that, once a legal aid office steps in to provide legal assistance to the adversaries of conflicted clients, the government owes a special duty to those conflicted clients and must ensure that they receive legal representation. It examines several means of providing representation to conflicted indigents without compromising any ethical obligations. This Article concludes that some form of private sector involvement in the provision of legal services to the poor will often be necessary to provide representation to eligible conflicted clients without compromising the fiduciary relationship between lawyer and client...|$|E

40|$|Scholars and jurists {{have long}} sought an {{explanation}} for why the Framers of Article III distinguished “Cases” from “Controversies. ” In a previous article that cataloged the exercise of federal jurisdiction over uncontested matters, such as pension claims, warrant applications, and naturalization proceedings, we tried to provide an answer to this question. We suggested that, at least as to “cases” arising under federal law, the federal courts could exercise what Roman and civil lawyers called non-contentious jurisdiction or, {{in the words of}} Chief Justice Marshall, could hear uncontested claims of right in the form prescribed by law. As for “controversies,” by contrast, the federal courts were limited to the adjudication of disputes between parties aligned as Article III specifies. Much that seems strange about the practice of federal jurisdiction becomes clear when viewed in light of our proposed interpretation. Thus, our Article accounts not only for the difference in Article III’s text, but also for the refusal of the federal courts to hear uncontested matters of state law, such as some probate and domestic relations proceedings. Our account also calls into question the claim that Article III embeds inflexible “injury” and “adverse-party” requirements in the definition of judicial power. It was those claims that triggered the response from Professor Ann Woolhandler, to which this Article briefly replies. Woolhandler argues that Article III requires not adverse parties, so much, as <b>adverse</b> <b>interests.</b> In the course of doing so, she embraces a late nineteenth-century revisionism that twisted the meaning of Article III. In the end, however, she fails to offer a coherent theory of the text of Article III or to explain why her newfangled adverse-interest construct better explains the history of judicial practice than the eighteenth-century construct of non-contentious jurisdiction with which the Framers were familiar...|$|E
40|$|The 19 th {{century was}} a century where the Balkans were {{reshaping}} by ideological and cultural polarisation. Until this century, the Ottoman Empire have maintained its multireligious, multilingual and multicultural structure without a problem. However in this century, the nationalist uprisings {{have caused a}} change in the Empire’s borders, leading to a Balkan region where Ottoman Empire has almost no presence. Notions that came with the French revolution such as freedom, motherland, nation and the policies of major European states have also affected the separation process.   It would be possible to divide Ottoman foreign policy at the time into three eras. The first era is the time until 1865 was the time where the Empire was no longer unrivalled. The second era until 1878, was the era where the Empire guaranteed its territorial integrity and independence via Paris Peace Treaty in 1856. And finally the third era between 1878 and 1908 mainly focused on the balance policies to preserve its territorial integrity. In this era where the Empire was unsettled and vulnerable against interference the policies were based on integrity of the state. Ottoman state governors have tried to attune to the European system which was formed by 1815 Vienna Congress. They have seen internal and external administration as a whole and seeked for a new political culture and identity that can coexist with traditional and western values. They have tried activating the connective power of religion and use religion as a common bonding factor against attacks from Europe. As an external policy, a balance policy that works with the rising powers of the era and makes use of the <b>adverse</b> <b>interests</b> masterfully was being followed.   After the 1877 - 1878 Ottoman Russian War, {{as a result of the}} immigration policies, the situation of the Muslim community was a determinant in the formation of new policies. Railways were used both as a tool of development and external policy. While keeping diplomacy in the foreground, blocks, polarisation and wars were avoided. These policies were not enough to save the state, however extended the life of it.           This study primarily puts emphasis on notions related to nationalism. Furthermore it aims to explore the Balkan nationalism, which led to the end of the Ottoman Empire and characteristics of the Ottoman state policies at the time...|$|E

40|$|A {{guaranteed}} minimum income benefit (GMIB) is a long-dated {{option that}} can be embedded in a deferred variable annuity. The GMIB is attractive because, for policyholders who plan to annuitize, it offers protection against poor market performance during the accumulation phase, and <b>adverse</b> <b>interest</b> rate experience at annuitization. The GMIB also provides an upside equity guarantee that resembles the benefit provided by a lookback option. We price the GMIB, and determine the fair fee rate that should be charged. Due to the long dated nature of the option, conventional hedging methods, such as delta hedging, will only be partially successful. Therefore, we are motivated to find alternative hedging methods which are practicable for long-dated options. First, we measure the effectiveness of static hedging strategies for the GMIB. Static hedging portfolios are constructed based on minimizing the Conditional Tail Expectation of the hedging loss distribution, or minimizing the mean squared hedging loss. Next, we measure the performance of semi-static hedging strategies for the GMIB. We present a practical method for testing semi-static strategies applied to long term options, which employs nested Monte Carlo simulations and standard optimization methods. The semi-static strategies involve periodically rebalancing the hedging portfolio at certain time intervals during the accumulation phase, such that, at the option maturity date, the hedging portfolio payoff is equal to or exceeds the option value, subject to an acceptable level of risk.

40|$|All {{companies}} incorporated {{under the}} Companies Act (and corresponding State Companies Codes), by section 67, have the legal {{capacity of a}} natural person. Consequently, all companies can enter into swap agreements without fear of the agreements being challenged by outsiders {{on the ground that}} they are outside the relevant company’s power. The situation is different for statutory corporations, public authorities, local councils, and other public bodies which invariably do not have the legal capacity of a natural person. The powers of such public bodies are usually enumerated in their incorporating legislation. Often they will be given a power to raise money by borrowing, subject to conditions, together with either an express or implied incidental power. There is some doubt, {{in the absence of a}} specific power, whether a statutory body can enter into a swap agreement. A swap transaction is usually an agreement by two parties to pay each other on certain days amounts calculated by reference to interest which would have accrued over a given period on the same notional principal sum assuming different rates of interest are payable in each case. Swaps are often employed as a device of minimising exposure to <b>adverse</b> <b>interest</b> rate fluctuations payable on loans. Since a swap transaction is not a borrowing, a question arises, in the absence of specific power, as to whether swap transactions are incidental to borrowing. Recently in the English case of Hazellv.
