5|$|A mosaic {{mutation}} {{may or may}} not be inheritable, {{depending on}} the cell populations affected. Though this is not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> case, genetic mutations can occur spontaneously in one sex cell of a parent during gametogenesis. In these cases, called germline mutations, the mutation will be present in the single-celled zygote conceived from the affected sperm or egg cell, and the condition can be inherited by the next generation.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highest}} award for valour of the United Kingdom, the Victoria Cross is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> first award to be {{presented}} at an investiture, even before knighthoods, as was shown at the investiture of Private Johnson Beharry, who received his medal before General Sir Mike Jackson received his knighthood. Owing to its status, the VC is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> first decoration worn {{in a row of}} medals and it is the first set of post-nominal letters used to indicate any decoration or order. Similar acts of extreme valour that do not take place {{in the face of the}} enemy are honoured with the George Cross, which has equal precedence but is awarded second because the GC is newer.|$|E

5|$|Birmingham fans {{consider}} their main rivals to be Aston Villa, their nearest neighbours geographically, {{with whom they}} contest the Second City derby. Lesser rivalries exist with fellow West Midlands clubs Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion. According to a 2003 Football Fans Census survey, Aston Villa fans thought of Birmingham City as their main rivals, though this was not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> case.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Who is unusual, however, in {{that each}} of its 97 missing episodes survives in audio form, {{recorded}} off-air by fans at home. Most episodes are also represented by stills or short video clips. Furthermore, after careful restoration, all 1970s episodes exist in full colour, which is not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> case for other series.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Scottish Terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally bred to hunt and fight badgers. Therefore, the Scottie is prone to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, rats, and mice.|$|E

5|$|Many Indians {{who joined}} the {{missions}} were looking for protection from Portuguese slave traders or the encomienda system of the Spanish conquistadores. In the reductions, the natives were free men. The land in the missions was common property. After a marriage, individual plots were assigned to newly founded families. For the Jesuits, the goal was <b>always</b> <b>the</b> same: to create cities {{in harmony with the}} paradise where they had encountered the indigenous peoples.|$|E

5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, or the gospel of success) is a religious belief among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are <b>always</b> <b>the</b> will of God for them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.|$|E

5|$|The Itchy & Scratchy Show {{is a show}} {{within a}} show that appears {{occasionally}} in episodes of The Simpsons.

Itchy & Scratchy airs as a segment on The Krusty the Clown Show, and also aired on its brief replacements, Sideshow Bob's Cavalcade of Whimsy and Gabbo.|$|E
5|$|The episode's title {{refers to}} an astronomical {{alignment}} of three celestial objects, usually the sun, the Earth, and a moon or planet. Mulder and Scully's behavior in the episode was written specifically by Carter to alert the show's audience that Mulder and Scully would not become a romantic partnership. In addition, the episode contained various fan in-jokes, such as Scully getting upset because Mulder is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> driver, which was inspired by nitpicking from fans.|$|E

The first thirteen Councils (held from 1907–1970) {{are referred to as}} All-American Sobors, reflecting the American Church's jurisdictional ties to the Russian Orthodox Church. The fourteenth Sobor (held in 1970) is jointly known as the 1st All-American Council, reflecting the autocephalous status of the OCA. The most recent All-American Council (18th) was held in July 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia.|$|E
