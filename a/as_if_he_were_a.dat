During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.|$|E
5|$|Don Vito {{brought the}} {{organization}} to its highest perfection without undue recourse to violence. The Mafia leader who scatters corpses all over the island {{in order to achieve}} his goal is considered as inept as the statesman who has to wage aggressive wars. Don Vito ruled and inspired fear mainly by the use of his great qualities and natural ascendancy. His awe-inspiring appearance helped him. … His manners were princely, his demeanour humble but majestic. He was loved by all. Being very generous by nature, he never refused a request for aid and dispensed millions in loans, gifts and general philanthropy. He would personally go {{out of his way to}} redress a wrong. When he started a journey, every major, dressed in his best clothes, awaited him at the entrance of his village, kissed his hands, and paid homage, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> king. And he was a king of sorts: under his reign peace and order were observed, the Mafia peace, of course, which was not what the official law of the Kingdom of Italy would have imposed, but people did not stop to draw too fine a distinction.|$|E

Cutolo challenged the old Camorra bosses and gave the youngsters a structure to belong to: “The new Camorra must have a statute, a structure, an oath, a complete ceremony, a ritual that must excite people {{to the point that they}} would risk their lives for this organization.” Cutolo was revered by his soldiers.

500|$|Vidal's claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated. Vidal {{first made}} the claim in an {{interview}} in the 1995 documentary film The Celluloid Closet, and asserted that he persuaded Wyler to direct Stephen Boyd to play the role <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> spurned homosexual lover. Vidal said that he believed that Messala's vindictiveness could only be motivated by the feeling of rejection that a lover would feel, and claimed to have suggested to Wyler that Stephen Boyd should play the role that way, and that Heston be kept in the dark about the Messala character's motivations. Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate. Wyler himself said that he did not remember any conversation about this part of the script or Boyd's acting with Gore Vidal, and that he discarded Vidal's draft in favor of Fry's. Morgan Hudgens, publicity director for the film, however, wrote to Vidal in late May 1958 about the crucial scene, and implied there was a homosexual context: [...] "...the big cornpone [...] really threw himself into your 'first meeting' scene yesterday. You should have seen those boys embrace!" [...] Film critic F. X. Feeney, in a comparison of script drafts, concludes that Vidal made significant and extensive contributions to the script.|$|E

2500|$|However, Sullivan {{featured}} [...] "rockers", {{and gave}} prominence to black musicians [...] "not without censorship".

2500|$|Oglethorpe {{continued}} {{to press the}} Spanish, trying to dislodge them from the island. A few days later, approaching a Spanish settlement on the south side, he learned of a French man who had deserted the British and gone to the Spanish. Worried that the deserter might report how small the British force was, Oglethorpe spread out his drummers, to make them sound {{as if they were}} accompanying a larger force. He wrote to the deserter, addressing him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> spy for the British, saying that the man just needed to continue his stories until Britain could send more men. The prisoner who was carrying the letter took it to the Spanish officers, as Oglethorpe had hoped and the Spanish promptly executed the Frenchmen. The timely arrival of British ships reinforced a misconception among the Spanish that British reinforcements were arriving. [...] The Spanish left St. Simons on 25 July, ending their last invasion of colonial Georgia.|$|E
2500|$|Critic Stephanie Zacharek of Salon {{states that}} [...] "this {{adaptation}} of Cormac McCarthy's novel touches on brutal themes, but never really gets its hands dirty. The movie's violence isn't pulpy and visceral, {{the kind of}} thing that hits like a fist; it's brutal, and rather relentless, but there are still several layers of comfortable distance between it and us. At one point a character lifts his cowboy boot, daintily, so it won't be mussed by the pool of blood gathering at his feet ... The Coens have often used cruel violence to make their points– that's nothing new– but putting that violence to work in the service of allegedly deep themes isn't the same as actually getting your hands dirty. No Country for Old Men feels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise. That may be partly because it's an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who's usually spoken of in hushed, respectful, hat-in-hand tones, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> schoolmarm who'd finally brought some sense and order to a lawless town." ...|$|E

2500|$|Georges {{begins as}} a {{potential}} hero, though the seeds of destruction are present from the beginning:Georges had all the talents necessary for becoming a well-regarded gentleman; yet he was possessed of a haughty, tenacious, willful nature; he {{had one of those}} oriental sorts of dispositions, the kind that, once pushed far enough from the path of virtue, will stride boldly down the path of crime. He would have given ten years of his life to know the name of his father, but he dared not violate the solemn oath he had made to his dying mother. It was as if nature pushed him toward Alfred; he liked him, as much as one can like a man; and Alfred esteemed him, but with that esteem that the horseman bears for the most handsome and vigorous of his chargers. Georges is instinctively drawn toward his natural father, who can only regard Georges <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> prized animal. Georges is Alfred's property rather than his heir, and by law can become the property of the half-sibling infant recognized as [...] "legitimate". The mulatto, as he is called repeatedly throughout the story in place of his given name, is denied the oedipal knowledge of his identity that would prevent a tragic end.|$|E
2500|$|In 1929, Ochse had a mixed tour. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, {{reviewing}} the tour as a whole, {{said that the}} South Africans [...] "laboured under a disadvantage in being without a fast bowler of real class". It went on: [...] "Ochse worked hard but his limitations were somewhat pronounced." [...] His bowling [...] "was often very erratic". The lack of control and consistency showed in the overall first-class cricket figures, where Ochse was the most expensive of the regular bowlers on the tour, taking just 52 wickets {{at an average of}} 34.51 and conceding runs at more than three an over, expensive by contemporary standards; he also failed to take more than four wickets in any single innings. Conversely, though he was selected only for two Test matches, Ochse's figures in the Tests bore comparison with those of his colleagues, who were also badly treated by England's batsmen; Ochse finished top of the Test bowling averages with 10 wickets at 31.70 apiece. In the first Test, he took four first-innings wickets for 79 and followed that with two for 88 in the second innings, when only four England wickets fell. This was his best Test performance. In the second Test, he was wicketless but economical in England's first innings, but took four in the second innings, though his 20 overs, none of them maidens, cost 99 runs. The Times reported that Ochse was [...] "very severely treated" [...] by Maurice Leyland and Maurice Tate, both of whom scored centuries; it went on: [...] "They drove his over-pitched balls <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> slow bowler, and when he dropped short their cutting was capable of beating the deep third man." [...] Ochse was dropped from the Test team after this and did not play Test cricket again.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, Pennsylvania State University {{announced}} that Freeh would lead {{an internal investigation}} into the Penn State child sex abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky and several high-ranking university officials. He {{announced that}} the team assisting him in his investigation would include former FBI agents and federal prosecutors. As the Sandusky trial proceeded toward conviction in June 2012, the university said Freeh would report {{in the summer and}} the report would [...] "be released to the trustees and the public simultaneously without being reviewed by the school’s general counsel’s office". The report was released on July 12, 2012. The 267-page report from Freeh's law firm was characterized as deeply critical of the administration of former university president Graham Spanier, athletic director Tim Curley, late coach Joe Paterno and former university vice president Gary Schultz. A commentary at Sports Illustrateds website characterized the report's accusations against Paterno as [...] "damning and sweeping" [...] and the findings about Spanier, including a 2001 e-mail {{in the wake of the}} 2001 shower incident purportedly witnessed by graduate assistant Mike McQueary, as [...] "most damning". A number of sources [...] have questioned if not outright disputed the accuracy of Freeh's findings, pointing to the lack of hard evidence to support his [...] "reasonable conclusions." [...] A year after the report's issuance, the chairman of the Penn State Board of Trustees, which had originally commissioned the report, said that Freeh's conclusions amounted to [...] "speculation."

Vidal further claimed that Wyler took his advice. Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate. In 1980, Wallace biographers Robert and Katharine Morsberger said that Vidal's contribution to the script remained unclear. Heston has asserted that Wyler felt Vidal did not solve the problem of motivation, and that Wyler shot little of what he wrote or made little contribution to the script. Wyler himself says that he does not remember any conversation about this part of the script or Boyd's acting with Gore Vidal, and that he discarded Vidal's draft in favor of Fry's. Film critic Gary Giddins also dismisses Vidal's claims, concluding that 80 percent of the script had been written [...] "years before" [...] Vidal came aboard the production. However, Jan Herman, one of Wyler's biographers, asserts [...] "there is no reason to doubt" [...] Vidal's claim, and that Wyler's inability to remember the conversation was just part of the director's notorious caginess. There appears to be some contemporary support for Vidal's assertions. [...] Morgan Hudgens, publicity director for the film, wrote to Vidal in late May 1958 about the crucial scene, and implied there was a homosexual context: [...] "...the big cornpone [...] really threw himself into your 'first meeting' scene yesterday.

2500|$|Chan-wook {{stated that}} he named the main {{character}} Oh Daesu [...] "to remind the viewer of Oedipus." [...] In one of the film's iconic shots, Yoo Ji-tae, who played Woo-jin, strikes an extraordinary yoga pose. Park Chan-wook said he designed this pose to convey [...] "the image of Apollo." [...] It was Apollo's prophecy that revealed Oedipus' fate in Sophocles' Oedipus the King. The link to Oedipus Rex is only a minor element in most English-language criticism of the movie, while Koreans have made it a central theme. Sung Hee Kim wrote [...] "Family seen through Greek tragedy and Korean movie – Oedipus the King and Old Boy." [...] Kim Kyungae offers a different analysis, with Dae-su and Woo-jin both representing Oedipus. [...] Besides the theme of unknown incest revealed, Oedipus gouges his eyes out to avoid seeing a world that despises the truth, while Oh Dae-su cuts off his tongue to avoid revealing the truth to his world. More parallels with Greek tragedy include the fact that Lee Woo-jin looks relatively young as compared to Oh Dae-su when {{they are supposed to}} be contemporaries at school, which makes Lee Woo-jin look like an immortal Greek god whereas Oh Dae-su is merely an aged mortal. The incest scene between Lee Woo-jin and his sister is also very striking and beautifully shot, as Greek gods are renown for their incestuous license (e.g. Zeus and Hera, and many more), and the way Oh Dae-Su peeps through the window to see their incestuous love has an ethereal feel to it, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> lowly mortal in the aether (divine realm of Greek gods) witnessing something which he should not have seen and hence trespassing the boundaries between gods and men, which is another classic act of hubris in Greek tragedy which leads to divine intervention and human punishment. Indeed, throughout the movie Lee Woo-jin is portrayed as an obscenely rich young man who lives in a lofty tower and is omnipresent due to having placed ear bugs on Oh Dae-Su and co, which again furthers the parallel between his character and the secrecy of Greek gods. One could also mention Mido, who throughout the movie comes across as a strong-willed, young and innocent girl, which is not too far from Sophocles' Antigone, Oedipus' daughter, who, though she does not commit incest with her father, remains faithful and loyal to him which reminds us of the bittersweet ending where Mido reunites with Oh Dae-Su and takes care of him in the wilderness (cf Oedipus at Colonus, the second installment of the Oedipus trilogy straightafter Oedipus Tyrannus). Another interesting character is the hypnotist, who, apart from being able to hypnotise people, also has the power to make people fall in love (e.g. Oh and Mido), which is characteristic of the power of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, whose classic act is to make Paris and Helen fall in love before and during the Trojan War.|$|E
