5|$|Negative {{perceptions}} of the Hinomaru exist in former colonies of Japan as well as within Japan itself, such as in Okinawa. In one notable example of this, on October 26, 1987, an Okinawan supermarket owner burned the Hinomaru {{before the start of}} the National Sports Festival of Japan. The flag burner, Shōichi Chibana, burned the Hinomaru not only to show opposition to atrocities committed by the Japanese army and the continued presence of U.S. forces, but also to prevent it from being displayed in public. Other incidents in Okinawa included the flag being torn down during school ceremonies and students refusing to honor the flag as it was being raised to the sounds of Kimigayo. In the capital city of Naha, Okinawa, the Hinomaru was raised for the first time since the return of Okinawa to Japan to celebrate the city's 80th anniversary in 2001. In the People's Republic of China and South Korea, both of which had been occupied by the Empire of Japan, the 1999 formal adoption of the Hinomaru was met with reactions of Japan moving towards the right and also a step towards re-militarization. The passage of the 1999 law also coincided with the debates about the status of the Yasukuni Shrine, US-Japan military cooperation and the creation of <b>a</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> program. In other nations that Japan occupied, the 1999 law was met with mixed reactions or glossed over. In Singapore, the older generation still harbors ill feelings toward the flag while the younger generation does not hold similar views. The Philippines government not only believed that Japan was not going to revert to militarism, but the goal of the 1999 law was to formally establish two symbols (the flag and anthem) in law and every state has a right to create national symbols. Japan has no law criminalizing the burning of the Hinomaru, but foreign flags cannot be burned in Japan. Some people have humorously drawn an analogy between the Japanese flag and the appearance of a menstruation stain on a white bedsheet.|$|E

On April 15, the Israeli Arrow 2 anti-ballistic missile system successfully intercepted a simulated Iranian Shihab-3 medium-range ballistic missile.

25|$|In 2002, the United States {{withdrew from}} the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty {{in order to move}} forward with plans for <b>a</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> system. Putin called the {{decision}} a mistake. Russia strongly opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, though without exercising its veto in the United Nations Security Council. Russia has regarded the expansion of NATO into the old Eastern Bloc, and U.S. efforts to gain access to Central Asian oil and natural gas as a potentially hostile encroachment on Russia's sphere of influence.|$|E
25|$|In February 2007, the US started formal {{negotiations}} with Czech Republic and Poland concerning construction of missile shield installations {{in those countries}} for a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System. Government of the Czech Republic agrees (while 67% Czechs disagree and only about 22% support it) to host <b>a</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors {{is supposed to be}} built in Poland. The objective is reportedly to protect another parts of US National Missile Defense from long-range missile strikes from Iran and North Korea, but Czech PM Mirek Topolánek said the main reason is to avoid Russian influence and strengthen ties to US.|$|E
40|$|The American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC) has tracked {{offensive}} missile {{threats and}} advocated for <b>a</b> strong <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> {{for well over}} a decade. The organization holds <b>an</b> annual <b>Missile</b> <b>Defense</b> con-ference on Capitol Hill and disseminates a monthly publication, the <b>Missile</b> <b>Defense</b> Briefing Report (MDBR), which monitors domestic and international <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> developments. The purpose of this brochure is to provide an informative and concise overview of the threat posed by ballistic mis-siles, detail the current <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> architecture and limitations, and provide policy recommen-dations to ensure the U.

50|$|The {{proposed}} U.S. <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> system {{received attention}} at the Helsinki summit, where Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to {{an interpretation of the}} 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty allowing the United States to proceed with <b>a</b> limited <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> system currently under development. Specifically, Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to distinguish between <b>a</b> national <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> system, aimed against strategic weapons, not allowed by the ABMT, and <b>a</b> theater <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> system to guard against shorter range missile attacks. Some critics thought that any agreement of this kind would place undesirable limits on the development of both theater and strategic <b>missile</b> <b>defenses.</b> The Helsinki meeting also saw progress in arms control negotiations between the United States and Russia, a matter high on Cohen's agenda. Yeltsin and Clinton agreed on the need for early Russian ratification of the Second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) and negotiation of START III to make further significant cuts in the strategic nuclear arsenals of both nations.|$|R
500|$|The {{argument}} {{for a national}} missile defense system in the United States was traditionally to protect the country from a Soviet missile attack.

500|$|The {{commission}} reentered {{the public}} consciousness in 2000 when {{the former chairman of}} the commission, Donald Rumsfeld, was named by newly elected President George W. Bush to be Secretary of Defense, his second time in that office. On December 30, 2000, Richard Garwin, a former commissioner, praised Rumsfeld for his commission work in a New York Times op-ed piece, although he reiterated that the commission never suggested whether or not the US should build <b>a</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> system. [...] Other staffers and members of the commission were also appointed by the new Bush administration: Paul Wolfowitz was named Deputy Secretary of Defense, William Schneider, Jr. was appointed by Rumsfeld to the Defense Science Board, and in March 2003 Stephen Cambone was selected by Rumsfeld to fill the newly created Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence position. [...] Robert Gates, the man who conducted the first review of the ballistic missile threat, was appointed Secretary of Defense after Rumsfeld's November 2006 resignation.|$|E

2500|$|This {{system was}} given major new {{importance}} by President Obama in September 2009, {{when he announced}} plans to scrap the plans for <b>a</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> site in Poland, in favor of missile defense systems located on U.S. Navy warships. On 18 September 2009, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin welcomed Obama's plans for missile defense which may include stationing American Aegis armed warships in the Black Sea, as these {{are likely to be}} less effective against Russia's missile attacks. In 2009 several U.S. Navy ships were fitted with SM-3 missiles to serve this function, which complements the Patriot systems already deployed by American units.
