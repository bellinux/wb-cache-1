5|$|In {{the fleet}} {{maneuvers}} in late 1890, Blitz and her flotilla {{were the only}} German force, and Blitz was given the task of defending Germany's Baltic coast against <b>a</b> <b>simulated</b> Russian blockade. Blitz also {{took part in the}} 1891 and 1892 training exercises. During the 1894 maneuvers, which postulated a two-front war against France and Russia, Blitz remained in the Baltic to defend against the simulated Russian attack. She also participated in the summer 1897 exercises in the simulated hostile squadron, along with her sister Pfeil. In AugustSeptember 1900, she participated in the annual summer fleet maneuvers; during the exercises, she was assigned to the simulated German squadron, tasked with defending against <b>a</b> <b>simulated</b> enemy fleet in the North Sea. After the conclusion of the maneuvers, Blitz was withdrawn from active service. In 1903, she was used as a tender for the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Living {{conditions}} were primitive in the camp, with trainees housed either under canvas in tents or in Nissen huts {{and they were}} responsible for cooking their own meals. Correct military protocols were enforced: Officers were saluted and uniforms had to be clean, with brasses and boots shining on parade.

5|$|While the {{wreckage}} was being examined, investigators {{found that all}} four engines were producing thrust {{at the time of}} impact. There were only two ways that the propeller could be reversed during the take-off sequence. Investigators ruled out electrical malfunction since, after detailed examination of the engine hub, there was no evidence found of this happening. Therefore, it was concluded that the only way the propeller could have been reversed was through an unintentional crew action. Although there was no formal evidence that <b>a</b> <b>simulated</b> engine failure was being performed, statements submitted by witnesses suggested that it was likely this was the case.

5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} environment, several life forms {{have been found}} that can {{withstand}} extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years. A strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or <b>a</b> <b>simulated</b> martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early {{in the history of}} the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited was {{the first}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding <b>a</b> <b>simulated</b> atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time computational fluid dynamics. Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.|$|E

That year, she took part in the annual fleet maneuvers, along with five ironclads, a protected cruiser, the torpedo cruisers , , and , and numerous smaller vessels.

The flotilla was back in German waters for the annual AugustSeptember maneuvers, where it formed the IV Division. By 1888, Blitz had been transferred to the III Flotilla. In July, Blitz joined a squadron of ships to take the newly crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II for a tour of Baltic ports, which included a visit to Tsar Alexander III of Russia.

During the maneuvers, which lasted from 6 August to 5 September, the ships of the Active Squadron simulated a French attack on the Italian fleet.|$|E
5|$|Lepanto {{was under}} {{construction}} for nearly 11 years.

Lepanto was not completed for another four-and-a-half years, her construction finally being finished on 16 August 1887, twenty-two months {{after the completion of}} Italia.

5|$|Rhythm game or rhythm {{action is}} a genre of music-themed action video game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as <b>a</b> <b>simulated</b> musical ensemble. While conventional control pads {{may be used as}} input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, Leaf {{was indicted}} on {{burglary}} and controlled-substance charges in Texas. He {{was in a}} drug-rehabilitation program in British Columbia {{at the time of}} the indictment, and was arrested by customs agents at the border on his return to the U.S as he was intending to fly to Texas to surrender on the indictment. However, his attorney Jeffrey A. Lustick successfully blocked the fugitive warrant extradition process, therefore legally allowing Leaf to go to Texas on his own. Lustick later successfully got the Washington fugitive action against Leaf dismissed with prejudice. On June 17, he posted a $45,000 bond in Washington state for the criminal charges in Texas. In April 2010, he pleaded guilty in Amarillo, Texas to seven counts of obtaining a controlled substance by fraud and one count of delivery of <b>a</b> <b>simulated</b> controlled substance, all felonies.

5|$|This was {{followed}} on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this {{mission was to}} achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by <b>a</b> <b>simulated</b> direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines {{in the second and}} third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test.|$|E
