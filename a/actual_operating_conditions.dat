50|$|Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS) is a {{closed-loop}} dynamic power minimization {{technique that}} reduces power {{based on the}} <b>actual</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> of the chip, i.e., the power consumption is continuously adjusted during the run time of the chip. Typically the design of any chip is done {{in such a way}} that it meets most demanding application throughput requirements under worst case operating conditions. This leads to an excess margin or wastage of power because the chip usually operates under typical operating conditions. AVS is beneficial compared to the conventional Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) approach, a commonly encountered open loop dynamic power minimization technique, because AVS eliminates the excess power margins that are present in the open loop DVS systems due to the fixed voltage-frequency relations employed in those systems. In AVS technique the chip's exact process corner is determined either during the manufacturing test or during runtime and the appropriate Voltage-Frequency relationship is determined, which will be used during the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling operations. This eliminates the extra margin that will be present if the worst case operating conditions are taken into account while the chip is actually operating under typical conditions.|$|E
50|$|The higher capital costs, lesser standardization, {{and added}} {{engineering}} & operational complexities (in comparison to zero and low-concentration PV technologies) make demonstrations of system reliability and long-life performance critical {{challenges for the}} first generation of CPV and CPVT technologies. Performance certification testing standards (e.g. IEC 62108, UL 8703, IEC 62789, IEC 62670) include stress conditions that may be useful to uncover some predominantly infant and early life (<1-2 year) failure modes at the system, module, and sub-component levels. However, such standardized tests - as typically performed on only a small sampling of units - are generally incapable to evaluate comprehensive long-term (10 to 25 or more years) lifetimes for each unique CPVT system design and application under its broader range of <b>actual</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> Long-life performance of these complex systems is therefore assessed in the field, and is improved through aggressive product development cycles which are guided by the results of accelerated component/system aging, enhanced performance monitoring diagnostics, and failure analysis. Significant growth in the deployment of CPV and CPVT can be anticipated once the long-term performance and reliability concerns are better addressed to build confidence in system bankability.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common feature {{extraction}} methods is based on correlating measured system response quantities, such a vibration amplitude or frequency, with the first-hand observations of the degrading system. Another method of developing features for damage identification is to apply engineered flaws, similar to ones expected in <b>actual</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> to systems and develop an initial understanding of the parameters that are sensitive to the expected damage. The flawed system {{can also be used to}} validate that the diagnostic measurements are sensitive enough to distinguish between features identified from the undamaged and damaged system. The use of analytical tools such as experimentally-validated finite element models can be a great asset in this process. In many cases the analytical tools are used to perform numerical experiments where the flaws are introduced through computer simulation. Damage accumulation testing, during which significant structural components of the system under study are degraded by subjecting them to realistic loading conditions, can also be used to identify appropriate features. This process may involve induced-damage testing, fatigue testing, corrosion growth, or temperature cycling to accumulate certain types of damage in an accelerated fashion. Insight into the appropriate features can be gained from several types of analytical and experimental studies as described above and is usually the result of information obtained from some combination of these studies.|$|E

5000|$|In 1973 (per {{the table}} below), DC {{traction}} at 3,000 volts, lost about 3 {{times as much}} energy (percentage-wise) in the catenary as AC at 25,000 volts. Paradoxically, {{it turned out that}} DC locomotives were somewhat more efficient overall than AC locomotives. [...] "Auxiliary Electric Motors" [...] are mainly used for air cooling electric machinery such as traction motors. Electric locomotives concentrate high power electric machinery in a relatively small space and thus require a lot of cooling. [...] Per the table below, a sizeable amount of energy (11-17%) is used for this, but when operating at nominal power only 2-4% is used. [...] The fact that the cooling motors run at full speed (and power) all the time makes their power consumption constant, so when the locomotive motors are operating at low power (far below the nominal regime) the percent of this power used for cooling blowers becomes much higher. The result is that under <b>actual</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> the percent energy used for cooling is a few times higher than [...] "nominal". Per the table below, AC locomotives used about 50% more energy for this purpose since in addition to cooling the motors, the blowers must cool the transformer, rectifiers and the smoothing reactor (inductors), which are mostly absent on DC locomotives. [...] The 3-phase AC power for these blower motors is supplied from a rotary phase converter which converts single phase (from the catenary via the main transformer) to 3-phase (and this also takes energy). It's proposed to reduce blower speeds when less cooling is needed.|$|E
