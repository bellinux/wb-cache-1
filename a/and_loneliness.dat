Given the importance of studying psychological adjustment and different types of loneliness in emerging adulthood, {{the purpose of the present}} study was to assess depressive symptomatology and family, social, <b>and</b> romantic <b>loneliness</b> in emerging adulthood. Specifically, the present study examined the impact of PARTheory (i. e., early relationship context), current attachment experiences in close relationships (i. e., current relationship context) and sense of mattering to family and friends (sense of awareness, sense of importance, and sense of reliance) on emerging adults 2 ̆ 7 overall reports of family, social, <b>and</b> romantic <b>loneliness</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptomatology. In addition, this study explored whether coping styles (i. e., behavioral and cognitive context) and psychological adjustment (i. e., personality context) mediated the role between early family and current attachment relationship experiences and the emerging adults 2 ̆ 7 reports of family, social, <b>and</b> romantic <b>loneliness.</b> Emerging adults (N = 440) from Wayne State University were assessed using the Adult Parental Acceptance Rejection Questionnaire, Short Form (PARQ), Experiences in Close Relationships Scale Revised (ECR-R), Social <b>and</b> Emotional <b>Loneliness</b> Scale for Adults - Short Form (SELSA-S), Interpersonal Mattering Scale (IMS), Adult Personality Assessment Questionnaire (PAQ), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale), and Brief Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced Scale (Brief-COPE), along with several demographic variables (e. g., age, gender, grade level, employment status, marital status, social networking rating, group involvement rating, etc.). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that family loneliness was best predicted by total father acceptance and rejection, sense of awareness to family, sense of importance to family, psychological adjustment, and use of behavioral disengagement. Social loneliness was best predicted by sense of awareness to friends, sense of importance to friends, psychological adjustment, use of instrumental support, and use of behavioral disengagement. Romantic loneliness was found to be influenced by attachment security, psychological adjustment, and use of emotional support. Depressive symptomatology was best predicted by gender, total father acceptance and rejection, attachment security, sense of awareness to family, psychological adjustment, and use of self-blame. In addition, results from the mediation analyses indicated that psychological adjustment mediated the relation between maternal acceptance <b>and</b> social <b>loneliness,</b> whereas psychological adjustment mediated the relation between paternal acceptance <b>and</b> social <b>loneliness</b> <b>and</b> between paternal acceptance <b>and</b> family <b>loneliness.</b> Use of instrumental support was found to mediate the relation between attachment security <b>and</b> family <b>loneliness</b> <b>and</b> between attachment security <b>and</b> social <b>loneliness.</b> Use of self-blame was also found to mediate the relation between attachment security <b>and</b> family <b>loneliness</b> <b>and</b> between attachment security <b>and</b> social <b>loneliness.</b> With result to attachment styles within emerging adulthood, results from the correlational and ANOVA analyses revealed that emerging adults with secure attachment styles reported a higher sense of mattering to family and friends and lower levels of depressive symptomatology, family <b>loneliness,</b> social <b>loneliness,</b> <b>and</b> romantic <b>loneliness.</b> In addition, security of attachment resulted in higher levels of use of instrumental support and use of emotional support and lower levels of behavioral disengagement, use of self-blame and use of self-distraction when coping within one 2 ̆ 7 s current relationships.

5|$|Recalling his {{homesickness}} <b>and</b> <b>loneliness</b> {{the last}} time he had ventured abroad, for his next foreign trip Etty travelled in the company of Richard Evans, who had been a fellow student of Thomas Lawrence.

Crossing to France by means of the recently developed steamboat, they arrived in Paris on 26June. They stayed in Paris for two weeks, visiting Versailles and the city's public art galleries; they also visited the much-reduced remaining exhibits of the Louvre. The Louvre was hosting an exhibition of modern French painting at the time, at which Etty felt a great dislike for the quality of portraiture in France, but he was nonetheless greatly impressed by the permanent collections, in particular Rubens's Marie de' Medici cycle, elements of which he would later reuse in many of his own works.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Loneliness is a {{negative}} emotional reaction to the experienced discrepancy between perceived and desired quantity or quality of social relations (Perlman & Peplau, 1981). Because different relationships are assumed to fulfil different social needs (Weiss, 1973), it is often assumed that loneliness can be experienced in various relationships (DiTommaso & Spinner, 1997; Goossens, 2016). Loneliness experiences within different relationships have been related differentially related to various measures of adjustment (e. g., DiTommaso, Brannen, & Best, 2004; Lasgaard, Goossens, & Elklit, 2011). Although {{it has been suggested}} that loneliness in one relationship (e. g., parents) might put one at risk for experiencing loneliness in another relationship (e. g., peers; Rubin et al., 2004), it remains unclear whether this influence is unidirectional or bidirectional. The current study aimed to gain more insight into the relation between parent-related <b>loneliness</b> <b>and</b> peer-related <b>loneliness</b> over time. Methods. Three independent samples were used to examine the associations between peer- <b>and</b> parent-related <b>loneliness.</b> A total of 1, 552 adolescents (46. 60 % male, M = 12. 93 years old) participated in the first study, 552 adolescents (37. 20 % male, M = 14. 82 years old) participated in the second study, and 1, 474 adolescents (35. 94 %, M = 15. 45 years old) participated in the third study. In all samples, parent- <b>and</b> peer-related <b>loneliness</b> were assessed with the subsequent subscales of the <b>Loneliness</b> <b>and</b> Aloneness Scale for Children and Adolescents (LACA; Goossens, 2016). A cross-lagged panel model was estimated in Mplus. The current poster presents the results of a meta-analysis that was conducted across the three samples. For this meta-analysis, a fixed effect model was applied (Field & Gillett, 2010) and betas were used as substitutes of Pearson’s r (Peterson & Brown, 2005). Results. First, the results show a high stability for peer- <b>and</b> parent-related <b>loneliness.</b> Second, moderate, positive within-time correlations were found between peer- <b>and</b> parent-related <b>loneliness.</b> Last, the meta-analysis indicates significant bidirectional relations over time between peer- <b>and</b> parent-related <b>loneliness.</b> More specifically, peer-related loneliness was related to more parent-related loneliness one year later, <b>and</b> parent-related <b>loneliness</b> was related to more peer-related loneliness one year later (see Figure 1). Conclusion. Parent-related <b>and</b> peer-related <b>loneliness</b> proved to be stable over time. In addition, parent-related <b>and</b> peer-related <b>loneliness</b> were found to be concurrently and longitudinally correlated with each other. Thereby, the findings seem to be in line with a transactional model (Sameroff, 2009). Future studies might examine mediating factors in order to provide more insight into how or why loneliness in various contexts influence each other. status: accepte...|$|R

5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation <b>and</b> <b>loneliness</b> she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E
