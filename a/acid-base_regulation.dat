40|$|CO 2, {{known for}} its role in <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulations,</b> is a {{mediator}} of peroxynitrite-induced oxidative damage and it also enhances Cu,Zn-SOD's antioxidant activity. These two means, by which CO₂ affects free-radical damage, are well-explored, {{but there are many}} other mechanisms. When CO 2 joins in free radical reactions, carbonate radical is often produced. The carbonate radical specifically damages substrates, but {{it is not possible to}} generalize, if the effect is pro-oxidant or antioxidant. A protective role of CO 2 has been observed during lipid peroxidation and during peroxynitrite-induced oxidation of DNA, when the carbonate radical caused injury to specific bases, but in the same time it prevented DNA strand breaks. Similarly, CO 2 prevented peroxynitrite- induced protein fragmentation as well as it caused injury to specific aminoacids. These observations are mostly based on experiments in a chemical system, which means under simplified conditions. In vivo, CO 2 exerts much more mechanisms to affect free radical reactions. Under more complex conditions, as cell culture is, there was an increase of oxidative stress after CO 2 exposure. Increased concentration of CO 2 causes a change in erythrocyte's function and an increase of oxidative stress on the organism's level...|$|R

This condition accompanies a variety of diseases, and the degree of its severity correlates with the patients’ survival: although not a separate disease in itself, metabolic acidosis, however, can worsen the disease course and even lead to death. The pathology causes are various (in connection with life-threatening changes in various organs and systems — lungs, heart and blood vessels, kidneys, and also due to a violation of lipid metabolism, in case of diabetes, poisoning, etc.), which determines the fact that a wide range of specialists are interested in the issue.

He wrote the Henderson equation in 1908 to describe the use of carbonic acid as a buffer solution. Karl Albert Hasselbalch later expressed the equation in logarithmic terms, creating the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. In addition, he described blood gas transport and the general physiology of blood as physico-chemical system (1920-1932).

50|$|Most {{metabolic}} processes have {{a specific}} and narrow range of pH where operation is possible, multiple regulatory systems are in place to maintain homeostasis. Fluctuations away from optimal operating pH can slow or impair reactions and possibly cause damage to cellular structures or proteins. To maintain homeostasis the body may excrete excess acid or base through the urine, via gas exchange in the lungs, or buffer it in the blood. The bicarbonate buffering system of blood plasma effectively holds a steady pH and helps to hold extracellular pH around 7.35. The kidneys {{are responsible for the}} majority of <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation</b> but can excrete urine no lower than a pH of 5. This means that a 330mL can of cola, for example, usually ranging in pH from 2.8 - 3.2, would need to be diluted 100 fold before being excreted. Instead of producing 33L of urine from one can of cola, the body relies on buffer to neutralize the acid. Systemic acidosis can be the result of multiple factors, not just diet. Anaerobic exercise, diabetes, AIDS, aging, menopause, inflammation, infections, tumours, and other wounds and fractures all contribute to acidosis. Blood has an average pH of 7.40 but interstitial fluid can vary. Interstitial pH of the skin, for example, is ~7.1. There is no data available for bone.|$|E

Associated with these morphological pathologies, one finds alterations in blood ionic levels, as well as gill Na,K-activated ATPase activity and ionic fluxes.

40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{hypotheses}} that compensation for metabolic <b>acid-base</b> disturbances involves <b>regulation</b> of carbonic anhydrase (CA) and that cortisol {{plays an important}} role in mediating the compensatory responses of the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Metabolic acidosis decreased mRNA expression of branchial trout cytosolic CA (tCAc) and increased mRNA expression of renal tCAc and membrane-bound CAIV (tCAIV). Metabolic alkalosis increased mRNA expression of branchial and renal tCAc, decreased renal tCAIV mRNA expression, and increased branchial CA activity. Plasma cortisol was elevated during acidosis and alkalosis, indicating its possible involvement in regulating the response to an acid-base challenge. Cortisol may up-regulate CA, as treatment with exogenous cortisol increased tCAc and tCAIV mRNA expression, renal tCAc protein abundance, and branchial CA activity. This study suggests that CA contributes to the compensation of metabolic acid-base disturbances in the rainbow trout, and that cortisol is involved in the <b>regulation</b> of <b>acid-base</b> status...|$|R
40|$|Homeostatic {{regulation}} allows organisms {{to secure}} basic physiological processes in a varying environment. To counteract fluctuations in ambient carbonate system speciation due to elevated seawater pCO 2 (hypercapnia), many aquatic crustaceans excrete/accumulate acid-base equivalents through their gills; however, not much {{is known about}} the role of ammonia in this response. The present study investigated the effects of hypercapnia on <b>acid-base</b> and ammonia <b>regulation</b> in the Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister on the whole animal and isolated gill levels. Hemolymph pCO 2 and [HCO 3]- increased in M. magister acclimated to elevated pCO 2 (330 Pa), while pH remained stable. Additionally, hemolymph [Na+], [Ca 2 +], and [SO 4] 2 - were significantly increased. When challenged with varying pH during gill perfusion, the pH of the artificial hemolymph remained relatively unchanged. Overall, ammonia production and excretion, as well as oxygen consumption, were reduced in crabs acclimated to elevated pCO 2, demonstrating that either (amino acid) oxidation is reduced in response to this particular stress, or nitrogenous wastes are excreted in an alternative form...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} that drive <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation</b> in organisms is important, especially for organisms in aquatic habitats that experience rapidly fluctuating pH conditions. Previous {{studies have shown}} that carbonic anhydrases (CAs), a family of zinc metalloenzymes, are responsible for <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation</b> in many organisms. Through the use of phylogenetic tools, this present study attempts to elucidate the evolutionary history of the α-CA superfamily, with particular interest in the emerging model aquatic organism Daphnia pulex. We provide one of the most extensive phylogenies of the evolution of α-CAs, with the inclusion of 261 amino acid sequences across taxa ranging from Cnidarians to Homo sapiens. While the phylogeny supports most of our previous understanding on the relationship of how α-CAs have evolved, we find that, contrary to expectations, amino acid conservation with bacterial α-CAs supports the supposition that extracellular α-CAs are the ancestral state of animal α-CAs. Furthermore, we show that two cytosolic and one GPI-anchored α-CA in Daphnia genus have homologs in sister taxa that are possible candidate genes to study for <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation.</b> In addition, we provide further support for previous findings of a high rate of gene duplication within Daphnia genus, as compared with other organisms...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acid-base</b> <b>regulation</b> and renal {{transporters}} in {{the kidney}} The kidney {{is one of}} the major organs that maintain acid-base homeostasis via three major processes.

The other process includes the synthesis of ammonia and the use of ammonia, phosphate and citrate as so-called titratable acids to bind protons and thereby max-imizing the kidneys ability to excrete proton. These proc-esses of the kidney to excrete acids or bases are associated with the expression of various specialized and spatially ar-ranged transport proteins and enzymes.

40|$|Phosphate plays a {{critical}} role in the body as a constituent of bone and tooth for body development, and as a urinary buffer for pH in body <b>acid-base</b> balance <b>regulation.</b> The phosphorus level in blood in human is between 3. 0 to 4. 5 mg/dl. When the blood phosphate concentration is lower than 2. 5 mg/dl, the person develops hypophosphatemia. When the blood phosphate concentration is higher than 4. 5 mg/dl, the person develops hyperphosphatemia. It is critically important for the body to control the phosphate level in blood and maintain the phosphate homeostasis. The kidney and the intestine are the important sites to regulate phosphate homeostasis. This dissertation research was to explore the transporter gene(s) involved in the intestinal sodium-dependent phosphate absorption in human and to investigate the role of sodium-phosphate (NaPi) transporters in phosphate homeostatic regulation. The research was performed to test the hypothesis that the sodium-dependent phosphate (NaPi) cotransporter is involved in the phosphate absorption in intestine and various physiological regulators modulate the activity of this transporter. A cDNA encoding a novel human small intestinal Na⁺-P i transporter was isolated from a human intestinal cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a 689 amino acid polypeptide which is different from the renal NaPi cotransporters. This human intestinal NaPi cotransporter gene was mapped to human chromosome 4 p 15. 1 [...] p 15. 3 by the F̲luorescence I̲n-S̲itu H̲y̲bridization (FISH) method. The human intestinal NaPi cotransporter gene structure was studied by screening a human genomic DNA library. This gene contains 12 exons and 11 introns. There were two transcription initiation sites identified by primer extension. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that the intestinal NaPi cotransporter gene expression is regulated by EGF and vitamin D 3. EGF inhibits NaPi-cotransporter gene expression, while vitamin D 3 stimulates NaPi-cotransporter gene expression. From these studies, I concluded that the intestinal sodium-dependent phosphate absorption is mainly mediated by intestinal NaPi cotransporters (NaPi-IIb), and this transporter is modulated by various physiological regulators {{in order to maintain the}} phosphate homeostasis...|$|R

Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} that ETs are expressed in a variety of fish tissues and contract various blood vessels. In order to determine if receptors for ET are expressed in fish gill tissue, we examined the binding kinetics of 125 I-labeled, human ET- 1 to membrane fragments isolated from the gill of the dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias. 125 I-ET- 1 bound at a single site, with a dissociation constant (Kd) and binding site number (Bmax) very similar to those described in a variety of mammalian blood vessels. ET- 1 and ET- 3 competed equally with 125 I-ET- 1, suggesting that the Summary receptor was ETB, which has been shown in mammalian systems to bind to both ligands equally. The ETB-specific agonists sarafotoxin S 6 c, IRL- 1620, and BQ- 3020 also competed against 125 I-ET- 1 at a single site, supporting this hypothesis.

40|$|Even though {{previous}} researches {{have been}} led on the acid-base {{balance of the}} coelomic fluid of sea urchins, {{most of them were}} carried out on regular euechinoids. To this date, very little is known on the acid-base status of cidaroids and irregular euechinoids. We have investigated this status within regular euechinoids, irregular euechinoids, and cidaroids from different regions including the temperate intertidal zone, the tropical subtidal zone and the Antarctic waters. Our survey pointed out the same pattern within all regions: 1) Regular euechinoids have a coelomic fluid (CF) pH of about 7. 2, an increased buffer capacity of the CF due to an increased concentration of bicarbonate ions and high molecular weight compounds; the HCO 3 - ions most probably originate from the surrounding seawater (witnessed by a similar isotopic signature of the carbon), 2) Irregular euechinoids and Cidaroids have a CF pH of about 7. 0, a buffer capacity and a concentration of bicarbonate ions of the CF similar to that of seawater and an isotopic signature of the carbon {{different from that of the}} surrounding seawater. This pattern is quite regular in its occurrence and shows a difference of baseline physiology within the different echinoid groups. These differences lead to different responses when these animals face hypercapnia and/or acidosis, resulting in different sensitivities.

40|$|In the {{tropical}} fresh water fish, Synbranchus marmoratus, transition from water breathing to air breathing, induced {{by reduction of}} oxygen partial pressure (Pot) in the environmental water below 16 mmHg, causes a con-siderable rise in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pcojt from 5 - 6 to 26 mmHg on the average (half time of the rise between 2 and 6 - 5 h). The associated fall in arterial plasma pH by about o- 6 units is not com-pensated {{by an increase in}} plasma bicarbonate concentration, whereas the intracellular pH of white skeletal muscle and heart muscle is kept almost constant by elevation of the intracellular bicarbonate concentration. The additional bicarbonate is generated by intracellular non-bicarbonate buffer-ing, and by net transfer into the intracellular space of bicarbonate formed by buffering in blood. Only a relatively small quantity of bicarbonate is taken up from environmental water. This type of <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation,</b> with almost complete intracellular pH compensation and only minor bicarbonate uptake (equivalent H+ release or OH ~ uptake) from water, is attributed to several factors. Probably {{the most important of these}} is the lack of continuous contact of the gills, which are the main site of ion transfer processes, with the environmental water during air breathing.

40|$|The gill {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{to have played}} a key role in the adaptive radiation of early vertebrates by supplanting the skin as the dominant site of gas exchange. However, in the most basal extant craniates, the hagfishes, gills play only a minor role in gas exchange. In contrast, we found hagfish gills to be associated with a tremendous capacity for <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation.</b> Indeed, Pacific hagfish exposed acutely to severe sustained hypercarbia tolerated among the most severe blood acidoses ever reported (1. 2 [*]pH unit reduction) and subsequently exhibited the greatest degree of acid-base compensation ever observed in an aquatic chordate.

40|$|In this review, we {{analyzed}} {{the role played}} by central and peripheral chemoreceptors (CHRs) in vasopressin (AVP) secretion control. Central neural pathways subserving osmotic and non-osmotic control of AVP secretion are strictly correlated to brain areas participating in chemoreception mechanisms. Among the different brain areas involved in central chemoreception, the most important site has been localized in the retrotrapezoid nucleus of the rostral ventrolateral medulla. These central CHRs are able to detect very small pH/CO 2 fluctuations, participating in brain blood flow <b>regulation,</b> <b>acid-base</b> balance and blood pressure control. Decreases in arterial pH and increases in arterial pCO 2 stimulate AVP release by the Supraoptic and Paraventricular Nuclei. Carotid CHRs transduce low arterial O 2 tension into increased action potential activity, leading to bradycardia and coronary vasodilatation via vagal stimulation, and systemic vasoconstriction via catecholaminergic stimulation. Stimulation of carotid CHRs by hypoxia increases neurohypophyseal blood flow and AVP release, an effect inhibited by CHRs denervation. Two renal CHRs have been identified: Type R 1 CHRs do not have a resting discharge but are activated by renal ischemia and hypotension; Type R 2 CHRs have a resting discharge and respond to backflow of urine into the renal pelvis. Signals arising from renal CHRs modulate the activity of hypothalamic AVPergic neurons: activation of R 1 and R 2 CHRs, following increased intrapelvic pressure with solutions of mannitol, NaCl and KCl, produces a significant increase of AVP secretion and the same effect has been obtained by the intrarenal infusion of bradykinin, which excites afferent renal nerves, {{as well as by the}} electrical stimulation of these nerves...|$|R
40|$|Ocean {{acidification}} and warming are {{predicted to}} affect the ability of marine bivalves to build their shells, but {{little is known about}} the underlying mechanisms. Shell formation is an extremely complex process requiring a detailed understanding of biomineralization processes. Sodium incorporation into the shells would increase if bivalves rely on the exchange of Na+/H+ to maintain homeostasis for shell formation, thereby shedding new light on the <b>acid-base</b> and ionic <b>regulation</b> at the calcifying front. Here, we investigated the combined effects of seawater pH (8. 1, 7. 7 and 7. 4) and temperature (16 and 22 °C) on the growth and sodium composition of the shells of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, and the Yesso scallop, Patinopecten yessoensis. Exposure of M. edulis to low pH (7. 7 and 7. 4) caused a significant decrease of shell formation, whereas a 6 °C warming significantly depressed the rate of shell growth in P. yessoensis. On the other hand, while the amount of Na incorporated into the shells of P. yessoensis did not increase in acidified seawater, an increase of Na/Cashell with decreasing pH was observed in M. edulis, the latter agreeing well with the aforementioned hypothesis. Moreover, a combined analysis of the shell growth and sodium content provides a more detailed understanding of shell formation processes. Under acidified conditions, mussels may maintain more alkaline conditions favorable for calcification, but a significant decrease of shell formation indicates that the mineralization processes are impaired. The opposite occurs in scallops; virtually unaffected shell growth implies that shell mineralization functions well. Finding of the present study may pave the way for deciphering the mechanisms underlying the impacts of ocean acidification and warming on bivalve shell formation...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic CO 2 {{emissions}} lead to chronically elevated seawater CO 2 partial pressures (hypercapnia). The induced {{ocean acidification}} will very {{likely be a}} relevant factor shaping future marine environments. CO 2 exposure concomitantly challenges the animal's capacity of <b>acid-base</b> and ionic <b>regulation</b> {{as well as the}} ability to maintain energy metabolism and calcification. Under conditions of acute hypercapnia, numerous studies have revealed a broad range of tolerance levels displayed by various marine taxa. Thus, it is well known that, in contrast to many marine invertebrates, most teleost fish are able to fully compensate acid-base disturbances in short-term experiments (hours to several days). in order to determine whether marine fish are able to preserve aerobic scope following long-term incubation to elevated CO 2, we exposed two groups of Atlantic Cod for 4 and 12 months to 0. 3 and 0. 6 kPa P-CO 2, respectively. Measurements of standard and active metabolic rates, critical swimming speeds and aerobic scope of long-term incubated cod showed no deviations from control values, indicating that locomotory performance is not compromised by the different levels of chronic hypercapnia. While the maintenance of high activity levels is supported by a 2 -fold increased Na+/K+-ATPase protein expression and 2 -fold elevated Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the 12 month incubated fish (0. 6 kPa P-CO 2), no such elevation in Na+/K+-ATPase activity could be observed in the group treated with 0. 3 kPa P-CO 2. Owing to the relevance of Na+/K+-ATPase as a general indicator for ion regulatory capacity, these results point at an adjustment of enzymatic activity to cope with the CO 2 induced acid-base load at 0. 6 kPa P-CO 2 while under milder hypercapnic conditions the 'standard' Na+/K+-ATPase capacity might still be sufficient to maintain acid-base status.

Hagfish extracellular fluids (ECF) play {{a greater role in}} <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation</b> than in teleosts. This is because hagfish have a much larger blood volume relative to teleosts, despite a relatively low blood buffering capacity. Consequently, infusion of ammonium sulphate produced only half of the acidosis produced in marine teleosts in comparable studies, and hagfish readily tolerated a threefold greater direct H + load. Furthermore, the H + load was largely retained and buffered in the extracellular space. Despite smaller acid-base disturbances, rates of net H + excretion to the external environment were, nonetheless, comparable to those of marine teleosts, and net acid excretion persisted until blood acid-base disturbances were corrected.

Northern blots of gill total RNA, performed under conditions of high stringency, revealed cross hybridisation between the trout probe and 11 of 16 species that were examined. Cross hybridisation was not observed in the pacific hagfish (E. stoutii), Lake Magadi tilapia (Oroechromis alcalicus Grahami), bigfin eelpout (Lycodes cortezianus), blackfin poacher (Bathyagonus nigripinnus) or freshwater American eel (Anguilla rostrata). Acute (3 h) exposure of trout to external hypercapnia (P w CO 2 = ~ 7 mm Hg) was associated with a transient increase after 1 h in gill H + -ATPase mRNA levels. Thus, the increase in gill H + -ATPase activity that is known to accompany hypercapnic acidosis in trout may reflect, at least in part, its transcriptional or post- transcriptional regulation. Plasma cortisol levels were elevated in the hypercapnic fish (45 ± 15 to 83 ± 4 ng mL - 1) and because 30 cortisol was previously implicated as a regulator of H + -ATPase activity, mRNA levels were quantified in fish subjected to chronic cortisol elevation. An increase in plasma cortisol concentration from 90 ± 10 (sham implants) to 300 ± 60 ng mL - 1 (cortisol implants) for 4 days was associated with an approximate doubling of gill H + -ATPase steady-state mRNA levels. Exposure of trout for 72 h to ion-poor water caused a persistent reduction in the concentration of gill H + -ATPase steady-state mRNA. The functional significance of this response is unclear but may reflect a reduced rate of Na + uptake across the gill. These results are discussed with reference to the physiological role of the branchial H + -ATPase in both <b>acid-base</b> and ionic <b>regulation...</b>|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. Exponentially rising CO 2 (currently ~ 400  μatm) is driving climate change and causing acidification of both marine and freshwater environments. Physiologists {{have long known that}} CO 2 directly affects <b>acid-base</b> and ion <b>regulation,</b> respiratory function and aerobic performance in aquatic animals. More recently, many studies have demonstrated that elevated CO 2 projected for end of this century (e. g. 800 - 1000  μatm) can also impact physiology, and have substantial effects on behaviours linked to sensory stimuli (smell, hearing and vision) both having negative implications for fitness and survival. In contrast, the aquaculture industry was farming aquatic animals at CO 2 levels that far exceed end-of-century climate change projections (sometimes > 10   000  μatm) long before the term 'ocean acidification' was coined, with limited detrimental effects reported. It is therefore vital to understand the reasons behind this apparent discrepancy. Potential explanations include 1) the use of 'control' CO 2 levels in aquaculture studies that go beyond 2100 projections in an ocean acidification context; 2) the relatively benign environment in aquaculture (abundant food, disease protection, absence of predators) compared to the wild; 3) aquaculture species having been chosen due to their natural tolerance to the intensive conditions, including CO 2 levels; or 4) the breeding of species within intensive aquaculture having further selected traits that confer tolerance to elevated CO 2. We highlight this issue and outline the insights that climate change and aquaculture science can offer for both marine and freshwater settings. Integrating these two fields will stimulate discussion on the direction of future cross-disciplinary research. In doing so, this article aimed to optimize future research efforts and elucidate effective mitigation strategies for managing the negative impacts of elevated CO 2 on future aquatic ecosystems and the sustainability of fish and shellfish aquaculture.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{was to examine the}} {{pathophysiological}} effects of chloramine-T exposure on the respiratory, acid-base and ionoregulatory physiology of the rainbow trout gill. In particular, chloramine-T was used as a tool to probe the fundamental physiological processes of gas transfer, <b>acid-base</b> and ion <b>regulation</b> in response to branchial irritation. Exposure of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to therapeutic and subtherapeutic concentrations of chloramine-T (9 mg. L- 1 and 2 mg. L- 1, respectively) caused acute respiratory and acid-base disturbances. These consisted of an increase in ventilation frequency and arterial blood PCO 2 (PaCO 2); arterial PO 2 (PaO 2) was unaffected. Exposure of fish to chloramine-T under hyperoxic and moderately hypoxic conditions suggested that CO 2 excretion was being impaired due to the secretion of mucus in response to irritation by hypochlorite. To verify that the apparent impediment to excretion was diffusional and not due to a reduced functional surface area for gas exchange, direct measurements of cardiac output, O 2 uptake, CO 2 excretion, dorsal and ventral aortic blood pressures were made. There were no changes in dorsal or ventral aortic pressures or in branchial or systemic vascular resistance. The perfusion convection requirement for CO 2, but not O 2, increased during exposure to chloramine-T even though there were consistent increases in cardiac output. Thus a greater blood flow than was achieved would be required to excrete an equivalent amount of CO 2 during chloramine-T exposure as under non-exposed (control) conditions. However, there was sufficient blood flow to maintain and even increase O 2 uptake. Repeated intermittent exposure of fish to chloramine-T resulted in a reduction in the thickness of the gill epithelial diffusion barrier and a mucous cell hyperlasia. The consequences of these morphological changes on gas exchange were assessed using a graded hypoxic challenge. There was no effect of chloramine-T treatment on oxygen uptake rates but fish which had been pre-treated with chloramine-T maintained their PaO 2 at higher levels at 70 - 80 mmHg water PO 2 compared with controls. PaCO 2 levels were not significantly different between control and experimental animals even though chloramine-T treated animals had higher ventilation frequencies under pre-hypoxic conditions. Acute acid-base disturbances during chloramine-T exposure consisted of a metabolic alkalosis superimposed over a respiratory acidosis. A study of the net and unidirectional ionic and acid-base fluxes across the gill confirmed that chloramine-T exposure caused a reduction in the uptake of acidic equivalents. Acute Na+ and Cl- losses were also observed with chloramine-T exposure and were attributed to an increase in a transcellular rather than paracellular ionic efflux. Chloramine-T did not effect urine flow rate, glomerular filtration rate, renal Na+ and Cl- effluxes or renal clearance of Na+ and Cl-. Exposure of soft-water acclimated fish to chloramine-T did not cause increased ionic losses, consistent with the theory of transcellular rather than paracellular ionic losses. Ionic losses in both normal tap water and artificial soft water acclimated trout were eliminated by the addition of 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|The PhD {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} influence of ocean acidification on the calcification of otoliths in fish larvae and the possible consequences on the larval swimming behavior. As more carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere, the pH of the world's oceans will decrease causing {{a problem in the}} calcification of calcium carbonate in marine organisms. The vulnerability of otolith calcification is dependent on the ability of the species to counteract the effects of lower pH through <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation.</b> The dissertation reports an increase in otolith growth in Atlantic cod larvae but a decrease in otolith growth in Atlantic herring larvae. This could represent a species-specific differences in the <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation</b> between the two species. The dissertation further reports that the change in otolith calcification was well within the normal variability in otolith growth that will still allow normal functioning of the otoliths as main organs for detection of motion, acceleration, balance and sound in fish larvae.

40|$|Increasing {{atmospheric}} {{carbon dioxide}} concentration alters {{the chemistry of}} the oceans towards more acidic conditions. Polar oceans are particularly affected due to their low temperature, low carbonate content and mixing patterns, for instance upwellings. Calcifying organisms {{are expected to be}} highly impacted by the decrease in the oceans' pH and carbonate ions concentration. In particular, sea urchins, members of the phylum Echinodermata, are hypothesized to be at risk due to their high-magnesium calcite skeleton. However, tolerance to ocean acidification in metazoans is first linked to <b>acid–base</b> <b>regulation</b> capacities of the extracellular fluids. No information on this is available to date for Antarctic echinoderms and inference from temperate and tropical studies needs support. In this study, we investigated the acid–base status of 9 species of sea urchins (3 cidaroids, 2 regular euechinoids and 4 irregular echinoids). It appears that Antarctic regular euechinoids seem equipped with similar <b>acid–base</b> <b>regulation</b> systems as tropical and temperate regular euechinoids but could rely on more passive ion transfer systems, minimizing energy requirements. Cidaroids have an acid–base status similar to that of tropical cidaroids. Therefore Antarctic cidaroids will most probably not be affected by decreasing seawater pH, the pH drop linked to ocean acidification being negligible in comparison of the naturally low pH of the coelomic fluid. Irregular echinoids might not suffer from reduced seawater pH if acidosis of the coelomic fluid pH does not occur but more data on their <b>acid–base</b> <b>regulation</b> are needed. Combining these results with the resilience of Antarctic sea urchin larvae strongly suggests that these organisms might not be the expected victims of ocean acidification. However, data on the impact of other global stressors such as temperature and of the combination of the different stressors needs to be acquired to assess the sensitivity of these organisms to global change.

40|$|Sodium/proton {{exchangers}} (NHE) are transmembrane {{proteins that}} facilitate {{the exchange of}} a Na + ion for a H + ion across cellular membranes. The NHE {{are present in the}} gills of fishes and are believed to function in <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation</b> by driving the extrusion of protons across the branchial epithelium in exchange for Na + in the water. In this study, we have used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of a branchial NHE in the gills of the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa. The subsequent partial cDNA sequence shares homology with other vertebrate and invertebrate NHE isoforms. In addition, using semi-quantitative, multiplex RT-PCR we demonstrate that mRNA expression of hagfish gill NHE is upregulated following an induced metabolic acidosis. Expression was increased to 4. 4 times basal levels at 2 -h post-infusion and had decreased to 1. 6 times basal by 6 h. Expression had returned to basal levels by 24 -h post-infusion. The inference from this study is that a gill NHE which is potentially important in <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation</b> has been present in the vertebrate lineage since before the divergence of the hagfishes from the main vertebrate line. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{involvement}} of the gill and kidney in <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation</b> was examined in the American eel, Anguilla rostrata, during 36 h of continuous air-exposure and subsequent return to water. While in air, eels developed a severe mixed respiratory/-metabolic acidosis. Renal acid excretion increased only slightly during the latter stages of air-exposure. A pronounced reduction in urine flow rate was important to minimize dehydration but essentially eliminated the kidney as a route for excess acid excretion. Upon return to the water, eels had accrued an extracellular metabolic acid load of 9 - 53 mmol I" 1. The metabolic acid was cleared from the extracellular compartment at an exceptionally low rate (approximately 70 ^molkg~ ' h~') and about 50 % of the acid load remained after 18 h of recovery in water. The clearance of metabolic acid was accounted for by enhanced branchial acid excretion which was related primarily to adjustments of unidirectional Na+ fluxes. Unidirectional Cl~ fluxes were undetectable using radiotracer methods. We speculate that the inef-ficiency of <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation</b> in the eel compared to other teleosts is, in part, related {{to the absence of}} significant branchial C 1 ~/HCO 3 ~ exchange...|$|E

In another project, tissue oxygenation and blood flow were studied together with energy metabolism and <b>acid-base</b> <b>regulation</b> in ground squirrels during hibernatation and arousal. African lungfishes (Protopterus spp.) undergo aestivation during dry periods. Recently, P. spp. were successfully brought into aestivation after building a dried mucous cocoon inside a plastic container (Chew et al. 2004). This set-up was used to investigate aestivating lungfish under normoxia and hypoxia in a MRI scanner by monitoring high-energy phosphates and intracellular pH through in vivo 31 P-NMR spectroscopy over a time period of 12 days. Large changes occurred in phosphodiester concentrations during transition to aestivation, indicating dramatic changes in cellular membrane properties. Chew et al. (2004). J. Exp.
