2500|$|The {{large extent}} of {{variability}} in HLA genes poses significant challenges in investigating {{the role of}} HLA genetic variations in diseases. Disease association studies typically treat each HLA allele as a single complete unit, which does not illuminate {{the parts of the}} molecule associated with disease. Karp D. R. et al. describes a novel sequence feature variant type (SFVT) approach for HLA genetic analysis that categorizes HLA proteins into biologically relevant smaller sequence features (SFs), and their variant types (VTs). Sequence features are combinations of amino acid sites defined based on structural information (e.g., beta-sheet 1), functional information (e.g., peptide antigen-binding), and polymorphism. These sequence features can be overlapping and continuous or discontinuous in the linear sequence. Variant types for each sequence feature are defined based upon all known polymorphisms in the HLA locus being described. SFVT categorization of HLA is applied in genetic <b>association</b> <b>analysis</b> so that the effects and roles of the epitopes shared by several HLA alleles can be identified. Sequence features and their variant types have been described for all classical HLA proteins; the international repository of HLA SFVTs will be maintained at IMGT/HLA database. [...] A tool to convert HLA alleles into their component SFVTs {{can be found on the}} Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) website.|$|E

In this paper we ask the following research question: “Does considering agents profile information when constructing an associative network by a game with a purpose allows to extract subjective information that might have been lost otherwise?”.

They assign for halos of a particular snapshot, the set of halos from previous snapshots they possibly originated from. In this work, <b>Association</b> rule <b>analysis</b> a well known technique from data mining {{has been used to}} build halo merger trees. <b>Association</b> rule <b>analysis</b> tries to find associations between different halos(in same as well as in snapshots) using the particle IDs of the particles which the halos are made of. Associations are expressed in the form of association rules. Merger trees are one of the several useful results one can obtain from the output of <b>association</b> rule <b>analysis.</b> Other results including halo substructure and halo splitting can also be extracted. Each type of output to be extracted from the <b>association</b> rule <b>analysis</b> output correspond to a pattern in association rules. Merger trees were formed and tested using the above technique. Dark matter simulations were run using Gadget- 2 for 128 ^ 3 particles.

Although it is still a poorly understood subject speculative ideas about brain processes involved in creative thinking may be implemented in computational models. A review of different approaches to creativity, insight and intuition is presented. Two factors are essential for creativity: imagination and selection or filtering. Imagination should be constrained by experience, while filtering in the case of creative use of words may be based on semantic and phonological <b>associations.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of brain processes involved in invention of new words leads to practical algorithms that create many interesting and novel names associated with a set of keywords.
