5|$|Some {{have speculated}} that a {{contributor}} to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when <b>animal</b> <b>protein</b> was in short supply during the German occupation. By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the haute cuisine style of cooking, {{although much of the}} lighter presentations and new techniques remained.|$|E
5|$|Chicken now {{provides}} some 20% of the <b>animal</b> <b>protein</b> eaten by the world's human {{population in the}} form of meat and eggs. Chickens are often raised intensively in battery farms; this facilitates production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds. Other species including ducks, geese, pheasants, guineafowl and turkeys are significant economically around the world. Less commonly-raised species such as the ostrich are starting to be farmed for their meat, which is low in cholesterol; they have also been kept for their feathers, and for leather from their skin.|$|E
5|$|Isotope {{analysis}} of the remains revealed that while the bones had δ13C values that were typical of those found at many other southern British Neolithic sites, they had significantly higher values of δ15N, which grew over time. Although this data is difficult to interpret, the investigative team believed that it probably reflected that these individuals had had a terrestrial diet high in <b>animal</b> <b>protein</b> that over time was increasingly supplemented with freshwater river or estuarine foods. In {{the case of the}} older individuals whose remains were interned in the tomb, the tooth enamel was worn away and the dentine had become exposed on the chewing area of the crowns.|$|E

40|$|Hard-to-degrade <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> are ubiquitously present {{throughout}} animal bodies. Enor-mous {{numbers of}} these proteins {{generated in the}} meat industry are converted to industrial wastes, the disposal of which is tremendously difficult. Most hard-to-degrade <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> are cur-rently disposed of by incineration; however, this method has ecological disadvantages {{in terms of an}} apparent energy loss and the production of a large amount of carbon dioxide. As a result, an innovative solution to these problems has been sought. In this review, we focus on the degradation of three hard-to-degrade <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> (extracellular matrix proteins, collagen in particular, keratin, and prion proteins) and discuss the decomposing capability of thermophilic bacteria. These proteins are strongly resistant to proteinases because of their structural features; therefore, new approaches employing bacterial proteases with strong activity and broad specificity are re-quired for practical application.

5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{typically}} harvested local small game, {{but sometimes}} organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. Their {{main sources of}} <b>animal</b> <b>protein</b> came from mule deer and rabbits, but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep, antelope, and elk. They began to domesticate turkeys starting around 1000, and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked, supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites. These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn, which further deepened reliance on the staple crop. Puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur, and made implements such as awls and needles from turkey and deer bones. Despite the availability of fish in the area's rivers and streams, archaeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten.|$|E
5|$|Milk was an {{important}} source of <b>animal</b> <b>protein</b> for those who could not afford meat. It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common. Plain fresh milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly. Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or milk that was soured or watered down. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack of}} technology to keep it from spoiling. On occasion it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was difficult to keep fresh in bulk and almond milk was generally used in its stead.|$|E
5|$|Cheese was {{far more}} {{important}} as a foodstuff, especially for common people, {{and it has been}} suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of <b>animal</b> <b>protein</b> among the lower classes. Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan, were available and well known in late medieval times. There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses. Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas. Butter, another important dairy product, was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production in the latter half of the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. While most other regions used oil or lard as cooking fats, butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas. Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward.|$|E

High levels of <b>proteins</b> (most particularly <b>animal</b> <b>proteins)</b> is unhealthy for lovebirds living under any alternate conditions (i.e. non-breeding, pets).|$|R
5|$|The {{collection}} of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still {{takes place in}} Casamance, {{which is one of}} three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are {{an important component of the}} family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of <b>animal</b> <b>protein</b> among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers.|$|E

Copper salts, including copper gluconate, copper acetate, or copper sulfate, are more easily absorbed than copper oxides. Elevated levels of dietary zinc, as well as cadmium, high intakes of phytate and simple sugars (fructose, sucrose) inhibit dietary absorption of copper. Furthermore, low levels of dietary copper inhibit iron absorption.|$|E

As a result, more health-conscious African Americans are using alternative methods of preparation, eschewing trans fats in favor of natural vegetable oils and substituting smoked turkey for fatback and other, cured pork products; limiting the amount of refined sugar in desserts; and emphasizing the consumption of more fruits and vegetables than <b>animal</b> <b>protein.</b> There is some resistance to such changes, however, as they involve deviating from long culinary tradition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>protein</b> {{products}} {{are a good}} source of B12, particularly organ meats such as kidney or liver. Other good sources are fish, eggs, and dairy products. It is suggested that vegans, who consume no animal meat or by-products, supplement their diet with B12. While there are foods fortified with B12 available, some may be mislabelled in an attempt to boost their nutritional claims. Products of fermentation, such as algae extracts and sea vegetables, may be labelled as sources of B12, but actually contain B12 analogues which compete for the absorption of the nutrient itself. In order to get adequate amounts of the vitamin, orally administered pills or fortified foods such as cereals and soy milk, are recommended for vegans.|$|E
