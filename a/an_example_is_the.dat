5|$|Known in {{the circles}} of clerics, students, and merchants, chess {{entered into the}} popular culture of Middle Ages. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> 209th song of Carmina Burana from the 13thcentury, which starts {{with the names of}} chess pieces, Roch, pedites, regina...|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> bipartite double cover, {{formed from}} a graph by {{splitting}} each vertex v into v0 and v1 and replacing each edge u,v with edges u0,v1 and v0,u1. The function mapping v0 and v1 in the cover to v {{in the original}} graph is a homomorphism and a covering map.|$|E
50|$|Area {{monitoring}} is {{a common}} application of WSNs. In area monitoring, <b>the</b> WSN <b>is</b> deployed over a region where some phenomenon is to <b>be</b> monitored. <b>A</b> military <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> use of sensors detect enemy intrusion; <b>a</b> civilian <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> geo-fencing of gas or oil pipelines.|$|R
50|$|Are {{of varied}} plant, but usually round or oval, {{adapting}} to the terrain. The natural defenses of <b>the</b> sea <b>are</b> complemented by walls and moats into <b>the</b> inland.

5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> development of wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|In {{several other}} locations, {{the tree is}} absent from large areas but still present in a few {{specific}} habitats. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Bluegrass region of Kentucky, where red maple is {{not found in the}} dominant open plains, but is present along streams. Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the Grain Belt, despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area.|$|E
5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or as a community, interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most important}} roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil turning and aeration, dung burial, pest control, pollination and wildlife nutrition. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> beetles, which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> notable <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> FMA VF-1 {{manufactured}} in Argentina.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> {{motivating}} <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> distances {{traveled in}} a given time.|$|R

5|$|International {{titles are}} awarded to composers and solvers of chess {{problems}} and to correspondence chess players (by the International Correspondence Chess Federation). National chess organizations may also award titles, usually to the advanced players {{still under the}} level needed for international titles; <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Chess expert title used in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities {{can also}} adopt flags of their own. The designs {{of the city}} flags {{are similar to the}} prefectural flags: a mon on a monocolored background. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> flag of Amakusa in Kumamoto Prefecture: the city symbol is {{composed}} of the Katakana character ア (a) and surrounded by waves. This symbol is centered on a white flag, with a ratio of 2:3. Both the city emblem and the flag were adopted in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on an organism's phenotype, {{or physical}} characteristics. Phenotype {{is determined by}} an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and {{the environment in which}} the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> good <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{oxidation}} of glucose (a monosaccharide) in aerobic respiration.|$|R

5|$|Related to {{this use}} of resonance, Messiaen also {{composed}} music in which the lowest, or fundamental, note is combined with higher notes or chords played much more quietly. These higher notes, far from being perceived as conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the timbre of the fundamental note like mixture stops on a pipe organ. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> song of the golden oriole in Le loriot of the Catalogue d'oiseaux for solo piano (Example 4).|$|E
5|$|Specific {{plans or}} {{strategic}} themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which {{result in a}} specific type of pawn structure. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> , which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside. The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a Calabi–Yau manifold is a two-dimensional torus or donut shape. Consider a circle on this surface that goes once through the hole of the donut. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> red circle in the figure. There are infinitely many circles like it on a torus; in fact, the entire surface is a union of such circles.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{local governments have}} {{implemented}} tree and landscape ordinances, which will help communities by providing shade during summer. Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city permit. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> city of Glendale, California: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the California sycamore, the coast live oak, mesa oak, valley oak, scrub oak, California bay. Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit. Within the permit they have to provide detailed information {{about the number of}} trees affected, trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself. They also have to submit photographs of the site, and a site plan sketch.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the history}} of Canada, {{heraldry}} in the country has incorporated aboriginal and First Nations symbols and elements. The Coat of Arms of Nunavut, for example, includes elements such as an inukshuk, a qulliq, and an igloo, all of which are references to the Inuit peoples who live in the area, while the arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority include ravens, a First Nations symbol of creation and transformation. In addition, some Canadians choose to bear their arms on a roundel rather than a shield, a reference to a drumhead; <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> coat of arms of Nunavut.|$|E
5|$|Early {{people began}} {{altering}} communities of {{flora and fauna}} for their own benefit through means such as fire-stick farming and forest gardening very early. Exact dates are hard to determine, as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them, and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> semi-tough rachis and larger seeds of cereals from just after the Younger Dryas (about 9,500 BC) in the early Holocene in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent. Monophyletic characteristics were attained without any human intervention, implying that apparent domestication of the cereal rachis could have occurred quite naturally.|$|E

5|$|In {{cases of}} massive and severe {{infection}} of invasive pests, techniques of pest control {{are often used}} in combination. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, an invasive beetle from China, which has destroyed {{tens of millions of}} ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely Tetrastichus planipennisi, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, Oobius agrili, a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and Spathius agrili, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States of America as a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer. Initial results for Tetrastichus planipennisi have shown promise, and it is now being released along with Beauveria bassiana, a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties.|$|E
5|$|Interactions between organisms {{can produce}} both {{conflict}} and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, {{such as a}} pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt {{and the evolution of}} tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the common garter snake. In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake.|$|E
5|$|Interstate, U.S., {{and state}} routes have {{maintenance}} road numbers that {{often do not}} match their signed route numbers. For instance, DE 261 in New Castle County is designated as Road 203. In Sussex County, several state routes largely have matching maintenance road numbers; for example, {{the entire length of}} DE 24 is designated Road 24. Some routes in Sussex County have maintenance road numbers that reflect former route designations; <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> section of US 9 between Laurel and Georgetown which is designated Road 28, reflecting the former DE 28 designation along this stretch of road.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a part of}} the Vietnamization Program South Vietnamese Navy crewmen were {{assigned}} for training purposes beginning in February 1969. Many close relationships developed with the American-Vietnamese crews while training together and <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> naming of his sixth child by Petty Officer First Class Le Chung. Because he thought so much of his American counterparts, he named his son [...] "Le Hudson" [...] in honor of the Point Hudson.|$|R
