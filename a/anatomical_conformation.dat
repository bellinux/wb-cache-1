40|$|AbstractAn open {{fracture}} of the calcaneus with loss of substance is a challenging injury and requires specialized care, involves high costs, and demands attention despite its lower incidence. The main complications are osteomyelitis, pressure ulcers, and fistulas, {{as well as}} pain conditions in the lateral, medial, and plantar regions. This {{is due to the}} wide loss of tissue and the change in <b>anatomical</b> <b>conformation</b> of the calcaneus in some cases. However, in cases of flattening of the calcaneus bone, these complications may be prevented or treated successfully. This technical note describes the resection osteotomy technique for calcaneus flattening to prevent and treat complications after micro-surgical flap in cases of open fracture or loss of substance...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMiddle ear cholesteatoma is an {{aggressive}} form of chronic otitis media requiring surgical therapy. The surgical strategy {{depends on the}} location of the lesion, its extensions to the middle ear and mastoid, the <b>anatomical</b> <b>conformation</b> of the tympanomastoid cavities and the health status of the patient (as well as his or her interest in aquatic leisure activities). For several years, imaging of the ear has been a routine test in the preoperative work-up of the disease. National guidelines for the topic “Imaging of non-operated middle ear cholesteatoma” were prepared in October 2010, for the annual congress of the French Society of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery (SFORL), by a panel of experts from the SFORL, represented by the French Association of Otology and Neuro-otology (AFON), and the French Radiological Society (SFR), represented by the French Society of Head and Neck Imaging (CIREOL).

40|$|Due to its {{particular}} <b>anatomical</b> <b>conformation,</b> {{the disposition of}} the temporal bone in the skull and the size of its structures, the interpretation, learning and teaching of its anatomy is very difficult, both to the undergraduate as well as the graduate students. It is impossible to reach a complete anatomical knowledge of its anatomy unless it can be projected in three-dimensions, and this requires not only the classical reading on the subject, but also the very own experimentation. The teacher must count on all the previously mentioned as well as to provide the student with good quality images next to their corresponding dissection. The aim {{of this article is to}} turn my experience after almost 15 years of working on the Dissection Team of the Second Chair of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Buenos Aires, and help the reader to learn about the anatomy of the ear and the temporal bone...|$|E

For each animal, the following biometrical measurements were considered: withers height, chest height, chest depth, trunk length, rump length, ischium width of the rump, ear and nose length, chest and cannon circumference. Results showed that sexual dimorphism was not present; however, two morphological groups of Basset Hound with some differences were found. The first group consisted of animals with high and broad chest, while the second one was more compact, with more pronounced nose and ears. Considering breed health, {{it would be interesting}} to select the subjects of the first group since showing an <b>anatomical</b> <b>conformation</b> less susceptible to some disorders typical of the breed.

40|$|A {{decrease}} in fertility {{can have a}} negative economic impact, both locally and over a broader geographical scope, and this is especially the case {{with regard to the}} cattle industry. Therefore, much interest exists in evaluating proteins that might be able to increase the fertility of sperm. Heparin binding proteins (HBPs), specifically the fertility associated antigen (FAA) and the Type- 2 tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP- 2), act to favor the capacitation and acrosome reaction and perhaps even modulate the immune system’s response toward the sperm. The objective of this research was to determine the effect on fertility of adding recombinant FAA (rFAA) and recombinant TIMP- 2 (rTIMP- 2) to bovine semen before cryopreservation for use in an artificial insemination (AI) program in a tropical environment. For this experiment, 100 crossbred (Bos taurus x Bos indicus) heifers were selected based on their estrus cycle, body condition score (BCS), of 4 to 6 on a scale of 1 to 9, and adequate <b>anatomical</b> <b>conformation</b> evaluated by pelvic and genital (normal) measurements.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study of the}} epidemiological and clinic-pathological aspects of cattle and buffaloes with degenerative joint disease (DJD) was conducted {{in the state of}} Pará, Brazil. From 1999 to 2014, eleven cattle and 24 buffaloes were evaluated. All the treated animals with suspected DJD underwent a clinical examination of the musculoskeletal system. In seven cattle and eight buffaloes with clinical signs of the disease postmortem examination was performed. The common clinical signs observed in both species were chronic lameness, stiff gait, postural changes, audible crackles in the affected limb, prolonged recumbency, difficulty in getting up and progressive weight loss. The lesions observed at necropsy were: irregular articular surfaces, erosion of the articular cartilage and the underlying bone tissue, and proliferation of the periarticular bone tissue with formation of osteophytes. The most affected joints in cattle and buffaloes wereof the hind limb. In buffaloes, the main predisposing factor to the onset of DJD was phosphorus deficiency. In cattle, defects of the <b>anatomical</b> <b>conformation</b> of the hind limbs, chronic trauma due to the activities performed, such as semen collection, and advanced age possibly contributed to the emergence of the disease...|$|E
40|$|The intra-operative {{latissimus dorsi}} (LD) pedicle damage during {{axillary}} lymph-node dissection {{by the general}} surgeon is a rare complication leading to flap failure and poor outcomes. The authors present their experience on this topic and develop a classification of the thoracodorsal (TD) pedicle injuries and reconstruction algorithm. Pedicle damage of LD occurred in five cases, three of which were experienced during immediate breast reconstruction and two observed in patients who underwent prior surgery. In two cases the thoracodorsal vein (TDV) was damaged in its proximal segment, thus end-to-end anastomosis was performed between distal stump of TDV and circumflex scapular vein (CSV). In one case the TDV required simple microsurgical repair while in other two cases the severe damage of vein and artery required more complex surgical strategies in attempt to salvage the flap. Four cases completely survived with one case of rippling phenomenon. One case had partial flap necrosis that required subtotal muscle resection. Based on these cases, the authors have developed a reconstruction algorithm in attempt to repair LD pedicle damage while preserving breast reconstruction. Taking into account its <b>anatomical</b> <b>conformation,</b> TD pedicle injuries are classified in four different types and available options are suggested {{for all of them}} according to the anatomical site and to the mechanism and timing of injury...|$|E
40|$|The perfect {{function}} of the mitral valve {{is linked to the}} <b>anatomical</b> <b>conformation</b> and physiological interaction of all the component of the mitral valve complex (leaflets, annulus, chordae, papillary muscles, left ventricle). The most important component of the valve are the leaflets. The nomenclature and the number of the leaflets are divergent in different studies. Usually the clinical Carpentier’s Classification is used, which identifies three posterior leaflet scallops: from antero-lateral (P 1) to central (P 2) and postero-medial (P 3). The terminology of mitral valve leaflet is a lot debated in the scientific literature. The aim of the study is to analyze the variability of the anatomy of posterior leaflet in normal subjects (Autoptic and cardiectomy specimens) and patients with myxomatous disease (three dimensional echocardiography) for assess possible difference and similarity. In patient with myxomatous disease we evaluate the clinical influence of the anatomy of the posterior leaflet on the planning of the mitral valve surgical repair strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty normal heart specimens without mitral valve disease, were examined by three independent observers (two pathologists and 1 cardiologist). The specimens which had been fixed in formalin following autopsy or cardiectomy, were selected in the anatomo-pathological heart collection of Padua University. The mitral valve was opened along the optus margin of the heart and evaluated. It was used a new terminology and call the normal physiological indentation, deep more than 50...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective To radiographically {{evaluate}} {{the quality of}} cementation and implantation technique using a polished, triple-tapered femoral stem in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Method Retrospective study with radiographic evaluation of 86 hips in 83 patients who underwent to primary THA with the triple-tapered cemented femoral stem C-Stem (DePuy Orthopedics, Warsaw, Indiana). Cases with at least one-year of follow-up were included, and data related to preoperative, immediate postoperative, and late postoperative radiographic evolution were recorded. This study analyzed, among others, the proximal femoral anatomy, the quality of cementation as described by Barrack, and the implant positioning. Cementation was also evaluated and quantified in the Gruen zones with one-year of follow-up. Results The mean age was 62. 85 years. Proximal femoral <b>anatomical</b> <b>conformation</b> was Dorr type A in 34 (39. 53 %) cases, type B in 52 (60. 46 %), and no type C cases were found. Five (5. 81 %) cases were defined as type A by Barrack's cementation classification system, 46 (56. 49 %) type B, 27 (31. 40 %) type C, and eight (9. 30 %) type D. The greatest cement mantle thickness was observed in zones four (15. 53 mm) and 11 (15. 64 mm), and the smallest in zone nine (3. 51 mm). Positioning in varus was observed in eight (9. 3 %) cases, valgus in 25 (29 %), forward deviation in two (5 %), and backward deviation in 55 (63. 95 %). Conclusions The C-Stem femoral system presented satisfactory results related to cementation pattern, positioning, osteolysis, and stress shielding with regard to literature referring to double-tapered or triple-tapered models, demonstrating to be a safe method, with a predictable and reliable cementing pattern...|$|E
40|$|A Varian 4 MeV isocentric therapy {{accelerator}} {{has been}} modified to perform {{also as a}} CT scanner. The goal is to provide low cost computed tomography capability for use in radiotherapy. The system will have three principal uses. These are (i) to provide 2 - and 3 -dimensional maps of electron density distribution for CT assisted therapy planning, (ii) to aid in patient set up by providing sectional views of the treatment volume and high contrast scout-mode verification images and (iii) to provide a means for periodically checking the patients <b>anatomical</b> <b>conformation</b> against what was used to generate the original therapy plan. The treatment machine was modified by mounting an array of detectors on a frame bolted to the counter weight end of the gantry {{in such a manner}} as to define a 'third generation' CT Scanner geometry. The data gathering is controlled by a Z- 80 based microcomputer system which transfers the x-ray transmission data to a general purpose PDP 11 / 34 for processing. There a series of calibration processes and a logarithmic conversion are performed to get projection data. After reordering the projection data to an equivalent parallel beam sinogram format a convolution algorithm is employed to construct the image from the equivalent parallel projection data. Results of phantom studies have shown a spatial resolution of 2. 6 mm and an electron density discrimination of less than 1 % which are sufficiently good for accurate therapy planning. Results also show that the system is linear to within the precision of our measurement (≈. 75 %) over a wide range of electron densities corresponding to those found in body tissues. Animal and human images are also presented to demonstrate that the system's imaging capability is sufficient to allow the necessary visualization of anatomy...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{intestinal}} resection impairs the {{absorptive capacity}} {{and results in}} short-bowel syndrome-associated intestinal failure (SBS-IF), when fluid, electrolyte, acid-base, micro-, and macronutrient homeostasis cannot be maintained on a conventional oral diet. Several factors, including the length and site of the resected intestine, <b>anatomical</b> <b>conformation</b> of the remnant bowel, {{and the degree of}} postresection intestinal adaptation determine the disease severity. While mild SBS patients achieve nutritional autonomy with dietary modification (eg, hyperphagia, small frequent meals, and oral rehydration fluids), those with moderate-to-severe disease may develop SBS-IF and become dependent on parenteral support (PS) in the form of intravenous fluids and/or nutrition for sustenance of life. SBS-IF is a chronic debilitating disease associated with a poor quality of life, and carries significant morbidity and health care costs. Medical management of SBS-IF is primarily focused on individually tailored symptomatic treatment strategies, such as antisecretory and antidiarrheal agents to mitigate fluid losses, and PS. However, PS administration is associated with potentially life-threatening complications, such as central venous thromboses, bloodstream infections, and liver disease. In pursuit of a targeted therapy to augment intestinal adaptation, research over the past 2 decades has identified glucagon-like peptide, an intestinotrophic gut peptide that has been shown to enhance intestinal absorptive capacity by causing an increase in the villus length, crypt depth, and mesenteric blood flow and by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and secretions. Teduglutide, a recombinant analog of glucagon-like peptide- 2, is the first targeted therapeutic agent to gain approval for use in adult SBS-IF. Teduglutide was shown to result in significant (20 %- 100 %) reduction in PS-volume requirement and have a satisfactory safety profile in three randomized control trials. Further research is warranted to see if reduction in PS dependency translates to improved quality of life and reduced PS-associated complications...|$|E

40|$|Surgery for anal fistula {{is often}} {{associated}} with continence disorders due to the transection of sphincter muscles. Extensive knowledge of anal canal anatomy and anal fistula can help prevent this outcome. Objective:Correlate the <b>anatomical</b> <b>conformation</b> of the anal canal, fistula track and the internal opening according to gender and hemicircumference (anterior vs. posterior) using 3 -D ultrasonography. Methods: 165 patients with fistula were evaluated with 3 -D ultrasound and grouped according to gender, fistula type, internal opening and track position. Fistulae were transsphincteric in 128 and intersphincteric in 37 subjects. The study measured the external and internal anal sphincter, the puborectalis, the distance from the internal opening to the distal edge of the external and internal sphincter, the length of the internal and external sphincter compromised by the track and the percentage of compromised muscle. Results:Muscles were longer in males. The distance from the internal opening to the internal sphincter was greater for the posterior hemicircumference. The point where the fistulous track crossed the anterior external sphincter was similar for the two genders but the compromised muscle percentage was greater in females. The point where the fistulous track crossed the internal sphincter was similar for the two genders but the percentage of compromised internal sphincter was greater in males for the posterior hemicircumference. The study was limited by the absence of testing for interobserver and intraobserver agreement. Conclusion:The anal canal muscles are longer in males and the pectinate line is asymmetrical. In females, the percentage of compromised external sphincter was greater in the anterior hemicircumference due to the shorter external sphincter, while in males the percentage of compromised internal sphincter was greater in the posterior hemicircumferenceA cirurgia para fÃstula anal Ã muitas vezes associada a distÃrbios de continÃncia, devido Ã transecÃÃo do esfÃncter.

40|$|Release notes FMRIPREP 1. 0. 0, codename "BOLD raccoon", is {{the first}} {{official}} release of FMRIPREP. FMRIPREP "BOLD" is {{the outcome of a}} thorough testing process to assess that FMRIPREP works reliably on any dataset uploaded to OpenfMRI. At the time of writing, a second pass of FMRIPREP is being run over 243 participants from 62 datasets of OpenfMRI that contain BOLD images. This accounts for approximately 4 subjects per dataset (with exceptions like My Connectome, which only has one subject but hundreds of BOLD runs). Overall, this release has been tested on more than 320 participants from OpenfMRI, and dozens of other datasets that our users have provided when encountering problems. Making a thorough pipeline that adapts to many kinds of dataset and associated metadata is a difficult undertaking. Throughout the three testing phases, we have encountered many problems in FMRIPREP (as {{well as some of the}} datasets), but the most complicated to deal with were hitting memory limits on high-capacity (> 64 GB) compute nodes. The effort to profile and limit memory consumption led to many optimizations and bugfixes in FMRIPREP, as well as in Nipype. This release supports a friendly way of providing FreeSurfer licenses, and comes with FreeSurfer 6. 0. 1 embedded in the Docker and Singularity containers. Acknowledgment We want to thank all the contributors that have added to FMRIPREP in one way or another (see our credits file). This release also contains modifications to prepare contributions that are in the making, like @madeleinesnyder's pull request for processing only-BOLD datasets or @emdupre's pull request for Multi-echo BOLD images. We also thank these soon-to-be contributors, and look forward to incorporating their additions. We would also like to thank the FreeSurfer team for their support when moving to 6. 0. 1, and particularly Andrew Hoopes, who followed-up closely during this effort. Finally, we want to thank all our users who posted over 80 (!) questions about FMRIPREP on neurostars. org, many of them reporting problems that couldn't have been diagnosed otherwise. Likewise, many users directly reported to this GitHub repository. We want to express our utmost appreciation to them and their valuable feedback.
