5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Lafayette, Indiana, Rose moved in the early 1980s to Los Angeles, where he became active in the local hard rock scene and joined several bands, {{including}} Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns. In 1985, he co-founded Guns N' Roses, {{with whom he had}} great success and recognition in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Their first album, Appetite for Destruction (1987), has sold in excess of 30 million copies worldwide, {{and is one of the}} best-selling debut albums of all time in the U.S. with 18 million units sold. Its full-length follow-ups, the twin albums Use Your Illusion I <b>and</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Your</b> Illusion II (1991), were also widely successful; they respectively debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the two and}} a {{half year}} world tour in support of the albums Use Your Illusion I <b>and</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Your</b> Illusion II, Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash {{returned}} to Los Angeles. He soon sold his home, the Walnut House, and moved to Mulholland Drive. He built a small home studio, nicknamed The Snakepit, over his garage and began working on demos for songs he had written during the tour. Slash worked on the demos with Guns N' Roses bandmate and drummer Matt Sorum. They were later joined by guitarist Gilby Clarke and Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez, jamming and recording most nights. Slash played the demos for Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose who rejected the material, though he would later want to use them for the next Guns N' Roses album. They had recorded twelve songs by 1994, the same year that Guns N' Roses went on hiatus.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock {{entered the}} 1990s {{as one of}} the {{dominant}} forms of commercial music. The multi-platinum releases of AC/DC's The Razors Edge (1990), Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I <b>and</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Your</b> Illusion II (both in 1991), Ozzy Osbourne's No More Tears (1991), and Van Halen's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge (1991) showcased this popularity. Additionally, the Black Crowes released their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker (1990), which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies. In 1992, Def Leppard followed up 1987's Hysteria with Adrenalize, which went multi-platinum, spawned four Top 40 singles and held the number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks.|$|E

500|$|With Lights and Sounds, Yellowcard {{broke away}} from their {{original}} pop punk sound to a more alternative rock album. The album is somewhat of a concept album, made to reflect what Yellowcard was feeling {{at the time of}} production. Ryan Key, in discussion of this, said that Ocean Avenue was about [...] "finding your place in the world" [...] and explained that Lights and Sounds was about [...] "realizing that you've gotten lost". The band has cited Radiohead's Kid A (2000) and Guns N' Roses' 1991 albums Use Your Illusion I <b>and</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Your</b> Illusion II as major influences for the album. Yellowcard also credit Aphex Twin, Mouse on Mars and Explosions in the Sky for inspiration, regarding the music sound in the album.|$|E
500|$|In September 1991, {{with enough}} {{material}} completed for two albums, Guns N' Roses released Use Your Illusion I <b>and</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Your</b> Illusion II, which debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 respectively on the Billboard 200, a feat not achieved {{by any other}} group. By the albums' release, however, Rose's relationships with his bandmates had become increasingly strained. His childhood friend Izzy Stradlin abruptly left the group in November 1991; he was replaced by Gilby Clarke of Kill For Thrills. Of his reasons for leaving, Stradlin said, [...] "I didn't like the complications that became such a part of daily life in Guns N' Roses," [...] citing the riot and Rose's chronic lateness as examples, {{as well as his}} new-found sobriety making it difficult to be around other bandmates continued alcohol and substance abuse. At some point during the remainder of the tour, Rose reportedly demanded, and received, sole ownership of the Guns N' Roses name from Slash and Duff McKagan; Rose allegedly issued an ultimatum—they had to sign the name over to him or he would not perform. (In 2008, however, Rose stated that these reports were false and that the alleged coercion would have rendered the contract legally untenable.) ...|$|E

(1988) by Poison, spawned number one hit single [...] "Every Rose Has Its Thorn", and {{eventually}} sold eight million copies worldwide. Britny Fox from Philadelphia and Winger from New York released their eponymous débuts in 1988. In 1989 Mötley Crüe produced their most commercially successful album, the multi-platinum number one Dr. Feelgood. In the same year eponymous débuts included Danger Danger from New York, Dangerous Toys from Austin, Texas, who provided more of a Southern rock tone to the genre, [...] and Enuff Z'Nuff from Chicago who provided an element of psychedelia to their sound and visual style. L.A. débuts included Warrant with Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich (1989), and Skid Row with their eponymous album (1989), which reached number six in the Billboard 200, but they were {{to be one of the}} last major bands that emerged in the glam metal era. Glam metal entered the 1990s as one of the major commercial genres of popular music. In 1990 débuts for Slaughter, from Las Vegas with Stick It to Ya and FireHouse, from North Carolina, with their eponymous album reached number 18 and number 21 on the Billboard 200 respectively, but it would be the peak of their commercial achievement. Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I <b>and</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Your</b> Illusion II (both in 1991) and Van Halen's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge (1991) showcased the genre's popularity.|$|E

The first occurrence of such an event was in September 1991, when Guns N' Roses conjunctively released Use Your Illusion I, which sold 685,000 copies, <b>and</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Your</b> Illusion II, which sold 770,000 copies. The first week sales totals of Graduation and Curtis have outsold the first week sales totals of Guns N' Roses' two albums. 50 Cent showed graciousness in regards to his defeat. In a statement released to the Associated Press, he said, [...] "I am very excited to have participated in one of the biggest album release weeks in the last two years. Collectively, we have sold hundreds of thousands of units in our debut week. This marks a great moment for hip-hop music, one that will go down in history." [...] After years of slumping sales, the album competition between the two releases and the resulting record breaking performances both albums demonstrated was considered to be a [...] "fantastic day for hip-hop".|$|E

Then close your eyes <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> imagination." [...] He later wrote on his blog about the film, [...] "The day will come when Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will be studied in film classes and shown at cult film festivals. It will be seen, in retrospect, as marking the end of an era. Of course there will be many more CGI-based action epics, but never again one this bloated, excessive, incomprehensible, long (149 minutes) or expensive ($200 million)." [...] Ebert would continue to lambast the film (and, sometimes, the Transformers franchise in general) in other movie reviews and responses to letters and emails sent to him. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers did not give the film any stars, considering that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen has a shot at the title 'Worst Movie of the Decade'." [...] Which he later did name it the [...] "worst film of the decade". Other reviewers, while still critical, were less damning of the film, The A.V.

Among positive reviews, Robbie Collin of News of the World remarked [...] "It's bigger. Badder. Boobier. And many other words beginning with B, including boneheadedly brilliant.", Amy Biancolli of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "a well-oiled, loudly revving summer action vehicle that does all that's required, and then some", Jordan Mintzer from Variety said it [...] "takes the franchise to a vastly superior level of artificial intelligence", and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen may be a massive overdose of popcorn greased with motor oil.
