5|$|Project Wizard was the US Air Force's on-again, off-again <b>ABM</b> <b>system</b> {{that was}} {{ultimately}} replaced by Nike Zeus.|$|E
5|$|For an answer, McElroy {{turned to}} the Re-entry Body Identification Group (RBIG), a {{sub-group}} of the Gaither Committee led by William E. Bradley, Jr. that had been studying the issue of penetrating a Soviet <b>ABM</b> <b>system.</b> The RBIG had delivered an extensive report on the topic on 2 April 1958 which suggested that defeating a Soviet <b>ABM</b> <b>system</b> would not be difficult. Their primary suggestion was to arm US missiles {{with more than one}} warhead, a concept known as Multiple Re-entry Vehicles (MRV). Each warhead would also be modified with radiation hardening, ensuring only a near miss could damage it. This would mean that the Soviets would have to launch at least one interceptor for each US warhead, while the US could launch multiple warheads without building a single new missile. If the Soviets added more interceptors to counter the increased number of US warheads, the US could counter this with a smaller number of new missiles of their own. The cost balance was always in favor of the offense. This basic concept would remain the primary argument against ABMs for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X was an {{anti-ballistic missile}} (<b>ABM)</b> <b>system</b> {{designed}} in the 1960s by the US Army to protect major cities in the United States from attacks by the Soviet Union's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fleet during the Cold War. The X in the name referred to its experimental basis and {{was supposed to be}} replaced by a more appropriate name when the system was put into production. This never came to pass; the Nike-X program was canceled and replaced by a much lighter defense system known as Sentinel.|$|E
25|$|Defence Research and Development Organisation, the {{organisation}} {{involved in the}} development of the <b>ABM</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Deploying <b>ABM</b> <b>systems</b> {{would likely}} invite another {{expensive}} arms race for defensive systems, {{in addition to}} maintaining existing offensive expenditures ...|$|R
25|$|In 1971 work {{starting}} {{on the next}} generation of <b>ABM</b> <b>systems</b> - A135. Building of the Don-2N radar started in 1978 and the replacement system was placed on combat duty in 1995.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, McElroy formed a panel to {{investigate}} ABM issues. The panel examined the Army and Air Force projects, {{and found the}} Zeus program considerably more advanced than Wizard. McElroy told the Air Force to stop work on ABM missiles and use Wizard funding {{for the development of}} long-range radars for early warning and raid identification. These were already under development as the BMEWS network. The Army was handed the job of actually shooting down the warheads, and McElroy gave them free hand to develop an <b>ABM</b> <b>system</b> as they saw fit, free of any range limitations.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} whether {{to proceed with}} Zeus eventually fell to President John F. Kennedy, who became fascinated by the indecision surrounding the <b>ABM</b> <b>system.</b> In 1963, the United States Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, convinced Kennedy to cancel Zeus. McNamara directed its funding towards studies of new ABM concepts being considered by ARPA, selecting the Nike-X concept which addressed Zeus' various problems by using an extremely high-speed missile, Sprint, along with greatly improved radars and computer systems. The Zeus test site built at Kwajalein was briefly used as an anti-satellite weapon.|$|E
5|$|The second issue, ironically, {{came about}} due to {{concerns}} about a Soviet <b>ABM</b> <b>system.</b> The US's existing SM-65 Atlas and SM-68 Titan both used re-entry vehicles with blunt noses that greatly slowed the warheads {{as they entered}} the lower atmosphere and made them relatively easy to attack. The new LGM-30 Minuteman missile used sharp-nosed reentry shapes that traveled at much higher terminal speeds, and included a number of decoy systems that were expected to make interception very difficult for the Soviet ABMs. This would guarantee the US's deterrent. If there was a budget choice to be made, McNamara supported Minuteman, although he tried not to say this.|$|E
50|$|Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM): 1972. Entered into {{between the}} U.S. and USSR {{to limit the}} anti-ballistic missile (<b>ABM)</b> <b>systems</b> used in {{defending}} areas against missile-delivered nuclear weapons; ended by the U.S. in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The {{strategic}} nuclear {{forces of the}} Soviet Union and the United States were changing in character in 1968. The total number of missiles held by the United States had been static since 1967 at 1,054 ICBMs and 656 SLBMs {{but there was an}} increasing number of missiles with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) warheads being deployed. MIRVs carried multiple nuclear warheads, often with dummies, to confuse <b>ABM</b> <b>systems,</b> making MIRV defense by <b>ABM</b> <b>systems</b> increasingly difficult and expensive. Both sides were also permitted to increase their number of SLBM forces, but only after disassembling an equivalent number of older ICBMs or SLBM launchers on older submarines.|$|R
50|$|These {{improvements}} {{would increase}} the Shahab-3B's survivability against <b>ABM</b> <b>systems</b> such as Israel's Arrow 2 missile (though its ability to overcome Arrow is very questionable) {{as well as being}} used for precision attacks against high-value targets such as command, control, and communications centres.|$|R
5|$|Nike Zeus was an {{anti-ballistic missile}} (<b>ABM)</b> <b>system</b> {{developed}} by the US Army during the late 1950s and early 1960s, designed to destroy Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile warheads before they could hit targets in the United States. It was designed by Bell's Nike team, and was initially based on the earlier Nike Hercules anti-aircraft missile. The original Zeus A, given the tri-service identifier XLIM-49, was designed to intercept warheads in the upper atmosphere, mounting a 25 kiloton W31 nuclear warhead. During development, the concept changed to protect a much larger area and intercept the warheads at higher altitudes. This required the missile to be greatly enlarged into the totally new design, Zeus B, mounting a 400 kiloton W50 warhead. In several successful tests, the B model proved itself able to intercept warheads, and even satellites.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Cooper {{helped lead}} the {{opposition}} to the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), putting him at odds with many in his party, including President Nixon. Cooper had long been an opponent of ABMs, which he believed could intensify a worldwide nuclear arms race. On August 6, 1969, a vote to suspend funding of the development of ABMs failed in the Senate by a vote of 50–51; Vice-President Spiro Agnew cast the tie-breaking vote. After this defeat, Cooper and Michigan Senator Philip Hart co-sponsored the Cooper–Hart Amendment that would have allowed funding for research and development of ABMs, but banned deployment of a U.S. <b>ABM</b> <b>system.</b> The measure failed by three votes but increased congressional scrutiny of the Defense Department budget, leading to a reduction in funding and hastening Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviets. Cooper served as an advisor to President Nixon during the events leading up to the talks.|$|E
5|$|This led to {{a series}} of {{increasingly}} sophisticated models to better predict the effectiveness of an <b>ABM</b> <b>system</b> and what the opposition would do to improve their performance against it. A key development was the Prim-Read theory, which provided an entirely mathematical solution to generating the ideal defensive layout. Using a Prim-Read layout for Nike-X, Air Force Brigadier General Glenn Kent began considering Soviet responses. His 1964 report produced a cost-exchange ratio that required $2 of defense for every $1 of offence if one wanted to limit US casualties to 30 percent of the population. The cost increased to 6-to-1 if the US wished to limit casualties to 10 percent. ABMs would only be cheaper than ICBMs if the US was willing to allow over half its population die in the exchange. When he realized he was using outdated exchange rates for the Soviet ruble, the exchange ratio for the 30 percent casualty rate jumped to 20-to-1.|$|E
50|$|<b>ABM</b> <b>systems</b> were {{developed}} initially to counter single warheads launched from large Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The economics seemed simple enough; since rocket costs increase rapidly with size, {{the price of}} the ICBM launching a large warhead should always be greater than the much smaller interceptor missile needed to destroy it. In an arms race the defense would always win.|$|R
50|$|The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty or ABMT) was {{a treaty}} between the United States and the Soviet Union on the {{limitation}} of the anti-ballistic missile (<b>ABM)</b> <b>systems</b> used in defending areas against ballistic missile-delivered nuclear weapons. Under {{the terms of the}} treaty, each party was limited to two ABM complexes, each of which was to be limited to 100 anti-ballistic missiles.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) systems allowed a single ICBM to deliver {{as many as}} ten separate warheads at a time. An <b>ABM</b> defense <b>system</b> could be overwhelmed with {{the sheer number of}} warheads. Upgrading it to counter the additional warheads would be economically unfeasible: The defenders required one rocket per incoming warhead, whereas the attackers could place 10 warheads on a single missile at a reasonable cost. To further protect against <b>ABM</b> <b>systems,</b> the Soviet MIRV missiles were equipped with decoys; R-36M heavy missiles carried as many as 40. These decoys would appear as warheads to an ABM, effectively requiring engagement of five times as many targets and rendering defense even less effective.|$|R
25|$|The next {{generation}} of missiles, introduced with the A-135 <b>ABM</b> <b>System,</b> were the ABM-3 Gazelle (1970s), and ABM-4 Gorgon (1980s).|$|E
25|$|The A-35 {{anti-ballistic missile}} system was a Soviet {{military}} anti-ballistic missile (<b>ABM)</b> <b>system</b> deployed around Moscow to intercept enemy ballistic missiles targeting {{the city or}} its surrounding areas. The A-35 was the only Soviet <b>ABM</b> <b>system</b> allowed under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In development since the 1960s and in operation from 1971 until the 1990s, it featured the nuclear-tipped A350 exoatmospheric interceptor missile. The A-35 {{was supported by the}} two Dunay radars (NATO: Cat House and Dog House) and the Soviet early warning system. It was followed by the A-135 in the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|He always {{believed}} that the best defense strategy for the U.S. was a parity of mutually assured destruction with the Soviet Union. An <b>ABM</b> <b>system</b> would be an ineffective weapon as compared {{to an increase in}} deployed nuclear missile capacity.|$|E
5000|$|In 1963, {{he began}} working on an arms control {{proposal}} for preventing anti-ballistic missile (<b>ABM)</b> <b>systems.</b> [...] In 1964-1966 he was a {{research associate at the}} Harvard Center for International Affairs (CFIA) where he wrote two books: Containing the Arms Race: Some Specific Proposals (MIT Press, 1966) and Strategic Persuasion: Arms Control Through Dialogue (Columbia University Press, 1967). He taught mathematics and arms control at Pomona College from 1966-68.|$|R
50|$|Other {{countries}} were {{also involved in}} early ABM research. A more advanced project was at CARDE in Canada, which researched the main problems of <b>ABM</b> <b>systems.</b> A key problem with any radar system is that the signal {{is in the form}} of a cone, which spreads with distance from the transmitter. For long-distance interceptions like <b>ABM</b> <b>systems,</b> the inherent inaccuracy of the radar makes an interception difficult. CARDE considered using a terminal guidance system to address the accuracy concerns, and developed several advanced infrared detectors for this role. They also studied a number of missile airframe designs, a new and much more powerful solid rocket fuel, and numerous systems for testing it all. After a series of drastic budget reductions during the late 1950s the research ended. One offshoot of the project was Gerald Bull's system for inexpensive high-speed testing, consisting of missile airframes shot from a sabot round, which would later be the basis of Project HARP. Another was the CRV7 and Black Brant rockets, which used the new solid rocket fuel.|$|R
50|$|This {{re-entry}} vehicle is {{unlike that of}} the Shaheen I in that it has four moving delta control fins at the rear and small solid/liquid-propellant side thrust motors, which are used to orient the {{re-entry vehicle}} after the booster stage is depleted or before re-entry to improve accuracy by providing stabilization during the terminal phase. This {{can also be used}} to fly evasive manoeuvres, making it problematic for existing anti-ballistic missile (<b>ABM)</b> <b>systems</b> to successfully intercept the missile. The Shaheen II warhead may change its trajectory several times during re-entry and during the terminal phase, effectively preventing <b>ABM</b> radar <b>systems</b> from pre-calculating intercept points. The re-entry vehicle is also stated to utilise a GPS satellite guidance system to provide updates on its position, further improving its accuracy and reducing the CEP.|$|R
25|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, the Soviet Union {{had reached a}} rough parity with the United States in some {{categories}} of strategic weaponry, {{and at that time}} offered to negotiate limits on strategic nuclear weapons deployments. The Soviet Union wished to constrain U.S. deployment of an antiballistic missile (<b>ABM)</b> <b>system</b> and retain the ability to place multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs).|$|E
25|$|Chevaline used {{a variety}} of {{penetration}} aids and decoys to offer so many indistinguishable targets that an opposing <b>ABM</b> <b>system</b> would be overwhelmed attempting to deal with them all, ensuring that enough warheads would get through an ABM defence to be a reasonable deterrent to a first strike. The project was highly secret, and survived in secrecy through four different governments before being revealed in 1980.|$|E
25|$|After Mao died on September 9, 1976, his rival, Deng Xiaoping, denounced {{during the}} Cultural Revolution as reactionary and {{therefore}} forced {{to retire from}} all his offices, slowly re-emerged as China's new leader in 1978. At first, new development was slowed. Then, several key projects deemed unnecessary were simply cancelled—the Fanji <b>ABM</b> <b>system,</b> the Xianfeng Anti-Missile Super Gun, the ICBM Early Warning Network 7010 Tracking Radar and the land-based high-power anti-missile laser program. Nevertheless, some development did proceed.|$|E

5000|$|Anti-Ballistic Missiles: Although the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, put a halt {{to further}} {{development}} and deployment of most ABM technology, there were exceptions for <b>ABM</b> <b>systems</b> surrounding Moscow and the Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota. The report argued that since the NIE conceded that Soviet ABM research and development was continuing at a pace similar in size and scope {{it was before the}} ABM Treaty in 1972, it was likely that Soviet ABM technology was greater than the NIE concluded it was.|$|R
25|$|A better {{understanding}} of Nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) presented new problems; a warhead set off at high altitudes and long ranges from the defensive missiles could blind the radars, making the incoming warheads only become visible at lower altitudes. This would further {{reduce the amount of}} time the <b>ABM</b> <b>system</b> had to react. Systems using non-obvious approaches might be able to blind the radars in a sneak attack; the Soviets developed the R-36 with a system called Fractional Orbital Bombardment System to allow attacks on US missile fields from low altitudes and/or from the south, while the US relied on manned bombers for the same role.|$|E
25|$|Whether or not {{deploying}} an <b>ABM</b> <b>system</b> was worthwhile was {{a highly}} contentious issue. The US scaled back their plans significantly and their Sentinel Program aimed only to counter the small Chinese ICBM force, a limited Soviet attack or an accidental launch. By the late 1960s, widespread efforts were underway {{to solve the problem}} diplomatically instead of with more missiles. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, signed in 1972, placed limits on the number of ABM systems, later followed by limits on the number of warheads. Both countries continued to deploy a single ABM site; the US briefly deployed a single site under their Safeguard Program, while the Soviets deployed A35/A135 missile defense system around Moscow.|$|E
25|$|ARPA {{released}} its Hardpoint study in 1965. It presented {{a way for}} the Army to offer an effective <b>ABM</b> <b>system</b> at a reasonable cost. At the same time, it would ensure that the Air Force's missiles would survive any sort of small-scale attack envisioned by the military planners. This led to a series of Army-Air Force studies under the name Hardsite. Hardsite initially considered the idea of using the existing Nike-X hardware being proposed around large cities to deliberately offer additional protection to Air Force and other military bases in the area. A second series of studies considered cut-down deployments to protect remote bases, like the missile fields. This later concept quickly captured the majority of follow-up work.|$|E
25|$|At {{first it}} {{appeared}} that the ICBM could be countered by systems similar to the ever-evolving SAMs already in operation. The ICBM's high trajectory meant they became visible to defensive radars not long after being launched, which meant that defensive systems would have time to prepare. Although they moved quickly in flight, early re-entry systems slowed dramatically once they reached the lower atmosphere, which gave time for a fast missile to attack it. By the early 1960s both nations were working on their first anti-ballistic missile (<b>ABM)</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

5|$|By 1967 {{the debate}} over <b>ABM</b> <b>systems</b> had become a major public policy issue, with almost continual debate on the topic in {{newspapers}} and magazines. It {{was in the midst}} of these debates, on 17 June 1967, that the Chinese tested their first H-bomb in Test No. 6. Suddenly the Nth Country concept was no longer simply theoretical. McNamara seized on this event as a way to deflect criticism over the lack of deployment while still keeping costs under control. On 18 September 1967, he announced that Nike-X would now be known as Sentinel, and outlined deployment plans broadly following the I-67 concept.|$|R
