5|$|Right now, we are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. We wondered, should we do a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a time}} in my {{life when}} I wasn't popular and {{accepted}} by kids in school. I was made fun of with braces and kinky hair, and being from a multicultural family, etcetera... <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> hurts when you're that age, but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in activities like a sport, you begin to be accepted for what you do, and your personality and who you are, instead of your clothes and how you look and the name designer brands you have on.|$|E
25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E

500|$|Fringe {{first season}} ended {{with an average}} of 9.96million viewers, and among the season's new series, it was the first rated show for adults 18–49. On May4,2009, a week before the season one finale, Fox renewed Fringe for a second season, giving it a full season pick-up of 22 episodes. The network's {{president}} of entertainment, Kevin Reilly, explained [...] "Fringe proved to be a notable addition to our schedule all season <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> has fans buzzing as it builds to a fantastic season finale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They told me {{you were}} out here," [...] said Lord Warburton; [...] "and as {{there was no one in}} the drawing-room <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>really</b> you that I wish to see, I came out with no more ado." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 4 July 2013, Homme {{mentioned}} AM at the Rock for People {{festival in}} the Czech Republic: [...] "I sang {{on the new}} Arctic Monkeys record. <b>It's</b> a <b>really</b> cool, sexy after-midnight record. It's called AM, so I guess that's <b>really</b> obvious. <b>And</b> <b>it's</b> <b>really</b> good. <b>It's</b> <b>really</b> good. <b>It's</b> not disco such, but it's like a modern, dancefloor sexy record. <b>It's</b> <b>really</b> good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you're not blind, Shadow, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>really</b> yours truly," [...] laughed Dave. And then {{as another}} {{handshake}} followed he continued: [...] "What {{are you going}} down to New York City for? To pick up some new stories?" ...|$|R
500|$|... "I {{tried to}} put {{different}} things in the video {{that made me feel}} under pressure <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> did! It was the hardest video I`ve ever done so I kept thinking, why on earth did I come up with this concept? People don’t realise but I definitely have that Australian tomboy side to me. I love snakes and sharks and jumping out of planes and stuff. Growing up {{it never occurred to me}} that it wasn’t a girly thing to ride a bike, covered in mud holding frogs and collecting lizards!".|$|E
500|$|Geri Halliwell {{described}} the single as a [...] "big love song" [...] and [...] "a Spice Girl classic". Chisholm, in her 2008 appearance on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, commented {{that she thought}} the song was not good at all, and that {{at least she was}} against the release of any new material when the record company was trying to market the Greatest Hits release. She would later say [...] "Headlines grew on me, it really came in to its own when we toured it, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> felt lovely on stage".|$|E
500|$|So, {{this song}} is about faith, but it's also about finding faith in other places, in the beyond, and my {{experience}} with love being something that took me up a really long time to find. So it's really psychedelic <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> takes you on a journey [...] I kinda got this lot of different inspiration from this sort of futuristic disco meets late 70s and jazz and this really really kinda gooey deep groove [...] This song is really about sex, but it's about sex on the most mythological way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{let us go}} home, {{and never}} mind Aunt March today. We can run down there any time, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>really</b> a pity to trail through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross." ...|$|R

5000|$|Jamie Parmenter from Renowned for Sound {{gave the}} album 4 out of 5 saying: [...] "Anchor is a brave and bold EP. The band has really focused their {{energies}} onto creating {{something with a}} different atmosphere to previous work, <b>and</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>really</b> paid off." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Because You Loved Me" [...] {{performed}} by Tina as Rachel {{received the most}} consistently positive reviews, though both Chaney, who gave the song an [...] and Strecker, who graded it a [...] "B+", stated their belief that the real Rachel {{would have done it}} better, and Saskin was more blunt: [...] "We love you, Tina, but you just can't belt like Rachel". Futterman was the most pleased, and wrote: [...] "The richness of her voice removes some of the Lite FM softness embedded in the tune, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is great to see Tina get a song that suits her vocal abilities".|$|E
500|$|During {{their stay}} in Cleveland during the tour, Gabriel told the band {{he would leave}} at its conclusion. He wrote a {{statement}} regarding his departure to the English press that was published in August 1975 titled [...] "Out, Angels Out", explaining he had become disillusioned with the music industry and wanted to spend extended time with his family. Banks later stated, [...] "Pete was also getting {{too big for the}} group. He was being portrayed as if he was 'the man' <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> wasn't like that. It was a very difficult thing to accommodate. So it was actually a bit of a relief." ...|$|E
500|$|Perry's {{decision}} to write [...] "E.T." [...] came after its beat was accidentally played during a recording session {{she had with}} Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Ammo. It was originally intended for American hip hop group Three 6 Mafia. However, after hearing it, Perry chose {{to work with the}} track. She told MTV News: [...] "I heard it and I always knew I wanted to write this futuristic, alienistic song, and they pulled it up and I was like, 'Wait, I can wrap my head around this. I know this seems like a long shot, but I think I have the perfect material to put on top of this sound.' And I did, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> worked out perfectly." ...|$|E
5000|$|But if {{they are}} colleagues she will claim common ground with them using the {{positive}} politeness strategy or frame an indirect request for them to stop talking, saying: [...] "I'm working on a lecture <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>really</b> hard to concentrate with all this noise.".|$|R
5000|$|The {{band has}} {{finished}} recording their next EP, called [...] "Be Human", which was released March 23, 2010. Currently, {{they say that}} touring is a possibility. Justin has been quoted saying [...] "A Rocket to the Moon is, it feels right, y’know. <b>It’s</b> <b>really</b> cool kinda doing both <b>and</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>really</b> not hard to juggle since Brighten may not be touring... a whole lot." ...|$|R
5000|$|In August 2011, Katter {{said the}} {{prospect}} of same-sex marriage [...] "deserves to be laughed at and ridiculed". The following week, his half-brother Carl, who is openly gay, spoke to the Ten Network, saying of Katter's comments, [...] "It's hurtful, it's dangerous, <b>it's</b> damaging, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>really</b> inappropriate".|$|R
500|$|The {{visual effects}} and slow-motion {{sequences}} induced by Slo-Mo received broad praise. Berkshire {{said that they}} are notable and eye-catching with [...] "impressively utilised 3d." [...] Hewitt said the visuals were [...] "genuinely surreal splashes of heightened colour that...don't outstay their welcome. The film's use of 3D is often excellent (including the credits) <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> comes {{to life in the}} Slo-mo scenes". Dalton said the film [...] "constantly impresses on a visual level, with a gritty style more akin to cult hits like District 9 or 28 Days Later than to standard Hollywood comic-book blockbusters." [...] Dalton said, [...] " [...] first venture into 3D is a blaze of saturated colours, gorgeous high-resolution close-ups and dazzling slow-motion sequences." [...] Dredd won The Art of 3D award at the 2013 Empire Awards, and was nominated for Best British Film and Best Science-fiction/Fantasy.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{criticized the}} {{character}} development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted {{as she looked at}} a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have been}} an animal [...] just as easily, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems so stupid that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Pearl Jam {{went for}} a two-week session at Henson. It {{was the first time}} the band spent a {{considerable}} amount of time recording outside of Seattle since 1996's No Code. McCready said, [...] " [...] we got together with Ed <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> started getting more cohesive, we took that momentum down to Los Angeles with Brendan... It was a great idea to get us out of Seattle. You've gotta get out [...] your comfort zone, and we've talked about doing that for the past ten years and kind of haven't, so we trusted Brendan's judgment." [...] In April 2009, the band {{went for a}} two-week session to finish the album with O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album took a total of thirty days in the studio to get finished, and O'Brien stated [...] "we had 90% of the record cut in the first nine days".|$|E
5000|$|The {{article also}} states:She said Hitchbot’s {{body had been}} found by some good samaritans who had located the roving robot through a {{regularly}} updated map on its website."They sent us images <b>and</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>really</b> beyond repair. There’s not a single wire inside {{and all the things}} are broken." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{appropriate}} psychogeography {{is easily}} conjured by a YouTube video that purloins material from [...] "the haunted archive". Archival representations of countryside ...are much more evocative than real countryside. There's a haunted forest of the mind, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>really</b> the haunted archive itself, {{disguised as a}} forest." [...] —Momus on Bibliotek.|$|R
5000|$|In a radio {{interview}} on Vancouver Island's CKWV-FM ("The Wave"), Gessle shared information about The Rox Box. [...] "It's four CDs, a DVD, {{a little bit}} of this, {{a little bit of}} that, outtakes and demos <b>and</b> stuff. <b>It's</b> like a coffee table thing, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>really,</b> really big an 80-page booklet and stuff." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Exit" [...] {{was created}} {{on the final}} day of {{recording}} for The Joshua Tree. It developed from a lengthy jam that the band recorded in a single take. Producer Daniel Lanois said, [...] "it was a long jam, and there was just this one section of it that had some kind of magic to it, and we just decided to turn it into something." [...] Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>really,</b> for me, it brought me there, it really did succeed as an experiment." [...] Lanois said: [...] "There's something that happens when U2 bash it out in the band room... and sometimes things get out of control, sonically, in a good way. Out of control in the sense that you don't know what it is anymore, it just takes on a life of its own, and it makes people do things." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{director}} Joe Wright {{was hired}} in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his directional feature film debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who {{were looking for a}} fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, [...] "I didn't know if I was really all that interested; I thought I was a little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it". He next read the novel, which he called [...] "an amazing piece of character observation <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people... things like that." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of composing [...] "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for {{she did not know}} how her friend would respond. [...] "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." [...] However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: [...] "She said, 'Does it bother you that your name is in a song that's so personal?' <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl can kind of learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it." [...] With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded [...] "Fifteen" [...] with producer Nathan Chapman, who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to {{the fact that she is}} most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences. She went to say [...] "Fifteen" [...] usually gets her every time.|$|E
5000|$|On McKeehan's YouTube account, he {{posted a}} video {{talking about the}} meaning of the song; [...] "'City on our Knees' is really about a moment. A moment that we all come together. Where our {{differences}} fall by the wayside. <b>And</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>really</b> a reminder that that moment could be right now, tonight." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment with a little laugh. [...] "I expect I'm talking nonsense, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>really</b> not so very long since that kind of thing used to appeal to me. After all, there must be a certain amount of {{satisfaction}} to be got out of purposeless flirtation, cards, dining, and dancing." ...|$|R
