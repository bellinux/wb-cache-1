5|$|Even {{after all}} Ostrom's work, several small blocks of lime-encased {{material}} remained unprepared in storage at the American Museum.

Several long, thin bones identified on the blocks as ossified tendons (structures that helped stiffen the tail of Deinonychus) turned out to actually represent gastralia (abdominal ribs). More significantly, {{a large number of}} previously unnoticed fossilized eggshells were discovered in the rock matrix that had surrounded the original Deinonychus specimen.|$|E
