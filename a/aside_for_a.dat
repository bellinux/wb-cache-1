5|$|Part of {{the show}} was set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> series of funny, colorful, puppet {{characters}} living on the titular street. These included Grover, Bert and Ernie, Cookie Monster, Elmo, Oscar the Grouch, and Big Bird. Henson performed the characters of Ernie, game-show host Guy Smiley, and Kermit, who appeared as a roving television news reporter. It was around this time that a frill was added around Kermit's neck to make him more frog-like. The collar was functional as well: it covered the joint where the Muppet's neck and body met.|$|E
5|$|An {{emergency}} subscription {{fund was}} established {{by some of the}} city's wealthiest citizens. Betances and Basora had the city's unsanitary slave barracks torched and a temporary camp set up for its dwellers. A large field at a corner of the city was set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> supplementary cemetery, and Betances set and managed a temporary hospital next to it (which was later housed in a permanent structure and became the Hospital San Antonio, the Mayagüez municipal hospital, which still serves the city). However, the epidemic struck the city soon after; Betances' stepmother and one of his brothers-in-law would die from it. By October 1856 Betances would {{have to take care of}} the entire operation on his own temporarily.|$|E
5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. He put the game <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E

5|$|Washington Park {{has been}} public {{property}} since the Dongan Charter was granted to Albany incorporating it as a city. The charter specified that all land not privately owned {{at the time}} became property of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty {{of the city of}} Albany, including the land that would become the site of Washington Park. A portion of the land was set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> structure built to house gunpowder in 1802, and in 1806 the areas between Willett and Knox streets, and between State Street and Madison Avenue, became the Middle Public Square. In 1800, the land west of Knox Street to Robin Street and south from State Street to Hudson Avenue was taken for a cemetery, which was apportioned into sections for each of Albany's churches. There were separate sections for African-Americans and for strangers. West of the cemetery was the alms-house farm and the penitentiary grounds. In 1809 the Middle Public Square was renamed Washington Square, and later the Washington Parade Ground. In 1868 the remains and headstones in the cemetery were removed and reinterred, most to Albany Rural Cemetery, and some to the cemeteries of other churches.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, land {{originally}} set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> metropolitan {{library in}} 2006 was reallocated {{for the use}} of National Experimental University of the Armed Forces, and a new site for the proposed library has yet to be granted.|$|E
25|$|Land was {{originally}} set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cemetery {{on the west}} side of the A325. However, there is no evidence that it was used, with burials occurring in the civilian cemeteries in either Headley or Greatham. The site is now the Woolmer trading estate.|$|E

50|$|The Su-47 is {{of similar}} {{dimensions}} to previous large Sukhoi fighters, {{such as the}} Su-35. To reduce development costs, the Su-47 borrowed the forward fuselage, vertical tails, and landing gear of the Su-27 family.

25|$|The site {{selection}} committee did not issue its recommendation until January 31, 2006—a full 13 months late. It recommended the site {{west of the}} National Museum of American History. The area {{was part of the}} Washington Monument grounds, but had been set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> museum or other building in the L'Enfant Plan of 1791 and the McMillan Plan of 1902. The United States Department of State originally planned to build its headquarters there in the early 20th century, and the National World War II Memorial Advisory Board had considered the parcel in 1995. On March 15, 2005, the Smithsonian named Dr. Lonnie G. Bunch III to be the Director of the National African American Museum of History and Culture.|$|E

25|$|Finally, in {{the summer}} of 1981 Joe Boyd signed the Thompsons to his small Hannibal label, and in November of that year the Thompsons went back into the studio and {{recorded}} a new album. Boyd's proposal, which the Thompsons accepted, was that the album be recorded {{in a matter of days}} so that money could be put <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> tour of the USA. The resulting Shoot Out the Lights included fresh recordings of six songs that had been recorded during the Rafferty-sponsored sessions and two newer songs. Linda Thompson was several months pregnant when the album was recorded and so there was no prospect of an immediate release or supporting tour. By the time the album was released Richard and Linda Thompson’s marriage was over.|$|E
25|$|It is {{customary}} to eat rice to {{the last}} grain. Being a picky eater is frowned upon, {{and it is not}} customary to ask for special requests or substitutions at restaurants. It is considered ungrateful to make these requests especially in circumstances where one is being hosted, as in a business dinner environment. After eating, try to move all dishes back to the same position they were {{at the start of the}} meal. This includes replacing the lids on dishes and putting one's chopsticks on the chopstick holder or back into their paper slip. Good manners dictate that one respects the selections of the host. However, this can be set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> diner with allergies such as a peanut allergy, or a religious prohibition against certain foods like pork.|$|E
25|$|In {{the post}} {{apartheid}} South Africa, {{construction of new}} schools in poorer townships often failed to include the construction of both indoor and outdoor sporting facilities. There might be some space set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> netball court or a soccer field, though {{that may be the}} only substitute available. The problems of getting facilities for women's sports like netball is still difficult because of Zulu gender constructions, where men are the dominant cultural force. Some schools in coloured areas do not offer physical education classes. To address this need, they have school teams. Most schools only offer netball for girls, soccer for boys and athletics for both genders. For coloured children, boys rank sport as the most important for things to do in their free time. In contrast, coloured girls rank playing sport as fourth in their list of priorities.|$|E

25|$|He {{was born}} in Narni and his exact birthdate is not known. He clearly {{decided to become a}} priest from an early age, and became {{associated}} with the Oratory of Filippo Neri around 1583. In 1595 he was employed as an organist at S Marcello, and likely became maestro di cappella at the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano, after Francesco Soriano, between 1600 or 1601 and 1603. In 1609 he held a similar post at Verona Cathedral, his first appointment outside of Rome; he stayed there until 1610, when he went back to Rome; and he stayed there, <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few travels, until 1624, in a variety of roles (becoming a priest at last in 1616). In 1624 he took the position of choirmaster to King Sigismund III of Poland in Warsaw. Poland had several active musical centers in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, including Kraków and Warsaw, and often employed Italians and Germans; Anerio was one of the more distinguished foreigners to take up residence there. Unfortunately he never saw Rome again; he died while traveling back home, while in Graz, Austria, and was buried there on 12 June 1630.|$|E

500|$|In 1937, {{part of the}} Forêt du Day {{site was}} set aside as Day Forest National Park; this {{designation}} is no longer valid. There have been studies of the area and the related environmental and economic issues involved; [...] {{very few of the}} suggestions made by these surveys have been implemented, partially due to the unrest in Djibouti since the early 1990s. In May 2008, [...] of forest near the village of Day were set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> tree nursery in an attempt to restore some of the francolin's damaged habitat. Surveys are under way to determine population sizes and current range, including plans to survey the largely unknown site in the Mabla Mountains and potentially suitable areas in between the two known sites.

50|$|First, only Congress has {{the power}} to {{diminish}} reservation boundaries. In Solem, it is stated that “once a block of land is set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Indian reservation and no matter what happens to the title of the individual plots within the area, the entire block retains its reservation status until Congress explicitly states otherwise”. Therefore, the allotment policy does not designate a change in reservation boundaries.|$|R
500|$|At {{least two}} people played major {{roles in the}} {{creation}} of Brown County State Park. [...] Richard Lieber, an Indianapolis businessman who became the first director of the Indiana Department of Conservation, visited Brown County in 1910. [...] Lieber was so impressed with the beauty of the land that he built a cabin near Nashville and suggested that a portion of the county should be set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> state park. [...] Lieber eventually became known as [...] "the father of Indiana's state parks", and the state opened 10 state parks (including Brown County) during his tenure as director of the Indiana Department of Conservation. [...] Lieber {{was not the only one}} from Indianapolis that was impressed with Brown County. [...] In 1923, the Order of Elks expressed interest in establishing a state park in Brown County.|$|E
500|$|Brittan {{converted}} {{the land in}} Avonside to farming, with [...] set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> homestead, garden and orchard.

Adjacent to his farm was Holy Trinity Avonside, {{which at the time}} was a cob church. On 24 February 1857, it became the first Anglican church in Canterbury consecrated by Bishop Harper, [...] and Guise Brittan, as churchwarden, read the lesson at the service. The entire Brittan family had a close connection to the church, with Joseph Brittan helping to raise money for its construction, and Mary Brittan singing in the church choir. They faithfully attended church on Sundays, and when subscriptions were taken for the construction of ChristChurch Cathedral, Brittan pledged a generous ₤100.|$|E
500|$|Released on {{theaters in}} 1975, Jaws became the highest-grossing film ever at the time, a record it held {{for two years}} until the release of Star Wars.

The film's success lead to three sequels, which Benchley had no involvement despite drawing on his characters. According to Benchley, once his payment of the adaptation-related royalties got late, he called his agent and she replied that the studio was arranging a deal for sequels. Benchley disliked the idea, saying, [...] "I don't care about sequels; who'll ever {{want to make a}} sequel to a movie about a fish?"
