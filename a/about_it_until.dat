5|$|Reynolds did {{not believe}} there was time to make changes because, {{if there were any}} delays in publication, the {{newspaper}} would not be published {{before the end of the}} school year. After consulting with his supervisors, he opted to publish a four-page newspaper instead of a six-page one, omitting the pages containing the two stories in question. Cutting two pages removed a total of seven articles from the paper. Reynolds did not tell the students about the decision, and they did not find out <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>until</b> the paper was delivered to the school.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the opening of Peter Grimes, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give {{recitals}} to concentration camp survivors. What they saw, at Belsen most of all, so shocked Britten that he refused to talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>until</b> {{towards the end of}} his life, when he told Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since. Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and the Second String Quartet, contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as Les Illuminations. Britten recovered his joie de vivre for The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945), written for an educational film, Instruments of the Orchestra, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent. It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work.|$|E

25|$|On {{his return}} from Mexico, Reynolds was {{assigned}} to Fort Preble, Maine, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Fort Lafayette, New York. He was next sent west to Fort Orford, Oregon, in 1855, and participated in the Rogue River Wars of 1856 and the Utah War with the Mormons in 1857-58. He was the Commandant of Cadets at West Point from September 1860 to June 1861, while also serving as an instructor of artillery, cavalry, and infantry tactics. During {{his return from}} the West, Reynolds became engaged to Katherine May Hewitt.

Cryovolcanoes near the south pole shoot geyser-like jets of water vapor, molecular hydrogen, [...] other volatiles, and solid material, including sodium chloride crystals and ice particles, into space, totaling about [...] per second. Over 100 geysers have been identified. Some of the water vapor falls back as [...] "snow"; the rest escapes, and supplies most of the material making up Saturn's E ring.

500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>until</b> we got there".|$|E
500|$|Newton {{later became}} {{involved}} in a dispute with Leibniz over priority {{in the development of}} calculus (the Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy). Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed calculus independently, although with very different notations. Occasionally {{it has been suggested that}} Newton published almost nothing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>until</b> 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704, while Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. (Leibniz's notation and [...] "differential Method", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians.) But such a suggestion fails to account for the content of calculus in Book 1 of Newton's Principia itself (published 1687) and in its forerunner manuscripts, such as De motu corporum in gyrum ("On the motion of bodies in orbit") of 1684; this content has been pointed out by critics of both Newton's time and modern times. The Principia is not written in the language of calculus either as we know it or as Newton's (later) 'dot' notation would write it. His work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishing small quantities: in the Principia itself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of 'the method of first and last ratios' and explained why he put his expositions in this form, remarking also that 'hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles'.|$|E
500|$|Despite having {{turned into}} a highly {{proficient}} band on stage, things were starting to heat up internally, with band members getting more vocal about the direction they wanted the music to go, {{as well as being}} dissatisfied with their treatment financially. Founding members Lord and Blackmore were tired of being identified as a [...] "clone of Vanilla Fudge" [...] and were starting to yearn for a sharper, rawer and overall heavier sound, similar to that introduced in Led Zeppelin's debut album, which had become a great success {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, after its release in January 1969. They felt that Rod Evans, with his tender, smooth voice, would not be able to cope with louder, more aggressive material. Evans had also expressed reservations about his permanence in the band and voiced his wish to permanently move to the US. Tensions were also high with bassist Nick Simper, whose playing style was considered, in Paice's words, [...] "stuck in the late '50s and early '60s" [...] by the other band members and unfit for the new musical direction they wanted to pursue. On the other hand, Simper sided with Blackmore against Lord's excessive influence in the band's songwriting and was critical of classical music getting in the way of harder rock. As a result of those tensions, communication between band members was at a minimum during the tour. It was in May that Lord and Blackmore agreed on changing the line-up, shifting out Evans. They talked their ideas over with drummer Paice, gaining his agreement to the line-up change. Coletta was surprised when he heard the trio's news, advising them to keep quiet <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>until</b> the tour was completed and they had returned home.|$|E

500|$|Before each segment, {{there are}} {{trailers}} advertising fake films, {{as well as}} vintage theater snipes and an ad for a fictional restaurant called Acuña Boys. According to Rodriguez, it was Tarantino's idea to film fake trailers for Grindhouse. [...] "I didn't even know <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>until</b> I {{read it in the}} trades. It said something like 'Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a double feature and Tarantino says there's gonna be fake trailers.' And I thought, 'There are?'" [...] Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film's fake trailers themselves. According to Rodriguez, [...] "We had so many ideas for trailers. I made Machete. I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer and sent it to Quentin, and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real. He started showing it around to Eli Roth and to Edgar Wright, and they said, 'Can we do a trailer? We have an idea for a trailer!' We were like, 'Hey, let them shoot it. If we don't get around to shooting ours, we'll put theirs in the movie. If theirs come out really great, we'll put it in the movie to have some variety.' Then Rob Zombie came up to me in October at the Scream Awards and said, 'I have a trailer: Werewolf Women of the SS.' I said, 'Say no more. Go shoot it. You got me.'" [...] Each trailer was shot in two days. While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen, Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half-hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down. Some Canadian screening releases included the South by Southwest-winning trailer Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E
