5000|$|Each B-channel carries data, voice, {{and other}} services. The D-channel carries control and {{signaling}} information. Larger connections are possible using PRI pairing. A dual T1-PRI could have 24 + 23 = 47 B-channels and 1 D-channel (often called [...] "47B + D"), but more commonly has 46 B-channels and 2 D-channels thus providing a backup signaling channel. The concept applies to E1s {{as well and}} both can include more than 2 PRIs. When configuring multiple T1's as ISDN-PRI's, it's possible to use NFAS (non-facility <b>associated</b> <b>signalling)</b> to enable one or two D-channels to support additional B-channels on separate T1 circuits.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{efficiently}} transport slowly varying channel <b>associated</b> <b>signalling</b> bits, second order structures known as multiframes or superframes are defined. For example, for E1 trunks the CAS signaling bits are updated once per multiframe of 16 frames (every 2 milliseconds) while for T1 ESF trunks the superframe is 24 frames (3 milliseconds). Other types of second order structures {{are also in}} common use. In GSM cellular networks, the Abis channel that connects the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and Base Station Controller (BSC) is an E1 link with several framing alternatives, {{all of which have}} a basic superframe duration of 20 milliseconds.|$|E

5000|$|In 1990, McCaw Cellular {{introduced}} SS7 signaling {{across their}} network. Prior to this, each cell tower {{in the network}} connected to local signaling, billing and sets of land-lines. Since only the towers in the area local to the customer's home had access to dialing and routing information, when they traveled to another area calls could not reach them. With the introduction of SS7 signaling, the dialing and routing information could now be switched across the entire network (known technically as Non-Facility <b>Associated</b> <b>Signalling),</b> tying it together into a single national network. They called the new system [...] "Cellular One", and introduced the concept of roaming charges. That year, McCaw earned $54 million, making him America's highest-paid chief executive.|$|E
5000|$|Upon the {{completion}} of the Cuckoo Line in 1880, the line between Eridge and Groombridge was doubled. At the same time, a crossover was constructed on the western side of Groombridge station, together with <b>associated</b> <b>signalling</b> equipment, and later the Groombridge West signal box. A second signal box, [...] "Groombridge Junction", was provided on the opening of the Cuckoo Line, and a third, [...] "Groombridge West" [...] (the first signal box's name was changed to [...] "Groombridge East"), was added in 1888 after the opening of the Oxted Line. Within 10 years of nationalisation, the three signal boxes had been closed by British Rail and replaced by a single box on 23 November 1958 when the Groombridge section was resignalled.|$|E
50|$|Because SS7 {{signaling}} {{does not}} require seizure of a channel for a conversation prior to the exchange of control information, non-facility <b>associated</b> <b>signalling</b> (NFAS) became possible. NFAS is signaling that is not directly associated with the path that a conversation will traverse and may concern other information located at a centralized database such as service subscription, feature activation, and service logic. This makes possible a set of network-based services that do not rely upon the call being routed to a particular subscription switch at which service logic would be executed, but permits service logic to be distributed throughout the telephone network and executed more expediently at originating switches far in advance of call routing. It also permits the subscriber increased mobility due to the decoupling of service logic from the subscription switch. Another ISUP characteristic SS7 with NFAS enables is the exchange of signaling information {{during the middle of}} a call.|$|E

5000|$|A further {{change to}} traffic {{patterns}} came about in 1968, when ferry operator Sealink announced {{its intention to}} convert the two ships operating out of the port on the Belfast route to [...] "roll-on/roll-off" [...] car ferries rather than conventional passenger ships. The change required major alterations to the ferries and to the berths at both termini. At Heysham, the station building was demolished and its replacement built on an adjacent site. The station reopened for traffic on 4 May 1970. As part of the scheme, a new signal box and <b>associated</b> <b>signalling</b> was provided. The viability of the Belfast route was compromised by the Northern Irish [...] "Troubles" [...] {{in the years that}} followed. Mounting losses led to its withdrawal on 5 April 1975 and led the connecting rail services becoming redundant and to the closure of the station to passengers, a few months later.|$|E

5000|$|The other ISDN access {{available}} is the Primary Rate Interface (PRI), which is carried over an E1 (2048 kbit/s) {{in most parts}} of the world. An E1 is 30 'B' channels of 64 kbit/s, one 'D' channel of 64 kbit/s and a timing and alarm channel of 64 kbit/s. This is often referred to as 30B+2D. In North America PRI service is delivered on one or more T1 carriers (often referred to as 23B+D) of 1544 kbit/s (24 channels). A PRI has 23 'B' channels and 1 'D' channel for signalling (Japan uses a circuit called a J1, which is similar to a T1). Inter-changeably but incorrectly, a PRI is referred to as T1 because it uses the T1 carrier format. A true T1 (commonly called [...] "Analog T1" [...] to avoid confusion) uses 24 channels of 64 kbit/s of in-band signaling. Each channel uses 56 kb for data and voice and 8 kb for signaling and messaging. PRI uses out of band signaling which provides the 23 B channels with clear 64 kb for voice and data and one 64 kb 'D' channel for signaling and messaging. In North America, Non-Facility <b>Associated</b> <b>Signalling</b> allows two or more PRIs to be controlled by a single D channel, and is sometimes called [...] "23B+D + n*24B". D-channel backup allows for a second D channel in case the primary fails. NFAS is commonly used on a T3.|$|E
