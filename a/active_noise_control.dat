The problems are mainly due to the multimodal error surface and instability of adaptive IIR filters used in such applications. Considering these, in this paper a new adaptive recursive RLS-based fast-array IIR filter for <b>active</b> <b>noise</b> and vibration <b>control</b> applications is proposed. At first an RLS-based adaptive IIR filter with computational complexity of order O(n(2)) is derived, and a sufficient condition for its stability is proposed by applying passivity theorem on the equivalent feedback representation of this adaptive algorithm. In the second step, to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm {{to the order of}} O(n) as well as to improve its numerical stability, a fast array implementation of this adaptive IIR filter is derived. This is accomplished by extending the existing results of fast-array implementation of adaptive FIR filters to adaptive IIR filters.

The first one uses the discovery that sound pressure could be attenuated when it passes through a plasma sheet.The second one, and being more widely used, is to actively suppress the flow-field that is responsible to flow-induced noise (also known as aeroacoustics), using plasma actuators. It has been demonstrated that both tonal noise and broadband noise (difference can refer to tonal versus broadband) can be actively attenuated by a carefully designed plasma actuator.|$|E

The-oretical analysis of convergence of the algorithm {{is based on the}} autocorrelation and crosscorrelation matrices of the overall parallel structure. Analysis results show that extra harmonics are induced in the residual error because of using a single error signal to update all adaptive filters with different sinusoidal reference signals. An optimized filter-adapting method which uses bandpass filters to split the error signal into multiple ban-dlimited error signals according to frequencies of reference signals is proposed to improve the performance of narrowband ANVC systems in steady state. Computer simulations are conducted to verify analysis results and performance of the optimized narrowband ANVC system.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} {{the reduction of}} the sound transmission through a double panel test section by means of an <b>active</b> <b>noise</b> and vibration <b>control</b> system. This stiffened double panel {{can be seen as a}} section of an aircraft fuselage, whereas the active control system has to reduce the noise level inside the passengers' cabin generated by the incident sound waves from the propellers. Experiments prove that control loudspeakers and error microphones in the cavity between both panels yield higher reductions in the radiated sound power than control shakers and error accelerometers on the radiating panel. This conclusion remains valid when the receiving and the radiating panel are mechanically connected by means of four vibration isolators, and when the cavity is filled with thermal insulation blankets. It also appears that, in case of an <b>active</b> cavity <b>noise</b> <b>control</b> system, there exists an almost linear relation between {{the reduction of the}} acoustic potential energy in the cavity and the reduction of the radiated sound power. The optimised control system performs much better than a control system with sensors and actuators in arbitrarily chosen positions.

The fixed-order robust controller is thus designed to achieve maximum noise attenua-tion with acceptable stability margins.
