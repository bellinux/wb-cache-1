5|$|In a final {{gesture of}} love and comprehension, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> of despising his father's stories and his father as story-teller, Will {{finishes}} the story his father has begun, pulling together the themes, images and characters of his father's storied life to blend reality and fantasy in act of communion and care. By unselfishly releasing the anger he has held about his father's stories, Will gains the understanding that all we are our stories and that his father's stories gave him a reality and substance and a dimension that was as real, genuine, and deep as the day-to-day experiences that Will sought out. Will comes to understand, then, that his father—and the rest of us—are our stories and that the deeper reality of our lives may, in fact, not be our truest self.|$|E

25|$|Sackville-West was {{a writer}} and author of novels. The Edwardians (1930) and All Passion Spent (1931) are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long {{suppressed}} sense of freedom and whimsy <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> of convention. This novel was dramatised by the BBC in 1986 starring Dame Wendy Hiller. All Passion Spent appears to reflect Woolf's influence, as Lady Slane, who has only existed while married to her late husband, a former prime minister, finally begins to live after his death, and becomes friends with the servants on her estate, discovering that {{the lives of people}} she had ignored until then are also interesting. At the end of the novel, Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage to pursue her career as a musician. Sackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break {{for a variety of reasons}} as she needed money to pay for the Sissinghurst Castle which had just been purchased; Nicolson having left the Foreign Office no longer had a diplomat's salary to draw upon; she had to pay tuition for her two sons to attend Eton, one of the most expensive public schools in England; and it because she felt she had become a better writer thanks to the mentorship of Woolf who had taught her how to write better.|$|E

For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifetime's</b> service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty.

Dunmaya was a thoroughly honest girl, and, in spite of her reverence for an Englishman, had a reasonable estimate of her husband's weaknesses. She managed him tenderly, and became, in less than a year, a very passable imitation of an English lady in dress and carriage.

2500|$|According to scholar Andrew Crowther, {{the play}} explores two {{ideas that are}} an {{important}} part of many of Gilbert's stage works, including the famous Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] "One is that stage romance and fantasy should be brought down to earth with reminders of prosaic reality. The other is that real life should take on some of the romance and fantasy of the stage." [...] Crowther notes that in the play, the [...] "supernatural" [...] fairy and demon speak in a more natural manner than the mortals, who Gilbert calls [...] "unnaturals". The play shows the tension between Gilbert's love of the harlequinade and his disapproval of the morality that it portrays. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> of fascination with the subject, the play resolves Gilbert's deep interest in the subject. According to Crowther, in many ways, the play was the capstone of Gilbert's career. He would write no more full-length plays and only one further opera (Fallen Fairies).|$|E
