5|$|The {{first real}} {{progress}} toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani, who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from {{the development of a}} new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such <b>a</b> <b>stain,</b> brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.|$|E

25|$|It is not {{necessary}} for the woman to witness {{the flow of blood}} itself; it is sufficient for her to notice <b>a</b> <b>stain</b> that has indications of having originated in her womb; bloodstains alone are inadequate without such evidence, for example, if she finds <b>a</b> <b>stain</b> just after cutting her finger, she does not become a niddah, as the blood is not obviously uterine. If she notices a bloodstain of uncertain origin, for example on her underclothing, there are a series of complicated criteria used by rabbinical law to determine whether she is niddah or not; the woman herself is not expected to know these criteria, and must seek the assistance of a rabbi.|$|E

25|$|Gordon {{believed}} {{this approach was}} militarily counterproductive, as it encouraged the Taipings {{to fight to the}} death, which Gordon felt to be very unwise as the Taiping leader Hong Xiuquan had become murderously paranoid, conducting bloody purges of his followers. Many Taipings were only willing to surrender if the Imperial government would spare the lives of themselves and their families. Even more importantly, Gordon had given his word of honour that all of the Taipings who surrendered would be well treated, and regarded the massacre as <b>a</b> <b>stain</b> on his honour.|$|E
25|$|The {{craft of}} {{bookbinding}} probably originated in India, where religious sutras were copied on to palm leaves (cut into two, lengthwise) {{with a metal}} stylus. The leaf was then dried and rubbed with ink, which would form <b>a</b> <b>stain</b> in the wound. The finished leaves were given numbers, and two long twines were threaded through each end through wooden boards, making a palm-leaf book. When the book was closed, the excess twine would be wrapped around the boards to protect the manuscript leaves. Buddhist monks took the idea through Afghanistan to China {{in the first century}} BC.|$|E
25|$|The mercilessness {{which the}} Athenian invaders showed to the Melians was {{exceptional}} {{even for the}} time and shocked many Greeks, even in Athens. These may have included the Athenian playwright Euripides, whose play The Trojan Women {{is widely regarded as}} a commentary on the razing of Melos. The historian Xenophon wrote that in 405 BC, with the Spartan army closing in on Athens, the citizens of Athens worried that the Spartans would treat them with the same cruelty that the Athenian army had shown the Melians.This event takes place after the people of Athens learned of their navy's final defeat at the Battle of Aegospotami. The Athenian rhetorician Isocrates was a proud patriot but accepted that the razing of Melos was <b>a</b> <b>stain</b> on Athens' history.|$|E

25|$|Sin is not {{viewed by}} the Orthodox as <b>a</b> <b>stain</b> on the soul {{that needs to be}} wiped out, or a legal {{transgression}} that must be set right by a punitive sentence, but rather as a mistake made by the individual with the opportunity for spiritual growth and development. An act of Penance (epitemia), if the spiritual guide requires it, is never formulaic, but rather is directed toward the individual and their particular problem, as a means of establishing {{a deeper understanding of the}} mistake made, and how to effect its cure. Because full participatory membership is granted to infants, it is not unusual for even small children to confess; though the scope of their culpability is far less than an older child, still their opportunity for spiritual growth remains the same.|$|E
25|$|OsO4 is {{a widely}} used {{staining}} agent used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide contrast to the image. As a lipid stain, it is also useful in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) {{as an alternative to}} sputter coating. It embeds a heavy metal directly into cell membranes, creating a high electron scattering rate without the need for coating the membrane with a layer of metal, which can obscure details of the cell membrane. In the staining of the plasma membrane, osmium(VIII) oxide binds phospholipid head regions, thus creating contrast with the neighbouring protoplasm (cytoplasm). Additionally, osmium(VIII) oxide is also used for fixing biological samples in conjunction with HgCl2. Its rapid killing abilities are used to quickly kill live specimens such as protozoa. OsO4 stabilizes many proteins by transforming them into gels without destroying structural features. Tissue proteins that are stabilized by OsO4 are not coagulated by alcohols during dehydration. Osmium(VIII) oxide is also used as <b>a</b> <b>stain</b> for lipids in optical microscopy. OsO4 also stains the human cornea (see safety considerations).|$|E
25|$|Collins' uncle, State Police Sergeant David Leik, {{had been}} on {{vacation}} with his family {{at the time of}} Beineman's disappearance, and had only returned home on July 29‚Äîthree days after the discovery of her body. Throughout their vacation, Collins had been temporarily residing in the Leik family's Ypsilanti home, having been granted sole access to the house in order that he could feed their German shepherd. Upon their return from their vacation, Leik's wife, Sandra, had noted numerous paint marks covering the floor of the family basement, and that several items including a bottle of ammonia, some washing powder, and a canister of black spray paint were missing from the household. The same day, Leik was advised by investigators of his nephew's suspect status, and the level of circumstantial evidence unfolding against him. Leik acknowledged that the evidence thus far gathered against his nephew was compelling, although in this first interview, he did not advise officers of the items missing from his household, or the paint marks {{he and his wife had}} found upon the floor of the family basement; however, the following morning, Leik scraped away some of the black paint which had been sprayed in his basement to reveal <b>a</b> <b>stain</b> which looked ominously like human blood and immediately returned to the police station to report his findings.|$|E

At the bus locker at which Veronica instructed the judge to leave the money, she instead finds a note that tells Veronica and Max to get in a limo. In the limo, they find Wendy‚Äôs pimp, who is actually a woman. She tells them that she actually did fall in love with Max, but that she needed money for other reasons.|$|E
