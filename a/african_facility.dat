40|$|MBA thesis - WBSPerformance {{appraisal}} is {{one element}} of the performance management process which involves different measurements throughout the organization. But it is the element that is most important if organisations are {{to take full advantage}} of their most important asset – employees. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the employee performance appraisal process in a South <b>African</b> <b>facility</b> management company and to suggest recommendations to management based on the literature review. The research took the form of a case study with a sample of 20 respondents who participated in individual qualitative structured interviews. Multiple sources of data were used in the data gathering process and triangulation was achieved by analysing the literature, policies and procedure of Company X as well as data gathered from the individual interviews. The findings of the research revealed that there were numerous gaps in the performance appraisal process, with respondents expressing deep concern on the validity and merits of the current appraisal practices. The main findings showed that respondents thought there was a lack of objectivity in contracts and poor communication. Furthermore the low emphasis on employee training and appraisers’ lack of skills were also raised as issues and concerns on the effectiveness of the appraisal process. The conclusions of the research have informed the main recommendations, to improve the current process to one that is much more effective and which incorporates more interactive communication and training on a continuous basis for both employees and appraiser...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute {{renal failure}} (ARF) is a {{clinical}} syndrome characterised by a rapid deterioration of kidney function over hours to days which may recover/return to normal values following appropriate therapy. Various scoring systems currently exist {{to predict the}} severity and outcome in patients with ARF. Recently the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Group has established the RIFLE (Risk of injury, Injury to the kidney, Failure of kidney function, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease) classification which has become widely used globally. There is however, limited data on its use in Africa. In order to provide data {{on the use of}} RIFLE criteria from an <b>African</b> <b>facility,</b> we conducted a retrospective chart review to assess the outcome of ARF in patients admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH). The data reviewed covered the period between January 1 st to December 31 st 2008. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review conducted in the adult multi-disciplinary intensive care unit at CMJAH between January 1 st to December 31 st 2008. Medical records of patients admitted during this period were reviewed and patients with acute renal failure were identified. Demographic data, relevant clinical information such as reason for ICU admission, number of organ(s) involved, presence of co-morbidity, RIFLE criteria on admission and on discharge, modality and duration of treatment of ARF, need for mechanical ventilation and or inotropic support were recorded. For the purpose of this study, serum creatinine based on RIFLE classification was used to define ARF. Statistical analysis was performed using the data collected and STATA version 11. The Primary outcome, which was survival or death, was correlated with the maximum RIFLE classification during patients’ ICU stay. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee medical (HRECM) of the University of Witwatersrand with Clearance certificate number M 090906 RESULTS: One hundred and ninety three (193) patients with acute renal failure were included in the study. The mean APACHE II score was 19 ± 6. 4 SD, with the maximum score documented being 38. Patient ages ranged from 21 – 92 years with a mean of 50. 5 years ± 18. 3 SD.

The research attempts to establish the existence and nature of generational differences. Two quantitative measuring instruments, namely the Rewards Preferences Questionnaire (RPQ) and the Motivation Measure, were distributed electronically to all staff of a South <b>African</b> <b>facilities</b> management firm. The findings indicated that there are generational sub-group preferences for certain types of reward, and different perceptions about what types of reward attract, motivate and retain employees.

An umbrella organization called the Pan-African Sanctuary Alliance (PASA) was formed in 2000 and recently the IUCN Reintroduction Specialist Group developed a set of specific policy guidelines for primates (2002). Data presented in this report are based upon questionnaire responses by managers from 17 <b>African</b> <b>facilities</b> that have become members of PASA (membership in PASA is defined by attendance at an annual PASA workshop). These PASA facilities house over 500 great apes. (There may be other facilities not represented here simply because their managers did not attend a PASA workshop.) The majority of the apes arrived at the sanctuaries when they were less than 4 years old and half were confiscated. Over 40 % were found awaiting sale, and 30 % had been previously kept as pets.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The aim of {{this study}} is to conduct a {{thorough}} theoretical study on the relevant aspects involved in knowledge management and organisational learning, and to assess the maturity level of knowledge management within the South African steel industry. Various aspects of knowledge, knowledge management and organisational learning with specific relation to sustainable competitive advantage are discussed in the literature study. During the literature research several factors which either promote or hinder the effective management of knowledge were identified and a list of lessons learned by other successful knowledge focused companies, are discussed. The critical success factors for a successful knowledge management program are also discussed. Knowledge can create a sustainable competitive advantage within an organisation, if successfully applied to make value adding decisions and to enable learning, and if it is applied to make decisions which are superior to that of its rivals across the supply chain. An integrated approach needs to be followed when KM is pursued and the knowledge must be applied to make value added decisions and facilitate learning across all processes in the value chain. The focus must be to retain an organisation’s tacit knowledge as this is a key success factor to ensure a sustainable competitive advantage. The study includes research on whether knowledge management is effectively used as a sustainable competitive advantage in the South African steel industry. The maturity level of the application of knowledge and learning principles implemented within the South African steel industry is assessed and compared to the maturity level of ArcelorMittal, Monlevade, located in Brazil. A survey was designed and distributed to determine the knowledge management and organisational learning maturity levels at two steel facilities of ArcelorMittal in South Africa and one facility in Brazil. The key problem areas as identified through the empirical research are discussed and it is concluded that South <b>African</b> <b>facilities</b> do not effectively use knowledge management as a sustainable competitive advantage. The maturity level of knowledge management in ArcelorMittal, South Africa is low compared to the maturity at Monlevade and rival companies such as Tata and Posco steel. A significant effort needs to be made in order to allow the effective creation, acquisition, sharing and leveraging of knowledge within the South <b>African</b> steel <b>facilities.</b> The key factors which constrain effective knowledge management is related to ineffective Human Resource policies, organisation structure, lack of knowledge exchange forums, collaboration and communication, coaching, and a lack of incentives to share tacit knowledge. It is also evident that knowledge is not seen as a sustainable competitive advantage by many respondents and that they perceive they do not have the time or capacity to transfer knowledge. Ten practical design principles were constructed and a knowledge management framework was developed to guide South African steel companies during the design and execution of a knowledge management programme which will ensure that knowledge management will result into a sustainable competitive advantage.

40|$|The {{increase}} in the number of correctional facilities as institutes for punishing convicted offenders was a purposeful and gradual process which developed over many centuries, from basic beginnings in the early sixteenth century to contemporary approaches in the 21 st Century. Over the centuries a range of models or approaches to the treatment of criminals were attempted. New buildings emerged with different designs in order to keep offenders away from society. New approaches were tried, but the situation in penal institutions worsened in terms of the conditions due to overcrowding. Merton in Cilliers states that, “we shape our buildings and afterwards our buildings shape us 2. ”In keeping with Merton’s words that buildings shape us to fit in with the specific design, South <b>African</b> correctional <b>facilities</b> were designed and built according to international standards to accommodate criminals, and in order to ‘satisfy’ the objectives of punishment, namely, retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence and protection of society. In this article the aim is to discuss the progression of the treatment approaches (models) over the centuries and during different periods of incarceration will be analysed with specific reference to the Westville Correctional Facility which is located in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A historical perusal into the development of treatment ideals for inmates “doing time for crime” will be discussed, both from an international perspective to the South African context in the 21 st century due to the fact that South Africa has drawn from the American and European systems of incarceration. The method in which these models/ approaches to treatment of inmates have been implemented by South <b>African</b> Correctional <b>facilities</b> is explored.

This study examined current PMTCT practices in 27 public health facilities in Nigeria. Methods. A cross-sectional survey of 231 practicing nurses was conducted. Current PMTCT care practices were evaluated and compared to WHO and national PMTCT policy guidelines. Linear mixed models evaluated the association between PMTCT care practices and training in PMTCT. Results. Most nurses (80 %) applied practices involving newborn prophylaxis; yet significant gaps in maternal intrapartum treatment and infant feeding practices were identified. PMTCT training explained 25 % {{of the variance in}} the application of PMTCT care practices. Conclusion. Key PMTCT practices are not being adequately translated from research into practice.
