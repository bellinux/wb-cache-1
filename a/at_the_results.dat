25|$|Even {{before the}} first {{selective}} COX-2 inhibitor was marketed, specialists began to suspect {{that there might be}} a cardiovascular risk associated with this class of medicines. In the VIGOR study (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research), rofecoxib (Vioxx) was compared to naproxen. After a short time, it became evident that there was a fivefold higher risk of myocardial infarction in the rofecoxib group compared to the group that received naproxen. The authors suggested that the difference was due to the cardioprotective effects of naproxen. The APPROVe (Adenomatous Poly Prevention on Vioxx) study was a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial aimed to assess the effect of three-year treatment with rofecoxib on recurrence of neoplastic polyps in individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas. In 2000 and 2001, 2587 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas were recruited and followed. The trial was stopped early (2 months before expected completion) on recommendations of its data safety and monitoring board because of concerns about cardiovascular toxicity. When looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the study, it showed a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular risk when taking rofecoxib compared to placebo beginning after 18 months of treatment. Then on 30 September Merck gave out a news release announcing their voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx.|$|E
500|$|Keating! is {{a musical}} which portrays the {{political}} career of former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. [...] Keating was Prime Minister between 1991 and 1996; the musical follows {{him from his}} ascent to the leadership through to his eventual electoral defeat by John Howard. It was written by Casey Bennetto, who was inspired to write the show by his disappointment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the 2004 federal election, which saw Howard's Coalition government returned for a fourth term. [...] The musical takes a humorous, satirical tone and presents a positive image of Keating while frequently criticising the Howard government. Bennetto describes the show as [...] "ridiculously pro-Paul Keating".|$|E

Giron's recall was more surprising, as the district is 47% Democratic to 23% Republican, and news reports stated that Giron was stunned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>results.</b> Other sources stated that Giron remained defiant.

500|$|Going {{into the}} 1992 Summer Paralympics, the International Coordinating Committee and the Technical Committee of the IPC {{push for a}} move towards a {{functional}} classification system.

[...] A study by the organising committee and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in the lead-up to the meeting looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of recent international competitions.

2500|$|The {{day after}} {{principal}} photography was completed, Ashby had his editor send {{what he had}} cut together so far. The director was shocked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> and fired the editor. He was afraid {{that he would have}} to edit the film himself. Ayres recommended bringing in Robert C. Jones, one of the fastest editors in the business, who had been nominated for an Academy Award for Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Jones put the film back into rushes and six weeks later had a first cut ready that ran four hours. Ashby was very impressed with his abilities and trusted him completely. Jones cut the film with Ashby at the filmmaker's home. The process took an unusually long time, as the director agonized over all the footage he had shot. Ashby would ignore phone calls from Columbia, and eventually executives higher and higher up the corporate ladder tried to contact him. Ashby was in London, England meeting with Peter Sellers about doing Being There when he received a phone call from Jones, who told him that Columbia was fed up with the time it was taking for the film to be assembled. The head of the studio's editing department called Jones to say that a representative was coming to take the film. Jones refused to give up the film, and Ashby called the studio and managed to calm down the officials. Towne occasionally visited Ashby's house to check in and did not like the pacing of the film. According to Towne, Ashby [...] "left his dramatizing to the editing room, and the effect was a thinning out of the script". During the editing process, Columbia hated the jump cuts Ashby employed. The studio was also concerned about the number of expletives. It needed a commercial hit as they were in major financial trouble. By August 1973, the final cut of The Last Detail was completed and submitted to the MPAA, which gave it an R rating.|$|E

Miller was considered a fan favorite, often placing in the voting's top ranks and becoming the season's sole contestant to not land in the bottom 2 or 3 until her elimination in the Top 3. The elimination was described by journalists as [...] "shocking" [...] and [...] "surprising," [...] to which they attributed competitor Kree Harrison's victory to support from Vote for the Worst, voting from Middle America, and pity votes prompted by her homecoming video. Conversely, Kevin Rutherford of Billboard said the singer's elimination was caused by her inability match the accolades of her [...] "You Set Me Free" [...] performance. Others ascribed her choice to perform Elton John's [...] "Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word" [...] without playing the song on the piano.
