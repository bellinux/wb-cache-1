50|$|Rather than a UN-style {{system of}} type approvals, the US and Canadian auto safety {{regulations}} {{operate on the}} principle of self-certification, wherein the manufacturer or importer of a vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment certifies—i.e., asserts and promises—that the vehicle or equipment complies with all applicable federal or Canada Motor Vehicle Safety, bumper and antitheft standards. No prior verification is required by a governmental agency or <b>authorised</b> <b>testing</b> entity before the vehicle or equipment can be imported, sold, or used. If reason develops to believe the certification wasfalse or improper — i.e., that the vehicle or equipment does not in fact comply — then authorities may conduct tests and, if a noncompliance is found, order a recall and/or other corrective and/or punitive measures. Vehicle and equipment makers are permitted to appeal such penalties, but this is a difficult direction. Non-compliances found that are arguably without effect to highway safety may be petitioned to skip recall (remedy and notification) requirements for vehicles already produced.|$|R

5000|$|Evidence: just as {{its early}} {{performance}} history {{is far from}} clear, so too is {{the date of the}} play's composition. 1598 can be fixed as a terminus post quem, as Shakespeare definitely used George Chapman's Seven Books of the Illiad of Homer as a source, which was entered into the Stationers' Register in April 1598. Some scholars have attempted to link the play to the War of the Theatres, particularly the reference to the [...] "Prologue armed" [...] (l.23), which may be an allusion to the prologue in Jonson's The Poetaster (1601), in which an obviously infuriated Jonson lashes out at his detractors. However, the prologue in Troilus was not included in either Q or Q, making it difficult to directly connect it to the squabbles between the playwrights. Stylistic evidence is also inconclusive. A rare word <b>test</b> <b>places</b> it closest to Hamlet. Ants Oras' pause <b>test</b> <b>places</b> it after Henry IV and before Othello, but is unable to determine exactly where the play lies between the two. A colloquialism-in-verse <b>test</b> <b>places</b> it after Hamlet and before Twelfth Night. Metrical analysis places it after Hamlet and Twelfth Night but before Measure for Measure and Othello. This all suggests a date of composition of somewhere between 1600 and 1602, but the exact order in which Hamlet, Twelfth Night and Troilus and Cressida were written seems impossible to determine.|$|R

5000|$|Evidence: The Winter's Tale {{can be a}} {{difficult}} play to date precisely {{due to a lack}} of contemporary references and topical allusions. Aside from the Forman reference (and some subsequent dated productions at court), and a possible allusion to a Ben Jonson piece, the play must be dated using stylistic analysis. The possible Jonson reference occurs during the sheep-shearing feast, when twelve countrymen perform a satyrs' dance that three are said to have already [...] "danced before the King" [...] (4.4.333). This may be an allusion to Ben Jonson's masque Oberon, the Faery Prince, which was performed at court on 1 January 1611. This would place the most likely date of composition sometime in mid-1610. However, not all scholars believe the reference need be taken that literally, and even those that do accept the Jonson allusion, such as Stanley Wells (editor of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works), agree that the passage may have been added at a later date, and is therefore of little use in dating the play. Traditionally, the play is paired with Cymbeline in terms of style, theme and tone, with The Winter's Tale seen as the superior play, and therefore the later of the two. However, stylistic analysis would suggest Winter's Tale preceded Cymbeline; a rare word <b>test</b> <b>places</b> it closest to Measure for Measure, Ants Oras pause <b>test</b> <b>places</b> it closest to Pericles, a colloquialism-in-verse <b>test</b> <b>places</b> it after Coriolanus but before Cymbeline, a metrical <b>test</b> <b>places</b> it closest to Antony and Cleopatra. In his 2010 edition of the play for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare, John Pitcher argues for a date of late 1610-early 1611, believing Shakespeare wrote Winter's Tale, Cymbeline and The Tempest in this period after the reopening of the theatres in early 1611, although he acknowledges this creates a gap in the chronology which would suggest Shakespeare wrote nothing in 1609.|$|R
