5|$|A {{major problem}} in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet has no solid surface on which to land, {{as there is a}} smooth {{transition}} between the planet's <b>atmosphere</b> and its fluid interior. Any probes descending into the <b>atmosphere</b> are eventually crushed by the immense pressures within Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There {{have been a number of}} proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper <b>atmosphere.</b> The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the <b>atmosphere,</b> but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of the upper <b>atmosphere.</b> In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper <b>atmosphere</b> for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a praxeological conception of shopping <b>atmospheres.</b> It {{looks at the}} significance of shopping <b>atmospheres</b> {{for the development of}} preferences for shopping locations. What is in the foreground here is the idea that the suitability of the <b>atmospheres</b> for successful completion of shopping activities is consciously perceived, and influences the development of long-term preferences for the choice of shopping locations. In addition to the conceptual framework, this paper also presents the results of an exploratory investigation: here, three forms of <b>atmospheres</b> have been identified (<b>atmospheres</b> for strolling, for rummaging, and <b>atmospheres</b> with a cultural resonance), which are taken into account in the choice of shopping locations...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{applications}} of chemical thermodynamics and chemical kinetics to planetary <b>atmospheres</b> research during {{the past four decades}} is presented with an emphasis on chemical equilibrium models and thermochemical kinetics. Several current problems in planetary <b>atmospheres</b> research such as the origin of the <b>atmospheres</b> of the terrestrial planets, atmosphere-surface interactions on Venus and Mars, deep mixing in the <b>atmospheres</b> of the gas giant planets, and the origin of the <b>atmospheres</b> of outer planet satellites all require laboratory data on the kinetics of thermochemical reactions for their solution...|$|R
40|$|Comparison between {{theoretical}} colors {{calculated from}} model <b>atmospheres</b> and ultraviolet celescope observations of supergiant star <b>atmospheres</b> {{show that most}} stars are deficient in ultraviolet flux relative to theoretical models.

5|$|Barman drew on {{data and}} {{measurements}} taken by Heather Knutson, {{a student at}} Harvard University, from the Hubble Space Telescope, and applied new theoretical models to demonstrate the likelihood of water absorption in the <b>atmosphere</b> of the planet. The planet orbits its parent star every {{three and a half}} days, and each time it passes in front of its parent star, the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the <b>atmosphere</b> absorbs light passing from the star directly through the <b>atmosphere</b> in the direction of Earth.|$|E

5|$|Edward Epstein {{recognized}} in 1969 that the <b>atmosphere</b> {{could not be}} completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed using an ensemble of stochastic Monte Carlo simulations to produce means and variances {{for the state of}} the <b>atmosphere.</b> Although this early example of an ensemble showed skill, in 1974 Cecil Leith showed that they produced adequate forecasts only when the ensemble probability distribution was a representative sample of the probability distribution in the <b>atmosphere.</b>|$|E
40|$|Present {{knowledge}} {{concerning the}} chemistry of planetary <b>atmospheres</b> is reviewed along with the theories which attempt to explain observational data. The known gross atmospheric compositions of the terrestrial and giant planets are listed, differences between the <b>atmospheres</b> of earth and Venus are discussed, and the <b>atmospheres</b> of the giant planets are described. The origin and evolution of the <b>atmospheres</b> of earth, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are outlined, and chemical processes in the <b>atmospheres</b> are examined, particularly cloud formation. The question of organic synthesis and evolution in the reducing <b>atmospheres</b> of the giant planets is considered. It is noted that laboratory work on the individual chemical processes and reactions involved {{in the evolution of}} organic compounds in planetary <b>atmospheres,</b> comets, and interstellar space points to the inevitability of organic-compound synthesis in all these situations and to the pervasiveness of organic chemistry throughout the universe...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{observations}} and theory {{suggest that some}} white dwarfs may have chemically stratified <b>atmospheres</b> - thin layers of hydrogen lying above helium-rich envelopes. Models of such <b>atmospheres</b> show that a discontinuous temperature inversion can occur at {{the boundary between the}} layers. Model spectra for layered <b>atmospheres</b> at 30, 000 K and 50, 000 K tend to have smaller decrements at 912 A, 504 A, and 228 A than uniform <b>atmospheres</b> would have. On the basis of their continuous extreme ultraviolet spectra, it is possible to distinguish observationally between uniform and layered <b>atmospheres</b> for hot white dwarfs...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} basic concepts, {{the present state}} of {{theoretical}} models, and the future prospects for theory and observations of pulsating stellar <b>atmospheres.</b> Our emphasis is on radially pulsating cool stars, which dynamic <b>atmospheres</b> provide a general example for the differences with standard static model <b>atmospheres...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1761, Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov {{observed}} an arc {{of light}} surrounding {{the part of}} Venus off the Sun's disc {{at the beginning of}} the egress phase of the transit and concluded that Venus has an <b>atmosphere.</b> In 1940, Rupert Wildt calculated that the amount of CO2 in the Venusian <b>atmosphere</b> would raise surface temperature above the boiling point for water. This was confirmed when Mariner 2 made radiometer measurements of the temperature in 1962. In 1967, Venera 4 confirmed that the <b>atmosphere</b> consisted primarily of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, American {{astronomer}} William W. Campbell {{found that}} the spectrum of Mars was identical to the spectrum of the Moon, throwing doubt on the burgeoning theory that the <b>atmosphere</b> of Mars {{is similar to that}} of the Earth. Previous detections of water in the <b>atmosphere</b> of Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's <b>atmosphere.</b> Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water in the <b>atmosphere,</b> he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925.|$|E
5|$|In February 2016, it was {{announced}} that NASA Hubble Space Telescope had detected hydrogen and helium (and suggestions of hydrogen cyanide), but no water vapor, in the <b>atmosphere</b> of 55Cancrie, the first time the <b>atmosphere</b> of a super-earth exoplanet was analyzed successfully.|$|E

5|$|In late December 2014, NASA's MAVEN {{spacecraft}} detected {{evidence of}} widespread auroras in Mars's northern hemisphere and descended to approximately 20–30 degrees North latitude of Mars's equator. The particles causing the aurora penetrated into the Martian <b>atmosphere,</b> creating auroras below 100km above the surface, Earth's auroras range from 100km to 500km above the surface. Magnetic {{fields in the}} solar wind drape over Mars, into the <b>atmosphere,</b> and the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines into the <b>atmosphere,</b> causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas.|$|E
5|$|In the Earth's <b>atmosphere,</b> the {{concentration}} of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million. The concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the Earth's <b>atmosphere</b> escapes into space by several processes. In the Earth's heterosphere, {{a part of the}} upper <b>atmosphere,</b> helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements.|$|E

40|$|Thermogravimetric-Mass Spectroscopy (TG-MS) {{study on}} lignin {{decomposition}} under different (oxygen-containing) <b>atmospheres</b> {{was carried out}} to investigate thermal performance of lignin during pyrolysis, oxidative gasification, oxy/fuel combustion and CO(2) gasification. Only one significant mass loss stage was observed for lignin decomposition under helium (He), while another stage, representing char oxidation, appeared under oxygen and CO(2) conditions. No significant variation of the activation energy was presented for the first pyrolysis stage under different <b>atmospheres</b> (from 40. 4 to 53. 2 kJ/mol). A much higher temperature was required for char oxidation under CO(2) than those under O(2) <b>atmospheres,</b> giving the activation energy of 541. 9 kJ/mol as compared to around 160 kJ/mol for O(2) -containing <b>atmospheres.</b> The evolution profiles of CO and CO(2) under different <b>atmospheres</b> were in good accordance with the DTG curves regardless of <b>atmospheres...</b>|$|R

5|$|In the past, {{quantities}} of hydrocarbons were greater. According to one source, {{in the period}} from 1751 to 2008 about 347 gigatonnes of carbon were released as carbon dioxide to the <b>atmosphere</b> from burning of fossil fuels. Another source puts the amount added to the <b>atmosphere</b> for the period since 1750 at 879 Gt, and the total going to the <b>atmosphere,</b> sea, and land (such as peat bogs) at almost 2,000 Gt.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{summarizes}} {{atmospheric chemistry}} and composition {{for the seven}} planets {{in our solar system}} that have significant <b>atmospheres.</b> The terrestrial planets (Venus, Earth, and Mars) have secondary <b>atmospheres</b> that originated by the outgassing of volatile-rich material during and/or after planetary accretion. The gas giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) have primary <b>atmospheres</b> that were captured from the solar nebula. Some of the important chemical cycles that presently operate in planetary <b>atmospheres</b> are illustrated. Thermochemistry controls the atmospheric composition on Venus and in the deep <b>atmospheres</b> of the gas giant planets. In contrast, photochemistry dominates atmospheric chemistry on Mars and in the upper <b>atmospheres</b> of the gas giants. Biochemistry is the key process on Earth, with photochemistry also playing an important role. Some speculations about atmospheric chemistry and composition on extrasolar Earth-like planets are also presented...|$|R
5|$|Observations of Titan {{prior to}} the space age were limited. In 1907 Spanish {{astronomer}} Josep Comas i Solà observed limb darkening of Titan, the first evidence that the body has an <b>atmosphere.</b> In 1944 Gerard P.

5|$|Observations {{with the}} Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope, first {{described}} in 1995, revealed that Europa has a thin <b>atmosphere</b> composed mostly of molecular oxygen (O2). The surface pressure of Europa's <b>atmosphere</b> is 0.1μPa, or 10−12 {{times that of}} the Earth. In 1997, the Galileo spacecraft confirmed the presence of a tenuous ionosphere (an upper-atmospheric layer of charged particles) around Europa created by solar radiation and energetic particles from Jupiter's magnetosphere, providing evidence of an <b>atmosphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2007, Travis Barman of the Lowell Observatory {{announced}} {{evidence that}} the <b>atmosphere</b> of HD 209458 b contained water vapor. Using a combination of previously published Hubble Space Telescope measurements and new theoretical models, Barman found strong evidence for water absorption in the planet's <b>atmosphere.</b> His method modeled light passing directly through the <b>atmosphere</b> from the planet's star as the planet passed in front of it. However, this hypothesis is still being investigated for confirmation.|$|E
25|$|According to {{extended}} habitable zone theory, planetary mass {{objects with}} <b>atmospheres</b> capable of inducing sufficient radiative forcing could possess liquid water farther {{out from the}} Sun. Such objects could include those whose <b>atmospheres</b> contain a high component of greenhouse gas and terrestrial planets much more massive than Earth (super-Earth class planets), that have retained <b>atmospheres</b> with surface pressures of up to 100 kbar. There are no examples of such objects in the Solar System to study; not enough {{is known about the}} nature of <b>atmospheres</b> of these kinds of extrasolar objects, and the net temperature effect of such <b>atmospheres</b> including induced albedo, anti-greenhouse or other possible heat sources cannot be determined by their position in the habitable zone.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the stability of}} super-Earth <b>atmospheres</b> around M stars using a seven-parameter, analytical framework. We construct stability diagrams in the parameter space of exoplanetary radius versus semimajor axis and elucidate the regions in which the <b>atmospheres</b> are stable against the condensation of their major constituents, out of the gas phase, on their permanent nightside hemispheres. We find that super-Earth <b>atmospheres</b> that are nitrogen-dominated (Earth-like) occupy a smaller region of allowed parameter space, compared to hydrogen-dominated <b>atmospheres,</b> because of the dual effects of diminished advection and enhanced radiative cooling. Furthermore, some super-Earths which reside within the habitable zones of M stars may not possess stable <b>atmospheres,</b> depending on the mean molecular weight and infrared photospheric pressure of their <b>atmospheres.</b> We apply our stability diagrams to GJ 436 b and GJ 1214 b, and demonstrate that atmospheric compositions with high mean molecular weights are disfavored if these exoplanets possess solid surfaces and shallow <b>atmospheres.</b> Finally, we construct stability diagrams tailored to the Kepler data set, for G and K stars, and predict {{that about half of}} the exoplanet candidates are expected to harbor stable <b>atmospheres</b> if Earth-like conditions are assumed. We include 55 Cancri e and CoRoT- 7 b in our stability diagram for G star...|$|R
40|$|Rayleigh {{scattering}} is {{a result}} of an interaction of photons with bound electrons. Rayleigh scattering is mostly neglected in calculations of hot star model <b>atmospheres</b> because most of the hydrogen atoms are ionized and the heavier elements have a lower abundance than hydrogen. In <b>atmospheres</b> of some chemically peculiar stars, helium overabundant regions containing singly ionized helium are present and Rayleigh scattering can be a significant opacity source. We evaluate the contribution of Rayleigh scattering by neutral hydrogen and singly ionized helium in the <b>atmospheres</b> of hot stars with solar composition and in the <b>atmospheres</b> of helium overabundant stars. We computed several series of model <b>atmospheres</b> using the TLUSTY code and emergent fluxes using the SYNSPEC code. These models describe <b>atmospheres</b> of main sequence B-type stars with different helium abundance. We used an existing grid of models for <b>atmospheres</b> with solar chemical composition and we calculated an additional grid for helium-rich stars with $N$(He) /$N$(H) = 10. Rayleigh scattering by neutral hydrogen can be neglected in <b>atmospheres</b> of hot stars, while Rayleigh scattering by singly ionized helium can be a non-negligible opacity source in some hot stars, especially in helium-rich stars.
