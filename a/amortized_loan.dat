50|$|An interest-only loan is a loan in which, {{for a set}} term, the {{borrower}} pays only the interest on the principal balance, with the principal balance unchanged. At {{the end of the}} interest-only term {{the borrower}} may enter an interest-only mortgage, pay the principal, or (with some lenders) convert the loan to a principal and interest payment (or <b>amortized)</b> <b>loan</b> at his/her option.|$|E
50|$|The {{mortgage}} constant {{is commonly}} denoted as Rm. The Rm {{is higher than}} the interest rate for an <b>amortizing</b> <b>loan</b> because the Rm includes consideration of the principal as well as the interest. The Rm could be lower than the interest for a negatively <b>amortizing</b> <b>loan.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each {{payment to}} the lender {{will consist of}} a portion of {{interest}} and a portion of principal. Mortgage <b>loans</b> are typically <b>amortizing</b> <b>loans.</b> The calculations for an <b>amortizing</b> <b>loan</b> are those of an annuity using the time value of money formulas, and can be done using an amortization calculator.|$|R

50|$|Due to the Algo Centre situation, and the {{tremendous}} {{social and economic}} impact it had on Elliot Lake as a small city with few other major retail outlets, the project was funded almost entirely by the provincial and federal governments. The Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada each provided $1 million in funding, with the remaining $1.5 million being provided via an <b>amortized</b> <b>loan</b> from Infrastructure Ontario.|$|E
5000|$|Neg-Ams {{also have}} {{what is called}} a recast period, and the recast {{principal}} balance cap is in the U.S. based on Federal and State legislation. The recast period is usually 60 months (5 years). The recast principal balance cap (also known as the [...] "neg am limit") is usually up to a 25% increase of the <b>amortized</b> <b>loan</b> balance over the original loan amount. States and lenders can offer products with lesser recast periods and principal balance caps; but cannot issue loans that exceed their state and federal legislated requirements under penalty of law.|$|E
5000|$|Lenders' {{standards}} for determining risk categories may {{also consider the}} size of the proposed loan, and also take into account the way the loan and the repayment plan is structured, if it is a conventional repayment loan, a mortgage loan, an endowment mortgage, an interest-only loan, a standard repayment loan, an <b>amortized</b> <b>loan,</b> a credit card limit or some other arrangement. The originator is also taken into consideration. Because of this, it was possible for a loan to a borrower with [...] "prime" [...] characteristics (e.g. high credit score, low debt) to be classified as subprime.|$|E
50|$|An <b>amortizing</b> <b>loan</b> {{should be}} contrasted {{with a bullet}} loan, where {{a large portion of}} the loan will be paid at the final {{maturity}} date instead of being paid down gradually over the loan's life.|$|R
50|$|In {{banking and}} finance, an <b>amortizing</b> <b>loan</b> is a loan where the {{principal}} of the loan is paid down {{over the life of the}} <b>loan</b> (that is, <b>amortized)</b> according to an amortization schedule, typically through equal payments.|$|R
50|$|In finance, the {{weighted}}-average life (WAL) of an <b>amortizing</b> <b>loan</b> or <b>amortizing</b> bond, {{also called}} average life, is the weighted {{average of the}} times of the principal repayments: it's the average time until a dollar of principal is repaid.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a few}} crucial points {{worth noting}} when {{mortgaging}} a home with an <b>amortized</b> <b>loan.</b> First, there is substantial disparate allocation of the monthly payments toward the interest, especially during the first 18 years of a 30-year mortgage. In the example below, payment 1 allocates about 80-90% of the total payment towards interest and only $67.09 (or 10-20%) toward the principal balance. The exact percentage allocated towards payment of the principal depends on the interest rate. Not until payment 257 or over two thirds through the term does the payment allocation towards principal and interest even out and subsequently tip the majority toward the former.|$|E
5000|$|A land {{contract}} — often described by other terminology listed below — is a contract between the buyer and seller of real property {{in which the}} seller provides the buyer financing in the purchase, and the buyer repays the resulting loan in installments. Under a {{land contract}}, the seller retains the legal title to the property, while permitting the buyer to take possession of it for most purposes other than legal ownership. The sale price is typically paid in periodic installments, often with a balloon payment at the end to make the timelength of payments shorter than in the corresponding fully <b>amortized</b> <b>loan</b> (i.e., a loan without a final balloon payment). When the full purchase price has been paid including any interest, the seller is obligated to convey (to the buyer) legal title to the property. An initial down payment from the buyer to the seller is usually also required.|$|E
40|$|Investments in {{productive}} assets by broad-based black {{economic empowerment}} (BEE) enterprises in South Africa (SA) during the 1990 s have been constrained, in part, {{by a lack}} of access to capital. Even if capital can be sourced, BEE businesses often face a liquidity problem, as conventional, equally <b>amortized</b> <b>loan</b> repayment plans do {{not take into account the}} size and timing of investment returns, or there are lags in the adjustment of management to such new investments. This paper describes five alternative loan products to the conventional equally amortized loan: the single payment non-amortized loan; the decreasing payment loan; the partial payment loan; the graduated payment loan; and the deferred payment loan. Recent SA experience with the graduated payment loan and the deferred payment loan suggests that there is scope to alleviate the liquidity problem if a wholesaler of funds can offer such terms to private banks and venture capital investors who then on-lend to finance BEE asset investments that are otherwise considered relatively high credit risks. This would shift the liquidity problem away from the client to the wholesaler of the funds, but requires access to capital at favourable interest rates. Such capital could be sourced from empowerment funds earmarked by the private sector, donors and government. Financial Economics,...|$|E

Federal banking {{regulators}} {{should use}} their regulatory authority to require banks issuing negatively <b>amortizing</b> <b>loans</b> that allow borrowers to defer payments {{of interest and}} principal, to maintain more conservative loss, liquidity, and capital reserves.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} “Interest” {{has been viewed}} as a {{forbidden}} instrument in Islamic investments. This study has focused on establishing an interest-free platform, and introducing a new method of direct-to-consumer financing using the amortization and the time value of money. Based on this method, the borrower makes a pre-determined amount of upfront payment {{in order to receive}} zero percent interest rate financing and only makes monthly principal payments during the term of the loan.   Using the same interest rate and the same term period as in amortization, the total amount of interest occurring during the <b>amortized</b> <b>loan</b> is replaced as future value and the discounted value is calculated as the amount of upfront payment. The relationship between the amount of upfront payment in each range of 30, 20, 15, 10 and 5 year terms and the interest rates 1 %- 30 % shows a parabolic pattern in each term, in which the amount of upfront payment will increase to a pivotal level in each term and will decrease as the interest rate increases.   The vertex point of the parabola is named “Mesbah Point” in order to distinguish this conceptual point. Therefore, Mesbah Point is the optimum amount of upfront payment collected, irrespective of the interest rate, to receive an interest free, zero percent loan.   In other words, Mesbah Point is as an interest rate-proof value in which the borrower, regardless of interest rates in the market, can contribute a pre-determined amount of upfront payment to receive an interest free, zero percent interest rate loan...|$|E
5000|$|Term: Mortgage loans {{generally}} have a maximum term, that is, {{the number of}} years after which an <b>amortizing</b> <b>loan</b> will be repaid.

40|$|The fair premia on FHA {{mortgage}} default {{insurance contracts}} are computed under alternative assumptions regarding the expected house price inflation rate and its variance and homeowner's default costs. The contracts considered vary by amortization schedule (15 and 30 year level-payment mortgages and two graduated-payment mortgages) and initial loan-to-value ratio (80 to 95. 8 percent). The results indicate a wide variation in fair insurance premia. Because FHA charges all borrowers the same premia, large cross-subsidies exist within the program, with borrower's obtaining low loan-to-value or rapidly <b>amortizing</b> <b>loans</b> subsidizing borrowers with high loan-to-value or negative <b>amortizing</b> <b>loans.</b> Moreover, {{the movement toward}} insuring riskier loans [...] graduated payment, price-level adjusted and adjustable rate [...] without increasing insurance premia seems almost certain to lead to significant overall losses for the program. ...|$|R

5000|$|For {{leveraged}} loans, considered {{non-investment grade}} risk, U.S. and European banks typically provide the revolving credits, letters of credit (L/Cs), and—although {{they are becoming}} increasingly less common—fully <b>amortizing</b> term <b>loans</b> known as [...] "Term Loan A" [...] under a syndicated loan agreement while institutions provide the partially <b>amortizing</b> term <b>loans</b> known a [...] "Term Loan B".|$|R
50|$|Congress {{passed the}} Federal Home Loan Bank Act in 1932, during the Great Depression. It {{established}} the Federal Home Loan Bank and associated Federal Home Loan Bank Board to assist other banks in providing funding to offer long term, <b>amortized</b> <b>loans</b> for home purchases. The {{aim was to}} encourage banks, not insurance companies, to become lenders and to provide realistic loans which borrowers could repay to gain full-ownership of their homes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Amortized</b> {{mortgage}} <b>loans</b> automatically pay {{a portion}} of each monthly payment to the principal balance, with the rest being paid as interest.|$|R
50|$|Bullet loans {{should be}} contrasted with <b>amortizing</b> <b>loans,</b> where {{the amount of}} {{principal}} is paid down {{over the life of}} the loan. There is no requirement that a loan be a bullet <b>loan</b> or an <b>amortizing</b> loan; combinations of all sorts exist. For example, a loan may have a grace period during which no principal is paid; partial amortization during the remainder of the loan; and a bullet payment at the end of the loan that is some percentage of the original principal.|$|R
50|$|Bond {{duration}}: Bond duration is the weighted-average time {{to receive}} the discounted present values of all the cash flows (including both principal and interest), while WAL is the weighted-average time to receive simply the principal payments (not including interest, and not discounting). For an <b>amortizing</b> <b>loan</b> with equal payments, the WAL will be higher than the duration, as the early payments are weighted towards interest, while the later payments are weighted towards principal, and further, taking present value (in duration) discounts the later payments.|$|R
50|$|The {{two basic}} types of <b>amortized</b> <b>loans</b> are the fixed rate {{mortgage}} (FRM) and adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) (also {{known as a}} floating rate or variable rate mortgage). In some countries, such as the United States, fixed rate mortgages are the norm, but floating rate mortgages are relatively common. Combinations of fixed and floating rate mortgages are also common, whereby a mortgage loan will have a fixed rate for some period, for example the first five years, and vary {{after the end of}} that period.|$|R
5000|$|Time until 50% of the {{principal}} has been repaid: WAL is a mean, while [...] "50% of {{the principal}} repaid" [...] is a median; see difference between mean and median. This is a common misunderstanding. Since principal outstanding is a concave function (of time) for a flat payment <b>amortizing</b> <b>loan,</b> {{less than half the}} principal will have been paid off at the WAL. Intuitively, this is because most {{of the principal}} repayment happens at the end. Formally, the distribution of repayments has negative skew: the small principal repayments at the beginning drag down the WAL (mean) more than they reduce the median.|$|R

40|$|A {{pricing model}} is {{developed}} for a reverse mortgage contract where the borrower receives payments {{either as a}} lump sum or in an annuity while the loan balance accumulates as a claim against the house. No underwriting criteria on income are applied. One risk of default is that the borrower {{will remain in the}} house after the negatively <b>amortizing</b> <b>loan</b> balance exceeds the value of the house. An explicit pricing model of the reverse mortgage permits the evaluation of this default "crossover" option.

50|$|An {{amortization}} {{schedule is}} a table detailing each periodic payment on an <b>amortizing</b> <b>loan</b> (typically a mortgage), as generated by an amortization calculator. Amortization {{refers to the}} process of paying off a debt (often from a loan or mortgage) over time through regular payments. A portion of each payment is for interest while the remaining amount is applied towards the principal balance. The percentage of interest versus principal in each payment is determined in an amortization schedule. The schedule differentiates the portion of payment that belongs to interest expense from the portion used to close the gap of a discount or premium from the principal after each payment.|$|R
