5|$|In {{addition}} to their function in respiration, the lungs also {{have a number of}} other functions. They are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin-angiotensin system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of <b>angiotensin</b> I to <b>angiotensin</b> II. The lungs are involved in the blood's acid-base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E
5|$|Mineralocorticoid {{secretion}} {{is regulated}} mainly by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), {{the concentration of}} potassium, {{and to a lesser}} extent the concentration of ACTH. Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of <b>angiotensin</b> II. <b>Angiotensin</b> receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate the release of aldosterone.|$|E
5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, <b>angiotensin</b> receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests that}} may {{assist in the}} {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism, especially if no tumor is found on the MRI scan, are ferritin (elevated in hemochromatosis), <b>angiotensin</b> converting enzyme (ACE) levels (often elevated in sarcoidosis), and human chorionic gonadotropin (often elevated in tumor of germ cell origin). If a genetic cause is suspected, genetic testing may be performed.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{produces}} aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, {{which is important}} in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. <b>Angiotensin</b> II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angiotensin</b> I {{flows in}} the {{bloodstream}} until it reaches the capillaries of the lungs where <b>angiotensin</b> converting enzyme (ACE) acts on it to convert it into <b>angiotensin</b> II.|$|E
25|$|Bradykinin {{is rapidly}} inactivated in the {{circulating}} blood, and it disappears completely {{in a single}} pass through the pulmonary circulation. <b>Angiotensin</b> I also disappears in the pulmonary circulation because of its conversion to <b>angiotensin</b> II. Furthermore, <b>angiotensin</b> II passes through the lungs without any loss. The inactivation of bradykinin and the conversion of <b>angiotensin</b> I to <b>angiotensin</b> II in the lungs was thought to be caused by the same enzyme. In 1970, Ng and Vane, using BPF provided by Ferreira, showed the conversion is inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angiotensin</b> is {{involved}} in regulating aldosterone and is the core regulation. <b>Angiotensin</b> II acts synergistically with potassium, and the potassium feedback is virtually inoperative when no <b>angiotensin</b> II is present. A {{small portion of the}} regulation resulting from <b>angiotensin</b> II must take place indirectly from decreased blood flow through the liver due to constriction of capillaries. When the blood flow decreases so does the destruction of aldosterone by liver enzymes.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors possess many common {{characteristics}} {{with another}} class of cardiovascular drugs, <b>angiotensin</b> II receptor antagonists, {{which are often}} used when patients are intolerant of the adverse effects produced by ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors do not completely prevent the formation of <b>angiotensin</b> II, as blockage is dose-dependent, so <b>angiotensin</b> II receptor antagonists may be useful because they act to prevent the action of <b>angiotensin</b> II at the AT1 receptor, leaving AT2 receptor unblocked; the latter may have consequences needing further study.|$|E
25|$|Losartan is a selective, {{competitive}} <b>angiotensin</b> II receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonist, {{reducing the}} end organ responses to <b>angiotensin</b> II. Losartan administration {{results in a}} decrease in total peripheral resistance (afterload) and cardiac venous return (preload). All of the physiological effects of <b>angiotensin</b> II, including release of aldosterone, are antagonized {{in the presence of}} losartan. Reduction in blood pressure occurs independently of the status of the renin-angiotensin system. As a result of losartan dosing, plasma renin activity increases due to removal of the <b>angiotensin</b> II feedback.|$|E
25|$|The lungs {{activate}} one hormone. The physiologically inactive decapeptide <b>angiotensin</b> I {{is converted}} to the aldosterone-releasing octapeptide, <b>angiotensin</b> II, in the pulmonary circulation. The reaction occurs in other tissues as well, but it is particularly prominent in the lungs. <b>Angiotensin</b> II also has a direct effect on arteriolar walls, causing arteriolar vasoconstriction, and consequently a rise in arterial blood pressure. Large amounts of the angiotensin-converting enzyme responsible for this activation are located on the surfaces of the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries. The converting enzyme also inactivates bradykinin. Circulation time through the alveolar capillaries is less than one second, yet 70% of the <b>angiotensin</b> I reaching the lungs {{is converted to}} <b>angiotensin</b> II in a single trip through the capillaries. Four other peptidases have been identified {{on the surface of}} the pulmonary endothelial cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angiotensin</b> {{receptor}} blockers or ACE inhibitors may aid {{blood flow}} to the fingers, and {{there is some evidence that}} <b>angiotensin</b> receptor blockers (often losartan) reduce frequency and severity of attacks, and possibly better than nifedipine.|$|E
25|$|Another system {{maintaining}} the extracellular fluid volume, peripheral resistance, {{and that if}} disturbed may lead to hypertension, is the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Renin is a circulating enzyme that participates in maintaining extracellular volume and arterial vasoconstriction, therefore contributing to regulation of blood pressure. It performs this function by breaking down (hydrolysing) angiotensinogen, secreted from the liver, into the peptide <b>angiotensin</b> I. <b>Angiotensin</b> I is further cleaved by an enzyme that is located primarily but not exclusively in the pulmonary circulation bound to endothelium; that enzyme is <b>angiotensin</b> converting enzyme (ACE). This cleavage produces <b>angiotensin</b> II, the most vasoactive peptide. <b>Angiotensin</b> II is a potent constrictor of all blood vessels. It acts on the musculature of arteries, raising peripheral resistance and thereby elevating blood pressure. <b>Angiotensin</b> II also causes the adrenal glands to release aldosterone, which stimulates the epithelial cells of the kidneys to increase re-absorption of salt and water, leading to raised blood volume and raised blood pressure. So elevated renin levels in the blood (normally 1.98-2.46ng/ml in the upright position) leads to hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{contraindicated}} or not tolerated, ACE inhibitor (ACE) {{therapy is}} recommended for all patients with systolic heart failure, irrespective of symptomatic severity or blood pressure. ACE inhibitors improve symptoms, decrease mortality and reduce ventricular hypertrophy. <b>Angiotensin</b> II receptor antagonist therapy (also referred to as AT1-antagonists or <b>angiotensin</b> receptor blockers), particularly using candesartan, is an acceptable alternative if the patient is unable to tolerate ACEI therapy. ACEIs and ARBs decrease afterload by antagonizing the vasopressor effect of <b>angiotensin,</b> thereby decreasing {{the amount of work}} the heart must perform. It is also believed that <b>angiotensin</b> directly affects cardiac remodeling, and blocking its activity can thereby slow the deterioration of cardiac function.|$|E
25|$|Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone {{system is}} a major blood {{pressure}} regulating mechanism. Markers of electrolyte and water imbalance in the body such as hypotension, low distal tubule sodium concentration, decreased blood volume and high sympathetic tone trigger {{the release of the}} enzyme renin from the cells of juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney. Renin activates a circulating liver derived prohormone angiotensinogen by proteolytic cleavage of all but its first ten amino acid residues known as <b>angiotensin</b> I. ACE (<b>Angiotensin</b> converting enzyme) then removes a further two residues, converting <b>angiotensin</b> I into <b>angiotensin</b> II. ACE is found in the pulmonary circulation and in the endothelium of many blood vessels. The system increases blood pressure by increasing the amount of salt and water the body retains, although <b>angiotensin</b> is also very good at causing the blood vessels to tighten (a potent vasoconstrictor).|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{development}} of ACE inhibitors was the discovery of ACE in plasma by Leonard T. Skeggs and his colleagues in 1956. Brazilian scientist Sérgio Henrique Ferreira reported a bradykinin-potentiating factor (BPF) present in the venom of Bothrops jararaca, a South American pit viper, in 1965. Ferreira then went to John Vane's laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow with his already-isolated BPF. The conversion of the inactive <b>angiotensin</b> I to the potent <b>angiotensin</b> II was thought to take place in the plasma. However, in 1967, Kevin K. F. Ng and John R. Vane showed plasma ACE is too slow to account for the conversion of <b>angiotensin</b> I to <b>angiotensin</b> II in vivo. Subsequent investigation showed rapid conversion occurs during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.|$|E
25|$|Renin {{activates}} the {{renin-angiotensin system}} by cleaving angiotensinogen, {{produced by the}} liver, to yield <b>angiotensin</b> I, which is further converted into <b>angiotensin</b> II by ACE, the angiotensin-converting enzyme primarily within the capillaries of the lungs. <b>Angiotensin</b> II then constricts blood vessels, increases the secretion of ADH and aldosterone, and stimulates the hypothalamus to activate the thirst reflex, each leading {{to an increase in}} blood pressure. Renin's primary function is therefore to eventually cause an increase in blood pressure, leading to restoration of perfusion pressure in the kidneys.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors {{block the}} {{conversion}} of <b>angiotensin</b> I (AI) to <b>angiotensin</b> II (AII). They thereby lower arteriolar resistance and increase venous capacity; decrease cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke work, and volume; lower resistance in {{blood vessels in the}} kidneys; and lead to increased natriuresis (excretion of sodium in the urine).|$|E
25|$|Renin {{converts}} angiotensinogen (inactive form) to <b>angiotensin</b> I (active form).|$|E
25|$|<b>Angiotensin</b> I {{is further}} cleaved {{in the lungs}} by endothelial-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) into <b>angiotensin</b> II, the most {{vasoactive}} peptide. <b>Angiotensin</b> II is a potent constrictor of all blood vessels. It acts on the smooth muscle and, therefore, raises the resistance posed by these arteries to the heart. The heart, trying to overcome this increase in its 'load', works more vigorously, causing the blood pressure to rise. <b>Angiotensin</b> II also acts on the adrenal glands and releases aldosterone, which stimulates the epithelial cells in the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the kidneys to increase re-absorption of sodium, exchanging with potassium to maintain electrochemical neutrality, and water, leading to raised blood volume and raised blood pressure. The RAS also acts on the CNS to increase water intake by stimulating thirst, as well as conserving blood volume, by reducing urinary loss through the secretion of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angiotensin</b> II also causes an {{increase}} in the release of aldosterone from the adrenal glands.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angiotensin</b> II {{increases}} {{synthesis of}} plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, so it accelerates {{the development of}} atherosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Two more <b>angiotensin</b> receptors {{have been}} described, AT3 and AT4, but their role is still unknown.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angiotensin</b> II stimulates AVP secretion, {{in keeping}} with its general pressor and pro-volumic effects on the body.|$|E
25|$|Atrial natriuretic peptide {{inhibits}} AVP secretion, {{in part by}} inhibiting <b>Angiotensin</b> II-induced {{stimulation of}} AVP secretion.|$|E
25|$|Blood-borne stimuli, {{including}} leptin, ghrelin, <b>angiotensin,</b> insulin, pituitary hormones, cytokines, plasma {{concentrations of}} glucose and osmolarity etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} therapy of <b>angiotensin</b> II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may {{be superior to}} either agent alone. This combination may increase levels of bradykinin while blocking the generation of <b>angiotensin</b> II and its activity at the AT1 receptor. This 'dual blockade' {{may be more effective}} than using an ACE inhibitor alone, because <b>angiotensin</b> II can be generated via non-ACE-dependent pathways. Preliminary studies suggest this combination of pharmacologic agents may be advantageous in the treatment of essential hypertension, chronic heart failure, and nephropathy. However, the more recent ONTARGET study showed no benefit of combining the agents and more adverse events. While statistically significant results have been obtained for its role in treating hypertension, clinical significance may be lacking. There are warnings about the combination of ACE inhibitors with ARBs.|$|E
25|$|The renin enzyme circulates in {{the blood}} stream and hydrolyzes (breaks down) {{angiotensinogen}} secreted from the liver into the peptide <b>angiotensin</b> I.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angiotensin</b> II is a {{vasoconstrictor}} {{which will}} increase bloodflow {{to the heart}} and subsequently the preload, ultimately increasing the cardiac output.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the kidney}} cannot {{directly}} sense blood, long-term regulation of blood pressure predominantly {{depends upon the}} kidney. This primarily occurs through maintenance of the extracellular fluid compartment, the size of which depends on the plasma sodium concentration. Renin {{is the first in}} a series of important chemical messengers that make up the renin-angiotensin system. Changes in renin ultimately alter the output of this system, principally the hormones <b>angiotensin</b> II and aldosterone. Each hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidney's absorption of sodium chloride, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid compartment and raising blood pressure. When renin levels are elevated, the concentrations of <b>angiotensin</b> II and aldosterone increase, leading to increased sodium chloride reabsorption, expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment, and an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when renin levels are low, <b>angiotensin</b> II and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the extracellular fluid compartment, and decreasing blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|The <b>angiotensin</b> {{receptor}} blockers can {{inhibit the}} receptor {{in a competitive}} surmountable, competitive insurmountable or noncompetitive fashion, depending upon {{the rate at which}} they dissociate from the receptor.|$|E
25|$|Generally, <b>angiotensin</b> {{converting}} {{enzyme inhibitors}} (ACEIs) or <b>angiotensin</b> II receptor antagonists (ARBs) are used, {{as they have}} been found to slow the progression. They have also been found {{to reduce the risk of}} major cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and death from cardiovascular disease when compared to placebo in individuals with CKD. Furthermore, ACEIs may be superior to ARBs for protection against progression to kidney failure and death from any cause in those with CKD. Aggressive blood pressure lowering decreases peoples risk of death.|$|E
25|$|Renin can be {{referred}} to as a hormone even though it has no peripheral receptors and rather has an enzymatic activity with which it hydrolyzes angiotensinogen to <b>angiotensin</b> I.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of <b>angiotensin</b> converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the late 1970s {{it was confirmed that}} Ang II {{plays an important role in}} regulating blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid balance.|$|E
25|$|The {{actions of}} Ang II are {{mediated}} by <b>angiotensin</b> receptors, AT1 and AT2. These receptors {{are members of}} the G protein-coupled receptors family which are seven transmembrane helices, connected by interchanging extracellular and intracellular loops.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a genetic}} element in {{individual}} susceptibility to cellulite. Researchers led by Enzo Emanuele have traced the genetic component of cellulite to particular polymorphisms in the <b>angiotensin</b> converting enzyme (ACE) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1A (HIF1a) genes.|$|E
