500|$|At the {{beginning}} of July, Gilligan played for the Gentlemen against the Players at the Oval. In the first innings, he was struck heavily over his heart by a delivery from Frederick Pearson; {{it was obvious that}} he was hurt, and he was out shortly afterwards. Although the Gentlemen v Players match at the Oval was less prestigious than its Lord's counterpart and generally mattered less to participants, Gilligan chose to bat the next day and scored a century batting at number 10. Even so, the Gentlemen lost the game by six wickets. Gilligan was never again as effective a cricketer, and he later conceded that batting in the second innings was a mistake. It is likely that the strain of the innings did as much harm as the original blow, although Gibson later wrote that Gilligan's subsequent long life suggests that he was not too badly hurt, and that it is unlikely too much damage was done. Nevertheless, Gibson concludes [...] "there is no doubt that he was badly shaken up, <b>and</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> reason, the magic departed".|$|E

However, even Shea's critics could not help but respect his engineering and management skills. Everyone who knew Shea considered him to be a brilliant engineer,Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 121. and his time as manager at ASPO only served to solidify a reputation that had been formed during his time on the Titan project. Of Shea's work in the mid-1960s, Murray and Cox write that [...] "these were Joe Shea's glory days, <b>and</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> swirl of opinions about this gifted, enigmatic man, he was taking an effort that had been foundering and driving it forward." [...] Shea's work also won wider attention, bringing him public recognition that approached that accorded to Wernher von Braun or Chris Kraft.

500|$|In {{military}} intelligence, the Russian doctrine roughly {{corresponds to}} Western notions of denial and deception. The United States Army's Glossary of Soviet Military Terminology from 1955 defined maskirovka as [...] "camouflage; concealment; disguise." [...] The International Dictionary of Intelligence from 1990 defined {{it as the}} Russian military intelligence (GRU) term for deception. Robert Pringle's 2006 Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Intelligence defined it as strategic deception. Scott Gerwehr's The Art of Darkness summarized it as deception and operational security. The historian Tom Cubbage commented that military deception was enormously successful for the Soviets, <b>and</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> United States might think, for the Soviet Union {{it was something to}} make use of both in war and in peacetime. An article in The Moscow Times explained: [...] "But маскировка has a broader military meaning: strategic, operational, physical and tactical deception. Apparently in U.S. military terminology, this is called either CC (camouflage, concealment and deception) or more recently D (denial and deception). It is the whole shebang—from guys in ski masks or uniforms with no insignia, to undercover activities, to hidden weapons transfers, to—well, starting a civil war but pretending that you've done nothing of the sort." ...|$|E

This had gradually brought a more enlightened atmosphere to Prague, and by 1861 Smetana was seeing prospects of a better future for Czech nationalism and culture. Before deciding his own future, in September Smetana set out on a concert tour of the Netherlands and Germany. He was still hoping to secure a reputation as a pianist, but once again he experienced failure. Back in Prague, he conducted performances of Richard III and Wallenstein's Camp in the Žofín Island concert hall in January 1862, to a muted reception. Critics accused him of adhering too closely to the [...] "New German" [...] school represented primarily by Liszt; Smetana responded that [...] "a prophet is without honour in his own land." [...] In March 1862 he made a last brief visit to Gothenburg, but the city no longer held his interest; it appeared to him a provincial backwater <b>and,</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> difficulties, he now determined to seek his musical future in Prague: [...] "My home has rooted itself into my heart so much that only there do I find real contentment.

2500|$|Rabbi Judah, Rabbi Nehemiah, and the Rabbis {{differed}} {{about the}} meaning of [...] "And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac."

Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Berekiah, and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Hama the son of Rabbi Hanina taught that Abraham did not bless Isaac, but gave him gifts. Rabbi Hama likened this to a king who had an orchard, which he entrusted to a steward. [...] The orchard contained two trees that were intertwined, and one of which yielded life-giving fruit and the other a deadly poison. [...] The steward thought that if he watered the life-bearing tree, the death-bearing one would flourish with it; while if he did not water the death-bearing tree, the life-bearing could not survive. On reflection, the steward decided that his position required him to do his duty, <b>and</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> owner of the orchard wished to do, he could do.

On reflection, he decided that he was only flesh; he would do his duty, and whatever God wished to do, God would do. Consequently, when Abraham died, God appeared to Isaac and blessed him, as [...] reports, [...] "And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Russian-Japanese {{negotiations}} then followed, although {{by early}} January 1904, the Japanese government had realised that Russia {{was not interested}} in settling the Manchurian or Korean issues. Instead, Russia's goal was buying time – via diplomacy – to further build up militarily. In December 1903, Wilhelm wrote in a marginal note on a diplomatic dispatch about his role in inflaming Russo–Japanese relations:"Since 97-Kiaochow-we have never left Russia in any doubt that we would cover her back in Europe, in case she decided to pursue a bigger policy in the Far East that might lead to military complications (with the aim of relieving our eastern border from the fearful pressure and threat of the massive Russian army!). Whereupon, Russia took Port Arthur and trusting us, took her fleet out of the Baltic, thereby making herself vulnerable to us by sea. In Danzig 01 and Reval 02, the same assurance was given again, with result that entire Russian divisions from Poland and European Russia were and are being sent to the Far East. This would not had happened if our governments had not been in agreement!". A recurring theme of Wilhelm's letters to Nicholas was that [...] "Holy Russia" [...] had been [...] "chosen" [...] by God to save the [...] "entire white race" [...] from the [...] "yellow peril", and that Russia was [...] "entitled" [...] to annex all of Korea, Manchuria, and northern China up to Beijing. Wilhelm went on to assure Nicholas that once Russia had defeated Japan {{that this would be a}} deadly blow to British diplomacy, and the two emperors, the self-proclaimed [...] "Admiral of the Atlantic" [...] and the [...] "Admiral of the Pacific" [...] would rule Eurasia together, making them able to challenge British sea power as the resources of Eurasia would make their empires immune to a British blockade, which would thus allow Germany and Russia to [...] "divide up the best" [...] of the British colonies in Asia between them. Nicholas had been prepared to compromise with Japan, but after receiving a letter from Wilhelm attacking him as a coward for his willingness to compromise with the Japanese (whom Wilhelm never ceasing reminding Nicholas represented the [...] "Yellow Peril") for the sake of peace, become more obstinate. Wilhelm had written to Nicholas stating that the question of Russian interests in Manchuria and Korea was beside the point, saying instead it was a matter of Russia"undertaking the protection and defense of the White Race, and with it, Christian civilization, against the Yellow Race. <b>And</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> Japs are determined to ensure the domination of the Yellow Race in East Asia, to put themselves at its head and organise and lead it into battle against the White Race. That is the kernel of the situation, and therefore there can be very little doubt about where the sympathies of all half-way intelligent Europeans should lie. England betrayed Europe's interests to America in a cowardly and shameful way over the Panama Canal question, so as to be left in 'peace' by the Yankees. Will the 'Tsar' likewise betray the interests of the White Race to the Yellow as to be 'left in peace' and not embarrass the Hague tribunal too much?". When Nicholas replied that he still wanted peace, Wilhelm wrote back in a telegram [...] "You innocent angel!", telling his advisors [...] "This is the language of an innocent angel. But not that of a White Tsar!". Nevertheless, the belief in Tokyo was that Russia was not serious about seeking a peaceful solution to the dispute, on 13 January 1904, Japan proposed a formula by which Manchuria would be outside the Japanese sphere of influence and, reciprocally, Korea outside Russia's. On 21 December 1903, the Tarō cabinet voted to go to war against Russia.|$|E
