5|$|Vanadinite is a lead {{chlorovanadate}} {{with the}} chemical formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine. Each structural unit of vanadinite contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six divalent lead ions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> {{of a regular}} octahedron, {{with one of the}} lead ions provided by an adjoining vanadinite molecule. The distance between each lead and chlorine ion is 317picometres. The shortest distance between each lead ion is 4.48Å. The octahedron shares two of its opposite faces with that of neighbouring vanadinite units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of an irregular tetrahedron. The distance between each oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76Å. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain.|$|E

5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners,</b> while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the focal length range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E
5|$|Before {{they were}} {{destroyed}} in the Revolution, {{the remains of the}} king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below. Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather than death, while Henry is posed strikingly, with his head thrown back. From 1583, Pilon also sculpted two later gisants of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes. In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel. Pilon's four bronze statues of the cardinal virtues stand <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of the tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall Bontemps' work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.|$|E

5|$|Physically, the Australian blacktip shark {{can only}} {{reliably}} {{be distinguished from}} the common blacktip shark {{by the number of}} vertebrae (174–182 total, 84–91 before the tail in C. tilstoni, 182–203 total, 94–102 before the tail in C. limbatus). It has a moderately robust, spindle-shaped body and a long, pointed snout. The anterior rims of the nostrils are slightly enlarged into low triangular flaps. The large, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The furrows <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of the mouth are barely evident. There are 32–35 upper and 29–31 lower tooth rows; each upper tooth has a slender, upright cusp and fine serrations that become coarser near the base, while the lower teeth are narrower and more finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|E
5|$|Rather heavily built, the bignose shark has a long, broad, and blunt snout {{with the}} {{nostrils}} preceded by well-developed, triangular flaps of skin. The moderately large, circular eyes {{are equipped with}} nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth is broadly curved and lacks obvious furrows <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners.</b> The upper teeth number 14–16 rows on either side and have tall, broad, triangular cusps with serrated edges; they are erect at the jaw center and become increasingly oblique towards the sides. The lower teeth number 14–15 rows on either side and have narrow, erect cusps with extremely fine serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are moderately long.|$|E
5|$|Slim and streamlined, {{the silky}} shark has a fairly long, rounded snout with barely {{developed}} flaps of skin {{in front of}} the nostrils.

5|$|Superficially, the smoothtooth blacktip shark {{resembles the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus). It is rather robust in build, with a short and blunt snout.

The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|E
5|$|The Al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo {{seems to}} have had a similar {{projecting}} entrance to the Great Mosque of Mahdiya. The original building had an open central courtyard with three arcades.

There were three domes (indicative of the location of the prayer hall), two <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of the qibla wall and one over the prayer niche, and a small brick minaret over the main entrance. The gallery around the courtyard had series of columns and the prayer hall, which had the domes built over it, had five more rows of five pillars.|$|E
5|$|The Australian swellshark has a stocky, rounded {{body that}} tapers {{significantly}} to the short caudal peduncle. The head comprises {{no more than a}} fifth of the total length and is broad and moderately flattened, with a very short, thick, blunt snout. The nostrils are divided into small incurrent and excurrent openings by short, triangular flaps of skin that do not reach the mouth. The mouth is extremely large, without furrows <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners.</b> The teeth are numerous and small with multiple cusps; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. The large, oval eyes are placed somewhat on the upper surface of the head, and have rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and ridges underneath.|$|E
