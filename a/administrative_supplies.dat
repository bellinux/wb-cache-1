A reorganized Ministry of War served as the <b>administrative,</b> <b>supply,</b> and mobilization agency of the army, and an independent Army General Staff had responsibility for strategic planning and command functions. The Chief of the Army General Staff, with {{direct access to the}} emperor could operate independently of the civilian government. This complete independence of the military from civilian oversight was codified in the 1889 Meiji Constitution which designated that the Army and Navy were directly under the personal command of the emperor, and not under the civilian leadership or Cabinet.|$|R

50|$|After World War II began, {{the lines}} between the Allgemeine-SS and the Waffen-SS became {{increasingly}} blurred, due largely to the Allgemeine-SS headquarters offices having <b>administrative</b> and <b>supply</b> command over the Waffen-SS. By 1940, all of the Allgemeine-SS had been issued grey war-time uniforms. Himmler ordered that the all-black uniforms be turned in for use by others.

Similarly, the conversion of the 2nd and 3rd Cuirassier Regiment to armoured division status in the area northeast of Paris was ascertained on December 1939.

40|$|The aim of our {{research}} {{in the first half}} of 2011 was to find out what were the administrative, regulative and other problems that were specific obstacles to local economic development and what best practices can be found in local economies. During {{our research}} we carried out interviews with leaders and local professionals in five medium size towns of Hungary. We stated that the most obstructive factors were the imperfection of vocational training, the excessively bureaucratic <b>administrative</b> proceedings (<b>supplying</b> of data, acquisition of authority permits, the attitude of the authorities, etc.) and the system of application and finding sources of funds. We think that the most innovative solutions are the good examples of the institutionalized co-operation between local governments and local businesses.
