50|$|If a food is adulterated, FDA and FSIS have a {{broad array}} of {{enforcement}} tools.They are of various types. These include seizing and condemning the product, detaining imported product, enjoining persons from manufacturing or distributing the product, or requesting a recall of the product. Enforcement action is usually preceded by a Warning Letter from FDA to the manufacturer or distributor of the adulterated product. In the case of an adulterated meat or poultry product, FSIS has certain additional powers. FSIS may suspend or withdraw federal inspection of an official establishment. Without federal inspection, an establishment may not produce or process meat or poultry products, and therefore must cease operations. With the exception of infant formula, neither FDA nor FSIS has the authority to require a company to recall an <b>adulterated</b> <b>food</b> <b>product.</b> However, the ability to generate negative publicity gives them considerable powers of persuasion.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} of nephrolithiasis and acute kidney injury among children in China {{have been linked}} to ingestion of milk-based infant formula contaminated with melamine. These cases provide evidence in humans for the nephrotoxicity of melamine, which previously had been described only in animals. The consequences of this outbreak are already severe and will likely continue to worsen. Herein we summarize the global impact of the melamine milk contamination, the reemergence of melamine-tainted animal feed, and potential mechanisms of melamine nephrotoxicity. Large-scale epidemiologic studies are necessary to further characterize this disease and to assess its potential long-term sequelae. This epidemic of environmental kidney disease highlights the morbidity associated with <b>adulterated</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> available in today’s global marketplace and reminds us of the unique vulnerability of the kidney to environmental insults. Melamine {{is the latest in a}} growing list of diverse potentially toxic compounds about which nephrologists and other health-care providers responsible for the diagnosis and management of kidney disease must now be aware...|$|R
40|$|Sustainability {{relies on}} the environmental, social and {{economical}} systems: the three pillars of sustainability. The social sustainability mostly advocates the people’s welfare, health, safety, and quality of life. In the agricultural food industry, the aspects of social sustainability, such as consumer health and safety have gained substantial attention due to the frequent cases of food-borne diseases. The food-borne diseases due to the food degradation, chemical contamination and adulteration of <b>food</b> <b>products</b> pose {{a serious threat to}} the consumer’s health, safety, and quality of life. To ensure the consumer’s health and safety, it is essential to develop an efficient system which can address these critical social issues in the food distribution networks. This research proposes an ePedigree (electronic pedigree) traceability system based on the integration of RFID and sensor technology for real-time monitoring of the agricultural food to prevent the distribution of hazardous and <b>adulterated</b> <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> The different aspects regarding implementation of the proposed system in food chains are analyzed and a feasible integrated solution is proposed. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated and finally, a comprehensive analysis of the proposed ePedigree system’s impact on the social sustainability in terms of consumer health and safety is presented...|$|R

There are two types of food adulteration; namely intentional/deliberate adulteration done by dishonest producers, retailers and processors for financial up liftmen and incidental/unintentional which may be done at the time of producing, handling and/or storing, etc. Different food items and drinks prone for adulteration include: dairy products, cereals grains, fats and oils, and others like honey, juice, peppers, etc. Food adulteration has a great impact on producers/farmers, consumers, enterprises and government. The main challenges are public health problem, lack of acceptance in the market due to lack of originality, decrease in consumer confidence. Regulations that penalize such a criminal traders and dishonest producers/processors that <b>adulterate</b> different <b>food</b> <b>products</b> in various places should be applied.

40|$|Bangladesh {{has long}} faced a serious food safety problem. Food {{manufacturers}} are producing many unhealthy and <b>adulterated</b> <b>food</b> <b>products,</b> ignoring the regulations deliberately. There are numerous laws {{as well as}} several regulatory bodies which deal with this alarming issue but with minimal effectiveness. The current study intends to investigate the relevant food safety regulations in regard to the manufacture of unsafe foods in Bangladesh. This study observes that the existing regulatory philosophy of the enforcement of the regulations is ineffective in practice. This is because the regulations only offer direct criminal penalty for any kind of contravention. There are no other enforcement tools — {{such as the use of}} persuasion or an improvement notice or civil penalties — for authorities to impose upon the food manufacturers prior to directly applying the criminal penalties. From that perspective, this study has chosen the responsive regulation theory to evaluate the food safety regulatory regime of Bangladesh and apply to it. In order to do that, the present research has chosen the equivalent food safety regulatory framework of NSW, where the responsive regulation theory has been successfully applied. The qualitative method of research has been used in this research to analyse the major relevant literature of Bangladesh and NSW with a view to suggesting the possible solutions for Bangladesh in light of the equivalent mechanisms applied in NSW, where appropriate and necessary. Besides applying the responsive regulation theory to the food safety regulatory regime of Bangladesh, this thesis has offered several recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the current food safety regulations of Bangladesh. The key issues of the thesis are divided between six main chapters. Firstly, it has presented the way in which to adopt the responsive regulation theory in the food safety regulatory regime in Bangladesh, which is a least developed country. The current study has recommended some moderation of and adaptations to the original theory of responsive regulation when introducing the grading system in the manufacturing food industry in Bangladesh. Secondly, this thesis has depicted the existing legal framework of the food safety regulations of Bangladesh. It is observed that the food safety legal framework in Bangladesh has been crowded with numerous unnecessary, confusing and overlapping regulations which this study has suggested should be minimised by the introduction of a single law encompassing all the food safety issues. Thirdly, the investigation into the food safety regulatory framework in Bangladesh revealed that the regulatory bodies that deal with the regulations are also quite large in number which makes the entire regulatory regime burdensome and ineffective. The present study has recommended a single regulatory body for coordinating all food safety activities, so ensuring the greater transparency and increased accountability. Fourthly, this study reveals that affected or injured consumers do not obtain damages entirely commensurate with their injuries under the current civil liability regime. In order to address this concern, this thesis has suggested that the current statutory laws be updated by introducing adequate and effective provisions as well as codifying the <b>product</b> liability of <b>food</b> manufacturers under the law of torts. Fifthly, the imposition of criminal liability on food manufacturers is also not effective as the current regime provides unstructured mens rea, narrow actus reus, and unrestricted defences of the offences. This study suggests introducing a Three-Tier model of offences, where offences with subjective mens rea, offences with objective mens rea and absolute liability offences will be available to try contraventions of food safety regulations. This dissertation also argues for the broadening of the actus reus of the offences and narrowing the defences for food manufacturers. Finally, this research offers a way in which to adopt the responsive regulation theory to the enforcement regime of the food safety regulations in Bangladesh and also analyses a number of other enforcement problems. It is believed that if all these recommendations of this thesis are adopted, the food safety situation in Bangladesh can be improved by having regulations that are effective. In addition, the findings of the thesis could have implications and usefulness in the global context, particularly in the developing and least developed countries...|$|R

Advisor: Dr. Lawrence Wackett. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxix, 295 pages, appendices 1 - 5. There {{is an increasing}} need to test for chemicals present in <b>adulterated</b> <b>foods</b> or <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> There is also an increasing need to degrade chemicals present in water. The s-triazine compounds compose a major class of industrial chemicals. The research in our labs focuses on developing microbial enzyme-based bioassays for s-triazines and understanding the enzymatic biodegradation of them. Cyanuric acid is an intermediate in bacterial metabolism of common s-triazine compounds. In 2008, intentional adulteration of milk and milk products (e. g., infant formula) with the s-triazine melamine affected 300, 000 infants & youth in China, resulting in 50, 000 hospitalizations and 6 deaths. In 2010, tons of melamine-tainted milk products were again for sale. Melamine is sometimes co-contaminated with cyanuric acid. When ingested together, they form insoluble crystals in kidneys, which may lead to renal failure. This scenario caused > 13, 000 pet deaths in the U. S. (2007) due to <b>adulterated</b> pet <b>food.</b> There is interest in detecting cyanuric acid and melamine, individually or together, in foods. With regards to s-triazines in water, cyanuric acid is a stable compound that accumulates over time in swimming pools disinfected with N-chloroisocyanuric acids. With high concentrations of cyanuric acid, disinfection is ineffective and public health is not protected from disease-causing microorganisms. To address this concern, the pool is drained, refilled with fresh water, and treated again. The research here identifies and characterizes microbial enzymes involved in s-triazine metabolism {{that could be used}} to 1) develop sensitive bioassays for cyanuric acid and/or 2) biodegrade cyanuric acid in water. Cyanuric acid hydrolase acts on cyanuric acid. Using 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS), this research establishes the product of this reaction is carboxybiuret. This work also demonstrates carboxybiuret spontaneously decarboxylates to generate biuret. In the subsequent reaction, biuret hydrolase acts on biuret. Using an interdisciplinary approach combining bioinformatics, microbiology, molecular biology, protein separations, enzymology, quantitative analyses, 13 C NMR, and MS, this research identifies and characterizes the first biuret hydrolase to be purified in active form (from R. leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841). Together, cyanuric acid and biuret hydrolases release ammonia, which is detected via the colorimetric Berthelot Assay. Cyanuric acid hydrolase belongs to rare family of unstable proteins. In an effort to identify a stable protein scaffold that could be modified to hydrolyze cyanuric acid, an array of amidohydrolase family members were analyzed for low-level activity with cyanuric acid to use as a starting point. Guanine deaminase from Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110 was observed to have such activity. This is the only known metallo-enzyme to hydrolyze a ring-opening amide bond of cyanuric acid...|$|R
