25|$|According to the OFAC, this {{sanction}} {{was part}} of a joint effort with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office in Los Angeles to work with the Mexican government. The intention of this sanction was to dismantle Los Cuinis' business network and uncover the businesses that were operating illegally with drug money invested in the economy. The U.S. government first heard of Hotelito Desconocido through a wire tap phone conversation Abigael had with Diana María Sánchez Carlón, one of his financial assistants. In that conversation, Abigael <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> his hotel was doing, prompting the U.S. government to investigate what he was referring to exactly. Sánchez Carlón was introduced to Abigael by Jennifer Beaney Camacho Cázares, a close friend of hers and wife of Abigael. Both Sánchez Carlón and Camacho Cázares were sanctioned through the Kingpin Act for their alleged role in money laundering.|$|E

I'd like my work to be an anthropological artifact from an extinct, primitive society". She died in her sleep on the morning of April 9, 2005, at her home in Washington, D.C. The cause of death was later determined to be acute myocarditis. She was 58 years old.|$|E
2500|$|Watson's The Double Helix {{almost entirely}} refers {{to her as}} [...] "Rosy", the name people at King's College used behind her back. She {{did not want to}} be called by that name because she had a {{great-aunt}} Rosy. In the family, she was called [...] "Ros". To others, she was simply [...] "Rosalind". She made it clear to an American visiting friend Dorothea Raacke, while sitting with her at Crick's table in The Eagle pub in Cambridge: Raacke <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> she was to be called and she replied [...] "I'm afraid it will have to be Rosalind", adding [...] "Most definitely not Rosy." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Baraita {{was taught}} in the Academy of Eliyahu: A certain scholar {{diligently}} studied Bible and Mishnah, and greatly served scholars, but nonetheless died young. His wife carried his tefillin to the synagogues and schoolhouses and asked if [...] says, [...] "for that is your life, {{and the length of}} your days," [...] why her husband nonetheless died young. No one could answer her. On one occasion, Eliyahu <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> he was to her during her days of white garments — the seven days after her menstrual period — and she reported that they ate, drank, and slept together without clothing. Eliyahu explained that God must have slain him because he did not sufficiently respect the separation that [...] requires.|$|E
2500|$|While {{reporting}} various unsavory hearsay, {{the ancient}} sources generally portray Livia (Julia Augusta) {{as a woman}} of proud and queenly attributes, faithful to her imperial husband, for whom she was a worthy consort, forever poised and dignified. With consummate skill she acted out the roles of consort, mother, widow and dowager. Dio records two of her utterances: [...] "Once, when some naked men met her and were {{to be put to}} death in consequence, she saved their lives by saying that to a chaste woman such men are in no way different from statues. When someone <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> she had obtained such a commanding influence over Augustus, she answered that it was by being scrupulously chaste herself, doing gladly whatever pleased him, not meddling with any of his affairs, and, in particular, by pretending neither to hear nor to notice the favourites of his passion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Teeny, {{also known}} as [...] "Little Girl" [...] and [...] "Sis" [...] (Marian Jordan) – a {{precocious}} youngster who frequently tried to cadge loose change from Fibber (often in cahoots with her rarely heard best friend Willie Toops). She often ended her sentences with [...] "I betcha!", and when someone mentioned food, or a word {{that sounded like a}} food, she usually responded [...] "I'm hungry." [...] Teeny was also known to lose track of her own conversations. When Fibber showed interest in what she was saying, she would forget all about it, and her conversation would switch from telling to asking. After Fibber repeated everything she had been telling him, Teeny would reply [...] "I know!" [...] or [...] "I know it!" [...] in a condescending way. Her appearances were sometimes foreshadowed by Molly excusing herself to the kitchen or to have a nap. Fibber would wistfully deliver a compliment to her, saying, [...] "Ah, there goes a good kid," [...] upon which the doorbell would ring and Teeny would appear, usually greeting Fibber with [...] "Hi, mister!" [...] On rare occasions Molly and Teeny would interact. In the December 21, 1948 broadcast Fibber learned that her real name was [...] "Elizabeth" [...] from a Christmas card she had sent him. She was perpetually a child, and her permanent youth was only mentioned once; Fibber <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> old she was, to which she responded, [...] "Five". Then he asked how long she'd been coming over to visit him and Molly. [...] "Nine years," [...] she answered. Then, after a pause, she asked, [...] "Ain't it a wonderful world, mister?" ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
