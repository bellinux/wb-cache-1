40|$|In {{this review}} I {{summarize}} the observational attempts {{done so far}} to unveil {{the nature of the}} progenitor system/s of Type Ia Supernovae. In particular, I focus on the most recent developments that followed the alleged detection of circumstellar material around a few events, and on the link this possibly establishes with recurrent novae. In this framework, I then discuss the case of RS Oph, what we know of its circumstellar environment, <b>and</b> what <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> us about its supposed connection to Type Ia supernova explosions.

40|$|In 1997 the {{creation}} of a virtual underground was somehow a bizarre idea that the author attempted to realize. First, the representation of metaphors of a metro in a multimedia format opened ideas of what could be possible to achieve on the Internet, e. g. how sound fragments uploaded by different people could run on the same navigational interface <b>and</b> what <b>this</b> mixture <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> us about our urban culture. How does it sound? Listening was the practice selected to perceive the whole of space and time relationships within a journey, and how these resonate with each individual. First in London, and later interconnecting the experience with Mexico and Paris, the author followed a mixed ethnographic method with commuters in each city, involving them in reflective and performative listening practices. Sounding Underground is the resulting interface that links the three cities’ metros, along with their cultures, evoking social, symbolic and political perceptions for each listener. The process followed by participants, and the interaction with the environment by users on the Internet, have opened paths for the acknowledgement <b>and</b> transformation of <b>this</b> experience, as each underground sonic journey becomes potentially a metaphor of a commuter’s life...|$|R

Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what I <b>tell</b> people — <b>is</b> that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream.

40|$|Achieving a good organization-person fit {{is vital}} to {{organizational}} survival and can also create a win-win phenomenon for both employers and job applicants. One of the factors of this ‘fit’ can hinge on how job applicants perceive whether their prospective employers have corporate social responsibilities (‘CSR’) that match their own corporate social responsibility orientation (‘CSRO’) and CSRO {{can be one of}} the employer-attractiveness influencing factors. However, the construct and definition of CSR and CSRO have been elusive, subject to different social-cultural environments, time frame and value orientations of people. This study qualitatively investigates the relationships, if any, between the Corporate Social Responsibility Orientation of undergraduate students in their senior years (full-time and part-time students) and Employer Attractiveness (‘EA’) in Hong Kong’s graduate labour market. It tries to find out whether students’ CSRO would influence their employment decisions towards organizations which have exhibited various extents and types of socially responsible behaviors. There were 97 participants spread among 15 focus-groups later classified into 6 categories in various study majors and study modes. They were all undergraduate students in their senior year of study. Findings from the study provide evidence that students generally aspired to work for a good CSR organization, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a <b>telling</b> factor in their employment-decision. However, students had a ‘CSR’ connotation differing from those established in previous research. Most of the students in this research thought that for an organization to be considered socially responsible and attractive in terms of their employment-decisions, the organization is normally expected to take up some responsibilities associated with a responsible-employer (‘RER’). However, it was found that their actual employment decisions were at variance from their espoused ethical position prior to seeking employment. Alternative interpretations, based on sensemaking, of the qualitative data will be explored and insights for students, educators and companies will be derived. The outcomes of the research could be informative for both human resources management theory and practice in organisations where there is a debate over whether, and how, they should pursue a CSR agenda. Furthermore, this research adds to literature which seeks to link CSR, CSRO, employment recruitment and employer attractiveness...|$|R

The artists of Der Blaue Reiter were less oriented towards intense expression of emotion and more towards theory- a tendency which would lead Kandinsky to pure abstraction.

There were therefore Utopian tones to Kandinsky's abstractions: [...] "We have before us an age of conscious creation, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> new spirit in painting is going {{hand in hand with}} thoughts toward an epoch of greater spirituality." [...] Die Brücke also had Utopian tendencies, but took the medieval craft guild as a model of cooperative work that could better society- [...] "Everyone who with directness and authenticity conveys that which drives him to creation belongs to us". The Bauhaus also shared these Utopian leanings, seeking to combine fine and applied arts (Gesamtkunstwerk) with a view towards creating a better society.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how policies are made, analysts {{need to be able}} to explain and describe the policy making process. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> a complex task due to the variety and complexity of policy making environments. The difficulty lies in accounting for the multiple actors who come and go, differing preferences, and impending problems and solutions sets which vary by policy environment. 	Therefore, there is a need to approach the understanding of policy processes from several different theoretical perspectives to aid in evaluating the multifaceted variations which ultimately affect policy making. An improved description of processes can lead to more accurate predictions of possible future policies, improved advocacy efforts, and enhanced problem solving. 	Two policy process frameworks, the Multiple Stream Framework (MSF) and the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, were applied to a recent significant change in science policy. An understanding is developed to explain how federal science funding survived within the highly controversial and costly American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). 	The volatile and unpredictable nature of science policy lends itself well to the MSF, while the more static IAD is less useful to explain how and why the funds stayed in the bill. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> about the scope and adaptability of the two frameworks, where each may be better suited for different policy environments.
