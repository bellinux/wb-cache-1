40|$|AbstractA model {{immunoassay}} {{test system}} is proposed based on metal enhanced photoluminescence to analyze low concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein, a tumor marker. Antigen-antibody reaction {{was performed on}} polystyrene plates coated with silver nanoparticles to increase sensitivity of fluorescent immunoassay and signal-to-noise ratio as compared to silver-free system. The proposed test system model uses layer-by-layer assembly approach, LED excitation and nanowatt photodetection set-up, so it is characterized by smaller probe volume, fast analysis and simplicity. The proposed model system offers <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> <b>detection</b> at concentrations used in clinical practice. Photostability and photoluminescence enhancement for labeled alpha-fetoprotein antibodies on a silver substrate were found to depend on antibodies concentration. Labeled antibodies photostability on substrates was found to deviate within 20 % as compared to silver-free samples whereas photoluminescence intensity enhancement is typically {{in the range of}} 6 - 8 times...|$|E

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a common}} neoplasm in Taiwan, for which early diagnosis is difficult and the prognosis is usually poor. HCC is usually diagnosed by abdominal sonography and serum <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> (AFP) <b>detection.</b> Modified nucleosides, regarded as indicators for the whole-body turnover of RNAs, are excreted in abnormal amounts in the urine of patients with malignancies and can serve as tumor markers. We analyzed the excretion patterns of urinary nucleosides from 25 HCC patients and 20 healthy volunteers by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) under optimized conditions. The HPLC/ESI-MS/MS approach with selective reaction monitoring (SRM) allowed for the sensitive determination of nucleosides in human urine samples. The mean levels of the urinary nucleosides adenosine, cytidine, and inosine were significantly higher in HCC patients than healthy volunteers (average of 1. 78 -, 2. 26 -, and 1. 47 -fold, respectively). However, the mean levels of urinary 1 -methyladenosine, 3 -methylcytidine, uridine, and 2 '-deoxyguanosine were not significantly different. Combined with the determination of serum AFP levels, the higher levels of urinary adenosine, cytidine, and inosine may be additional diagnosis markers for HCC in Taiwanese patients.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{hepatitis}} B (CHB) virus {{infection is}} {{a major cause of}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as late diagnosis is the main factor for the poor survival of patients. There is an urgent need for accurate biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore the serum lipidome profiles of hepatitis B-related HCC to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers. Methods An ultraperformance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) lipidomic method was used to characterize serum profiles from HCC (n[*]=[*] 32), liver cirrhosis (LC) (n[*]=[*] 30), CHB (n[*]=[*] 25), and healthy subjects (n[*]=[*] 34). Patients were diagnosed by clinical laboratory and imaging evidence and all presented with CHB while healthy controls had normal liver function and no infectious diseases. Results The UPLC-MS-based serum lipidomic profile provided more accurate diagnosis for LC patients than conventional <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> (AFP) <b>detection.</b> HCC patients were discriminated from LC with 78  % sensitivity and 64  % specificity. In comparison, AFP showed sensitivity and specificity of 38  % and 93  %, respectively. HCC was differentiated from CHB with 100  % sensitivity and specificity using the UPLC-MS approach. Identified lipids comprised glycerophosphocolines, glycerophosphoserines and glycerophosphoinositols. Conclusions UPLC-MS lipid profiling proved to be an efficient and convenient tool for diagnosis and screening of HCC in a high-risk population...|$|R

40|$|With {{advances}} in lectin affinity electrophoresis of <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> (AFP), the <b>detection</b> of {{significant changes in}} serum AFP at low levels in cirrhotics has become important for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum AFP levels of 616 healthy individuals without abnormal liver function tests or virus markers of hepatitis B and C were determined by enzyme immunoassay with IMx-AFP Dainapack using automated IMx apparatus set at twice the ordinary sensitivity and {{compared with those of}} 241 individuals with abnormal liver function tests and/or positive hepatitis virus markers. The coefficient of variation in this assay was less than 10 % at AFP levels as low as 0. 2 ng/ml with a lower detection limit of 0. 1 ng/ml. The AFP level of healthy population showed a Gaussian distribution curve after logarithmic transformation with a median and 2. 5 - 97. 5 percentile reference range of 2. 2 (0. 6 - 5. 6) ng/ml.

40|$|Nanometer-sized {{fluorescent}} hybrid silica (NFHS) particles {{were prepared}} for use as sensitive and photostable fluorescent probes in biological staining and diagnostics. The first step of the synthesis involves the covalent modification of 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane with an organic fluorophore, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, under N- 2 atmosphere for getting a fluorescent silica precursor. Then the NFHS particles, with a diameter of well below 40 nm, were prepared by controlled hydrolysis of the fluorescent silica precursor with tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) using the reverse micelle technique. The fluorophores are dispersed homogeneously in the silica network of the NFHS particles and well protected from the environmental oxygen. Furthermore, since the fluorophores are covalently bound to the silica network, there is no migration, aggregation and leakage of the fluorophores. In comparison with common single organic fluorophores, these particle probes are brighter, more stable against photobleaching and do not suffer from intermittent on/off light emission (blinking). We have used these newly developed NFHS particles as a fluorescent marker to label antibodies, using silica immobilization method, for the immunoassay of human <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> (AFP). The <b>detection</b> limit of this method was down to 0. 05 ng mL(- 1) under our current experimental conditions. We think this material would attract much attention and be applied widely in biotechnology...|$|R
40|$|Aim. In this study, we {{attempted}} to identify HCC-specific serum glycoproteins by using glycoproteomic technologies. We targeted at finding glycoforms with aberrant alpha- 2, 6 -sialylation and alpha- 1, 6 -fucosylation in sera of HCC patients. These glycoforms may have potentials {{to be used as}} tumor marker(s) in the diagnosis of HCC. Among the validated differential glycoproteins, Hp was the only glycoprotein, glycoforms of which were found to be significantly up-regulated in the HCC group when examining both the sialylated glycoprotein profiles and the fucosylated glycoprotein profiles. This glycoprotein was selected for further investigation. In the independent validation group, increased serum levels of Hp (total), alpha- 2, 6 sialylated Hp and alpha- 1, 6 fucosylated Hp was observed in the HCC patients. A unique pattern of Hp glycoforms comprising both hypersialylated fucosylated and hyposialytated fucosylated species was found in the HCC patients. Serum concentrations of these glycoforms were significantly higher in the HCC patients with advanced tumor, suggesting their tumor-specific nature. Besides, we have performed quantitative profiling of N-glycans of serum Hp in the HCC patients, CLD patients and normal subjects, and have attempted to identify HCC-associated N-glycans for HCC diagnosis. Combined used of serum alpha-fetoprotein, serum Hp and its N-glycans, we could achieve 84 % sensitivity at 100 % and 93 % specificities when distinguishing the HCC patients from the CLD patients and from the normal subjects, respectively. Background. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often arises in patients with coexisting chronic liver disease (CLD). Since alpha-fetoprotein, a conventional biomarker, may also be raised in patients with uncomplicated CLD, the use of <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> in early <b>detection</b> of HCC is limited. Identification of additional biomarkers may improve early detection. Previous studies have shown that levels of alpha- 2, 6 -sialyltransferase and alpha- 1, 6 -fucosyltransferase change in liver cancer, leading to aberrant glycosylations on some serum proteins. Conclusion. By undertaking glycoproteomic approach, we have identified a panel of potential biomarkers for diagnosis of HCC. These biomarkers were useful for classifying among normal healthy subjects, CLD patients, patients with early HCC and patients with advanced HCC. Some of them were validated with the independent cases. Finally, we have identified a unique pattern of Hp glycoforms comprising both hypersialylated fucosylated and hyposialylated fucosylated species in the HCC patients. Serum Hp and its N-glycans have been shown to have potential values for aiding the diagnosis of HCC. Methodology. There are four parts in this study. The first part is "method development". A method for obtaining quantitative profiles of serum glycoproteins with alpha- 2, 6 -sialylation or alpha- 1, 6 -fucosylation was developed by combined use of lectin affinity chromatography, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and enzyme-linked lectin assay. The second part is "biomarker discovery". The quantitative profiles of the serum glycoproteins from 20 HCC patients and 10 CLD patients (control) were compared by bioinformatic approaches to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis of HCC. The protein identities of the potential targets were obtained by using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. The third part is "validation". An independent set of serum samples from 40 HCC patients, 30 CLD patients and 20 normal subjects was used to evaluate the diagnostic values of the potential biomarkers. The last part of this study was aimed to identify HCC-associated N-glycans on one of potential biomarkers found, and examine their values in diagnosis of HCC. Result. When analyzing alpha- 2, 6 -sialylated glycoproteins, 53 glycoprotein spots were significantly different between the HCC and CLD groups, of which 44 spots belonged to 13 glycoproteins. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that these differential sialoglycoprotein profiles contained valuable information for differentiating the HCC patients from CLD patients, and classifying between early HCC and advanced HCC patients. When analyzing alpha- 1, 6 -fucosylated proteins, 11 glycoprotein spots were significant different between the two study groups, of which 8 spots belonged to 1 glycoprotein. Majority of the protein identities were successfully obtained by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Among the differential glycoproteins, we have identified a subgroup with a unique pattern of glycosylation. These glycoproteins were characterized by the presence of hypersialylated and fucosylated glycoforms. The differential patterns and the diagnostic values of some of these serum glycoproteins were confirmed in the independent validation group by measuring their serum levels with immunoassays. The results of the logistic regression analyses suggest that complement factor B and haptoglobin (Hp) can be used in combination with alpha-fetoprotein to improve the diagnosis of HCC. Ang, Ling.
