5|$|Millennium Group {{offender}} profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{investigate a}} series of murders mimicking urban legends. The case soon leads them to a psychiatric hospital for violent criminals, where all is not <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although never gaining wide fame, Ali had a {{dedicated}} following on the vaudeville circuit in the United States. He performed for {{heads of state}} including Tsar NicholasII of Russia. Judy Garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and David Blaine identified Ali as his favorite magician. Portions of his act were captured in the short film Strange <b>as</b> <b>It</b> <b>Seems</b> (1930) and in Politiquerias (1931), the Spanish-language version of Laurel and Hardy's Chickens Come Home. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias: 1977's Gizmo!, and 1999's Vaudeville. Ali's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the Rockefeller Institute had offered a large sum of money to obtain his stomach post-mortem. After he died in England, his body was offered to Johns Hopkins University for study, though the offer was declined.|$|E
5|$|In the Life of Probus, {{the author}} 'Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse' {{states that the}} Emperor's {{descendants}} (posteri) fled from Rome and settled near Verona. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus (supposedly writing under Constantine) says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This {{is one of the}} strongest indications of the History's late 4th-century date, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to be a fairly transparent allusion to the rich and powerful senator Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395. Petronius Probus was born in Verona.|$|E

5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
5|$|Amazing {{began as}} a bedsheet format {{magazine}} and remained so until October 1933, when it switched to pulp size. With the April–May 1953 issue Amazing became a digest. Seven issues in the early 1980s, from November 1980 to November 1981, were a half-inch taller than the regular digest size, but thereafter the magazine reverted to the standard digest format. In May 1991 the magazine returned to a large format, but this lasted only until the Winter 1994 issue, and the next three issues were digest-sized again. When the magazine reappeared in 1998, it was in bedsheet format and remained that size until the very end. The last issue, March 2005, was distributed only as a PDF download, never as a physical magazine. The volume numbering contained some irregularities: the numbering given in the tables above {{appears to be in}} error for the period from 1979 to 1983, but in fact it is given correctly in the table. Note also that vol. 27 no. 8 was a single issue, not two, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to be from the table; it was dated Dec 1953/Jan 1954.|$|E
5|$|The Path of the King {{picks up}} with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim {{on the way}} to Minas Tirith. Before arriving, however, the three companions must walk the Paths of the Dead in an effort to {{convince}} the Army of the Dead to join their cause in the War of the Ring. To do so, they must defeat the King of the Dead (Jarion Monroe) in combat. After this, the Paths of the Dead start to collapse, and they must escape before the falling rubble crushes them. With the Army of the Dead pledged to aid them, they travel to Minas Tirith and enter the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Joining the Rohirrim and the soldiers of Minas Tirith, they face orcs, Easterlings, Haradrim and oliphaunts. They must also defend Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Éowyn (Lorri Holt), allowing Éowyn the opportunity to defeat the Witch-king of Angmar. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> they are about to be overwhelmed, the Army of Dead arrive, destroying the forces of Mordor and saving Minas Tirith.|$|E
60|$|This {{was added}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> involuntarily, {{and with a}} deep sigh.|$|R
60|$|The {{footsteps}} were incessant, and the hurry of them {{became more}} and more rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed,</b> under the windows; some, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed,</b> in the room; some coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in the distant streets, and not one within sight.|$|R

25|$|The {{class is}} going to the weather station to learn about weather. However, on the way there the bus turns into a hot air balloon. Eventually they find {{themselves}} inside a hurricane. Ms Frizzle's radio proves an annoyance to Arnold in this book, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to know his name.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{multiple}} handle arrangements is {{depending on the}} bit, control is easier with different configurations. For example, when shaping {{the edge of a}} fine table top, many users prefer a D handle, with variable speed, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to permit better control and burning the wood can be minimized.|$|E
60|$|The {{housekeeper}} {{answered in}} a curiously indirect manner--partly in jest, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed,</b> and partly in earnest.|$|R

25|$|Eunuchs were {{familiar}} {{figures in the}} Assyrian Empire (ca. 850 until 622 BC) and {{in the court of}} the Egyptian Pharaohs (down to the Lagid dynasty known as Ptolemies, ending with Cleopatra),(30 BC). Eunuchs sometimes were used as regents for underage heirs to the throne, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to be the case for the Neo-Hittite state of Carchemish.|$|E
25|$|Much {{research}} has been done on elucidating the phylogeny of the ground beetles and adjusting systematics and taxonomy accordingly. While no completely firm consensus exists, a few points are generally accepted: <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems,</b> the ground beetles consist of a number of more basal lineages and the extremely diverse Harpalinae which contain over half the described species and into which several formerly independent families had to be subsumed.|$|E
25|$|Viktoria {{leaves with}} her new band for the {{international}} song festival Intermusik in Germany, and begins {{to fall in love}} with her old friend. She falls ill during a yacht trip on the North Sea. A doctor present on board detects the reason, and advises her to stop singing immediately. Viktoria asks him to be silent and appears on the stage during the competition, where she wins. The last scene of the movie is ambiguous, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> she loses her voice completely after the competition, yet the final chord is the victory at the competition.|$|E
60|$|Even more intimately and confidentially she {{indicated}} Mr. Carmine, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> by a motion of her eyelash.|$|R

25|$|In the 1940s, {{newspaper}} journalist John Hix's syndicated comic Strange <b>as</b> <b>It</b> <b>Seems</b> {{published an}} interesting, but apocryphal, explanation for Charles Carroll's distinctive signature on the Declaration of Independence. Every {{member of the}} Continental Congress who signed this document automatically became a criminal, guilty of sedition against King George III. Carroll, because of his wealth, had more to lose than most of his companions. Some of the signators, such as Caesar Rodney and Button Gwinnett, had unusual and distinctive names which would clearly identify them to the King; other signators, with more commonplace names, might hope to sign the Declaration without incriminating themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} land {{grant to}} an entire class of people was not so unusual in the 1700s and 1800s <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> today. For example, Thomas Jefferson {{proposed}} a grant of 50 acres to any free man who didn't already have at least 50 acres in his draft of a revolutionary constitution for Virginia in 1776. More proximately, various Homestead Acts were passed 1862–1916, granting 160–640 acres (a quarter section to a full section), depending on the act, and earlier homesteading occurred under statutues such as the Preemption Act of 1841. Freedmen were not generally eligible for homesteading, {{because they were not}} citizens, which changed with the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, when they were granted citizenship.|$|E
25|$|Lydus understands Consivius as βουλαιον (consiliarius) {{owing to}} a {{conflation}} with Consus through Ops Consiva or Consivia. The interpretation of Consus as god of advice is already present in Latin authors and {{is due to}} a folk etymology supported by the story of the abduction of the Sabine women, (which happened {{on the day of the}} Consualia aestiva), said to have been advised by Consus. However no Latin source cites relationships of any kind between Consus and Janus Consivius. Moreover, both the passages that this etymology requires present difficulties, particularly <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> Consus cannot be etymologically related to adjective consivius or conseuius, found in Ops Consivia and thence the implied notion of sowing.|$|E

25|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{of having a}} judiciary that is seemingly too independent include possible abuse of power by judges. Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any checks and balances in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent. The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and interdependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.|$|E
25|$|The {{house of}} representatives can not only refuse, but they alone can propose the {{supplies}} requisite {{for the support of}} government. They in a word hold the purse; that powerful instrument by which we behold, {{in the history of the}} British constitution, an infant and humble representation of the people, gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance, and finally reducing, as far <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to have wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government. This power over the purse, may in fact be regarded as the most compleat and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.|$|E
25|$|The Polish–Soviet war likely {{happened}} more {{by accident}} than design, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> unlikely that anyone in Soviet Russia {{or in the}} new Second Republic of Poland would have deliberately planned a major foreign war. Poland, its territory a major battle-ground during the First World War, lacked political stability; it had won the difficult conflict with the West Ukrainian National Republic by July 1919 but had already become embroiled in new conflicts with Germany (the Silesian Uprisings of 1919 to 1921) and with Czechoslovakia (January 1919). Revolutionary Russia, meanwhile, focused on thwarting counter-revolution and the intervention by the Allied powers (1918 to 1925). While the first clashes between Polish and Soviet forces occurred in February 1919, it would take almost a year before both sides realized that they had become engaged in a full-scale war.|$|E
