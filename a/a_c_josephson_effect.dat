The population transfer is driven by a time-dependent shift of a barrier separating {{the left and right}} wells. Sharp and soft profiles of the barrier velocity are tested. Evolution of the relevant characteristics, involving phase differences and currents, is inspected. It is shown that the repulsive interaction substantially supports the transfer making it possible i) in a wide velocity interval and ii) three orders of magnitude faster than in the ideal BEC.

40|$|Mesoscopic charge pumping, a {{transport}} mechanism {{that relies on}} the explicit time-dependence of some properties of a nanoscale conductor, was envisaged theoretically a few decades ago(1 - 4). So far, nanoscale pumps have been realized only in systems exhibiting strong Coulombic effects(5 - 12), whereas evidence for pumping {{in the absence of}} Coulomb blockade has been elusive. A pioneering experiment by Switkes et al. (13) evidenced the difficulty of modulating in time the properties of an open mesoscopic conductor at cryogenic temperatures without generating undesired bias voltages due to stray capacitances(14, 15). One possible solution to this problem is to use the <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>Josephson</b> <b>effect</b> to induce periodically time-dependent Andreev reflection amplitudes in a hybrid normal-superconducting system(16). Here we report the experimental detection of charge flow in an unbiased InAs nanowire embedded in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). In this system, quantum pumping may occur via the cyclic modulation of the phase of the order parameter of different superconducting electrodes. The symmetry of the current with respect to the enclosed magnetic flux(17, 18) and bias SQUID current is a discriminating signature of pumping.

The significance of the obliqueness hypothesis is underlined {{and the importance of}} the “local fit ” method of extracting these parameters from the data is emphasized. Possible new physics implications are briefly touched upon. 1 1. Radiative/Precision Parameters The precision-testing of a renormalizable relativistic quantum field theory is intrinsically connected with the accurate calculation of radiative corrections in it. This connection has a long tradition [1] in QED. The basic point there is extremely simple at the 1 -loop-level. If one is measuring a quantity of order unity to the precision of the third decimal place, comparison with theory is meaningful only if there is a correct calculation taking all 0 (α) terms into account. For the electroweak processes, being studied on the Z mass-shell at LEP 1, the relevant couplings are semiweak. Since the accuracy in the LEP measurements has now reached the 10 − 3 level, the consideration [2] of 1 -loop corrections to the tree-level contributions is very pertinent. Of course, certain couplings, relevant to weak and electromagnetic processes, are known to an extraordinarily high accuracy. Specifically, we refer to two which form part of our reference frame: (1) the atomic fine structure constant αEM, as measured in the <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>Josephson</b> <b>effect,</b> namely [3] α − 1 EM = 137. 0359895 (61); (2) the Fermi constant Gµ, as measured in muon decay.

40|$|Femtosecond optical laser pulses {{have been}} {{comprehensively}} {{applied in the}} past to control the material properties of high critical temperature superconductors. However, since the superconducting gap is of the order of several millielectronvolts, optical photons have the potential to deplete the condensate by breaking Cooper-pairs. This thesis takes a novel direction as it reports on the non-dissipative control of the Josephson plasma in the layered cuprate superconductor La 1 : 84 Sr 0 : 16 CuO 4 using terahertz electromagnetic waves. To achieve sufficiently intense sub-millimetre radiation, two complementary experimental approaches are taken. First, the table-top tilted pulse front technique is employed as a source of microjoule broadband terahertz pulses. Second, a large-scale free electron laser is operated to achieve multi-cycle pulses of less than two percent relative bandwidth. Using the tilted pulse front technique, out-of-plane superconducting transport in La 1 : 84 Sr 0 : 16 CuO 4 is gated bi-directionally on ultrafast timescales. The applied electric field modulates the interlayer coupling, leading to picosecond oscillations between superconducting and resistive states. Thereby, the modulation frequency is determined by the electric field strength in spirit of the <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>Josephson</b> <b>effect.</b> Throughout the oscillations, in-plane properties remain unperturbed, revealing an exotic state in which the dimensionality of the superconductivity is time-dependent. Using a free electron laser, it is shown that resonant terahertz excitation of nonlinear Josephson plasma waves in La 1 : 84 Sr 0 : 16 CuO 4 creates a metastable state that is transparent over a narrow spectral region. This finding is interpreted as the result of disruptive quantum interference between the linear plasma modes of the cuprate and an optically injected Josephson vortex lattice, which features the periodicity of the driving field, giving rise to three-level quantum interference optical transparency. Both observations demonstrate the potential of layered superconductors for quantum nonlinear optics and are of relevance for applications in ultrafast nanoelectronics. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{counterflow}} transport {{in quantum}} Hall bilayers provided by superfluid excitons is locked at small input currents {{due to a}} complete leakage caused by the interlayer tunneling. We show that the counterflow critical current I_c^CF above which the system unlocks for the counterflow transport can be controlled by a tilt of magnetic field in the plane perpendicular to the current direction. The effect is asymmetric {{with respect to the}} tilting angle. The unlocking is accompanied by switching of the systems from the d. <b>c.</b> to the <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>Josephson</b> state. Similar switching takes place for the tunneling set-up when the current flowing through the system exceeds the critical value I_c^T. At zero tilt the relation between the tunnel and counterflow critical currents is I_c^T= 2 I_c^CF. We compare the influence of the in-plane magnetic field component B_∥ on the critical currents I_c^CF and I_c^T. The in-plane magnetic field reduces the tunnel critical current and this reduction is symmetric with respect to the tilting angle.
