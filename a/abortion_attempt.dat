Ron Hubbard wrote in Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health that <b>abortion</b> and <b>attempts</b> at <b>abortion</b> could cause trauma to the fetus and to the mother in both spiritual and physical ways. The St. Petersburg Times reported on how Hubbard's views from Dianetics affect Scientology practitioners, [...] "Abortion is therefore rare among Scientologists, recognizing that even the fetus may have already been occupied by a spiritual being. In some instances, abortion might be chosen of health concerns of the mother or other personal factors." [...] Hubbard asserted, [...] "It is a scientific fact that <b>abortion</b> <b>attempts</b> {{are the most important}} factor in aberration", and stated [...] "Attempted abortion is very common. ...

5000|$|Jessen's {{career as}} an activist began in 1991, when she was 14, after her adoptive mother, Dianna DePaul, told Jessen she was born to a 17-year-old girl, during a failed <b>abortion</b> <b>attempt.</b> Jessen has since campaigned against abortion, saying [...] "It's more {{comfortable}} for people to think of abortion as a political decision, or a right. But I am not a right. I am a human being". Jessen said she's forgiven her birth mother, but {{is not interested in}} a relationship with her, citing a strong relationship with her adoptive mother. Jessen has also campaigned against exceptions to late-term abortion laws, on the grounds of fetal disability, citing her own disability. Jessen appeared on the Maury Povich Show with her adoptive mother in 1991. In reporting her story and publicizing Jessen's early life to the nation, the New York Times observed that Jessen and Becky Bell, a teenage girl who reportedly {{died as a result of}} an unsafe abortion in 1988, had become the symbols of America's debate over abortion and characterized them as [...] "poster girls whose stories are being shrewdly marketed by their supporters to keep passions high." [...] Jessen is a stage name that was adopted when she began her activism.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring the psychotherapeutic work I have {{encountered}} profound {{issues related to}} the mother's lack of bounding with the fetus, prenatal abandonment, mother's rejection of the fetus, various forms of aggression (e. g., single or multiple <b>abortion</b> <b>attempts,</b> domestic violence), which led to prenatal traumas. For activation of such traumas I metaphorically reconstruct within the group therapy the context of prenatal life, using different forms of experiential “provocative” exercises. The person gets in contact with emotions from the prenatal period such us fear, angry or very deep sadness. These emotions were always related with mother's lack of bounding with the fetus in different forms or even to the unknown situations that were perceived as dangerous for the fetus's life...|$|R
40|$|Premarital {{pregnancy}} {{is a highly}} stigmatized phenomenon and may possibly be traumatic as well. However, there are {{adolescents and young adults}} who continue to commit premarital sex. The high likelihood of unwanted pregnancy will remain a serious concern in the Malaysian society which could lead to further psychosocial problems such as baby dumping, mental health problems, and health concerns among others. Despite experiencing the trauma and stigma of being pregnant and unmarried, there are teenagers and young women who decide to carry on with the pregnancy. This research seeks to examine the experiences of unmarried teenagers and young women who choose to continue their pregnancy while seeking protection in women’s shelters. The highlight of this paper is the profile of young mothers who sought protection in five women shelters throughout the country. The findings suggest disturbing information regarding sexual experience of young girls such as the early age of first sexual encounter, <b>abortion</b> <b>attempt,</b> the usage (non-usage) of contraception and the influence of the social circle environment...|$|E
40|$|The Moebius {{syndrome}} {{consists of}} a congenital disorder characterized by lesion of the facial and abducens nerves associated with limb malformations. Although the genetic aetiology is the most accepted, environmental causes have been proposed because of {{the increasing number of}} cases {{associated with the use of}} misoprostol during pregnancy. Misoprostol is the active drug of cytotec®, a drug initially used for the treatment of peptic ulcer that acts increasing uterine contractility when used during pregnancy. The objective of this study was to identify the patients with Moebius syndrome whose mothers referred to attempt abortion by using misoprostol. Fifteen mothers of children with Moebius syndrome were inquired about <b>abortion</b> <b>attempt</b> during the pregnancy and, if positive, the method applied. A total of 66. 7 % of the mothers referred the attempt. All reported the use of Cytotec® and the combined route (oral and vaginal) was the preferred method (70 %) with the use of one to four tablets in most cases (90 %). All the attempts were done in the first trimester of pregnancy, being most of them (70 %) between the fifth and eight gestation weeks. Our findings reveal the high prevalence of Cytotec® use in abortion attempts by mothers of children with Moebius syndrome...|$|E
40|$|The {{historical}} {{development of the}} criminal law with respect to abortion is interesting {{not only because of}} its intimate connection with religious ideology and medical science: it also illustrates the interest which the criminal law has long had in exercising some control over the circumstances of human reproduction. The close relationship which the practice of abortion and infanticide share is also important to understand if one is interested {{in the nature of the}} involvement of the criminal law in human reproduction. All of these issues essentially came together in Lord Ellenborough 2 ̆ 7 s Act, 1803 as abortion at any stage of pregnancy became a statutory felony, although the ecclesiastically inspired distinction of quickening was retained to demarcate the graver offence. The Act also effected a change in the law concerning concealment of illegitimate birth by repealing an old and very punitive statute of 1623. The intention herein is to examine the state of the common law with respect to abortion before and after quickening, and the related issues of infant and maternal death resulting from the <b>abortion</b> <b>attempt,</b> with a view to understanding the basis of Lord Ellenborough 2 ̆ 7 s Act and the profound change in the law which it wrought...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused {{in some aspects}} of {{maternal}} exposure to misoprostol during perinatal period, and the abortive and teratogenesis effects on the fetus. The causes of malformations were revised, taking into account chemical, physical and environmental factors {{as well as the}} interaction between them. There are evidences that the practice of abortion tripled in Southern and Northeastern Brazil in 15 years, {{and one of the most}} frequent forms of abortion is through the use of misoprostol. In Brazil, 1991, 288, 700 women were hospitalized as a consequence of complications induced by <b>abortion</b> <b>attempt</b> with this medicine.

Among the more severe problems affecting the non-aborted child is the injury on the central nervous system, which frequently results in the Moebius syndrome. This is a congenital and non-progressive paralysis of the VI and VII cranial nerves, frequently bilateral, which produces a unexpressive facial appearance and convergent Strabismus.

40|$|Purpose: To {{review the}} {{association}} of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in individuals manifesting thalidomide embry-opathy and Möbius sequence and compare them with three new studies in which ASD was also associated with ocular and systemic malformations: (1) a Swedish study of individuals with CHARGE association (Coloboma, Heart, choanal Atresia, developmental or growth Retardation, Genital anomaly, and Ear involvement); (2) a Swedish study of Goldenhar syndrome; and (3) Brazilian Möbius syndrome (sequence) study. Methods: In the Swedish CHARGE study, 31 patients met the inclusion criteria (3 + or 4 of the common characteristics of the CHARGE syndrome). The same team of investigators also evaluated 20 Swedish patients with Goldenhar syndrome. In the Brazilian Möbius study, 28 children with a diagnosis of Möbius sequence were studied; some children {{had a history of}} exposure during their mother’s pregnancy to the abortifacient drug misoprostol in an unsuccessful <b>abortion</b> <b>attempt</b> Results: In the CHARGE study, five patients had the more severe autism disorder and five had autistic-like condition. In the Goldenhar study, two had autism disorder and one had autistic-like condition. In the Brazilian Möbius study, the systemic findings of the misoprostol-exposed and misoprostol-unexposed patients were almost undistinguishable, and ASD was present in both groups (autism disorder in five and autistic-like condition in three). Conclusion: Autism spectrum disorder has been reported in two conditions with known early pregnancy exposure to the teratogenic agents thalidomide and misoprostol. In the Brazilian Möbius study, autism also occurred in both the miso-prostol-exposed and misoprostol-unexposed groups. Autism also was present in patients with both CHARGE associa-tion and Goldenhar syndrome. Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc 2004; 102 : 107 - 12...|$|E

Este trabalho enfoca aspectos relativos à exposição ao misoprostol no período perinatal como abortificante e agente teratogênico, assim como as causas das malformações, considerando-se fatores químicos, físicos e ambientais. A prática do aborto triplicou nas regiões Sul e Nordeste em 15 anos, sendo que entre os métodos mais freqüentes está o uso do medicamento com o princípio ativo do misoprostol. Em 1991 no Brasil, 288. 700 mulheres foram socorridas em hospitais devido a complicações por indução de aborto com este medicamento. Isso resultou na proibição do misoprostol em todo país por determinação da portaria 344 / 98 do Ministério da Saúde, que exige um controle especial, onde sua utilização é permitida apenas em hospitais e com supervisão da vigilância sanitária municipal. Um dos problemas mais graves que a criança não abortada apresenta é uma injúria em seu sistema nervoso central desenvolvendo a Síndrome de Moebius. Esta é uma paralisia congênita e não progressiva do VI e do VII nervos cranianos, freqüentemente bilateral, que produz uma aparência facial pouco expressiva e estrabismo divergente. Neste sentido, mesmo sendo proibido em nosso país, o aborto induzido por misoprostol é praticado ilegalmente e sem uma verdadeira instrução da paciente sobre os efeitos teratogênicos do mesmo para ela e para seu bebê...|$|E
