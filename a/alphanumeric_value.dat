40|$|The {{solution}} {{of the problem of}} modelling and quantitative assessment of flight safety risk is being considered in this paper. The article considers the main groups of mathematical models used to quantify the risks of flight safety, which can be used by providers of aviation services. The authors demonstrate and discuss risk modeling possibilities in the field of flight safety on the basis of Bayesian belief networks. In this paper a mathematical model is built on the basis of identified hazards, and this model allows to determine the level of risk for each hazard and the consequences of their occurrence using Bayesian belief networks, consisting of marginal probability distributions graph and conditional probability tables. This mathematical model allows to determine the following, based on the data on adverse events and hazard identification: the probability of various adverse events in all dangers occurrence, the risk level for each of the identified hazards, the most likely consequences of the given danger oc- currence. For risk modeling in the field of flight safety on the basis of Bayesian belief networks there were used supple- mentary Bayes Net Toolbox for MATLAB with open source. To determine the level of risk in the form specified in ICAO Doc 9859 "Flight Safety Management Manual" of the International Civil Aviation Organization, the authors wrote a func- tion to MATLAB, allowing each pair of probability - to set severity level in line with <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>value</b> and significance of the risk category. Risk model in the field of flight safety on the basis of Bayesian belief networks corresponds to the definition of risk by Kaplan and Garrick. The advantage of the developed risk assessment method over other methods is shown in the paper...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{graph-based}} knowledge discovery algo-rithms do {{not consider}} numeric attributes (they are dis-carded in the preprocessing step, or they are treated as <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>values</b> with an exact matching criterion), with the limitation to work with domains {{that do not have}} this type of attribute or finding patterns without numeric attributes. In this work, we propose a new ap-proach for the numerical attributes handling for graph-based learning algorithms. Our approach shows how graph-based learning approaches increase their accu-racy for the classification task and its descriptive power when they are able to use both nominal and numeri-cal attributes.

40|$|The {{theme of}} our {{research}} is to provide security for the data that contains <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>values</b> during its transmission. The best known multiple letter encryption cipher is the play fair, which treats the plain text as single units and translates these units into cipher text. It is highly difficult to the intruder to understand or to decrypt the cipher text. In this we discussed about the existing play fair algorithm, its merits and demerits. The existing play fair algorithm {{is based on the}} use of a 5 X 5 matrix of letters constructed using a keyword. This algorithm can only allow the text that contains alphabets only. For this we have proposed an enhancement to the existing algorithm, that a 6 X 6 matrix can be constructed...|$|R

So this topic is interesting to the testing arena. To reach the goal a genetic algorithm (GA) tool is developed. A study was carried out to choose the best fitness function for string data input; resulting modified edit distance algorithm {{was used as a}} fitness function. Firstly, string and <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>values</b> with different lengths were passed through the GA tool and evaluated the result. Then three EFSM models were designed and deployed to the GA tool where most of cases the whole path is passed. This work was limited to string equality and there is a scope to work with string ordering in future...|$|R

40|$|A {{database}} management system is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, and manipulating databases for various applications. The main characteristic of the ‘database approach’ is that it increases the value of data by its emphasis on data independence. DBMSs, and in particular those based on the relational data model, have been very successful at the management of administrative data in the business domain. This thesis has investigated data management in multimedia digital libraries, and its implications {{on the design of}} {{database management}} systems. The main problem of multimedia data management is providing access to the stored objects. The content structure of administrative data is easily represented in <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>values.</b> Thus, database technology has primarily focused on handling the objects’ logical structure. In the case of multimedia data, representation of content is far from trivial though, and not supported by current {{database management system}}s...|$|R
40|$|A {{relational}} database often yields a large set of tuples {{as the result}} of a query. Users browse this result set to find the information they require. If the result set is large, there may be many pages of data to browse. Since results comprise tuples of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>values</b> that have few visual markers, it is hard to browse the data quickly, even if it is sorted. In this paper, we describe the design of a system for browsing relational data by scrolling through it at a high speed. Rather than showing the user a fast-changing blur, the system presents the user with a small number of representative tuples. Representative tuples are selected to provide a “good impression ” of the query result. We show that the information loss to the user is limited, even at high scrolling speeds, and that our algorithms can pick good representatives fast enough to provide for real-time, high-speed scrolling over large datasets...|$|R

In graphic design and image editing, users {{typically}} choose colors via an interface with a visual representation of a color - organized with quasi-perceptually-relevant hue, lightness, and saturation dimensions (HLS) - instead of keying in <b>alphanumeric</b> text <b>values.</b> Because color appearance depends on comparison of neighboring colors (see color vision), many interfaces attempt to clarify the relationships between colors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Discovering {{interesting}} patterns from structural domains is {{an important}} task in many real world domains. In recent years, graph-based approaches have demonstrated to be a straight forward tool to mine structural data. However, not all graph-based knowledge discovery algorithms deal with numerical attributes in the same way. Some of the algorithms discard the numeric attributes during the preprocessing step. Some others treat them as <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>values</b> with an exact matching criterion, with the limitation to work with domains {{that do not have}} this type of attribute or discovering patterns without interesting numerical generalizations. Other algorithms work with numerical attributes with some limitations. In this work, we propose a new approach for the numerical attributes handling for graphbased learning algorithms. Our experimental results show how graph-based learning benefits from numerical values handling by increasing accuracy for the classification task and descriptive power of the patterns found (being able to process both nominal and numerical attributes). This new approach was tested with the Subdue system in the Mutagenesis and PTC (The Predictive Toxicology Challenge) domains showing an accuracy increase around 22 % compared to Subdue when it does not use our numerical attributes handling method. Our results are also superior to those reported by other authors, around 7 % for the Mutagenesis domain and around 17 % for the PTC domain...|$|R

The purpose of the project is to minimize the social and landscape impact caused by this motorized traffic. The installation is formed by a system of IP cameras to capture and transmit the different accesses, which will be analyzed and stored by a registration plate reading system and resulting data management. The reading system {{is based on a}} computer vision system known as ALPR or ANPR (Automatic Number/License Plate Recognition). This is a method that uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) in image recognition to read license plates and extract their <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>values</b> and detect its existence and position. On the other hand, a database and web interface are created for the management and interaction of the information generated. The features offered are the following: add authorized vehicles, add periods of days when access is restricted, handle license plate reading errors, generate PDF to the sanction process and lastly show access statistics. Finally, readings have been validated in different tests conducted throughout the project and an usability analysis has also been made to adapt the design to the client’s needs...|$|R
40|$|A digital {{equivalent}} dat{{a system}} (DEDS) {{is a system}} for identifying objects {{by means of the}} x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra of labeling elements that are encased in or deposited on the objects. As such, a DEDS is a revolutionary new major subsystem of an XRF system. A DEDS embodies the means for converting the spectral data output of an XRF scanner to an ASCII alphanumeric or barcode label {{that can be used to}} identify (or verify the assumed or apparent identity of) an XRF-scanned object. A typical XRF spectrum of interest contains peaks at photon energies associated with specific elements on the Periodic Table (see figure). The height of each spectral peak above the local background spectral intensity is proportional to the relative abundance of the corresponding element. <b>Alphanumeric</b> <b>values</b> are assigned to the relative abundances of the elements. Hence, if an object contained labeling elements in suitably chosen proportions, an alphanumeric representation of the object could be extracted from its XRF spectrum. The mixture of labeling elements and for reading the XRF spectrum would be compatible with one of the labeling conventions now used for bar codes and binary matrix patterns (essentially, two-dimensional bar codes that resemble checkerboards). A further benefit of such compatibility is that it would enable the conversion of the XRF spectral output to a bar or matrix-coded label, if needed. In short, a process previously used only for material composition analysis has been reapplied to the world of identification. This new level of verification is now being used for "authentication. ...|$|R
40|$|Faceted {{browsing}} is {{a popular}} paradigm for end-user data access. It is, at present, the de-facto search interface for almost all e-commerce. A typical faceted interface has two main component panels: a query panel and a result panel. Faceted browsing is primarily designed to help users quickly get to a specific item if they know the characteristics they are looking for. However, limitations in the query and the result panel deter effective faceted browsing, especially for users unfamiliar with the data. In this dissertation, we highlight two such limitations, one each in the query and the result panel. We propose add-on extensions to address each of these limitations. In a faceted interface, users progressively select a sequence of facet values {{to get to their}} desired result set, which is called an exploration path. If the dataset is high-dimensional, the query panel can only show a few of those dimensions as queriable facets. Users cannot see in the query panel the overall space of available exploration paths, and thus end up choosing an inferior exploration path. Many users have difficulty in selecting or understanding an exploration path when there are many non-queriable facets and the query panel has very limited information of interaction between facets. We address this limitation by showing users an integrated summary of facet interaction that summarizes their chosen exploration path, and by presenting a two-phased faceted interface that provides users a facetwise way to compare the available exploration paths. The result panel that is normally used for presenting relational tuples, including faceted interface, cannot support fast browsing. When a user scrolls fast through data having <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>values,</b> then everything seems like a fast changing blur. To help the user get a quick sense of data, we propose a novel variable-speed scrolling interface, which provides the user a good impression of the data through selected representative tuples that are chosen based on the user’s scrolling speed and browsing history...|$|R
