5|$|Both sexes drum, {{although}} the male does {{so much more}} often, mostly from mid-January until the young are fledged. The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16strikes per second, typically in one-second bursts, although repeated frequently. <b>As</b> <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> early twentieth century {{it was thought that}} the drumming might be a vocalisation, and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.|$|E
5|$|Funerary {{activity}} continued <b>as</b> <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Postclassic (c. 900-1525).

5|$|Gerhard Heilmann {{discussed}} Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis at considerable {{length in}} his 1926 book The Origin of Birds. Heilmann examined hatchlings {{of many other}} bird species, both closely related to those studied by Beebe and belonging to more primitive species, in hope of finding additional evidence for the leg-wings which Beebe had documented. After failing to find such evidence, Heilmann ultimately rejected Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis, and this remained the consensus among ornithologists {{for the next several}} decades. Beebe, however, continued to advance his Tetrapteryx hypothesis <b>as</b> <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 1940s.|$|E

5|$|In 1627 Barbary Pirates {{from the}} Republic of Salé {{occupied}} Lundy for five years. The North African invaders, {{under the command}} of Dutch renegade Jan Janszoon, flew an Ottoman flag over the island. Some captured Europeans were held on Lundy before being sent to Algiers as slaves. From 1628 to 1634 the island was plagued by pirate ships of French, Basque, English and Spanish origin. These incursions were eventually ended by Sir John Penington, but in the 1660s and <b>as</b> <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 1700s the island still fell prey to French privateers.|$|E
5|$|In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle {{suggested}} that nature abhors a vacuum, a principle that {{became known as}} the horror vacui. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the West it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty. <b>As</b> <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.|$|E

5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords <b>as</b> <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ninth century.

Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. A weaker state also might ask or pay {{for the protection of}} a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.|$|E

5|$|The {{actions of}} Yarim-Lim I and his {{alliance}} with Babylon proved vital for the kingdom's economy, for they secured the trade between Mesopotamia and northern Syria, {{with the king}} of Mari protecting the caravans crossing from the Persian Gulf to Anatolia.
