2500|$|On 15 November 2001, Boeing {{successfully}} completed an initial flight demonstration of F/A-18F [...] "F-1" [...] fitted with the ALQ-99 electronic warfare system {{to serve as}} the EA-18 <b>Airborne</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Attack</b> (AEA) concept aircraft. [...] In December 2003, the US Navy awarded a development contract for the EA-18G to Boeing. As primary contractor, Boeing was to construct the forward fuselage, wings and perform the final assembly. Northrop Grumman was the principal airframe subcontractor and they would supply the center and aft fuselage as well as the principal electronic combat system. In 2003, the Navy expected to receive 90 EA-18Gs.|$|E
2500|$|The Growler {{has more}} than 90% {{in common with the}} {{standard}} Super Hornet, sharing airframe, Raytheon AN/APG-79 AESA radar and weapon systems such as the AN/AYK-22 stores management system. Most of the dedicated <b>airborne</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>attack</b> equipment is mounted in the space that used to house the internal 20mm cannon and on the wingtips. Nine weapons stations remain free to provide for additional weapons or jamming pods. [...] The added electronics include AN/ALQ-218 wideband receivers on the wingtips and ALQ-99 high and low-band tactical jamming pods. The ALQ-218 combined with the ALQ-99 form a full spectrum electronic warfare suite that is able to provide detection and jamming against all known surface-to-air threats.

50|$|In January 2016, after a year-and-a-half of {{training}} and inspections, the Star Warriors made their first operational Growler deployment. VAQ-209 filled the Pacific Command requirement, allowing an active squadron to return home as scheduled. The deployment began in Guam, where the squadron participated in an AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) live-fire exercise with U.S. Air Force units, honed their <b>airborne</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>attack</b> skills, and participated in Exercise Cope North, a combined exercise designed to increase interoperability among U.S. and coalition air forces operating in the Pacific Theater. In February, the squadron left the beaches of Guam for the snow of Misawa Air Base in northern Japan. While in Misawa, the Star Warriors integrated with the U.S. Air Force’s 35th Fighter Wing and the Navy’s Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 5 to further the joint collaboration that began on Guam. In March, the squadron detached to Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea (ROK), {{to participate in a}} maritime counter special operations forces exercise with Air Force and Navy units from the ROK, along with the U.S. Air Force and Navy units. In addition to gaining exposure to real-world flying conditions on the Korean peninsula, VAQ-209 was able to plan and integrate with USS John C. Stennis (CVN) 74 Carrier Strike Group and its embarked CVW-9, which were on patrol in the Western Pacific. The squadron returned home safely to their families and most Selective Reservists to their civilian careers in early April.|$|E

In 2002, the Department of Defense (DOD) completed an analysis of alternatives for the EA- 6 B that concluded the inventory would be insufficient to meet the DOD's needs beyond 2009. Since then, the services have embarked on separate acquisition efforts to develop <b>airborne</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>attack</b> assets. In 2003, the Navy started development of the EA- 18 G aircraft to replace the EA- 6 B. This report was done under the Comptroller General's authority and assesses if (1) DOD's 2002 conclusion that the EA- 6 B inventory would be insufficient beyond 2009 remains valid for assessing the Navy's future needs, and (2) the acquisition approach used to develop the EA- 18 G is knowledge-based and might mitigate future risks. ...|$|E

DOD analyses dating back a decade have identified capability gaps and provided a basis for service investments, but budget realities and lessons learned from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have driven changes in strategic direction and program content. Most notably, DOD canceled some acquisitions, after which the services revised their operating concepts for <b>airborne</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>attack.</b> These decisions saved money, allowing DOD to fund other priorities, but reduced the planned level of synergy among systems during operations. As acquisition plans have evolved, capability limitations and sustainment challenges facing existing systems have grown, prompting the department to invest in system improvements to mitigate shortfalls. ...|$|E
