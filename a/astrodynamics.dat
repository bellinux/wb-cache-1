5|$|Flights from Earth {{to other}} planets in the Solar System {{have a high}} energy cost. It {{requires}} almost {{the same amount of}} energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. In <b>astrodynamics,</b> this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta-v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an Earth orbit requires a delta-v of about 9km/s, compared to the 9.0–9.5km/s to reach a low Earth orbit from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys (such as by Earth or Venus) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement (i.e. the fuel) at launch, at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory. Ion thrusters capable of a delta-v of more than 10 kilometers/s were used on the Dawn spacecraft. This is more than enough delta-v to do a Jupiter fly-by mission from a solar orbit of the same radius as that of Earth without gravity assist.|$|E
25|$|<b>Astrodynamics</b> is {{the study}} of {{spacecraft}} trajectories, particularly as they relate to gravitational and propulsion effects. <b>Astrodynamics</b> allows for a spacecraft to arrive at its destination at the correct time without excessive propellant use.

25|$|A spaceflight {{typically}} {{begins with}} a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome {{the force of gravity}} and propels the spacecraft {{from the surface of the}} Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called <b>astrodynamics.</b> Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.|$|E
25|$|Orbital {{mechanics}} or <b>astrodynamics</b> is {{the application}} of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft. The motion of these objects is usually calculated from Newton's laws of motion and Newton's law of universal gravitation. It is a core discipline within space mission design and control. Celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems {{under the influence of}} gravity, including spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems, planets, moons, and comets. Orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories, including orbital maneuvers, orbit plane changes, and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers. General relativity is a more exact theory than Newton's laws for calculating orbits, and is sometimes necessary for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations (such as orbits close to the Sun).|$|E

2500|$|Standard {{assumptions}} in <b>astrodynamics</b> include non-interference {{from outside}} bodies, negligible mass {{for one of}} the bodies, and negligible other forces (such as from the solar wind, atmospheric drag, etc.).

2500|$|While away in Roswell, Goddard {{was still}} {{head of the}} physics {{department}} at Clark University, and Clark deserves credit for allowing him to devote {{most of his time}} to rocket research. Likewise the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) permitted astronomer Samuel Herrick to pursue research in space vehicle guidance and control, and shortly after the war to teach courses in spacecraft guidance and orbit determination. Herrick began corresponding with Goddard in 1931 and asked if he should work in this new field, which he named <b>astrodynamics.</b> Herrick said that Goddard had the vision to advise and encourage him in his use of celestial mechanics [...] "to anticipate the basic problem of space navigation." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{the degree}} that the {{standard}} assumptions of <b>astrodynamics</b> do not hold, actual trajectories will vary from those calculated. [...] For example, simple atmospheric drag is another complicating factor for objects in low Earth orbit. [...] These rules of thumb are decidedly inaccurate when describing two or more bodies of similar mass, such as a binary star system (see n-body problem). Celestial mechanics uses more general rules applicable to {{a wider variety of}} situations. Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which can be mathematically derived from Newton's laws, hold strictly only in describing the motion of two gravitating bodies in the absence of non-gravitational forces; they also describe parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories. In the close proximity of large objects like stars the differences between classical mechanics and general relativity also become important.|$|E
