2500|$|The {{economic}} situation in Denmark {{was one of}} high unemployment and poor housing, especially in Copenhagen. In the 1970s, the Copenhagen City Council, led by a social democratic mayor, Egon Weidekamp, had begun a process of rehousing for {{people living in the}} poor areas of Copenhagen. The process involved the demolition of large parts of the old boroughs surrounding the city center. Although the intent was to raise the standard of living for working-class people, the consequence was that the new houses often became too expensive for those very people to live in. Many found themselves temporarily relocated to elsewhere in the city, and when they wanted to return to their old homes, they found the rent to be too high for them to pay. [...] This gave rise to a growing anger towards the city council and a feeling amongst the poor people of Copenhagen that decisions concerning their lives were being made without them having <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The city's plans also left many old and worn, but still useful, buildings empty. [...] At the same time, {{a lot of young people}} were unemployed and without homes. All these factors opened the door to widespread squatting.|$|E

But this boat of his, with two hands left in her, {{immediately}} put off again when the men were out of her, and kept off, some yards from the shore. As she floated there, with the two hands gently backing water to keep her from going down the stream, this pretty little arbour attracted many eyes. None of the boat's crew, however, had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> except that it was the captain's fancy.|$|E

[...] To this proposition Mary perhaps agreed in her own mind but she gave no spoken assent. [...] "Now this young man that is wanting to marry you has got all these things, and as far as I can judge with my experience in the world, is as likely to make a good husband as any one I know."

50|$|In The Human Stain by Philip Roth, {{the narrator}} attends a {{rehearsal}} at Tanglewood at which Bronfman performs. The following description is offered (pages 209-10):Then Bronfman appears. Bronfman the brontosaur! Mr. Fortissimo. Enter Bronfman to play Prokofiev {{at such a}} pace and with such bravado as to knock my morbidity clear out of the ring. He is conspicuously massive through the upper torso, {{a force of nature}} camouflaged in a sweatshirt, somebody who has strolled into the Music Shed out of a circus where is the strongman and who takes on the piano as a ridiculous challenge to the gargantuan strength he revels in. Yefim Bronfman looks less like the person who is going to play the piano than like the guy who should be moving it. I had never before seen anybody go at a piano like this sturdy little barrel of an unshaven Russian Jew. When he's finished, I thought, they'll have to throw the thing out. He crushes it. He doesn't let that piano conceal a thing. Whatever's in there is going to come out, and come out with its hands in the air. And when it does, everything there out in the open, the last of the last pulsation, he himself gets up and goes, leaving behind him our redemption. With a jaunty wave, he is suddenly gone, and though he takes all his fire off with him like no less a force than Prometheus, our own lives now seem inextinguishable. Nobody is dying, nobody - not if Bronfman has <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

40|$|Crowd-sourced or crowd-curated art shows, the {{relatively}} new and unusual approaches to museum exhibitions in {{which members of}} the public assume the role of the art professionals usually behind big shows, may seem to be the next big thing. But they are not about to steal the spotlight from the more traditional exhibitions, at least not if the museums have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> When they do happen—and they have been mounted at museums large and small, from Fresno to Brooklyn and many places in between—they seem to represent less of a fundamental change in a museum’s vision than simply an opportunity to experiment. Museums are responding to a cultural and economic shift that asks them to become centers of community engagement and entertain as well as to educate the public. Crowd-based projects represent the latest effort by some museums to define themselves as either a temple for the preservation of art or a forum for public opinion. Crowd-sourcing and crowd-curation appear to be two of the currently favored solutions to threats against museums ’ sustainability and relevancy. Glenn Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art, told the New York Times in 2009 that “museums had to shed the idea of being a repository and become social spaces. ” Th...|$|E
