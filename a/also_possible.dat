Commentators may have confused the philosopher with an athletic trainer, Pythagoras of Samos, but it is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> the trainer and the philosopher were the same person.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{polynomial}} time algorithm is known for this problem, more efficient algorithms than the brute-force search are known. For instance, the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm {{can be used to}} list all maximal cliques in worst-case optimal time, and it is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to list them in {{polynomial time}} per clique.|$|E
5|$|Bronze Age barrows at Selworthy Beacon and an Iron Age {{enclosure}} at Furzebury Brake, west of {{the town}} show evidence of prehistoric occupation of the area, although there is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> evidence in the intertidal area, where {{the remains of a}} submerged forest still exist.|$|E

5|$|Burney was {{reluctant}} to publish the study {{for fear of being}} labeled a cryptozoologist, but eventually published the results in American Anthropologist. Burney concluded that while the villagers had possibly encountered a Malagasy hippopotamus, it was <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that the stories were inaccuratea combination of misidentified animals, old folk traditions, and information the villagers had gathered from modern paleontology.|$|E
5|$|Constructions of graphs {{with large}} values of {{chromatic}} number and girth, not just odd girth, are <b>also</b> <b>possible,</b> but more complicated (see Girth and graph coloring).|$|E
5|$|Eye {{problems}} are <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> in some Labradors, particularly progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, corneal dystrophy and retinal dysplasia. Dogs which {{are intended to}} be bred should be examined by a veterinary ophthalmologist for an eye score.|$|E

5|$|Initially making only {{tentative}} forays onto land, tetrapods {{adapted to}} terrestrial environments {{over time and}} spent longer periods away from the water. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that the adults started {{to spend some time}} on land (as the skeletal modifications in early tetrapods such as Ichthyostega suggests) to bask in the sun close to the water's edge, while otherwise being mostly aquatic.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> for erectile {{dysfunction}} to exist {{not as a}} direct result of SCI but due to factors such as major depression, diabetes, or drugs such as those taken for spasticity. Finding and treating the root cause may alleviate the problem. For example, men who experience erectile problems as the result of a testosterone deficiency can receive androgen replacement therapy.|$|E

50|$|It is <b>also</b> quite <b>possible</b> {{for the two}} {{different}} davae to be just homonyms.|$|R
5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> {{to check}} whether a given {{directed}} graph is a DAG in linear time, either {{by attempting to}} find a topological ordering and then testing for each edge whether the resulting ordering is valid or alternatively, for some topological sorting algorithms, by verifying that the algorithm successfully orders all the vertices without meeting an error condition.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> {{to climb}} Ben Nevis from the Nevis Gorge car park at Steal {{at the head}} of the road up Glen Nevis, either by the {{south-east}} ridge or via the summit of Càrn Dearg (south-west). These routes require mild scrambling, are shorter and steeper than the Pony Track, and tend only to be used by experienced hill walkers.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> {{to explain}} why zero is even without {{referring}} to formal definitions. The following explanations {{make sense of the}} idea that zero is even in terms of fundamental number concepts. From this foundation, one can provide a rationale for the definition itself—and its applicability to zero.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to walk or {{cycle to}} the arena from central Malmö via Kroksbäck and Kroksbäcksparken. An area {{reserved}} for the parking of up to 1,000 bicycles {{is located on the}} eastern side of the arena. There are areas for charter buses as well as taxis beside the arena's main and side entrances.|$|E
5|$|Just {{as it is}} {{possible}} for a circle to be surrounded by six congruent circles that touch it, it is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to arrange seven congruent Reuleaux triangles so that they all make contact with a central Reuleaux triangle of the same size. This is the maximum number possible for any curve of constant width.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, William {{continued}} his advancement in the kingdom. In 1169 he visited Rome, possibly to answer accusations made against him by Archbishop Frederick, although if so, {{the charge is}} unknown. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that while Frederick was away on a diplomatic mission in Europe, a problem within the diocese forced William to seek the archbishop's assistance.|$|E

5|$|Their nearest analogies are {{the circles}} found on Dartmoor and Exmoor to the west, and the Stanton Drew stone circles to the north. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that the stone circles {{were linked to}} a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period.|$|E
