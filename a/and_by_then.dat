5|$|The castle was {{probably}} {{constructed in the}} 12th century but fell out of use soon after. It is first mentioned in 1360 <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> it was lying derelict. The small number of finds retrieved during archaeological investigation of the site indicates that Buckton Castle {{may not have been}} completed.|$|E
5|$|Although Ethel made {{a return}} visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America {{after his arrival}} in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British {{government}} indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> he felt too old to make the journey. The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30, Egyptian forces {{captured}} Fort Lahtzanit, {{the first}} fortification of the Bar Lev Line to fall, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> the infantry had been reinforced with 82mm B-10 and 107mm B-11 rifles. At the same time, engineers began operating their water pumps against the sand wall, opening the first passage {{in less than}} an hour, and the Egyptians moved up their bridging units to the canal. By 16:30 eight waves had brought across the canal ten infantry brigades in all five bridgeheads, totaling 23,500 men (around 4,700 at each bridgehead). Each bridgehead was on average six kilometers (3¾ mi) wide and around two kilometers deep. The Egyptians had high-velocity 85mm and 100mm rifled anti-tank guns in action on the east bank by that time.|$|E

5|$|In April 637, the Arabs, {{after a long}} siege {{captured}} Jerusalem, {{which was}} surrendered by Patriarch Sophronius. In the summer of 637, the Muslims conquered Gaza, and, during the same period, the Byzantine authorities in Egypt and Mesopotamia purchased an expensive truce, which lasted three years for Egypt and one year for Mesopotamia. Antioch fell to the Muslim armies in late 637, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> the Muslims occupied the whole of northern Syria, except for upper Mesopotamia, which they granted a one-year truce.|$|E
5|$|In Week 3, Vick {{was brought}} into action against the St. Louis Rams when Ben Roethlisberger {{sustained}} a knee injury that sidelined him for 4–6 weeks. Vick played decently in that stretch, going 40–66 with 2 TDs and 1 INT, while also rushing for 104 yards on 15 carries (his other five carries were kneel downs). Vick suffered a hamstring injury in a win against the Arizona Cardinals, being replaced by Landry Jones, which led to him missing six games, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> Roethlisberger was healthy enough to play. Despite continual injuries to Roethlisberger and the team not signing another quarterback throughout the season, Vick would be inactive {{the remainder of the}} season, leading some sports commentators to speculate that Vick's playing career may be over.|$|E
5|$|Over France, {{the losses}} became quite severe, {{particularly}} over {{the port of}} Brest, France. German defences were strong, owing to Operation Cerberus and Operation Donnerkeil, a joint Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe plan to enable the escape of Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen through the English Channel. Five Spitfires and a Mosquito were lost on PR operations in December 1941. The failure to photograph and pin-point {{the location of the}} ships, led to their successful move to Germany in February 1942. It was not until the day of the German operation that a Coastal Command aircraft caught sight of the ships, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> it was too late.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the First World War, {{sales of}} peat began to decline, as working horses were {{replaced}} by motor lorries and tractors. The British Moss Litter Company bought up two other companies who were extracting peat in Crowle Moor in 1935. Most peat was sold as bales, with 'fine' peat being used by gardeners and the growing of mushrooms and 'litter' being used for animal bedding, while 'tailings' were used for floor covering at show-jumping events and for bulking up feed for cows. Around one-fifth was not baled, and was used for various purposes, including the production of firelighters, for health cures at Harrogate baths, and the purifying of gas by gas companies, for which it was mixed with iron ore at Creyke's Siding. By the late 1940s, it was finding a new market as litter for battery hen houses, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> around 90 per cent was baled.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May, the Germans {{continued}} to attack Soviet {{positions in the}} north in localized offensives <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>then,</b> the Luftwaffe had gained air superiority over the Kharkov sector, forcing Timoshenko to move his own air assets forward in order to effectively counter the bolstered Luftflotte 4. The Luftwaffe won air superiority over their numerically superior, but technically inferior opponents. The air battles depleted the Soviet fighter strength, allowing the German strike aircraft the chance to influence the land battle even more. Nonetheless, the Soviet forces pushed on, disengaging from several minor battles and changing the direction of their thrusts. However, {{in the face of}} continued resistance and local counterattacks, the Soviet attack ebbed, especially when combined with the invariably heavy air raids. By the end of the day, the 28th Army could no longer conduct offensive operations against German positions.|$|E

5|$|Tchaikovsky {{remained}} friendly {{but never}} intimate {{with most of}} The Five, ambivalent about their music; their goals and aesthetics did not match his. He took pains to ensure his musical independence from {{them as well as}} from the conservative faction at the Conservatory—an outcome facilitated by his acceptance of a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory offered to him by Nikolai Rubinstein, Anton's brother. When Rimsky-Korsakov was offered a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, it was to Tchaikovsky that he turned for advice and guidance. Later, when Rimsky-Korsakov was under pressure from his fellow nationalists for his change in attitude on music education and his own intensive studies in music, Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, told him that he fully applauded what he was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. In the 1880s, long after the members of The Five had gone their separate ways, another group called the Belyayev circle took up where they left off. Tchaikovsky enjoyed close relations with the leading members of this group—Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov <b>and,</b> <b>by</b> <b>then,</b> Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E
