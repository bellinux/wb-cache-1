Their goal was to develop guidance specifically for Canadian HIV-treating physicians on the appropriate use of etravirine (TMC 125, Intelence, Tibotec <b>BVBA,</b> <b>Belgium)</b> in adult HIV-infected patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn China {{and other}} {{countries}} of East Asia, so-called Ling-zhi or Reishi mushrooms are used in traditional medicine since several centuries. Although the common practice to apply the originally European name ‘Ganoderma lucidum’ to these fungi has been questioned by several taxonomists, this is still generally done in recent publications and with commercially cultivated strains. In the present study, two commercially sold strains of ‘G. lucidum’, M 9720 and M 9724 from the company Mycelia <b>bvba</b> (<b>Belgium),</b> are compared for their fruiting body (basidiocarp) morphology combined with molecular phylogenetic analyses, and for their secondary metabolite profile employing an ultra-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (UPLC–ESIMS) in combination with a high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS). According to basidiocarp morphology, the strain M 9720 was identified as G. lucidum s. str. whereas M 9724 was determined as Ganoderma lingzhi. In molecular phylogenetic analyses, the M 9720 ITS and beta-tubulin sequences grouped with sequences of G. lucidum s. str. from Europe whereas those from M 9724 clustered with sequences of G. lingzhi from East Asia. We show that an ethanol extract of ground basidiocarps from G. lucidum (M 9720) contains much less triterpenic acids than found in the extract of G. lingzhi (M 9724). The high amount of triterpenic acids accounts for the bitter taste of the basidiocarps of G. lingzhi (M 9724) and of its ethanol extract. Apparently, triterpenic acids of G. lucidum s. str. are analyzed {{here for the first}} time. These results demonstrate the importance of taxonomy for commercial use of fungi...|$|R
40|$|On July 23, 2014, the Progress cargo {{spacecraft}} 56 P {{was launched}} from Baikonur to the International Space Station (ISS), carrying EXPOSE-R 2, the third ESA (European Space Agency) EXPOSE facility, the second EXPOSE {{on the outside}} platform of the Russian Zvezda module, with four international astrobiological experiments into space. More than 600 biological samples of archaea, bacteria (as biofilms and in planktonic form), lichens, fungi, plant seeds, triops eggs, mosses and 150 samples of organic compounds {{were exposed to the}} harsh space environment and to parameters similar to those on the Mars surface. Radiation dosimeters distributed over the whole facility complemented the scientific payload. Three extravehicular activities later the chemical samples were returned to Earth on March 2, 2016, with Soyuz 44 S, having spent 588 days in space. The biological samples arrived back later, on June 18, 2016, with 45 S, after a total duration in space of 531 days. The exposure of the samples to Low Earth Orbit vacuum lasted for 531 days and was divided in two parts: protected against solar irradiation during the first 62 days, followed by exposure to solar radiation during the subsequent 469 days. In parallel to the space mission, a Mission Ground Reference (MGR) experiment with a flight identical Hardware and a complete flight identical set of samples was performed at the premises of DLR (German Aerospace Center) in Cologne by MUSC (Microgravity User Support Center), according to the mission data either downloaded from the ISS (temperature data, facility status, inner pressure status) or provided by RedShift Design and Engineering <b>BVBA,</b> <b>Belgium</b> (calculated ultra violet radiation fluence data). In this paper, the EXPOSE-R 2 facility, the experimental samples, mission parameters, environmental parameters, and the overall mission and MGR sequences are described, building the background for the research papers of the individual experiments, their analysis and results...|$|R
40|$|For {{some time}} past, {{terrestrial}} laser scanning {{has been adopted}} {{as one of the}} data acquisition techniques for e. g. deformation measurements, documentation of historical monuments and civil engineering projects. Using terrestrial laser scanning, millions of 3 D points can be obtained with a high accuracy in a time span of minutes or even seconds {{depending on the type of}} laser scanner. However, processing the data still remains a time consuming process. As a result, total station measurements are often preferred over laser scanning for high frequency deformation measurements when time for data processing is limited. In the research at hand, the applicability of terrestrial laser scanning in time critical situations was assessed based on the case of a recent monitoring project on a sewage purification plant. Deformations had to be assessed twice a day in order to prevent accidents from happening. The total station measurements were executed and processed by a specialized company (Teccon <b>bvba,</b> <b>Belgium).</b> At the same time, terrestrial laser scanning was used by researchers of University College Ghent and Ghent University to acquire deformation data. The data obtained by laser scanning was processed independently and then georeferenced to the same coordinate system as used for the total station measurements to enable comparison of the resulting deformations. In order to be able to meet the time requirements, a “quick and dirty” method was developed to process the laser scan data. This method implied no cleaning up of the point clouds and only primitive modeling of parts of the structure. Although a complete 3 D model of the whole structure could not be generated in the limited time frame between two scans, the objective, namely an accurate assessment of deformations almost in real time, was accomplished. Furthermore, the degree of detail that can be reached through the use of laser scanning surpasses the possibilities of total stations. Moreover, even with a “quick and dirty method”, visualization is much more comprehensive than can be obtained by using a total station...|$|R
