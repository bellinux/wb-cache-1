25|$|Wilson met {{his wife}} Lois Burnham {{during the summer of}} 1913, while sailing on Vermont's Emerald Lake; two years later the couple became engaged. He entered Norwich University, but {{depression}} and panic attacks forced him to leave during his second semester. The next year he returned, but was soon suspended with a group of students involved in a hazing incident. Because no one would take responsibility, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> identify the perpetrators, the entire class was punished.|$|E
500|$|As {{they grew}} older, the sisters became more {{interested}} in incorporating pop and contemporary R into their music, and in 2007 they decided to form their own band. For their first gig, the trio played at a Jewish deli in Hollywood and were paid in matzah ball soup. Early gigs were sparsely populated; Danielle recalled, [...] "We were [...] bottom of the bill at 50-capacity venues <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> show up." ...|$|E

500|$|Writer Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{felt the}} song {{failed to produce}} a {{significant}} and memorable hook, though noting its dance appeal: [...] "it has a beat that makes you move, but the songs' pop hook doesn't stick." [...] While New York Times columnist Jon Pareles called the song an [...] "earthy delight", Glenn Gamboa from Newsday felt Carey's vocals could have easily {{been replaced by a}} less skilled singer, and wrote [...] "she sounds like a hook girl in her own song. Her vocals could have been delivered by Kelis or Amerie <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> have been the wiser." ...|$|E
500|$|A doctor prescribes Prozac, a {{real life}} antidepressant, to Kyle for his {{apparent}} love for feces, which he describes as [...] "fecalphilia", a condition perhaps better known by the medical term coprophilia. Composer Philip Glass composes the avant-garde musical score for the non-denominational Christmas play. Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass; Parker, who was a music major in college, said, [...] "I really thought you could basically tell a third grader {{to sit down at}} a keyboard and mess around and sell it as a Philip Glass album, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> know the difference." [...] The do-it-yourself kit in the live action commercial, in which families can make their own Mr. Hankey, is similar to the Mr. Potato Head toy set.|$|E

500|$|On April 22, TMZ.com {{reported}} that the tape was a hoax.

[...] The following day, Beyoncé spoke about the allegations to MTV News. She stated that the report was ridiculous and that the timing of the video would draw publicity to two of her upcoming television performances. In an interview with Chris Harris of Rolling Stone, Zeghibe said that he was surprised by how much attention the clip received and by Beyoncé's reaction to it. He admitted that he had previously given the same treatment to Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, and that he did not feel he had to apologize for the hoax: ...|$|E
500|$|The show's animal trainer, Debbie Cove, used {{around three}} hundred {{cockroaches}} for this episode. Cove later noted {{that only one}} of the cockroaches died during the filming, due to old age. Director Kim Manners was very pleased with the way the cockroaches behaved, noting that [...] "every shot I wanted to get, they got." [...] Cast and crew members later recalled that Manners began giving orders to the roaches. Cinematographer John Bartley explained, [...] "when I saw Kim Manners talking to a bucket of cockroaches, that was a highlight for me." [...] Several [...] "incredibly detailed" [...] rubber cockroaches were created for the episode. These props were extremely detailed: prop master Ken Hawryliw explained that, [...] "you could put one next to a real roach <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> know the difference." [...] In addition, the [...] "piles and piles" [...] of faux-dung were created for the show by using an organic, feces-free substance.|$|E
500|$|Twilight was in {{development}} for approximately {{three years at}} Paramount Pictures's MTV Films, during which time a screen adaptation differing significantly from the novel was written. For example, the script transformed Bella into a star athlete. Stephenie Meyer stated {{that there was some}} debate in allowing the movie to be made because of the negative or positive outcome of the movie compared to the book, '"They could have put that [...] movie out, called it something else, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> have known it was Twilight!" [...] The idea of seeing a scene converted correctly, specifically the meadow scene, convinced Meyer to sell the rights. In seeing the script, she was frightened that she had made the wrong decision. When Summit Entertainment reinvented itself as a full-service studio in April 2007, it successfully acquired the rights to the novel. Erik Feig, President of Production at Summit Entertainment, guaranteed a close adaptation to the book. The company perceived the film as an opportunity to launch a franchise based on the success of Meyer's book and its sequels. Meyer felt that Summit was open to letting her {{be a part of the}} film. Catherine Hardwicke was hired to direct the film, and soon afterward, Melissa Rosenberg was selected to be the film's structural base as the writer of the film.|$|E

2500|$|Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo {{expressed}} {{on numerous}} occasions their admiration for the music of Joni Mitchell, such as this quote by Thurston Moore: [...] "Joni Mitchell!

[...] Additionally, as with Sonic Youth, Joni Mitchell has always used a number of alternative tunings. The band named a song after her, [...] "Hey Joni".|$|E
2500|$|Gross says Hill did {{not want}} the film to be {{especially}} violent - there would be no blood <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> die.

2500|$|This {{terminology}} implies analysing {{the full}} infinitive as a two-word infinitive, which not all grammarians accept. As one who used [...] "infinitive" [...] {{to mean the}} single-word verb, Otto Jespersen challenged the epithet: [...] "'To' is no more {{an essential part of}} an infinitive than the definite article {{is an essential part of}} a nominative, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> think of calling 'the good man' a split nominative." [...] However, no alternative terminology has been proposed.|$|E

Power and resources would be distributed fairly. There would be no grievances, no mass mobilizations, demands for political participation, or any other of the turmoil of non-Islamic governance.

But neither may Germans imagine that they might push Italy back to Salorno and from there to the Lago di Garda. Perhaps the Germans believe that all Italians are like Credaro. If they do, they’re sorely mistaken. In Italy, there are hundreds of thousands of Fascists who would rather lay waste to Alto Adige than to permit the tricolore that flies above the Vetta d’Italia to be lowered. If the Germans have to be beaten and stomped to bring them to reason, then so be it, we’re ready. A lot of Italians have been trained in this business." ...|$|E

2500|$|In another version, Ledell {{placed the}} meeting {{not at a}} {{crossroads}} but in a graveyard. This resembles the story told to Steve LaVere that Ike Zinnerman of Hazlehurst, Mississippi, learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones. Zinnerman {{is believed to have}} influenced the playing of the young Johnson. [...] Recent research by the blues scholar Bruce Conforth, in Living Blues magazine, makes the story clearer. Johnson and Ike Zimmerman (the spelling reportedly given in census records for the family going back to the early 1800s, on his Social Security card and Social Security death notice, on his funeral program, and by his daughters) did practice in a graveyard at night, because it was quiet <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> disturb them, but it was not the Hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed: Zimmerman was not from Hazlehurst but nearby Beauregard, and he didn't practice in one graveyard, but in several in the area. Johnson spent about a year living with and learning from Zimmerman, who ultimately accompanied Johnson back to the Delta to look after him.|$|E
