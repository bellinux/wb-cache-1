40|$|Rational {{expectations}} do {{not require}} beliefs {{to be consistent with}} history and with what agents can conclude from it. Actually, at a rational expectations equilibrium agents may hold beliefs that explain poorly the history they observe, even when restricted to only those rationalizing their choices. This paper shows that if agents hold rationally formed expectations instead —in the sense of following from beliefs that explain history better than any other beliefs justifying their choices— then <b>additional</b> <b>allocations</b> unsupported by rational expectations can be shown to be equilibrium outcomes. By means of this result, it is established too that adding common knowledge of the rationality of the formation of expectations —on top of that of rationality of choices and market clearing— does not suffice either to guarantee rational expectations. Interestingly, the rationally formed expectations equilibria produced in this paper exhibit a sunspot-like volatility that do not rely on an explicit sunspot mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Internet address {{allocation}} schemes have a {{huge impact}} on the size of routing tables. Due to the imminent deployment of IPv 6 and the rapidly growing number of users worldwide, it is very urgent that we have a good address allocation algorithm for IPv 6. Addresses are allocated by registries to users in the form of prefixes. Such an allocation dovetails nicely with the Longest Matching Prefix algorithm employed by routers to keep the address lookup problem scalable. However, some users inevitably grow in size and need more addresses. The <b>additional</b> <b>allocations</b> often end up creating new prefixes, causing undesirable “address fragmentation. ” We further develop a simple algorithm, called Growthbased Address Partitioning (GAP), proposed in Wang (2005). GAP allocates addresses taking into account the possibility that users may grow in the future. However, it makes the unrealistic assumption that this growth rate is known {{at the time of the}} initial request. In this paper, we develop an online version of the GAP algorithm and use theory, simulations and real data from the Asia Pacific and the Chinese registries to show that the online version yields an order of magnitude less address fragmentation compared to existing allocation schemes. This is significant for reducing routing table size, increasing scalability and improving the performance of the Internet...|$|E
40|$|In Texas, Hispanic populations (people of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American {{or other}} Spanish culture or origin, {{regardless}} of race) have increased from 6. 7 million in 2000 to 7. 4 million in 2005, or by approximately 10. 5 %. This growth trend {{is expected to}} continue with estimates that Hispanics will represent approximately 37 % of the state's population by 2015. The problem this research addressed is that participation in higher education by Texas Hispanics is not keeping pace with the growth in the Texas Hispanic population. If allowed to continue, the state could be in danger of realizing devastating economic and societal consequences. The present study utilized regression analysis to determine how well four institutional characteristics explained the variance in Hispanic enrollment and graduation percentages of students attending public 4 -year institutions in states with prevalent Hispanic populations. Findings indicate that while local Hispanic population is a strong, positive predictor of Hispanic enrollments, it has a negative impact on Hispanic graduation rates. The independent variables of average cost of attendance and average financial aid package are the strongest predictors of Hispanic graduation percentages. Implications for the state of Texas include stress on public 4 -year institutions in coping with Hispanic population increases, possible enrollment overflows at the community college level, and need for <b>additional</b> <b>allocations</b> to state and institutional financial aid programs...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the latest}} Education Statistics Report {{published}} by the Department of Basic Education in March 2013, there were 12 680 829 learners and students in the basic education system in 2011, who attended 30 992 education institutions and were served by 441 128 educators. The vision of the Department of Basic Education is of a South Africa in which all our people have access to lifelong learning and education and training, which will, in turn, contribute towards {{improving the quality of}} life. Ultimately this will influence the building of a peaceful, prosperous and democratic South Africa. The emphasis is on excellence. Therefore maintaining high standards of performance and professionalism is a national imperative. However, this has not always been the case in terms of performance. For more than a decade we have witnessed dismal results in literacy and numeracy. This was accompanied by a low throughput rate. Despite the poor matric, literacy and numeracy results in South Africa as well as the low throughput rate, no teacher has been formally charged for poor performance in the last two decades. South Africa’s education budget is {{regarded as one of the}} highest in the developing world. Since 1993 the education budget has also grown substantially. South Africa’s education expenditure on education has grown from R 30 billion in 1994 / 05 to R 101 billion in 2007 / 08. Spending on education grew even further from R 207 billion in 2012 / 13 to a projected R 236 billion in 2014 / 15. <b>Additional</b> <b>allocations</b> of R 18. 8 billion over the medium term are accommodated, including equalisation of learner subsidies for no-fee schools and expanded access to grade R. 6 Over the rest of the medium-term-expenditure framework (MTEF), 7 spending on education, sport and culture will amount to R 233 billion in 2013 / 14. The investment in education has not yet yielded the desired results and the outcome of education is not in keeping with the substantial input. This crisis in education is one of the major challenges facing Government, Administrators, educators, parents and children of today. According to Spaull, 9 the South African government spends the equivalent of $ 1225 (R 12440. 26) 10 per child on primary education, yet accomplishes less than the government of Kenya which spends only the equivalent of $ 258 (R 2620. 80) 11 per child. Various reasons such as poverty, management, leadership, imbalances of the past, two unequal education systems, poor management, training and development, non-accountability, role of government and unions, have been identified for the poor state of our education system. However, what is noticeably absent and hardly mentioned in any of the position papers, is that not a single teacher has been held accountable and dismissed for incapacity for the poor performance in the education sector. Unfortunately, there is no record in any of the provincial education departments’ annual reports that a teacher has been dismissed or at least placed on a formal programme of incapacity for poor performance. Therefore, we have to ask the question: “Are we getting value for money...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{tools for}} welfare and revenue analyses of Bayes-Nash equilibria in asymmetric auctions with single-dimensional agents. We employ these tools to derive price of anarchy results for social welfare and revenue. Our approach separates the standard smoothness framework into two distinct parts, isolating the analysis common to any auction {{from the analysis}} specific to a given auction. The first part relates a bidder's contribution to welfare in equilibrium to their contribution to welfare in the optimal auction using the price the bidder faces for <b>additional</b> <b>allocation.</b> Intuitively, either an agent's utility and hence contribution to welfare is high, or the price she {{has to pay for}} <b>additional</b> <b>allocation</b> is high relative to her value. We call this condition value covering; it holds in every Bayes-Nash equilibrium of any auction. The second part, revenue covering, relates the prices bidders face for <b>additional</b> <b>allocation</b> to the revenue of the auction, using an auction's rules and feasibility constraints. Combining the two parts gives approximation results to the optimal welfare, and, under the right conditions, the optimal revenue. In mechanisms with reserve prices, our welfare results show approximation with respect to the optimal mechanism with the same reserves. As a center-piece result, we analyze the single-item first-price auction with individual monopoly reserves. When each distribution satisfies a regularity condition the auction's revenue is at least a 2 e/(e- 1) ≈ 3. 16 approximation to the revenue of the optimal auction. We also give bounds for matroid auctions with first-price or all-pay semantics, and the generalized first-price position auction. Finally, we give an extension theorem for simultaneous composition, i. e., when multiple auctions are run simultaneously, with single-valued, unit-demand agents.
