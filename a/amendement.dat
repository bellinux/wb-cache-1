The emphasis is on the major changes in accounting and tax regulation. Financial accounting and taxation in Finland have been based on 'expenditure-revenue' accounting theory. In fact, the Company Income Tax Law (1968) institutionalized the usage of this accounting theory. Taxation has been linked strictly to book-keeping in formal and material terms in Finland. Extensive income smoothing due to the flexible depreciation and inventory undervaluation practices has characterized Finnish accounting until the beginning of the 1990 s. The concept of deferred taxation has not been the central issue in Finnish accounting and there is no detailed regulation regarding accounting for it. Since the 1992 <b>amendements,</b> it has been allowed in group accounts to divide depreciation difference between tax and financial accounts and untaxed reserves into equity and deferred tax liability in balance sheets. To conclude, there has been very interesting interplay between the harmonization efforts, needs for international comparability, remaining tax dependence and the role of accounting theory in Finland. ...|$|R

The amendments {{brought to}} the Combines Act by the Third Session of the 24 th Parliament are as follow: first, the bill C- 58 consolidates all the anti-trust legislation under one act only which means that it removes from the criminal code the articles which were concerned with unfairetrade practices and integrates then in the Combines Act. Second, the new law provides for an alternative way of controlling the restrictive trade practices: the injonction. The prosecution leading to conviction by a provincial court {{used to be the}} sole remedy against the combines, but now {{it would be possible to}} issue an order of dissolution against trade associations. This provision is mainly concerned with the merger cases. Third, the new bill autorises the Department of Justice to bring certain combine cases before the Exchequer Court of Canada instead of a trial Court. The reason for this amendment is that the federal government wants to build up a body of judicial experts who will deal with the more complicated cases of merger or combines. Four, the law specifically autorises the enterprises to exchange information and statistics on the state of their business and permits them to cooperate in research and development. This means that in a prosecution under the Combines Act, the court shall not convict the accused if the agreement relates only to these matters. Five, the law obliges any productor or distributor of a merchandise to offer the same discount or allowances to all its customers. Thus, this amendment forbides any trade discrimination...|$|R

40|$|The incessant {{growth of}} the US foreign trade and {{development}} of its modern technical facilities, {{did not find any}} pendant in the traditional legal regulation of the matter. The reason was the federal system leading to diversity of legislatures according to the constitutional rights exercised by each of 50 states and Puerto Rico, and accordingly by Congress of the United States in relation to the District of Columbia and the federal territories. „Splendid isolation" has left essential disadvantages as regards commerce itself (in the broad meaning of this word as adopted by Anglo-American legal system). Disregarding the Incoterms 1936, the Revised American Foreign Trade Definitions have been introduced in 1941. Only few international conventions are in force in the United States. The convention on checks, convention on bills of exchange, many maritime conventions, and even done in New York City convention on recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, have not yet been adopted in this country. Signature being ever put on any act of this kind does not secure the prosperous perspectives as regards its adoption by particular states. In order to avoid disadvantages of the legal situation as described above, being improper for promoting of the interstate commerce relations too, a series of uniform acts has been duly adopted by legislatives of particular states. The Uniform Commercial Code, being an advanced stage of the unification efforts, is — in the opinion of Professor Soia Mentschikoff — the most ambitious Codification ever undertaken in the Anglo - American legal world. After testing of its draft in series of discussions, the 1952 Official Text and Comments Edition has been produced as a private proposal for state legislatives. Since 1954 (Pennsylvania) the code has been adopted by every state except Louisiana. In the meantime the deep-seated adherence to the „judge-made law" system was to be surmounted. The main negative aspect of the above system of coming the code in force of the will of state legislatives, were various local <b>amendements</b> introduced to the text. Therefore, a full unification by one federal act is now urgently needed.

40|$|Localism acts such as Act 2011 {{have always}} {{accompanied}} and reinforced Planning Acts. For example, in Planning Act 2008, National Policy Statements describe clearly a single commissioner’s {{role and tasks}} to handle application; they also define the cases in which Secretary of State is decision-maker. Planning acts describe the meaning of ’owner’, allocation of housing accomodation and acquisition of land. On the other hand {{with the help of}} Localism Acts enforcing rules, regulations and continuous <b>amendements,</b> some local communities have successfully challenged Gypsy planning applications as in our case studies in East and West Midlands. Since several years and looking back in time, policy-makers and extremely conservative locals have always challenged planning applications of Gypsy individuals and communities by successfully repealing provisions of local authorities through petitions and other abusive behaviour at times. And although a Housing Act promises to make provisions about housing, secure tenancy and also about mobile homes and the accomodation needs of gypsies and travellers, it may also contain contraddictory content in ’schedules’, ’service notices’ and ’appeals to prohibition notices’, ’management orders’, which may encourage locals to oppose local authorities decisions about Gypsy protected sites. However the most sinister decisions and campaigns against Gypsy sites and planning permissions have been triggered mainly by the Localism acts and by notions of who has the right to be a ’local person’ having the right to make an application and/or acquire land to be used as protected site. In some case study we can discover that the terms of ’Gypsy’, ’nomadism’ and ’Traveller’ become challenging ’weapons’ against planning applications. No Gypsy person getting a local fixed job can be considered any more as a ’Gypsy’ or ’Traveller’, but, they have no chance to become ’locals’ to acquire more rights. On the opposite side, if any person comes from somewhere else is not considered a local to have equal rights with everybody else in the area. If they declare themselves as Gypsy/Traveller, they are opposed by locals as such; locals use themes of wrong waste management and lack of cleaningness, for example, based on Housing Acts to prevent decisions of local authorities ion favour of gypsies who recently lost the right to get legal aid and appeal, as well. The term ’Gypsy’ is played down to {{what the rest of the}} inhabitants wants to achieve and most of the times middle aged Gypsy women become victims of a male war of law and regulations; there are occasions in which a woman lost the right to be a ’Gypsy’ simply because they had to find a job close by and for long in order to be a carer for her elderly parents. We are going to challenge ’good practices’ by investigating on these cases through hidden agenda and metaphors used in acts and related decisions and outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the standpoints of Polish penal code writing {{with respect to}} basic directives of measurement of penalty formulated {{on the basis of}} Penal Code of 1969. The first part presents three basic directives contained in Art. 50 § 1 of the Penal Code of 1969, i. e. a) a directive of the degree of social danger of a criminal act (identified by most authors with the justice-based rationalization); b) a directive of social influence of penalty (corresponding with the principle of general crime prevention); c) a directive of individual influence of penalty (corresponding with the principle of individual crime prevention). The interpretation of Art. 50 § 1 of the Penal Code does not indicate that the legislator would treat any of these directives in a preferential way. It may mean that each of them should be reflected in the individual measurement of penalty. The Penal Code is also silent on the question of priority of one of these directives in case of conflict between them, leaving the choice to the discretionary powers of the court. Such an arrangement of basic directives of measurement of penalty has {{since the early days of}} the Penal Code raised numerous controversies, most of them focused around the problem of a so-called leading directive of measurement of penalty. The second part of the article shows the course of a twenty-year-old discussion on the conceptions of measurement of penalty. The first stage of that discussion took place in years 1959 - 1974. Three basic standpoints were represented in legal writing at that time. Most writers supported the conception of equality of directives provided for in Art. 50 § 1 of the Penal Code (among others I. Andrejew, Z. Kaczmarek, Z. Kubec, J. Majewski, W. Swida, J. Sliwowski, Z. Sienkiewicz). The second group of authors supported the conception of domination of one of the preventive directives, mostly the one of individual crime prevention, over the others (K. Buchała, A. Spotowski, A. Zoll, A. Krukowski). Finally, the third view was for the conception of priority of the directive of social danger. The problems of basic directives of measurement of penalty were again in the focus of interest of legal writing in years 1981 - 1982, in connection with <b>amendements</b> to the Penal Code. Most authors were then for the leading role of individual prevention modified by the needs of just requital, or for the equivalent position of both directives (e. g. A. Spotowski, A. Marek, A. Zoll). Almost unanimous was in legal writing the renouncement of the directive of general crime prevention. The two projects of amendments to the Penal Code (a government and a so-called social draft) incorporated the above proposals of changes of Art. 50 § 1 of the Penal Code. In 1988, The Commission for the Penal Law Reform appointed by the Minister of Justice issued Guidelines on the Penal Law Reform. However, the Guidelines were not clear as to the standpoint with respect to changes of Art. 50 of the Penal Code. The above Guidelines were also analysed by the Scientific Society of Penal Law. The opinion of that organization stated that the measurement of penalty should include two aims: the satisfaction of social sense of justice through the severity of penalty commensurate with the degree of guilt, and individual crime prevention directed towards resocialization. In case of conflict of those two directives, priority should be given to individual crime prevention, with the exception of fellonies. The author is fully in support for the standpoint expressed in the Opinion of the Scientific Society of Penal Law.

40|$|A partir de {{distributions}} de conventions collectives pondérées par le nombre de salariés visés, l'auteur dégage certains indicateurs du taux de pénétration syndicale au Québec selon les secteurs d'activité, les régions et les catégories de travailleurs couverts. Il examine également la répartition des conventions {{en fonction}} de leur durée et de la taille des unités de négociation. Since 1969, collective agreements filed to the Department of Labour and Manpower must indicate {{the number of}} employees governed by such agreement. It is now possible to make some distributions of the agreements in force in Québec weighted by {{the number of employees}} covered by the agreement. This paper aims at presenting a more precise view of the relative importance of this institution and of the number of workers represented by unions in each industrial sector or in each region in the Province of Québec. The data analyzed here come from 1930 agreements, Le. all those expiring after June, 1 1973 covering 15 or more employees excluding those agreements (or decrees) in force in the public sector and the construction industry and those who were expired and had not been renewed at the time data were collected by a questionnaire administered to the agreements (summer 1973). As to results, most of the agreements (62 %) in force and most of the workers covered (58 %) are in the manufacturing sector eventhough the workers of this sector represent only for 30 % of the total employed labor force. Despite the fact that over 60 % of the total employed labor force is in the service sector, the workers of this sector governed by such agreements represent less than one third of all those covered. The data analysis also shows the relative importance of international unions in the Québec private sector since AFL-CIO-CLC unions have signed almost half of the agreements which determine the working conditions of about 45 % of the workers covered by the analysed agreements. The CNTU comes second in ranking with 25 % of the agreements and of the workers covered. Most agreements in force (60 %) are found in the Montréal area and white collar workers are far behind blue collars (in the private sector) since they count for only 11 % of all the workers covered by collective agreements. There is also a strong tendency for these agreements' duration to be close to the maximum permitted by theLabor Code (3 years). This maximum is found in half of the agreements and 64 % of all agreements have a duration of 30 months and over. If international unions have signed the largest number of agreements, this predominance is true only in the primary and secondary sector, since in the services the covered workers are spread almost evently among the CNTU, the CLC, the AFL-CIO-CLC and Others (mostly independent). When distributed on a regional basis, the results show that the international unions dominate in Montréal and in most provincial peripheral regions. Even if the CNTU comes first in Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean and in the Eastern Township, the AFL-CIO-CLC unions compete with them in the regions of Québec, Trois-Rivières and Côte-Nord. Three groups of unions have a regional character, the CSD in the Québec, Eastern Township and Montréal regions, the CLC in Montréal and Québec, and Others (mostly independant) in Montréal, Québec and Trois-Rivières. The weighted distributions also show the large number of small bargaining units in Québec. Actually almost 45 % of the agreements have been signed in units covering 15 to 49 employees, and altogether they do not touch 10 % of all the employees governed by collective agreements in Québec. On the other hand, only 16. 5 % of the agreements are applicable to bargaining units covering 200 or more employees (and only 5 %, covering 500 or more). But these cover more than 63 % of all employees governed. There are more large units in the primary sector than in any of the other two, and more small units in the services sector (private). There is no significant relation between the size of the bargaining unit and the affiliation of the signing union, nor between the size of the unit and the duration of the contract, except in the very small units where the contracts have a shorter duration and in the very large units (500 and more) where the contracts are more often longer than the average. It is not contended this study has been exhaustive. It would be interesting, using other sources of information, {{to see if there is}} a significant relation between the size of bargaining units and the frequency and the duration of strikes, or between these and the union affiliation or the industrial sector. All was intended here was to show some of the possible uses of these data available since the 1969 <b>amendements</b> to theQuébec Labor ^Code...|$|R

Ceci est mis en évidence par le dispositif des 42 parcelles de l'INRA à Versailles qui reçoit chaque année les mêmes traitements depuis 1929. Il présente l'originalité d'être en jachère nue. Les résultats reportés ici reposent sur 16 traitements que nous comparons à une parcelle témoin. Le sol est à caractère limoneux avec 14 à 22 % d'argile. Le pH, la capacité d'échange au pH du sol (CECsol), et les cations échangeables ont été mesurés. Des mesures de porosité, de rétention de l'eau à différents potentiels de l'eau ont été effectuées. Des variations considérables de pH sont observées. Les engrais ammoniacaux conduisent à des parcelles très acides (pH 3, 5 à 5, 0), à faible CECsol, essentiellement saturée par des cations aluminium. Dans les parcelles chaulées ou recevant des <b>amendements</b> basiques, le pH est tamponné à 8, 2 par les carbonates. La CECsol double du sol acide au sol chaulé où {{elle est}} majoritairement saturée par du calcium échangeable. Avec les sels neutres (par exemple KCl, NaNO 3) le pH n'a pas changé et pour le témoin il a légèrement baissé. Des observations de terrain montrent que ces différents états physico-chimiques sont en relation avec les états de surface du sol et influencent la porosité du sol en profondeur. Ainsi dans les sols des régions tempérées la CECsol peut doubler dans un domaine très restreint de pH (6, 0 à 7, 5), orientant fortement les propriétés physiques des sols. In temperate regions, soil acidification {{is a real}} problem. The pH change causes transformations of both the chemical and physical properties of the soil. The 42 experimental plots at the Institut national de Recherche agronomique (INRA) in Versailles, France, were created in 1929. Since that time, each plot has received either fertiliser or amendments (Table 1). There are ten reference plots {{that have not been}} treated. Plots were dug up twice a year and left fallow. The results corresponding to 17 plots, 16 treated and one reference plot, are presented in this paper. The samples were collected in 1999 and compared to the 1929 soil reference. The pH was measured in water (AFNOR 1994), the cation exchange capacity (CEC) was determined at pH 7. 0 (AFNOR 1994, CEC 7) and at the soil pH by the cobaltihexamine method (Ciesielski and Steckermann 1997, CECsoil). Exchangeable cations (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K+ and Na+) were measured after cobaltihexamine extraction and exchangeable aluminium by the KCl method (McLean, 1965). Water retention measurements were carried out with an apparatus developed by Tessier and Berrier (1979) and AFNOR (1996) at - 10 kPa, with the Richards pressure plate cell at - 1. 6 kPa (Richards 1948) and with a controlled hygrometry dessicator at - 107 MPa (Tessier 1984). The average pH of the reference plot collected in 1929 was close to 6. 3. In 1999, pH values ranged between 3. 5 and 8. 2. For plots treated with ammonium fertilisers the pH ranged from 3. 5 to 5. 5. In contrast, plots with basic treatment or liming had a soil pH that was close to 8. 2 and was equilibrated with carbonates. Intermediate pH values (from 5. 5 to 7. 5) were obtained for plots treated with neutral salts such as KCl or NaNO 3, or with superphosphate. The cation exchange capacity in soils at the reference pH (7. 0) demonstrated variations in soil composition. For example, the CEC 7 varied with clay content as a function of depth or with organic matter loss or gain due to lying fallow or to manure application. When the CEC was measured at soil pH (CECsoil), strong differences were observed. Two groups of plots can be differentiated in 1999. One ranged between 11 and 16 cmol+/kg; this range corresponded to plots with amendments or with fertilisers containing bases. A lower range of CECsoil values (below 11 cmol+ /kg) was obtained with ammonium fertilisers. It {{is important to note that}} between pH= 6. 0 and pH= 7. 5 the CECsoil doubled. Six months after digging, the surface state of the soil was variable. Thick crusts dominated in acidic conditions, whereas the presence of dispersing cations (K+, Na+), and a smooth surface was present in soil treated with amendments. In the soil profile, bulk density increased with acidity and sodium or potassium cation concentrations. At - 10 kPa, water retention measurements demonstrated that bulk density and sampling depth were linked with water retention: the higher the bulk density, the lower the water retention. At - 1. 6 MPa, water retention was correlated to the amount of clay and organic matter content. We also showed that the exchangeable calcium content and CECsoil influence water retention. At - 107 MPa, water retention depends on pH as well as the CECsoil and exchangeable cation concentration. The main purpose of this study was to show that after 70 years, plots subjected to intensive fertilisation or amendments and lying fallow (i. e., without organic matter restitution), have dramatically different soil properties. The first indicator of this evolution was pH. Ammonium fertilisers produced very acid plots (pH 3. 5 to 5. 0). In the presence of neutral salts (e. g., KCl, NaNO 3) and in the reference plot, the pH had decreased a little. In liming or basic treatment plots, the pH is controlled at 8. 2 by carbonates. The second important factor to consider is the cation exchange capacity value. When measured at a reference pH (pH= 7. 0), the CEC 7 reflects the natural components present in a soil, but doesn't consider the influence of physico-chemical factors that operate in the native soil. After 70 years without organic restitution, the soil has lost approximately half of its original organic matter content, and as a result the exchangeable sites were approximately 2 cmol+ /kg. The effective CEC at soil pH demonstrates the influence of pH on variable charges due to mineral constituents and organic matter. Plots with ammonium fertilisers have a low cation exchange capacity. Fertilisers with sodium and potassium cations have increased the exchangeable sodium (up to 11 % of the CECsoil) or potassium (18 %) respectively. The cation exchange capacity doubled in going from acidic plots to liming plots, and in the latter the CEC is mainly saturated with exchangeable calcium. In situ plot observations show that soil physico-chemical properties strongly influence not only soil surface state, but also soil profile porosity. Both acidification and dispersing cations are factors in soil degradation, whereas high pH values and calcium as the exchangeable cation produce strong structure stability and high porosity. It is also interesting to note that the CECsoil can double between pH= 6. 0 and pH= 7. 5, thus influencing the physical properties of the soil. Comparing CEC 7 and CECsoil facilitates the prediction of the effects of fertilisation and amendments on soil properties. The cation exchange capacity at soil pH can be used as an excellent indicator of soil quality...|$|R

Under delictual liability we mean certain secondary liability {{to suffer the}} consequences of one's actions which arises {{in case of a}} violation of certain primary liability, usually set by a legal norm. Within the protection of environment, we encounter the term ecological-legal liability. Delictual liability can be specified as liability within administrative and criminal law, accompanied by environmental liability. There is no unified amendment for the first one within environmental protection and particular actus reus of regulatory offence can be therefore found in particular component laws. Administrative delicts of legal entities and individuals undertaking business then form an independent part of law and they are punished more severly than deliquencies of individuals. As far as criminal liability is concerned, its <b>amendement</b> is incorporated into the criminal code. Also, the criminal liability law for legal entities came into effect in 2012. The thesis also comprises the comparison with the Slovak legislation...|$|E
