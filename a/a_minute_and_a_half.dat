5|$|In a squad {{with much}} less star power than that {{sent to the}} Tour de France, they were again {{middle of the pack}} in the team time trial, {{finishing}} 11th of 22 teams. The squad did not show themselves much, as it was not until stage 10 that they so much as finished in the top ten on a stage. Phinney took fifth place in the stage 10 individual time trial, <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> off the pace of the day's winner Tony Martin. Frank rode to fourth from a breakaway in the next stage, again <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> off the pace of the day's winner, this time David Moncoutié. All the team had to show for itself from {{the second half of the}} Vuelta was a seventh place from Van Avermaet in the field sprint finish to stage 12. Six BMC riders reached the Vuelta's finish, with Van Avermaet in 83rd place being their highest overall finisher.|$|E
5|$|Los Angeles lost in {{the finals}} to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points. Down by 16 {{entering}} the fourth quarter, and 10 with <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments which fell just short. After dropping to 36 wins and losing {{in the first round}} of the 1967 NBA Playoffs, they {{lost in the}} finals to the Celtics again in 1968. Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.|$|E
5|$|The team {{picked up}} their first single-day win {{the same day}} as the more prestigious Tour of Flanders, in which they participated but were not {{especially}} competitive, with Duque in 19th their best finisher. The race they won was the inaugural Flèche d'Emeraude, a new race in the UCI Europe Tour and the French Road Cycling Cup. Gallopin came first {{at the head of a}} field sprint in Saint-Malo. Zingle figured into a winning breakaway at the Brabantse Pijl, the precursor to the Ardennes classics. He took seventh place, <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> back of the winner Philippe Gilbert. Vogondy was sixth at the Tour du Finistère, finishing with a big main group behind two leaders.|$|E

5|$|The Road World Championships {{took place}} in Cancellara's native country Switzerland and he stated that he wished to win both events. Cancellara {{dominated}} the time trial event and won {{by a margin of}} close <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> over the second-place finisher. This was Cancellara's third world championship in the time trial discipline, which was tied for most ever with Australia's Michael Rogers. Cancellara's next goal was the road race, which was to take place three days later. During the final lap of the race, Cancellara crossed the gap to the race's leading group that had just formed. At the bottom of the final climb Cadel Evans (Australia) attacked, but no other riders reacted. Cancellara crossed the line in fifth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E
5|$|Stage 12 into Briançon in France was the Giro's first high {{mountain}} stage, and it shook up the standings {{for the final}} time. Di Luca took the stage win, twice attacking from an elite group of five that had made the climb together. As Noè finished nearly ten minutes behind, Di Luca took the pink jersey for a third time, while still holding the green jersey. As Di Luca concentrated on winning the race overall, Piepoli took the green jersey after stage 15, the race's queen stage, topping two of that stage's climbs in first position. His lead in the mountains classification quickly became unassailable, and he won the jersey in Milan. It was also on this stage that 's Eddy Mazzoleni distinguished himself as a podium contender, taking <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> out of Di Luca to move into second overall. Schleck lost time to Di Luca and Mazzoleni, but gained time over other riders {{in the top of}} the overall standings and stood third overall.|$|E

25|$|The pattern {{returned}} in 2003, Armstrong taking first place <b>and</b> Ullrich second. Only <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> second separated the {{two at the}} end of the final day in Paris. U.S. Postal won the team time trial on stage four, while Armstrong took stage 15, despite having been knocked off on the ascent to Luz Ardiden, the final climb, when a spectator's bag caught his right handlebar. Ullrich waited for him, which brought Ullrich fair-play honors.|$|R
5000|$|However, in {{many cases}} these basic {{durations}} are extended in actual performance, {{in part because of}} inserted material, and in part because many of the moments can or must be repeated. Sometimes the repetition of a moment involves a considerable change of speed. For example, DK(d) has a basic duration of fifteen seconds, but upon repetition is performed four times slower. Consequently, its actual duration is five times longer, at <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quarter [...]|$|R
5|$|The Trojans next {{stayed on}} the road and faced the fifteenth–ranked Arizona State Sun Devils, led by fifth–year head coach Dirk Koetter and quarterback Sam Keller. With both offenses {{struggling}} in the first quarter, Sun Devil, Terry Richardson, opened scoring on an 84-yard punt return for a touchdown. The Trojans answered early in the second quarter with a field goal, however, two touchdowns, a Keller pass and a Keegan Herring rush, gave the Sun Devils an 18-point half-time lead. Starting in the third quarter the Trojans got on track with a pair of rushing touchdowns to bring their deficit to four, and midway through the fourth quarter they took the lead on a quarterback sneak by Leinart. Keller drove the Sun Devils to another touchdown to take back the lead, but two more rushing touchdowns by the Trojans, within <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> gave them the win, 38–28. Reggie Bush and LenDale White both ran for over 150yards to help the Trojans win their Pac-10 record 26th consecutive game. Helping to seal the win for the Trojans were their defense who sacked Keller five times and caused him to throw five interceptions. Before the game, Keller, in his first year as a starter, had thrown for 2,165yards in seven games.|$|E
5|$|Though Evans was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} against the clock, Schleck had surpassed expectations in the long time trial at the 2010 Tour de France, leading to speculation as to whether his 57-second cushion over the Australian could be sufficient for him to win the Tour. Evans rode {{one of the best}} time trials of his career, finishing in second place seven seconds off the pace of Tony Martin, the rider who was crowned world time trial champion later that year. Andy said of his and his brother's rides that they were probably the best time trials likewise of their respective careers, but they were no match for Evans' performance. The Australian was two and a half minutes better than both of them, taking the overall lead by <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> with Andy slipping to second and Fränk to third. Since the Tour's final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial save for a final sprint finish, the time trial effectively cemented the final overall standings. Andy took the positive from the result, saying he and his brother were both proud of each other for their efforts and were excited to stand on the podium together in Paris, even if neither of them was on the top step.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the third}} period Eric Staal tied the game at seven with his first goal of the game. Minutes later Duchene got a breakaway, but before he could take a shot, Ovechkin threw his stick at the puck, {{resulting}} in the first penalty shot in All-Star game history, and only the third penalty assessed during the past ten years of All-Star competition. Duchene took the shot against Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped the attempt. Kris Letang scored shortly after the penalty shot to give back the lead to Team Staal. Briere scored a little over a minute later assisted by Weber and Henrik Sedin to re-tie the game. Weber's assist was his fourth of the game making him the second defenceman in history to record four assists in an All-Star Game (Ray Bourque, 1985). Team Lidstrom added two more goals before Rick Nash scored to cut the deficit to one. With about <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> left in the game, Team Staal pulled their goaltender for the extra attacker. The decision backfired as Eriksson scored on the empty net with 1:11 remaining. Eric Staal scored with 33.6 seconds remaining to bring his team back within one goal, but they failed to get another shot on goal before time ran out. By coming back from a four-goal deficit to win the game Team Lidstrom set the record for biggest comeback victory in All-Star history. Lidstrom finished the game with a +7 rating, the highest rating since 1991 when Adam Oates was also a +7 for the Wales Conference. Tim Thomas earned the victory becoming the first goaltender to win three straight All-Star Games. Patrick Sharp was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) after registering one goal and two assists in a losing cause for Team Staal. The combined 21 goals was the fourth highest total in NHL All-Star Game history.|$|E

5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff merely needing {{to run down}} the clock to secure its lead and the win. Twocomplete passes set up a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, but his third-down pass fell short, stopping the clock and forcing a Florida State punt. Only <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> had run off the clock, and Virginia Tech recovered the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State committed a pass interference penalty that gave Virginia Tech 15automatic yards and a first down. As in the previous drive, the penalty kick-started the Virginia Tech offense. On the next play, Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard pass—the longest offensive play of the game—that drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. After that, a Florida State holding penalty gave Virginia Tech a first-and-goal from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick scrambled fouryards for the touchdown, and {{what had been a}} 24-point Seminole lead was now cut to 11points. The drive had taken just 55seconds off the clock, and it appeared that Virginia Tech still had a chance to make it a close game. As before, Virginia Tech attempted a two-point conversion, and as before, it failed. With 10:50 remaining in the game, the score was now Florida State 27, Virginia Tech 15.|$|E
