5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{disagree with}} this narrative, Professor Constantin Zuckerman going as far <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that the True Cross was actually lost, {{and that the}} wood contained in the allegedly still sealed reliquary brought to Jerusalem by Heraclius in 629 was a fake. In his analysis, the hoax was designed to serve the political purposes of both Heraclius and his former foe, recently turned ally and co-father-in-law, Persian general and soon-to-become king, Shahrvaraz.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{its only}} {{access to the}} Baltic Sea was a major blow to the Lithuanian economy. Between 70% and 80% of foreign trade passed through Klaipėda. The region, which {{represented}} only about 5% of Lithuania's territory, contained {{a third of its}} industry. Lithuania also lost its heavy investments in the port's infrastructure. About 10,000 refugees, mostly Jews, left the region and sought shelter and support from the Lithuanian government. Lithuanians doubted the fate of their country: in March–April withdrawals of deposits in banks and credit institutions totaled almost 20% of total deposits. After the loss of Klaipėda, Lithuania drifted into the German sphere of influence, especially in terms of trade. At the end of 1939, Germany accounted for 75% of Lithuanian exports and for 86% of its imports. Germany and the Soviet Union concluded the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, dividing Eastern Europe into their respective spheres of influence. Not surprisingly, Lithuania was, at first, assigned to Germany. The Nazis went so far <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a German–Lithuanian military alliance against Poland and promised to return the Vilnius Region, but Lithuania held to its policy of strict neutrality.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{international}} conventions on flying the flag, but protocol {{adopted by a}} large number of countries have such similarities <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> lines of commonly accepted practice. In general two areas of exposure are identified: national and international events. In both cases it is generally followed practice that national flags displayed in a group should be of equal size and each hoisted on its own flagstaff, of equal height, or on separate ropes if fixed on yardarm. The flag is flown from sunrise to sunset, except in case of bad weather; exhibition at night is permitted provided it is adequately illuminated. The flag is raised and lowered vividly and with solemnity; it is always treated with dignity and should never be allowed to touch the ground or water. Vertical hoist is transformationally identical to horizontal hoist (i.e. the flag is rotated 90 degrees).|$|E

5|$|When the two generals {{with their}} men reached the pass, night had fallen, and the Paulicians, {{apparently}} unaware {{that they were}} being followed, had made camp in the valley of the pass. The Byzantines took up position in a wooded hill called Zogoloenos that overlooked the Paulician encampment, which further concealed them from their enemy. At this point, the sources record that a dispute broke out between the men of the two thematic corps as to who was the bravest; the two generals decided to take advantage of their troops' high morale and impetuousness to attack, despite their orders. A picked detachment of 600 men from both divisions launched a surprise attack at dawn, {{while the rest of the}} army remained behind and made loud clamour with trumpets and drums, so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the imminent arrival of the entire Byzantine field army under Christopher. The ruse worked perfectly: the Paulicians, taken by surprise, panicked and dispersed without offering any serious resistance. The Paulician rout was completed as they fell upon the main Byzantine army while fleeing. Their remnants were pursued by the victorious Byzantines up to a distance of 50km. Chrysocheir himself managed to escape with a small detachment of bodyguards, but he was brought at bay at Konstantinou Bounos (probably modern Yildiz Dagı). In the ensuing engagement, he was wounded by Poulades, a Byzantine soldier who had been formerly a captive of the Paulicians, and fell from his horse. He was then captured and beheaded by the advancing Byzantines, and his head was sent to Emperor Basil in Constantinople.|$|E

50|$|In earlier {{literature}} the belvica has variously {{been treated}} <b>as</b> belonging <b>to</b> <b>suggested</b> endemic genera Acantholingua and Salmothymus.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s the logo {{was changed to}} a more simplistic design to the old one. It had a rugby ball shape with three small lines, {{representing}} 13 players, and two long lines, representing goalposts, arranged on a rugby ball so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a hand carrying or passing it. The Rugby Football League was abbreviated to RFL.|$|E
25|$|Beside by words, scolding {{could also}} be {{performed}} by pejorative visual portrayals, especially by so-called níðstangs or nīþing poles. These were usually single poles with a carved man's head, on which a horse or a horse's head was impaled. In two attested instances (Bjarnar saga Hítdælakappa ch. 17, Gísla saga Súrssonar), two níðstangs were arranged so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> homosexual intercourse.|$|E
25|$|The {{starlings}} {{belong to}} the superfamily Muscicapoidea, together with thrushes, flycatchers and chats, as well as dippers which are quite distant and Mimidae (thrashers and mockingbirds). The latter are apparently the Sturnidae's closest living relatives, replace them in the Americas, and have a rather similar but more solitary lifestyle. They are morphologically quite similar too—a partly albinistic specimen of a mimid, mislabelled <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> an Old World origin, was for many decades believed to represent an extinct starling (see Rodrigues starling for details).|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to a pecuniary interest, other forms of personal interest that an adjudicator has in a decision may {{give the impression that}} he or she is biased. As the High Court stated in Re Singh Kalpanath (1992), a likelihood of bias may arise because an adjudicator (1) has already indicated partisanship by expressing opinions antagonistic or favourable to the parties before him; (2) has made known his views about the merits of the very issue or issues of a similar nature in such a way <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> prejudgment; or (3) has a personal relationship with the party or there is close kinship between the adjudicator and a party.|$|E
25|$|On 20 October 2009, Larsson {{announced}} his retirement from playing {{at the end of}} the 2009 Allsvenskan. The announcement followed a previous statement from the player declaring his intention to retire from international duty. Larsson had also stated his desire to move into coaching and expressed his intent to study for coaching badges in Scotland under the Scottish Football Association system. The announcement quickly sparked rumours of a return to Celtic as manager, even going so far <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a link-up with former Celtic teammate Ľubomír Moravčík as his assistant. Larsson also discussed the possibility of taking up floorball on a full-time basis.|$|E
25|$|In Terry Hands' 1977 {{production}} for the Royal Shakespeare Company, Margaret (played by Helen Mirren) {{tried to bring}} Henry {{back from the brink}} of madness by engaging his mind in an elaborate, difficult to follow verbal dance. Henry's preceding speech to Suffolk, where he demands Suffolk not look at him, and then immediately demands that he wants to look into Suffolk's eyes was played by Alan Howard in such a way <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Henry was losing his grip on reality, and in response to this, Mirren played the speech {{in such a way as}} to engage Henry's mind in the here and now, focus his thoughts and prevent them drifting away.|$|E

25|$|When the {{decision-maker}} has a pecuniary {{or personal}} interest {{in relation to the}} parties in the decision, he or she will be disqualified from making the decision on the basis that there is imputed bias. If the adjudicator has a pecuniary interest in the case, however small the interest is, it will be enough for the decision to be set aside. As for a personal interest, if it can be shown that, for example, an adjudicator has already indicated partisanship by expressing opinions antagonistic or favourable to the parties before him, or has made known his views about the merits of the very issue or issues of a similar nature in such a way <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> prejudgment, or because of his personal relationship with a party, the court is likely to impute bias.|$|E

50|$|The {{style of}} Antanas Škėma is very particular, full of {{unexpected}} metaphor and subconscious. Nevertheless, there are stylistic contrasts also: lyric and aesthetically delicate confessions are suddenly followed by coarse, cynical images and rude words.

500|$|Nelson Goodman had {{formulated}} {{a similar}} notion in Fact, Fiction and Forecast in 1956. In that work, Goodman {{went as far}} <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that there is [...] "no one world, but many worlds, each created by the human mind." [...] Putnam rejected this form of social constructivism, but retained {{the idea that there}} can be many correct descriptions of reality. No one of these descriptions can be scientifically proven to be the [...] "one, true" [...] description of the world. This does not imply relativism, for Putnam, because not all descriptions are equally correct and the ones that are correct are not determined subjectively.|$|E
500|$|With Aldimir's {{appointment}} as despot of Kran, Smiltsena ensured that his lands were better protected from Smilets' brothers Radoslav and Voysil who, as émigrés in Byzantium, held aspirations for the Bulgarian throne {{or at least}} their former domains. During Smiltsena's regency, Aldimir {{was one of the}} most influential people in Bulgaria; indeed, Byzantine statesman Theodore Metochites refers to the [...] "Scythian [...] venturer", as he calls Aldimir, as the queen's right-hand man. Aldimir's leading position leaves little doubt that he was involved in the fruitless anti-Byzantine negotiations between Bulgaria and Serbia in 1299. Pavlov even goes as far <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that the proposed anti-Byzantine union was the brainchild of Aldimir.|$|E
500|$|Despite this education, biographers Alexander Pantsov and Steven Levine {{commented that}} the [...] "moral-ethical precepts of Confucius seem to have left not a trace in his soul".

Short went so far <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Confucianism would prove to be [...] "at least as important to [...] as Marxism", noting that even in later life, Mao's speeches contained a greater number of quotations from Confucius and other ancient Chinese philosophers than from major Marxist theoreticians Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.|$|E

This would have allowed Raphael to both gain influence by Michaelangelo and also contribute to a piece of work on the Sistine Chapel.|$|R
30|$|Secondly, the {{feedback}} instances targeting GM use were categorized {{according to their}} explicitness depending on whether there is one correct/appropriate option or there are multiple correct/appropriate options.

5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{suggested}} that the Games were alluded to in playwright William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, and used that <b>as</b> evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Shakespeare may have seen the Games.
