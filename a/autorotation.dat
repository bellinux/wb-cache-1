5|$|The V-22's two Rolls-Royce AE 1107C {{engines are}} {{connected}} by drive shafts {{to a common}} central gearbox so that one engine can power both proprotors if an engine failure occurs. Either engine can power both proprotors through the wing driveshaft. However, the V-22 is generally not capable of hovering on one engine. If a proprotor gearbox fails, that proprotor cannot be feathered, and both engines must be stopped before an emergency landing. The V-22's <b>autorotation</b> characteristics are poor partly because the rotors have low inertia.|$|E
25|$|In {{early summer}} 2014, the AW609 {{performed}} FAA-monitored <b>autorotation</b> tests; more than 79 power-off conversions from airplane mode to helicopter mode were made across 10 flight hours; during these tests it was {{stated that the}} minimum <b>autorotation</b> altitude is , and that the system keeps rotor RPM above the minimum 70% for stable recovery. The test pilots subsequently received the Iven C. Kincheloe Award for {{their role in the}} tests.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{air base}} is mainly {{used as a}} {{training}} site for helicopter pilots, several grassy areas parallel to the runway are used for the training of emergency landing procedures, for example <b>autorotation</b> and engine failure.|$|E
50|$|The {{feel of the}} {{controls}} in the Helicycle is modeled after that of the Robinson R22, such that quick stops and <b>autorotations</b> are performed similarly in both aircraft, reportedly allowing new pilots to transition to flying their kits with minimal adjustments.|$|R
50|$|He {{participates in}} the Athens Flying Week, the largest air event in Greece, since it started in 2012. Athens Flying Week {{involves}} pilots performing precision exercises, operational maneuvers and mock rescues. Since 2014, Ververelis flies a EC-120 B. with the colors of Vostok Europe. His air displays often incorporate backward movements with quick changes of heading, back and front pirouettes, 90° climbs, 360° vertical dives, dog turns and full down <b>autorotations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each type of {{helicopter}} has {{a specific}} airspeed {{at which a}} power-off glide is most efficient. The best airspeed {{is the one that}} combines the greatest glide range with the slowest rate of descent. The specific airspeed is different for each type of helicopter, yet certain factors (density altitude, wind) affect all configurations in the same manner. The specific airspeed for <b>autorotations</b> is established for each type of helicopter on the basis of average weather and wind conditions and normal loading.|$|R
25|$|Like {{other early}} Italian monoplanes, the C.200 {{suffered}} from a dangerous tendency {{to go into a}} spin. Early production C.200 aircraft showed <b>autorotation</b> problems similar to those found in the Fiat G.50, IMAM Ro.51, and the AUT 18. At the beginning of 1940, a pair of deadly accidents occurred due to <b>autorotation.</b> Both deliveries and production were halted while the Regia Aeronautica evaluated the potential for abandoning use of the type, as the skill involved in flying the C.200 was considered to be beyond that of the average pilot. The problem was a produce of the profile of the wing. Castoldi soon tested a new profile, but a solution to the <b>autorotation</b> problem was found by Sergio Stefanutti, chief designer of SAI Ambrosini in Passignano sul Trasimeno, based on studies conducted by German aircraft engineer Willy Messerschmitt and the American National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). He redesigned the wing section according to variable (instead of constant) profile, which was achieved by covering parts of the wings with plywood.|$|E
25|$|G-ASWI North Sea {{ditching}} - On 13 August 1981 a Westland Wessex 60 helicopter {{lost power}} to the main rotor gearbox, going out of control during the ensuing <b>autorotation.</b> The flight was carrying 11 gas workers from the Leman gas field to Bacton, Norfolk. All people on board were lost.|$|E
25|$|Gyrodyne {{purchased}} {{the assets of}} Bendix Helicopters in 1949, including the Model 2C coaxial helicopter which provided the technology for the XRON-I. In 1951 the Model 2C was demonstrated to the Navy with shortcomings noted in <b>autorotation</b> control. The XRON-I was demonstrated under a new Navy contract NOas 55-388-c for a lightweight single man helicopter.|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this ongoing effort is to provide the capability to model and simulate rotorcraft aeromechanics behaviors in real-tune. This would be accomplished {{by the addition of}} an aeromechanics element to an existing high-fidelity, real-time helicopter flight simulation. As a first step, the peak vertical vibration at the pilot floor location was considered in this neural-network-based study. The flight conditions considered were level flights, rolls, pushovers, pull-ups, <b>autorotations,</b> and landing flares. The NASA/Army UH- 60 A Airloads Program flight test database was the source of raw data. The present neural network training databases were created in a physically consistent manner. Two modeling approaches, with different physical assumptions, were considered. The first approach involved a "maneuver load factor " that was derived using the roll-angle and the pitch-rate. The second approach involved the three pilot control stick positions. The resulting, trained back-propagation neural networks were small, implying rapid execution. The present neural-network-based approach involving the peak pilot vibration was utilized in a quasi-static manner to simulate an extreme, time-varying pull-up maneuver. For the above pull-up maneuver, the maneuver load factor approach was better for real-time simulation, i. e., produced greater fidelity, as compared to the control stick positions approach. Thus, neural networks show promise for use in high-fidelity, real-time modeling of rotorcraft vibration...|$|R
40|$|To date, perceptual errors {{occur in}} {{determining}} descent rate from a computer-generated image in flight simulation. Pilots tend {{to touch down}} twice as hard in simulation than in flight, and more training time is needed in simulation before reaching steady-state performance. Barnes suggested that recognition of range may be the culprit, and he cited that problems such as collimated objects, binocular vision, and poor resolution lead to poor estimation of the velocity vector. Brown's study essentially ruled out {{that the lack of}} binocular vision is the problem. Dorfel added specificity to the problem by showing that pilots underestimated range in simulated scenes by 50 % when 800 ft from the runway threshold. Palmer and Petitt showed that pilots are able to distinguish between a 1. 7 ft/sec and 2. 9 ft/sec sink rate when passively observing sink rates in a night scene. Platform motion also plays a role, as previous research has shown that the addition of substantial platform motion improves pilot estimates of vertical velocity and results in simulated touchdown rates more closely resembling flight. This experiment examined how some specific variations in the visual scene properties affect a pilot's perception of sink rate. It extended another experiment that focused on the visual and motion cues necessary for helicopter <b>autorotations.</b> In that experiment, pilots performed steep approaches to a runway. The visual content of the runway and its surroundings varied in two ways: texture and rectangular grid spacing. Four textures, included a no-texture case, were evaluated. Three grid spacings, including a no-grid case, were evaluated. The results showed that pilot better controlled their vertical descent rates when good texture cues were present. No significant differences were found for the grid manipulation. Using those visual scenes a simple psychophysics, experiment was performed. The purpose was to determine if the variations in the visual scenes allowed pilots to better perceive vertical velocity. To determine that answer, pilots passively viewed a particular visual scene in which the vehicle was descending at two different rates. Pilots had to select which of the two rates they thought was the fastest rate. The difference between the two rates changed using a staircase method, depending on whether or not the pilot was correct, until a minimum threshold between the two descent rates was reached. This process was repeated for all of the visual scenes {{to decide whether or not}} the visual scenes did allow pilots to perceive vertical velocity better among them. All of the data have yet to be analyzed; however, neither the effects of grid nor texture revealed any statistically significant trends. On further examination of the staircase method employed, a possibility exists that the lack of an evident trend may be due to the exit criterion used during the study. As such, the experiment will be repeated with an improved exit criterion in February. Results of this study will be presented in the submitted paper...|$|R
25|$|En route, the {{helicopter}} ran into poor weather and was then struck by lightning. This caused severe {{damage to the}} tail rotor. Though {{the helicopter}} managed to limp {{for a few more}} minutes, the tail rotor eventually failed completely and the pilot was forced to perform an emergency <b>autorotation</b> onto the rough seas. Emergency floaters on the helicopter allowed the passengers and crew to be evacuated onto a life raft. Despite the high waves and bad weather, all the people on board the flight were rescued.|$|E
25|$|During the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation, no {{evidence}} of failure or malfunction of the aircraft or any of its systems prior to the crash was found. Further examination of the engine found approximately five fluid ounces of jet fuel in the entire fuel system and that the engine had flamed out due to fuel starvation. The final report from the NTSB lists the probable causes as improper in-flight decisions and mismanagement of fuel by the pilot in command which led to fuel exhaustion. Also listed was improper operation of flight controls during the power-off <b>autorotation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The German Army {{operates}} {{a total of}} 14 EC135s as basic trainers at the School of Army Aviation in Bückeburg, these have had an average operational availability in excess of 95 per cent; in 2014, the German Army noted that there was potential for vibration-induced rotor cracking during <b>autorotation</b> training, shortening {{the life of the}} main rotor. In October 2014, the Australian Department of Defence announced that the EC135 would be procured as the primary training platform for both the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy. A total of 13 EC135 trainers have been procured by the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force, they have been designed as the TH-135.|$|E
25|$|An {{autogyro}} (from Greek αὐτός + γύρος, self-turning), {{also known}} as gyroplane, gyrocopter, or rotaplane, {{is a type of}} rotorcraft that uses an unpowered rotor in <b>autorotation</b> to develop lift, and an engine-powered propeller, similar to that of a fixed-wing aircraft, to provide thrust. While similar to a helicopter rotor in appearance, the autogyro's rotor must have air flowing through the rotor disc to generate rotation. Invented by the Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva to create an aircraft that could fly safely at low speeds, the autogyro was first flown on 9 January 1923, at Cuatro Vientos Airfield in Madrid. De la Cierva's aircraft resembled the fixed-wing aircraft of the day, with a front-mounted engine and propeller in a tractor configuration to pull the aircraft through the air.|$|E
25|$|Due to an {{increase}} in costs and in order to decrease the noise pollution for the population flight simulators are increasingly used. Only the essential elements of flight training are practised by using actual helicopters. By 2012 the German armed forces had intend to have implemented the new Tiger and NH-90 helicopters. Consequently, training on the Bell UH-1D was to be reduced and terminated in September 2010. The remaining Bell UH-1D helicopters were handed over to Faßberg Air Base where they will be flown until the delivery of the new NH-90 helicopter. The practicing of <b>autorotation</b> was to be continued at Celle as this could not be trained on the standard helicopter for initial flight training, the Eurocopter EC-135 stationed at the main base of Army Aviation School at Bückeburg. However, with the forthcoming discontinuation of flying activities at Celle Air Base, the practice of autoration will be trained elesewhere.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight test}} {{program is to}} involve {{a total of three}} prototypes, {{designated}} P1, P2, and P3. The first prototype, P1, performed early test flights during {{the first phase of the}} flight test program, during which the handling and attitude of the aircraft were explored and the flight envelope gradually expanded, including <b>autorotation</b> tests and being flown at up to 97 per cent of its maximum internal load takeoff weight. P2 and P3 are the main vehicles for airworthiness certification testing; they are more representative of production aircraft, their design incorporating several refinements that had been made based upon experiences with P1. Following on from EASA certification, Marenco aims to quickly achieve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification for the North American market as well. Completion of P1 was reportedly delayed by as much as six months due to the late delivery of its engine by Honeywell. In December 2013, the completed P1 was revealed to the public.|$|E
25|$|Turbine {{engines in}} use on today’s turbine-powered {{aircraft}} are very reliable. Engines operate efficiently with regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance. These units can have lives ranging {{in the thousands}} of hours of operation. However, engine malfunctions or failures occasionally occur that require an engine {{to be shut down}} in flight. Since multi-engine airplanes are designed to fly with one engine inoperative and flight crews are trained to fly with one engine inoperative, the in-flight shutdown of an engine typically does not constitute a serious safety of flight issue. Following an engine shutdown, a precautionary landing is usually performed with airport fire and rescue equipment positioned near the runway. Once the airplane lands, fire department personnel assist with inspecting the airplane to ensure it is safe before it taxis to its parking position. Turboprop-powered aircraft and turboshaft-powered helicopters are also powered by turbine engines and are subject to engine failures for many similar reasons as jet-powered aircraft. In the case of an engine failure in a helicopter, it is often possible for the pilot to enter <b>autorotation,</b> using the unpowered rotor to slow the aircraft's descent and provide a measure of control, usually allowing for a safe emergency landing even without engine power.|$|E
500|$|While {{technically}} {{capable of}} <b>autorotation</b> if both engines fail in helicopter mode, a safe landing is difficult; in 2005, {{a director of}} the Pentagon's testing office stated that in a loss of power while hovering below , emergency landings [...] "...are not likely to be survivable." [...] V-22 pilot Captain Justin [...] "Moon" [...] McKinney stated that: [...] "We can turn it into a plane and glide it down, just like a C-130." [...] A complete loss of power requires both engines to fail, as one engine can power both proprotors via interconnected drive shafts. Though vortex ring state (VRS) contributed to a deadly V-22 accident, flight testing found the aircraft to be less susceptible to the condition than conventional helicopters. A GAO report stated that the V-22 is [...] "less forgiving than conventional helicopters" [...] during this phenomenon. Several test flights to explore the V-22's VRS characteristics were canceled. The USMC trains pilots in the recognition of and recovery from VRS, and has instituted operational envelope limits and instrumentation to help pilots avoid VRS conditions.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 February 1941, the [...] 4° Stormo {{received}} C.200s from 54° Stormo. Once the <b>autorotation</b> problems {{had been}} resolved, the Macchis {{were regarded as}} [...] "very good machines, fast, manoeuvrable and strong" [...] by Italian pilots. [...] After intense training, on 1 April 1941, the 10° Gruppo (4° Stormo) moved to Ronchi dei Legionari airport and started active service. The C.200 subsequently saw action over Greece, Yugoslavia and the Balkans, frequently engaged in dogfights with British Gladiators and Hurricanes on the Balkans.|$|E
2500|$|Gurney flaps {{have found}} wide {{application}} on helicopter horizontal stabilizers, because they operate over {{a very wide}} range of {{both positive and negative}} angles of attack. At one extreme, in a high-powered climb, the negative angle of attack of the horizontal stabilizer can be as high as -25°; [...] at the other extreme, in <b>autorotation,</b> it may be +15°. As a result, at least half of all modern helicopters built in the West have them in one form or another.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main rotor}} system was {{originally}} {{based upon the}} rigid rotor technology developed by Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm for the MBB Bo 105; however, due to control problems experienced while at high speeds upon prototype aircraft, the rigid rotor was replaced with a semi-articulated one on production aircraft. The difficulties experienced with the early design of the main rotor {{was one of the}} factors contributing to the lengthy development time of the Gazelle. The individual rotor blades were crafted out of composite materials, primarily composed of fiberglass, and had been designed for an extremely long operational lifespan; composite rotor blades would become a common feature of later helicopters. The main rotor maintains a constant speed in normal flight, and is described as having a [...] "wide range of tolerance" [...] for <b>autorotation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On October 23, 1999, Harrison Ford was {{involved}} in the crash of a Bell 206L4 LongRanger helicopter (N36R). The NTSB accident report states that Ford was piloting the aircraft over the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita, California, on a routine training flight. While making his second attempt at an <b>autorotation</b> with powered recovery, Ford allowed the aircraft's altitude to drop to 150–200 feet before beginning power-up. The aircraft was unable to recover power before hitting the ground. The aircraft landed hard and began skidding forward in the loose gravel before one of its skids struck a partially embedded log, flipping the aircraft onto its side. Neither Ford nor the instructor pilot suffered any injuries, though the helicopter was seriously damaged. When asked about the incident by fellow pilot James Lipton in an interview on the TV show Inside the Actor's Studio, Ford replied, [...] "I broke it." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{flying in}} {{airplane}} mode, {{the majority of}} lift is produced by the AW609's wings, which are slightly forward-swept. Both the wing and the main fuselage are made largely of composite materials. The [...] wings feature flaperon control surfaces which are normally automatically controlled; in vertical flight, the flaperons drop to a 66-degree downwards angle to reduce the wing area being encountered by downwash from the proprotors. A high-mounted rudderless vertical stabiliser is attached {{the rear of the}} fuselage to stabilise flight while in aircraft mode. In the event of a single engine failure, either engine can provide power to both proprotors via a drive shaft; the AW609 is also capable of <b>autorotation.</b> The AW609 has been designed to develop Full Transport Category/Class 1 performance to operate safely even when flown under single engine conditions. It is equipped with a de-icing system, and is to be certified for flying into known icing conditions. Building on experiences with the V-22, the AW609 is outfitted with a sink rate warning system.|$|E
2500|$|The Rotachute was the {{eventual}} {{development of a}} concept devised by Raoul Hafner, an Austrian engineer who specialised in rotary wing design, and who {{had moved to the}} UK in 1933 to continue his research and development work. In 1940, he proposed the use of a single-place strap-on rotor kite in place of a conventional parachute, to deliver a soldier accurately to a battlefield. The proposal was made to the Air Ministry in the light of a shortage of silk for parachute manufacture. Hafner was briefly interned as an alien, but was released to pursue the feasibility of the idea at the Central Landing Establishment (CLE) located at RAF Ringway. In October 1940, work began on design and construction of rotor systems and scale models of rotor kites. The first models were made of wood and fabric, ballasted to represent a pilot, and had a rotor span of about 3ft (0.91 m). They were tested successfully by hand launching, but suffered buffeting and lack of <b>autorotation</b> when launched from aircraft at height. The third evolution, designated [...] "M.3", had metal rotor blades, and after further modifications made the first successful launch and descent from a De Havilland Tiger Moth. Further developments and tests continued into February 1941. The tenth evolution scale model (M.10) had mass-balanced wooden rotors, ballast of 100lb (45.3kg), and a rotor span of 10ft (3.05 m). On 14 March 1941, the M.10 model was successfully air-launched from a Boulton & Paul Overstrand.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} reason for <b>autorotation</b> is an engine {{malfunction}} or failure, but <b>autorotation</b> {{can also be}} performed {{in the event of}} a complete tail rotor failure, or following loss of tail-rotor effectiveness, since there is virtually no torque produced in an <b>autorotation.</b> If altitude permits, autorotations may also be used to recover from vortex ring state. In all cases, a successful landing depends on the helicopter's height and velocity at the commencement of <b>autorotation</b> (see height-velocity diagram).|$|E
50|$|A one-way {{sprag clutch}} {{is built into}} the center of the upper sheave to allow the rotor system to {{continue}} to rotate in the event of engine failure, allowing the R22 to enter <b>autorotation</b> and land in a controlled manner. Because the main rotor has very little mass and inertia, <b>autorotation</b> in an R22 requires careful and proper execution to assure a successful outcome. Much time is spent in training practicing various types of <b>autorotation.</b> Target speed in an <b>autorotation</b> is 65 kn and the glide ratio is approximately 4:1 in maximum-glide configuration.|$|E
50|$|For {{fixed-wing}} aircraft, <b>autorotation</b> is {{the tendency}} of an aircraft in or near a stall to roll spontaneously to the right or left, leading to a spin (a state of continuous <b>autorotation).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Again, a third kind of <b>autorotation</b> {{occurs in}} {{self-rotating}} bols, rotating parachutes, or rotating helical objects sometimes used as kite tails or kite-line laundry. This kind of <b>autorotation</b> drives {{wind and water}} propeller-type turbines, sometimes used to generate electricity.|$|E
