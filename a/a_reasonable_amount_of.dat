5|$|A {{fiberglass}} Space Race cabinet {{was designed}} for the game by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. The tall, angular cabinet, reminiscent of the fiberglass cabinet for Computer Space, {{was the first to}} display the Atari logo. The cabinet design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered using it for Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular cabinet. The final cabinet stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the molds to make the fiberglass cabinets cost US$2000 and could only make one per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough molds to make a full production run in <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time. The final Space Race cabinet was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong.|$|E
5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. <b>A</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Heuristic {{algorithms}} (or simply heuristics) are {{methods that}} seek for high quality solutions within <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> (limited) <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time {{without being able}} to guarantee optimality. They often come out as a result of imitation of the real world (physics, nature, biology, etc.). In this paper, we give an overview of some heuristic algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. At the beginning, some definitions related to combinatorial optimization, as well as the principle (framework) and basic features of the heuristics for combinatorial problems are concerned. Then, several popular heuristic algorithms are discussed, namely: descent local search, simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms, ant algorithms, and iterated local search. The unified paradigms of these heuristics are given. Finally, we present some results of comparisons of these algorithms for the well-known combinatorial problem, the quadratic assignment problem...|$|R

The best dietary sources include seafood (especially shellfish), organ meats (e.g., liver), whole grains, legumes (e.g., beans and lentils) and chocolate. Nuts, including peanuts and pecans, are especially rich in copper, as are grains such as wheat and rye, and several fruits including lemons and raisins. Other food sources that contain copper include cereals, potatoes, peas, red meat, mushrooms, some dark green leafy vegetables (such as kale), and fruits (coconuts, papaya and apples). Tea, rice and chicken are relatively low in copper, but can provide <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> copper when they are consumed in significant amounts.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, timpani were hand-tuned; that is, {{there was a}} {{sequence}} of screws with T-shaped handles, called taps, which altered {{the tension in the}} head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time for players to change notes if they were called to tune {{in the middle of a}} work. The first 'machine' timpani, with a single tuning handle, was developed in 1812. The first pedal timpani originated in Dresden in the 1870s and are called Dresden timpani for this reason. However, since vellum was used for the heads of the drums, automated solutions were difficult to implement since the tension would vary unpredictably across the drum. This could be compensated for by hand-tuning, but not easily by a pedal drum. Mechanisms continued to improve in the early 20th century.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a computer program that aligns spliced sequences to genomic sequences, using local alignment algorithms and heuristics {{to put together a}} global spliced alignment. Spidey can produce reliable alignments quickly, even when confronted with noise from alternative splicing, polymorphisms, sequencing errors, or evolutionary divergence.

Expressed sequences are the key to the inner workings of an organism. To understand fully the function of an expressed sequence, however, it needs to be put in its genomic context. Alignment of expressed sequences to their parent genomic sequences can be used to find or confirm a gene’s position, to locate potential regulatory elements, and to study paralogs, pseudogenes, and alternative splicing.

40|$|To {{find the}} native {{conformation}} (fold), proteins sample a subspace that is typically hundreds of {{orders of magnitude}} smaller than their full conformational space. Whether such fast folding is intrinsic or the result of natural selection, {{and what is the}} longest foldable protein, are open questions.

This size range is in general agreement with the experimental protein domain length distribution obtained from approximately 1, 200 proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Trp-cage protein confirm this picture on the free energy landscape. Our analytical and computational results are consistent with a model in which the length and time scales of protein folding, as well as the modular nature of large proteins, are dictated primarily by inherent physical forces, whereas natural selection determines the native state...|$|R
