5|$|Life Is Good {{features}} personal subject matter, {{themes of}} adulthood and nostalgia, and reflections on Nas' {{personal life and}} experience in hip hop. His rapping {{is characterized by a}} relaxed, plainspoken flow, internal rhymes, and <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> veers from malicious to nostalgic and introspective. The album's production incorporates orchestral elements and musical references to both contemporary and golden age hip hop, including boom bap beats and old school samples.|$|E
5|$|Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone {{as well as}} by its erratic, fantastical and {{fast-moving}} plot. A picaresque novel with a story {{similar to}} that of a more serious coming-of-age narrative (Bildungsroman), it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.|$|E

25|$|Narration describes, in <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> is {{at times}} enraptured {{and at other}} times pointedly cynical, Angelica's first visit to the Prince and his family {{following}} her betrothal to Tancredi. Dressed beautifully, she makes her entrance with perfect timing, and immediately endears herself to the Prince. Only Bendicò, growling in a corner, seems unhappy to see her. Finally, narration also describes how Angelica, as she's listening, coolly considers the financial and sexual prosperity that awaits them, and comments that, within a few years of the marriage, Angelica will become one of the great political kingmakers of the Italian Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Early on, McGuinty {{set down}} three {{strategic}} imperatives. First, no tax cuts. This ran against {{the conventional wisdom}} of politics {{that you had to}} offer tax cuts to win; everyone from Mike Harris to Bill Clinton had campaigned on reducing the tax burden on the middle class. But McGuinty was determined that Ontario voters would accept that the money was needed to restore public health care and education services. Second, a positive tone. McGuinty wanted to avoid the typical opposition leader role of automatically opposing whatever the government announced, and instead, set the agenda with positive alternatives. While attacking your opponent was important, that would be left to caucus surrogates. Third, one big team. At the time, the Ontario Liberal Party was riven into factions. Peterson-era people distrusted more recent arrivals. Jean Chrétien supporters fought with Paul Martin supporters. McGuinty set <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> divisions were left at the door.|$|E
500|$|Director Greg Beeman filmed {{the episode}} with <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> was thematically {{similar to a}} [...] "rising storm". According to Beeman, the episode would start very calm and then begin to build upon itself. As he explains: ...|$|E

500|$|Each half of {{the film}} focuses on a {{different}} revolution, both fundamentally the same in theory but vastly different in outcome, reflecting the Marxist notion of dialectics. Soderbergh wanted the film's two parts to mimic {{the voice of the}} two diaries they were based on; the Cuban diaries were written after the fact and, according to the director, [...] "with a certain hindsight and perspective and <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> comes from being victorious", while the Bolivian diaries were [...] "contemporaneous, and they're very isolated and have no perspective, at all. It's a much more tense read, because the outcome is totally unclear".|$|E
500|$|The {{legislature}} {{elected in}} the Know Nothing sweep was unlike any that preceded it: {{almost all of}} its members were new to elected office. [...] The 1855 session {{was one of the}} most productive in the state's history, with about 600 bills and resolutions passed. [...] In his inaugural address, Gardner set what he hoped was <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> would solidify his position has the party leader. [...] The speech focused almost to exclusion on nativist issues, and included hyperbolic claims that the level of immigration was reaching crisis proportions. Gardner notably omitted popular substantive reform issues such as the ten-hour workday, and also avoided the contentious subject of slavery.|$|E

500|$|Heider {{considered}} Terang Boelan {{one of the}} {{two most}} important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s; Balink's earlier film Pareh was the other. He notes that Terang Boelan [...] "set the tone for popular Indonesian cinema", <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> remained dominant into the 1990s. Biran considered the film {{a turning point in the}} history of Indonesian cinema, showing the possibilities of the medium and serving as a catalyst for further development. Said concurred, describing the film as a milestone in Indonesia's history because of the widespread formula it introduced. The repeated use of Terang Boelan formula has been criticised. The director Teguh Karya, for instance, denounced films that used it without building on it, leaving the formula [...] "undeveloped and static".|$|E
500|$|Her {{characteristic}} dimple {{has been}} cited by the media as her trademark. At {{the beginning of her}} career, she was often described by the press as having a vivacious personality and a bubbly, outgoing persona, an image she had confessed to disliking. According to film critic Sukanya Verma, Zinta's energetic nature extends from her real life into her appearances in films and {{is an integral part of}} her technique. In an article discussing Hindi film actresses and their flair for comedy, Verma wrote, [...] "What can you say about an actress who giggles non-stop in <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> is anything but prim and propah? She is carefree. She is animated. She talks non-stop. She laughs all the time. She has a chilled out sense of humour. And a tomboyish streak too. Preity Zinta is all that and more. All this greatly contributes to her style of acting." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{score was}} written by {{composer}} Patrick Doyle, a frequent collaborator of Branagh. Doyle described Thor as [...] "the most commercially high profile film I have done since Frankenstein", adding that the composing process had the challenge of trying to find <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> fit the duality of Asgard and Earth. Thus Doyle and Branagh had frequent discussions on the musical direction, with the director suggesting a contemporary feel and having {{a balance between the}} music and [...] "grand images [...] were not in any way hyperbolized", and the composer in turn implementing [...] "a strong sense of melody, which he responds to in my work". As Doyle declared that his own Celtic background made him familiar with Norse mythology, an old Celtic folk song also provided the inspiration for Thor's leitmotif. A soundtrack album was released by Buena Vista Records in April 2011.|$|E

5000|$|In {{practice}} and analysis, neighboring tones are sometimes differentiated depending upon {{whether or not}} they are lower or higher than the chord <b>tones</b> surrounding them. <b>A</b> neighboring <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> is <b>a</b> step higher than the surrounding chord <b>tones</b> is called <b>an</b> upper neighboring <b>tone</b> or <b>an</b> upper auxiliary note while <b>a</b> neighboring <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> is <b>a</b> step lower than the surrounding chord <b>tones</b> is <b>a</b> lower neighboring <b>tone</b> or lower auxiliary note. However, following Heinrich Schenker's usage in Free Composition, some authors reserve the term [...] "neighbor note" [...] to the lower neighbor a half step below the main note.|$|R
500|$|For the US press, Gary Arnold in The Washington Post {{thought the}} film was [...] "undeniably easy on the eyes", and further added [...] "maybe too easy to prevent the mind from {{wandering}} and the lids from drooping." [...] Arnold was also critical of the large set pieces, calling them [...] "more ponderous than sensational" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no equivalent of the classic action highlights that can be recalled readily from [...] "From Russia, With Love" [...] or [...] "You Only Live Twice" [...] or [...] "The Spy Who Loved Me" [...] or [...] "Moonraker." [...] This is a Bond waiting for something inspired to push it over the top." [...] The New York Times critic Vincent Canby said that [...] "For Your Eyes Only is not the best of the series by a long shot" [...] although he did say that the film is [...] "slick entertainment" [...] with <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> is [...] "consistently comic even when the material is not." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} praised for its {{political}} satire. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict called the episode a [...] "biting political satire {{in the guise}} of a children's oratory contest", that [...] "signifies that this season of the series will be all over the map, both emotionally and logically." [...] Gibron added: [...] "Everything, from the Reader's Digest rants to the formulaic speeches of the youths, has a resounding ring of truth. And once the story moves to Washington D.C, our nation's capital is in for a royal reaming as well." [...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said the episode solidified the series' politically satirical voice as it [...] "bitch slapped the Bush administration" [...] that would later badmouth The Simpsons. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, however, gave the episode a more negative review, stating that it [...] "has its moments but never seems like one of the series’ better programs. Part of that stems from its somewhat icky ending. The show exhibits <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> feels more appropriate to a less biting and cynical series. It starts well with Homer’s obsession with Reading Digest. After that, the show seems more erratic, and it remains pretty average overall." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, America's Got Talent, judge Piers Morgan said: [...] "I {{have never}} seen an act, on this show or the British show {{or any of the}} other talent shows in the world, with more {{potential}} than Jackie Evancho. [...] was perfection. Perfection!" [...] Christopher Hahn, General Director of the Pittsburgh Opera, observed: [...] "It's very unusual for a young child to have a voice that sounded so rich and developed." [...] "I thought she was just lovely, sweetly compelling". Hahn particularly praised Evancho's phrasing. Composer Tim Janis commented that Evancho [...] "takes a classical piece and makes it friendly and accessible. ... Her voice is so pure and natural, there's no flaw in it. People say 'I can hear her potential coming,' but no, it's here, it's now." [...] Claudia Benack, Assistant Professor of musical theatre at Carnegie Mellon University, said that Evancho [...] "has an unusually adult feel for the repertoire. ... She sings to the important part of the phrase, and then backs off. That's instinctual. ... She takes breaths sometimes where an adult would not, but that's just because she's young and little. ... She sings from the healthy part of her voice." [...] Jia Tolentino of The New Yorker later called Evancho's YouTube audition for AGT [...] "supernaturally blissful", and commented that she delivered [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] with [...] "graceful phrasing, a controlled, slow vibrato, and <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> resonates impersonally, like a bell." [...] Critic Tim Page, however, wrote that Evancho [...] "has many years of work ahead of her before she becomes any sort of musician." [...] Doctor Clark Rosen, director of the University of Pittsburgh Voice Center, noted that Evancho's talent is made possible by how her brain coordinates her body for singing.|$|E

[...] He wrote in <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> suggested he was {{a supporter of the}} British cause, but desired to promote international understanding, and that he was open to hearing all viewpoints.

2500|$|Many Synod fathers {{stressed}} the need for the Church to speak in <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> was positive, clear, simple, and which upheld the ideal family life as one that was obtainable. [...] Irish Archbishop Diarmuid Martin said that [...] "repeating doctrinal formulations alone will not bring the gospel and the good news of the family into an antagonistic society. We have to find a language which helps our young people to appreciate the newness and the challenge of the gospel." [...] Australian Archbishop Mark Coleridge agreed, saying [...] "crude and bleak readings" [...] of modern society [...] "are not what the doctor ordered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Sonnet 33 is {{considered}} {{a part of the}} group of Shakespearean sonnets addressed to a young man, there have been claims that the third quatrain of sonnet 33 may have been co-addressed to Shakespere's only son, Hamnet, who died in 1596 at the age of 11. As noted by Mark Schwartzberg of New York University, Shakespearean biographer Anthony Holden suggests that the death of Hamnet was [...] "one of the catalysts that sparked the change to a darker tone in his [...] work, <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>that</b> increasingly reflected personal grief". This change in tone is found in Hamlet, The Winter's Tale, and King John, which contained several, unexpected emotional moments.|$|E
