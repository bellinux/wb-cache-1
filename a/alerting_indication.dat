40|$|Confusion between similar drug names is {{a common}} cause of {{potentially}} harmful medication errors. Interventions to prevent these errors {{at the point of}} prescribing have had limited success. The {{purpose of this study is}} to measure whether <b>indication</b> <b>alerts</b> at the time of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) can intercept drug name confusion errors. A retrospective observational study of alerts provided to prescribers in a public, tertiary hospital and ambulatory practice with medication orders placed using CPOE. Consecutive patients seen from April 2006 through February 2012 were eligible if a clinician received an <b>indication</b> <b>alert</b> during ordering. A total of 54, 499 unique patients were included. The computerized decision support system prompted prescribers to enter indications when certain medications were ordered without a coded indication in the electronic problem list. Alerts required prescribers either to ignore them by clicking OK, to place a problem in the problem list, or to cancel the order. Main outcome was the proportion of <b>indication</b> <b>alerts</b> resulting in the interception of drug name confusion errors. Error interception was determined using an algorithm to identify instances in which an alert triggered, the initial medication order was not completed, and the same prescriber ordered a similar-sounding medication on the same patient within 5 minutes. Similarity was defined using standard text similarity measures. Two clinicians performed chart review of all cases to determine whether the first, non-completed medication order had a documented or non-documented, plausible indication for use. If either reviewer found a plausible indication, the case was not considered an error. We analyzed 127, 458 alerts and identified 176 intercepted drug name confusion errors, an interception rate of 0. 14 Â±. 01 %. <b>Indication</b> <b>alerts</b> intercepted 1. 4 drug name confusion errors per 1000 alerts.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the usefulness of occupant acceptance as a preliminary screen measure for offices' indoor air quality (IAQ). An effective <b>alert</b> <b>indication</b> of IAQ problems of a concerned indoor environment would help to promote good IAQ. Design/methodology/approach: The study evaluates {{the hypothesis that the}} occupant dissatisfaction with the overall indoor environment provides an indication of IAQ problems. Hence, occupant dissatisfaction would be used as a screening parameter to identify problematic IAQ regarding some IAQ criteria in subsequent IAQ assessments. The hypothesis was tested with a database of regional cross-sectional measurement in 490 offices within Hong Kong. Findings: The occupants' dissatisfaction with the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) was correlated with the IAQ assessment results of nine IAQ assessment parameters regarding some IAQ criteria for air-conditioned offices. At certain screening levels of predicted IEQ dissatisfaction, the performance of the proposed screening tool, indicating unsatisfactory office IAQ, was evaluated in terms of the test sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and Yule's Q statistics. The results showed that occupants' response to the indoor environment produced indications of unsatisfactory IAQ regarding the requirement of an "Excellent" office. Research limitations/implications: The subjective feelings of occupants are capable of identifying marked indoor environmental problems, but cannot identify the "marginal" IAQ problem cases. Practical implications: The study shows the usefulness of using occupant acceptance to identify the unrecognized IAQ problems for air-conditioned office environment. Using the identification model developed in the study, all the suspected cases were associated with a high chance of IAQ dissatisfaction and subsequent IAQ assessments were thus recommended. Originality/value: The paper proposes a new identification method to identify the unrecognized IAQ problems which may indicate unsatisfactory IAQ. Also, the occupants' responses on the indoor environment are quantified. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
30|$|Screening for {{potential}} endocrine disruptors in fish was approached {{based on evidence}} from structural alerts and in vitro and in vivo toxicological assays. First, structural <b>alerts</b> for the <b>indication</b> of potential estrogenic and androgenic endocrine activities were reviewed and refined based on in vitro studies. Then, consistencies between in silico structural alerts, in vitro assays, and in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies and fish life-cycle tests were assessed. Finally, the model was applied to EINECS to search {{for potential}} candidates for estrogenic and androgenic effects {{with regard to the}} environment.|$|R

25|$|Following {{the attack}} on the Sabalan, U.S. naval forces were ordered to assume a de-escalatory posture, giving Iran a way out and {{avoiding}} further combat. Iran took the offer and combat ceased, though both sides remained on alert, and near-clashes occurred throughout the night and into the next day as the forces steamed within the Gulf. Two days after the battle, the Lynde McCormick was directed to escort a U.S. oiler out through the Strait of Hormuz, while a Scandinavian-flagged merchant remained near, probably for protection. While the ships remained <b>alert,</b> no hostile <b>indications</b> were received, and the clash was over.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To provide {{recommendations}} for family physicians on the detection, assessment {{and management of}} abuse or mistreatment in patients over 65 years of age. OPTIONS: Detection of elder abuse by history and examination or by specific protocols; intervention through mandatory reporting, removing the victim from the situation or acting as an advocate for the patient. OUTCOMES: Termination of abusive situation and prevention of further abuse. EVIDENCE: A MEDLINE search was conducted {{with the use of}} medical subject headings "elder abuse" and "epidemiology" for articles published from January 1980 to October 1992 and headings "elder abuse" and "clinical trials" for articles published from January 1980 to February 1994. Standard references and review articles and their bibliographies were scrutinized, and experts were consulted. VALUES: The evidence-based methods and values of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination were used. Since senior citizens are among the most disadvantaged people in Canadian society, prevention of abuse and promotion of their autonomy were the highest values selected. BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: The principal benefits are cessation and prevention of abuse. Potential harms include the loss of a personal residence, the erosion of an established family structure and the loss of autonomy for the victim. RECOMMENDATIONS: There is poor evidence to include case finding for elder abuse in or exclude it from the periodic health examination. However, it is prudent for physicians to be <b>alert</b> for <b>indications</b> of elder abuse and, if such abuse is discovered, to take measures to prevent further abuse...|$|R
50|$|Blue Alert warnings, which {{indicate}} that a cyclone may affect the warning area within 48 hours, were issued for Cyclone Rosita on the morning on 19 April. They were upgraded to a Yellow <b>Alert</b> - an <b>indication</b> that a cyclone appears inevitable to affect the warning area in 12 hours - at 1 pm, then to a Red Alert - meaning the cyclone is imminent - at 8 pm. In general, residents were well informed of the warnings through the radio. Residents from the low-lying downtown areas evacuated to homes in more elevated locations. Two of the three available evacuation shelters were opened and co-ordinated by the Department of Family and Children's Services. 280 people took shelter in schools, while 78 residents from Bidyadanga were evacuated to Port Hedland or Broome. The people that stayed in the settlement sheltered {{in the church and}} family homes. Staff and guests at the Eco Beach tourist resort received warnings from Rosita early on 19 April and made a timely return to Broome before the cyclone hit.|$|R
5000|$|An alert by an scenting dog can be {{distinct}} from an indication (although {{for a dog}} that uses a natural indication, the two may not be distinguishable). Both involve being {{able to read the}} dog's behavior. Alerts are instances where an scenting dog detects human scent but has not located the subject or source. Alerts can be recognized by a change in the dog's behaviorâpointing, following a scent upwind, circling, or following scent up terrain or obstructions, for example. Recognizing an alert is important for any experienced handler, as the location of alerts along with wind conditions, environmental conditions, and terrain can be used by the handler to alter the search strategy. Regardless of whether the dog is trained to perform an indication on find, or whether the handler uses a natural indication on find, all handlers must be able to recognize an alert in order to effectively deploy their dog. Inexperienced handlers who use trained indications may have difficulty recognizing alerts, while handlers who rely on a natural indication {{may not be able to}} differentiate an <b>alert</b> from an <b>indication</b> (since the behaviors are essentially the same).|$|R

40|$|Background: The European chemicals' {{legislation}} REACH aims {{to protect}} {{man and the}} environment from substances of very high concern (SVHC). Chemicals like endocrine disruptors (EDs) {{may be subject to}} authorization. Identification of (potential) EDs with regard to the environment is limited because specific experimental assessments are not standard requirements under REACH. Evidence is based on a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments (if available), expert judgement, and structural analogy with known EDs. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to review and refine structural <b>alerts</b> for the <b>indication</b> of potential estrogenic and androgenic endocrine activities based on in vitro studies; to analyze in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies with regard to estrogen- and androgen-sensitive endpoints in order to identify potential indicators for endocrine activity with regard to the environment; to assess the consistency of potential estrogenic and androgenic endocrine activities based on in vitro assays and in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies and fish life-cycle tests; and to evaluate structural alerts, in vitro assays, and in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies for the indication of potential estrogenic and androgenic endocrine disruptors in fish. Results: Screening for potential endocrine activities in fish via estrogenic and androgenic modes of action based on structural alerts provides similar information as in vitro receptor-mediated assays. Additional evidence can be obtained from in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies. Conclusive confirmation is possible with fish lifecycle tests. Application of structural alerts to the more than 33, 000 discrete organic compounds of the EINECS inventory indicated 3585 chemicals (approx. 11 %) as potential candidates for estrogenic and androgenic effects that should be further investigated. Endocrine activities of the remaining substances cannot be excluded; however, because the structural alerts perform much better for substances with (very) high estrogenic and androgenic activities, there is reasonable probability that the most hazardous candidates have been identified. Conclusions: The combination of structural alerts, in vitro receptor-based assays, and in vivo mammalian studies may support the priority setting for further assessments of chemicals with potential environmental hazards due to estrogenic and androgenic activities...|$|R
40|$|Attacks {{propagated}} against IT {{systems and}} how they can be curbed has been an important information security issue in recent times. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are employed in the monitoring of computer systems for indications of security violations. On detecting such signs, alerts are triggered by the IDSs which are reported to the human analyst for further actions to be carried out. In some cases, such intrusions may go undetected thereby compromising the system or network. A n approach seen to be useful in identifying compromised systems as well as addressing the problem of the large number of false alerts generated by IDS systems is by looking at the type of responses that compromised systems may generate. However, not all generated <b>alerts</b> are true <b>indications</b> of a propagated attack. This research thesis reviewed existing {{research in the area of}} utilising detection of attack responses. Carrying out the project also involved researching threats facing IT systems as well as highlighting a broad classification of attacks that can be propagated against IT systems and networks. A number of attack responses rules and scenarios where they can be triggered were also researched. This was done in order to investigate ways that may enhance intrusion detection with attack responses thereby improving IT security in a general context. It was also done with the aim of highlighting the problems inherent with use of the detection of attack responses {{and how they}} can be addressed. The findings from the research analysis mostly centered on the various impacts vulnerability exploits had in aiding propagation of attacks on IT systems. Based on the analysis of the findings, the project put forward recommendations that may aid detection of intrusions amongst which were more effort to be made in automating IDS responses to attacks and a better interoperability between various IDS models. Adequately educating and training IT security personnel involved with IDS operations was also recommended by the project. Finally, the carrying out of this project is solely to contribute to the growing IDS technology knowledge and awareness as well as arouse the interest of any interested reading audience in the field of IT security. iiiSchool of Computing, Communications and Electronic...|$|R
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the 18th of September General Ord moved by rail to Burnsville, and there left the cars and moved out to perform his part of the programme. He was to get as near the enemy as {{possible}} during the day and intrench himself so as to hold his position until the next morning. Rosecrans was to be up by {{the morning of}} the 19th on the two roads before described, and the attack was to be from all three quarters simultaneously. Troops enough were left at Jacinto and Rienzi to detain any cavalry that Van Dorn might send out to make a sudden dash into Corinth until I could be notified. There was a telegraph wire along the railroad, so there would be no delay in communication. I detained cars and locomotives enough at Burnsville to transport the whole of Ord's command at once, and if Van Dorn had moved against Corinth instead of Iuka I could have thrown in reinforcements to the number of 7,000 or 8,000 before he could have arrived. I remained at Burnsville with a detachment of about 900 men from Ord's command and communicated with my two wings by courier. Ord met the advance of the enemy soon after leaving Burnsville. Quite a sharp engagement ensued, but he drove the rebels back with considerable loss, including one general officer killed. He maintained his position and was ready to attack by daylight the next morning. I was very much disappointed at receiving a dispatch from Rosecrans after midnight from Jacinto, twenty-two miles from Iuka, saying that some of his command had been delayed, and that the rear of his column was not yet up as far as Jacinto. He said, however, that he would still be at Iuka by two o'clock the next day. I did not believe this possible because of the distance and the condition of the roads, which was bad; besides, troops after a forced march of twenty miles are not in a good condition for fighting the moment they get through. It might do in marching to relieve a beleaguered garrison, but not to make an assault. I immediately sent Ord a copy of Rosecrans' dispatch and ordered him to be in readiness to attack the moment he heard the sound of guns to the south or south-east. He was instructed to notify his officers to be on the <b>alert</b> for any <b>indications</b> of battle. During the 19th the wind blew in the wrong direction to transmit sound either towards the point where Ord was, or to Burnsville where I had remained.|$|R
