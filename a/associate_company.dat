The licence was valid from 1 April 1966, for five years. The same month, the airline sold the DC-6A/B {{that had been}} acquired 18 months earlier. Nineteen sixty-six was also the year Neckermann und Reisen, the tour operator of West German mail-order concern Neckermann, contracted Lloyd International to launch a series of weekday IT flights from Tegel Airport {{in what used to}} be West Berlin's French sector in the days prior to Germany's reunification. These flights were operated with Britannias. They served principal European holiday resorts in the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. The combination of these flights with a similar series of weekend IT flights from Scotland on behalf of a British tour operator fully utilised one Britannia for that summer season.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1930s, as {{the pearl}} trade declined, {{interest}} {{grew in the}} oil possibilities of the region. On 5 January 1936, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC), an <b>associate</b> <b>company</b> of the Iraq Petroleum Company, entered into a concession agreement with the ruler, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan al Nahyan, to explore for oil. This {{was followed by a}} seventy-five-year concession signed in January 1939. However, owing to the desert terrain, inland exploration was fraught with difficulties. In 1953, D'Arcy Exploration Company, the exploration arm of BP, obtained an offshore concession which was then transferred to a company created to operate the concession: Abu Dhabi Marine Areas (ADMA) was a joint venture between BP and Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later Total). In 1958, using a marine drilling platform, the ADMA Enterprise, oil was struck in the Umm Shaif field at a depth of about [...] This was followed in 1959 by PDTC’s onshore discovery well at Murban No.3.|$|E
2500|$|After his {{assignment}} to Bahrain, Lees proceeded to Qatar {{to fend off}} the interest of Major Frank Holmes who had approached the shiekh for an oil concession. Lees visited Doha and made a one-day trip to a few outcrops of Qatar, which he rightly identified as Eocene limestone exposed on the crest of a gently-dipping anticline. Before leaving, Lees also obtained permission from the sheikh to explore the sheikhdom for the following two years. He did not visit the most promising oil propspect, Jebel Dukhan, and his prediction of finding oil was generally pessimistic, although he qualified this with the statement that [...] "if…Bahrain be drilled and proved successful, similar conditions may apply at Qatar." [...] The concession was allowed to lapse but, when oil was indeed stuck on Bahrain in 1933, Anglo-Persian began serious negotiations for an oil concession for Qatar, which they obtained in 1935. Then, on account of the Red Line Agreement, the company transferred the concession to the Qatar Petroleum Company, an <b>associate</b> <b>company</b> of the Iraq Petroleum Company.|$|E

2500|$|Evidence {{emerged in}} early 2002 of Telecom having {{exploited}} an ill-considered, or fraudulently made to order, [...] accounting standard (FRS38) to inflate its year 2001 reported profit by some $263m. This standard required holding companies to incorporate {{profits and losses}} of associate companies into their group accounts by way of [...] "equity accounting" [...] except when the associate is insolvent. Being insolvent has been wrongly taken as substantial evidence that the holding company will no longer share in the associates profits and losses. The <b>associate</b> <b>company</b> Southern Cross Cables paid Telecom $263m in dividends as per (note 2 of) Telecom’s 2001 annual accounts, $US200m as per [...] Southern Cross’s annual accounts. Southern Cross opened for (limited) business in November 2000 and its income from operations to 30 June 2001 was only $US13m ($US55m for the 2002 year). Southern Cross were insolvent {{to the extent of}} $US24m as at 30 June 2000 and this increased to $US280m as at June 2001 {{as a result of the}} dividends and other (net) expenses ($328m in 2002). [...] The dividends were treated as income in Telecom’s accounts there being nothing in FRS 28 to say that they should not be although such inclusion did breach an overall requirement that the accounts present a fair view.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922, the British {{government}} secured undertakings {{from the}} trucial rulers not to sign concessions with foreign companies. Aware {{of the potential}} for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were agreed with local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an <b>associate</b> <b>company</b> of IPC. APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the Red Line Agreement, which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a [...] bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of £1 million.|$|E
