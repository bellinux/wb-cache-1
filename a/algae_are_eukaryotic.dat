50|$|Algae are {{important}} as primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Most <b>algae</b> <b>are</b> <b>eukaryotic,</b> photosynthetic organisms {{that live in}} a wet environment. They are distinguished from the higher plants {{by a lack of}} true roots, stems or leaves. They do not flower. Many species are single-celled and microscopic (including phytoplankton and other microalgae); many others are multicellular to one degree or another, some of these growing to large size (for example, seaweeds such as kelp and Sargassum).|$|E
2500|$|Plants, animals, fungi, slime moulds, protozoa, and <b>algae</b> <b>are</b> all <b>eukaryotic.</b> These cells <b>are</b> {{about fifteen}} times wider than a typical {{prokaryote}} {{and can be}} as much as a thousand times greater in volume. The main distinguishing feature of eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes is [...] the presence of membrane-bound organelles (compartments) in which specific metabolic activities take place. Most important among these is a cell nucleus, an organelle that houses the cell's DNA. This nucleus gives the eukaryote its name, which means [...] "true kernel (nucleus)". Other differences include: ...|$|R
5000|$|Cyanotoxins are {{produced}} by cyanobacteria, a phylum of bacteria that obtain their energy through photosynthesis. The prefix cyan comes from the Greek κύανoς meaning [...] "a dark blue substance", and usually indicates any {{of a number of}} colours in the blue/green range of the spectrum. Cyanobacteria are commonly referred to as blue-green <b>algae.</b> Traditionally they <b>were</b> thought of as a form of <b>algae,</b> and <b>were</b> introduced as such in older textbooks. However modern sources tend to regard this as outdated; they are now considered to be more closely related to bacteria, and the term for true <b>algae</b> <b>is</b> restricted to <b>eukaryotic</b> organisms. Like true <b>algae,</b> cyanobacteria <b>are</b> photosynthetic and contain photosynthetic pigments, which is why they are usually green or blue.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{aspects of}} the history of photosynthetic hydrogen research, from the pioneering discovery of Hans Gaffron over 60 years ago to the potential exploitation of green algae in commercial H 2 -production. The trail started as a mere scientific curiosity, but promises to be a most important discovery, one that leads photosynthesis research to important commercial applications. Progress achieved in the field of photosynthetic hydrogen production by green algae includes elucidation of the mechanism, the ability to modify photosynthesis by physiological means and to produce bulk amounts of H 2 gas, and cloning of the [Fe]-hydrogenase genes in several green algal species. The original discovery It was Hans Gaffron (1902 – 1979) who discovered the hydrogen metabolism in unicellular green <b>algae,</b> which <b>are</b> <b>eukaryotic</b> organisms of oxygenic photosynthesis (Gaffron 1939, 1940). Homann (2003), in these history issues, has thoroughly covered the early days of research by Gaffron and his associates...|$|R
5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals <b>are</b> <b>eukaryotic</b> and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and <b>algae.</b> They <b>are</b> also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|R

50|$|The <b>algae</b> <b>are</b> a {{large and}} diverse group of {{photosynthetic}} organisms. Many studies of algae include the cyanobacteria, in addition to micro and macro eukaryotic types that inhabit both fresh and saltwater. Currently, about 10,000 to 12,000 species of <b>algae</b> <b>are</b> known for Australia. The algal flora of Australia is unevenly documented: northern Australia remains largely uncollected for seaweeds and marine phytoplankton, descriptions of freshwater <b>algae</b> <b>are</b> patchy, and the collection of terrestrial <b>algae</b> has <b>been</b> almost completely neglected.|$|R

30|$|Algal biomass was {{primarily}} collected from ponds {{which are used}} for pisciculture at Punjab Agricultural University campus, Punjab, India. In these ponds, culture and experiments on commercial fish take place throughout the year. These ponds get cleaned in winter. Huge algal blooms take place in these ponds at this time. These <b>algae</b> <b>are</b> thrown away to re-prepare the ponds. Some specimens of <b>algae</b> <b>were</b> collected from Simlapuri Nahar (canal) of Ludhiana, Punjab. These algae, collected from these two sites, were chosen for the experiment as they are (1) economically unimportant, (2) easily available and (3) not used by any one for any purpose.

40|$|Crustose coralline <b>algae</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} {{components of}} tropical reef communities because they promote successful settlement by corals {{and contribute to}} solidification of the reef framework. We show experimentally that crustose coralline <b>algae</b> <b>are</b> also capable of suppressing the growth and recruitment potential of an abundant Hawaiian reef macroalga, Ulva fasciata. When mixed communities of crustose coralline <b>algae</b> <b>were</b> absent, relative growth rates of U. fasciata increased by 54. 6 %. When experimental nutrient additions were used to induce algal spore release, effective recruitment of U. fasciata approached zero only when crustose coralline <b>algae</b> <b>were</b> present. Mixed communities of crustose coralline <b>algae</b> <b>are</b> thus capable of limiting the local abundance of already-established macroalgae by reducing both their growth rate and recruitment success. This experimental observation was confirmed by field surveys. Because crustose coralline species also induce settlement and metamorphosis in {{a large number of}} scleractinian coral species, their abundance and species composition are expected to affect the (future) abundance of macroalgae and corals, which are often used to characterize degraded and 'healthy' reefs, respectively...|$|R
