50|$|In {{condensation}} reactions a small molecule, usually water, {{is split}} off when two reactants combine in a chemical reaction. The opposite reaction, when water is consumed in a reaction, is called hydrolysis. Many Polymerization reactions {{are derived from}} organic reactions.

Comparison with ground-based controls showed that the 4. 98 micron-size flight sample was the more uniform; the uniformity at the other two sizes was about the same.

40|$|Man-made {{polymers}} {{are compared}} with certain naturally occurring polymers which {{have long been}} used at elevated temperatures. The pyrolysis of model compounds is discussed together with aspects of thermogravimetric analysis, torsional braid analysis, and questions of chemical and radiation stability. Some structure-property relationships are examined, giving attention to asbestos, mica, graphite, and diamond. Questions of bond strengths are investigated along with the stability of ladder polymers and some fundamental concepts in the synthesis of aromatic and heteroaromatic polymers. The substances considered include aromatic single-strand polymers, heteroaromatic polymers, polymers obtained by <b>addition</b> <b>polymerizations,</b> and nonhydrogen-containing polymers.

5000|$|The {{problem of}} heat {{transfer}} {{is compounded by}} the highly exothermic nature of free radical <b>addition</b> <b>polymerization.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{forms of}} chain growth {{polymerization}} include cationic <b>addition</b> <b>polymerization</b> and anionic <b>addition</b> <b>polymerization.</b> While {{not used to}} a large extent in industry yet due to stringent reaction conditions such as lack of water and oxygen, these methods provide ways to polymerize some monomers that cannot be polymerized by free radical methods such as polypropylene. Cationic and anionic mechanisms are also more ideally suited for living polymerizations, although free radical living polymerizations have also been developed.|$|E
50|$|Anionic <b>addition</b> <b>polymerizations</b> have {{no formal}} {{termination}} pathways because proton transfer from solvent or other positive species does not occur. However, termination can occur through unintentional quenching due to trace impurities. This includes trace amounts of oxygen, carbon dioxide or water. Intentional termination can occur through {{the addition of}} water or alcohol. Another method of termination, chain transfer, can occur when an agent {{can act as a}} Brønsted acid. In this case, the pKa value of the agent is similar to the conjugate acid of the propagating carbanionic chain end. Spontaneous termination occurs because the concentration of carbanion centers decay over time and eventually results in hydride elimination. Polar monomers are more reactive because they are stabilized by their polar substituents. These polar substituents can react with nucleophiles which results in termination as well as side reactions that compete with both initiation and propagation.|$|R
25|$|This {{limitation}} can {{be overcome}} by polymerizing directly on the surface. This process {{is referred to as}} grafting from, or surface-initiated polymerization (SIP). As the name suggests, the initiator molecules must be immobilized on the solid surface. Like other polymerization methods, SIP can be tailored to follow radical, anionic, or cationic mechanisms and can be controlled utilizing reversible <b>addition</b> transfer <b>polymerization</b> (RAFT), atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), or nitroxide-mediated techniques.|$|R

Microparticles with an average diameter of 4. 1 µm and with inherent tetrazole-ene dual functionality are prepared by a one-pot off-stoichiometric thiol-Michael <b>addition</b> dispersion <b>polymerization.</b> The NITEC reaction is performed efficiently in the solid phase by UV irradiation, leading {{to the formation of}} fluorescent pyrozoline adducts, with an estimated quantum yield of 0. 7. Particle concentration-independent reaction kinetics are observed and full conversion is reached within 10 min of UV exposure at an intensity of 8 mW cm− 2. Temporal control is demonstrated with either UV or rooftop sunlight irradiation of variable duration. By using two-photon writing with a laser centered around 700 nm wavelength, spatial control is demonstrated with micrometer-scale resolution via surface patterning of the microparticles. Further, microparticles with exclusive tetrazole functionality are prepared by a one-pot, two-step thiol-Michael <b>addition</b> dispersion <b>polymerization.</b> The NITEC reaction between tetrazole-functional particles and acrylates in solution is examined at various tetrazole/alkene molar ratios, and a 10 : 1 excess of alkenes in solution is found necessary for efficient functionalization...|$|R

This polymerization is carried out through a carbanion active species. Like all chain-growth polymerizations, it takes place in three steps: chain initiation, chain propagation, and chain termination. Living polymerizations, which lack a formal termination pathway, occur in many anionic addition polymerizations. The advantage of living anionic addition polymerizations is that they allow for the control of structure and composition.|$|E

Epoxides (ethylene oxide and/or 1, 2 -butylene oxide) were first polymerized from a monoalcohol {{in the presence of}} a strong phosphazene base promoter (t-BuP 4). Then an excess of diphenyl phosphate (DPP) was introduced, followed by the <b>addition</b> and <b>polymerization</b> of a cyclic ester (ε-caprolactone or δ-valerolactone) or a cyclic carbonate (trimethylene carbonate), where DPP acted as both the neutralizer of phosphazenium alkoxide (polyether chain end) and the activator of cyclic ester/carbonate.
