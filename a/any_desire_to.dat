5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I am no politician, nor have I <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> be one. In {{the course of}} my commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} the play takes place {{over the course of}} 12 years (1624 to 1636), {{represented}} in 12 scenes. Some give a sense of Courage's career, but do not provide time for viewers to develop sentimental feelings and empathize with any of the characters. Meanwhile, Mother Courage is not depicted as a noble character. The Brechtian epic theatre distinguished itself from the ancient Greek tragedies, in which the heroes are far above the average. Neither does Brecht's ending of his play inspire <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> imitate the main character, Mother Courage.|$|E
25|$|The {{roles of}} each {{character}} are strongly {{defined in the}} series: Fred is the leader and the determined detective, Velma is the intelligent analyst, Daphne is danger-prone, Shaggy is a coward more motivated by hunger than <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> solve mysteries, and Scooby is similar to Shaggy, save for a Bob Hope-inspired tendency towards temporary bravery. Later versions of the show would make slight changes to the characters' established roles, most notably {{in the character of}} Daphne, shown in 1990s and 2000s Scooby-Doo productions as knowing many forms of karate and having the ability to defend herself, and less of a tendency towards getting kidnapped.|$|E

25|$|Philby, a known anti-Zionist, {{outlined}} {{a plan to}} reach a compromise with Zionism, after consultation with Arab leaders, and it was reported in The New York Times in October 1929. The Plan foresaw a shared confirmation of the Balfour Declaration and continued Jewish immigration into Palestine {{in exchange for a}} renunciation by Zionists of <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> seek political dominance. Representation of the two groups would be based on respecting the numerical proportions between the two groups. Judah Magnes, chancellor of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a member of Brit Shalom, reacted to the proposal positively, and suggested alterations in order to secure guarantees for the Jewish minority.|$|E
25|$|The Bistromath arrives {{too late}} {{at the gate}} to stop the robots, so its {{occupants}} transport to the planet to attempt {{to negotiate with the}} Krikkit people. To their surprise, they find that the people seem to lack <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> continue the war, and are directed to the robot and spaceship facilities in orbit about the planet. With Zaphod and Marvin's help, the group is able to infiltrate the facilities. Trillian deduces that the Krikkiters have been manipulated, reasoning that the people of Krikkit could not simultaneously be smart enough to develop their ultimate weapon—a bomb that could destroy every star in the universe—while also being stupid enough not to realise that this weapon would also destroy them.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{returning}} to London on 16 December, James was welcomed by cheering crowds. He took heart {{at this and}} attempted to recommence government, even presiding over {{a meeting of the}} Privy Council. He sent the Earl of Feversham to William to arrange for a personal meeting to continue negotiations. Now for the first time it became evident that William had no longer <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> keep James in power in England. He was extremely dismayed by the arrival of Lord Feversham. He refused the suggestion that he simply arrest James because this would violate his own declarations and burden his relationship with his wife. In the end it was decided that he should exploit James's fears; the three original commissioners were sent back to James with the message that William felt he could no longer guarantee the king's well-being and that James for his own safety had better leave London for Ham.|$|E

25|$|Fasting is also {{encouraged}} for members <b>any</b> time they <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> grow closer to God and to exercise self-mastery of spirit over body. Members may also implement personal, family or group fasts <b>any</b> time they <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> solicit special blessings from God, including health or comfort for themselves or others.|$|R
5000|$|Marvin's first passion ironically, was not music. He first <b>desired</b> <b>to</b> {{follow in}} the {{footsteps}} of his childhood hero and basketball great, Isiah Thomas. However, his passion for music soon overtook <b>any</b> <b>desires</b> <b>to</b> play professional basketball. Marvin's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> write songs and produce music grew strong as he watched his older brother, Mario, develop his production skills in the basement of their home. He also studied his father when he used the living room piano to write songs that later became world-renowned. Inevitably, the writing bug also bit Marvin and at the age of 10 with his first attempt at songwriting, entitled, [...] "People", he stumbled into the family business! ...|$|R
25|$|The then {{deputy head}} of the IDF, Ehud Barak, disavowing <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> fire at {{children}} stated at the time that, 'when you see a child, you don't shoot'. A new military device which hurled out pebbles at high speed was also deployed. IDF forces were permitted to respond to stone-throwing with lethal fire even when it posed no risk to their lives. From the outset, in Gaza, tire-burning and stone throwing was answered with fire from M16 assault rifles. Those caught were given exemplary punishments: 4 teenagers in Gaza alone were given prison sentences of 10–14 years for throwing stones and Molotov cocktails, compared to 13 years for Sheikh Yassin, the leader of Hamas at the time, for having creating clandestine weapon caches in Gaza back in 1983. Where earlier, disturbances by schoolchildren such as raising the Palestinian flag, had been negotiated by the IDF, harsh measures under the new policy led to immediate quelling by military force.|$|E
25|$|Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen, {{treasurer}} of Oslo AUF from 1992 to 1994, had at first denied {{to testify in}} the case, after advice from his defense attorney, but chose to change his mind. He told the court that the Oslo Labour Party pressured the Oslo AUF to maintain high membership numbers, {{in order to maintain}} their strong influence within AUF. He also told the court that the four accused members tried to keep the money advancements a secret, because they all knew that the practice was illegal. He also admitted that the leadership of AUF in the years between 1992 and 1994 conspired to inflate membership numbers in order to receive higher government subsidies. The leadership regularly paid membership fees for those members who did not pay their fees. In 1993, they also decided to pay membership fees for people who had never expressed <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> be members of AUF. He also admitted that the four of them met at Hornslien's parliament office to discuss the situation after Verdens Gang broke the story.|$|E

"He swore, moreover, {{and did not}} repent of what he said, that {{if anyone}} {{belonging}} to that perverse sect should presume to preach in his diocese, they {{should be taken to}} the fire or beheaded. Consequently, having understood this, no one belonging to that tendency had <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> embrace martyrdom, with the result that, up to now, the faith and true religion have remained unaffected within the bounds of his episcopal authority."

500|$|... {{all came}} down to one {{sentence}} in the [...] "X" [...] article where I said that wherever these people, meaning the Soviet leadership, confronted us with dangerous hostility anywhere in the world, we should {{do everything possible to}} contain it and not let them expand any further. I should have explained that I didn't suspect them of <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> launch an attack on us. This was right after the war, and it was absurd to suppose {{that they were going to}} turn around and attack the United States. I didn't think I needed to explain that, but I obviously should have done it.|$|E
500|$|Jim's plan to {{consolidate}} three employee birthdays into a combined birthday party encounters several complications, and his constant adjustments incur {{the ire of}} Party Planning Committee chair Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey). [...] Later, Jim discovers that no one likes his idea for a combined party, realizing {{the depth of his}} error when Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) mistakenly refers to him as Michael, and he returns to the original plan of having separate parties. Michael and Dwight return lightening the mood amongst the employees and for the lighting of Creed Bratton's (portrayed by the actor of the same name) birthday cobbler, with Michael expressing that he no longer has <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> return to the wilderness and Jim expressing his relief that Michael has returned to run the office.|$|E
500|$|... "North by North Quahog", which premiered May 1, 2005, was {{the first}} episode to be {{broadcast}} after the show's hiatus. It was written by MacFarlane and directed by Peter Shin. MacFarlane believed the show's three-year hiatus was beneficial because animated shows do not normally have hiatuses, and {{towards the end of}} their seasons, [...] "...you see a lot more sex jokes and bodily function jokes and signs of a fatigued staff that their brains are just fried". With [...] "North by North Quahog", the writing staff tried to keep the show [...] "exactly as it was" [...] before its cancellation, and [...] "None of us had <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> make it look any slicker".

[...] Despite his general sympathy with the aims of the UFA, he could not support their transition into a political party. For one, he disagreed with the UFA's belief that politics should be conducted along class, rather than ideological, lines. [...] Stewart believed that [...] "the more strongly armed the classes become the harder will it be to get the things we really need in our government" [...] and asserted that [...] "I never did and never will have <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> form a coalition with anybody except with men who think the same as I do." ...|$|E
500|$|Brimsek {{was born}} in the hockey hotbed of Eveleth, Minnesota on September 26, 1915. His parents were of Slovene descent. The town of Eveleth {{produced}} at that time four other hockey players who would play in the National Hockey League (NHL): Mike Karakas, Sam LoPresti, Al Suomi and John Mariucci. [...] Brimsek and Karakas played on the same baseball team in high school. Brimsek first started playing hockey when his brother, John, the second-string goalie on the Eveleth High School team, expressed his desire to be a defenseman instead. John was moved to his desired position, while Frank replaced him. Soon, Brimsek found himself spending most of his spare time on the Eveleth rinks playing hockey. Unlike most of his friends who wanted to be high-scoring forwards, Brimsek never showed <b>any</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> play any other position except for goalie. Just before winter, Brimsek ...|$|E

2500|$|Sempill's motives remain unclear.
