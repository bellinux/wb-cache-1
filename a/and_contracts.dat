The auditor checks all expenditures and may refuse to allow specific ones, usually based on financial reasons.|$|E

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to {{the debate on the}} relation between trust and control in the management of inter-organizational relations. More specifically, we focus on the question how trust <b>and</b> formal <b>contract</b> are related. While there have been studies on whether trust <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> are substitutes or complements, they offer little insight into the dynamic interaction between the two. They fail to answer, first, whether contract precedes trust or follows it, in other words, what causal relationship exists between the concepts; second, how and why trust <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> can substitute or complement each other; and third, how the various combinations of trust <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> affect a relationship’s development and outcome. In search of answers, we conducted longitudinal case studies to reveal the relationship between trust, <b>contract</b> <b>and</b> relationship outcome in complex inter-firm relationships. We find trust <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> to be both complements and substitutes and find that a close study of a contract’s content offers alternative insight into the presence <b>and</b> use of <b>contracts</b> in inter-firm relationships...|$|R

The article is based upon a quantitative analysis of 180 questionnaire responses provided by procurement <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> managers.

5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools <b>and</b> <b>contracts.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, and as {{a result}} of Europe's debt crisis that {{resulted}} in PSA Peugeot Citroën (PSA) Group slow sales, Mitsubishi Motors announced the suspension of its supply of the i-MiEV electric vehicle to PSA, although the period for supplying vehicles under their contract as part of original equipment manufacturer agreements has not yet ended. The suspension is part of the decision of several Japanese manufacturers to suspend their joint development projects <b>and</b> <b>contracts</b> with several European partners. By early August 2012, PSA had sold a total of 6,575 Peugeot iOns and Citroën C-Zeros since their launch in Europe in 2010, while Mitsubishi had assembled almost 11,000 electric cars destined to PSA, leaving the French carmaker with more than 4,400 electric cars in unsold inventory. PSA only sold 50% of the sales target set for 2011 and according to PSA the supply was only temporarily interrupted.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations <b>and</b> <b>contracts</b> that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E

The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July.
