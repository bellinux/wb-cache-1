5|$|The Buckleyi Group {{contains}} all cultivars {{with at least}} some features clearly showing inheritance from S. russelliana: stem segments with rounded, more symmetrical teeth; more or less symmetrical (regular) flowers which hang down, below the horizontal; and pollen which is pink. They generally flower later than members of the Truncata Group <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be called Christmas cactus.|$|E
5|$|Social wasps are {{considered}} pests {{when they become}} excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to {{come into contact with}} humans; if people then respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the wasps may sting if people come close to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases, people may suffer life-threatening anaphylactic shock.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} is very {{efficient}} at eating its prey; {{not only is}} it able to splinter and eat the largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. They react to alighting vultures more readily than other African carnivores, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.|$|E

50|$|Gay {{and lesbian}} youth who attempt suicide are disproportionately subject to anti-gay attitudes, and have weaker skills {{for coping with}} discrimination, isolation, <b>and</b> loneliness, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to {{experience}} family rejection {{than those who do}} not attempt suicide. Another study found that gay and bisexual youth who attempted suicide had more feminine gender roles, adopted an LGB identity at a young age <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than peers to report sexual abuse, drug abuse, and arrests for misconduct.|$|R

5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{seven to eight}} years old, and males at seven to 10 years. The {{beginning}} of a female's ovulation is {{a signal to the}} males that she is ready to mate. During ovulation, the skin of the female's anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. The swelling makes it difficult to move and increases the female's chance of microbial or parasitic infection. Females with more swollen anogenital areas reproduce while younger, produce more offspring per year, and those offspring {{have a better chance of}} surviving. These females also attract more males, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to cause aggressive fights between them. Olive baboons tend to mate promiscuously. A male forms a mating consortship with an estrous female, staying close to and copulating with her. Males guard their partner against any other male trying to mate with her. Unless a female is in a multiday consortship, she often copulates with more than one male each day. Multiple copulations are not necessary for reproduction, but may function to make the actual paternity of the female's offspring ambiguous. This lack of paternal certainty could help reduce the occurrence of infanticide. Occasionally, male olive baboons monopolize a female for her entire period of probable conception. The male protects his female from being mated by other males during consortship.|$|E
5|$|The Oddo–Harkins rule {{holds that}} {{elements}} with even atomic numbers {{are more common}} that those with odd atomic numbers, {{with the exception of}} hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to capture another, thus increasing their atomic number. In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability. All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them (the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals) in the Solar System. The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis. Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both Big Bang nucleosynthesis and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons, and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triple-alpha process, fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon, and skipping over those three elements.|$|E
50|$|The hexagon is {{typically}} a smaller diameter {{than would be}} used with an external cap, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to round off its contact surfaces.|$|R

25|$|The teacher {{workforce}} after intervention {{across all}} models <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> white, younger, <b>and</b> less experienced, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have provisional certification than {{teachers who were}} at those schools before the intervention.|$|R
25|$|This {{suggests}} that viruses possessing mutations to these exposed sites benefit from positive selection <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than viruses lacking such mutations {{to take over}} the influenza population.|$|E
25|$|People with CKD {{suffer from}} {{accelerated}} atherosclerosis <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to develop cardiovascular disease {{than the general}} population. Patients afflicted with CKD and cardiovascular disease tend to have significantly worse prognoses than those suffering only from the latter.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, late-maturing boys develop lower {{self-esteem}} and confidence and generally have lower popularity among peers, {{due to their}} less-developed physiques. Also, they experience problems with anxiety and depression <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{to be afraid of}} sex than other boys.|$|E
50|$|Gay {{and lesbian}} youth who attempt suicide are disproportionately subject to anti-gay attitudes, often have fewer skills {{for coping with}} discrimination, isolation, <b>and</b> loneliness, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to {{experience}} family rejection {{than those who do}} not attempt suicide. Another study found that gay and bisexual youth who attempted suicide had more feminine gender roles, adopted a non-heterosexual identity at a young age <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than peers to report sexual abuse, drug abuse, and arrests for misconduct. One study found that same-sex sexual behavior, but not homosexual attraction or homosexual identity, was significantly predictive of suicide among Norwegian adolescents.|$|R
5000|$|Acute {{bacterial}} endocarditis (ABE) is a fulminant illness over days to weeks(<2weeks), <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> due to Staphylococcus aureus which has much greater virulence, or disease-producing capacity and frequently causes metastatic infection.|$|R

25|$|Esophageal varices {{result from}} {{collateral}} portal blood flow through {{vessels in the}} stomach and esophagus (a process called portacaval anastomosis). When these blood vessels become enlarged, they are called varices <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to rupture. Variceal rupture often leads to severe bleeding, which can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|Adolescents {{whose parents}} {{talked to them}} {{at a young age}} felt more {{comfortable}} as they grew <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to make personal decisions about sexual behavior that reflects the parental values and morals.|$|R
25|$|Acute {{bacterial}} endocarditis (ABE) is a fulminant illness over {{days to weeks}} (<2 weeks), <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> due to Staphylococcus aureus which has much greater virulence, or disease-producing capacity and frequently causes metastatic infection.|$|R
25|$|Race, {{ethnicity}} {{and socioeconomic status}} affect choice and duration in the United States. A 2011 study found that on average, US women who breastfed had higher levels of education, <b>were</b> older <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> white.|$|R
25|$|Agreeableness is {{negatively}} correlated with income, although agreeable people can be less disruptive in teams <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be liked, although not necessarily respected, by their coworkers. Less agreeable people tend to make more effective managers, perhaps {{because it is not}} easy to take advantage of them.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} birds for Trinidad and Tobago are {{the scarlet}} ibis and the cocrico. The Scarlet Ibis is kept safe {{by the government}} by living in the Caroni Bird Sanctuary which {{was set up by}} the government for the protection of these birds. The Cocrico is more indigenous to the island of Tobago <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be seen in the forest.|$|E
25|$|Health {{differentials}} amongst races {{can also}} serve as determining factors for other facets of life, including income and marital status. AIDS-affected Hispanic women hold smaller salaries than average women, are part of poorer families, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to head households. According to one study, black teenage women living in dysfunctional homes {{were more likely to}} have serious health issues for themselves or children.|$|E
30|$|When the {{consumer}} trusts the producer, the certified price premium will <b>be</b> reduced <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> {{overwhelmed by the}} negative aspects of certification. This is especially true when the producer’s quality claims are consistent with {{the consumer}}’s preferences.|$|R
50|$|Known {{occurrence}} of Sphagnum fuscus {{are on the}} map above. The moss inhabits boreal forests and marshlands primarily, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> found in colder climates. The moss is also capable of inhabiting areas of relatively high elevation.|$|R
50|$|Chain rode is {{relatively}} heavy but resists abrasion from coral sharp rocks or shellfish beds which may abrade a pure rope warp. Fibre rope <b>is</b> <b>more</b> susceptible to abrasion on the seabed or obstructions, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to fail without warning.|$|R
25|$|Wildlife is {{abundant}} {{on the slopes}} of Blue Knob. Species such as white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse, turkey, coyote, porcupine and fox are difficult to see, but finding their tracks in the snow is not uncommon. Black bears are also resident on the mountain <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be seen during the early morning and evening hours. Red-tailed hawks, warblers, vireos and songbirds are found here throughout the seasons.|$|E
25|$|In Beattie and Butterworth's (1979) study, low {{frequency}} content words and those rated as contextually improbable were preceded by hesitations such as fillers. Speakers, when choosing to use {{low frequency}} words in their speech, are aware, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be disfluent. This is further supported by Schnadt and Corley {{where they found}} that prolongations and fillers increased in words just before multiple-named or low frequency items.|$|E
25|$|Wife beating {{was made}} illegal nationally in the United States by 1920. Although the exact rates are disputed, {{there is a}} large body of {{cross-cultural}} evidence that women are subjected to domestic violence significantly more often than men. In addition, there is broad consensus that women are more often subjected to severe forms of abuse <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be injured by an abusive partner, and this is exacerbated by economic or social dependence.|$|E
5000|$|Demodex folliculorum, a {{microscopic}} mite that feeds on the sebum {{produced by the}} sebaceous glands, denies hair essential nutrients and can cause thinning. Demodex folliculorum is not present on every scalp <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{to live in an}} excessively oily scalp environment.|$|R
5000|$|Call {{attention}} to people's mistakes indirectly. No {{one likes to}} make mistakes, especially in front of others. Scolding and blaming only serves to humiliate. If we subtly and indirectly show people mistakes, they will appreciate us <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to improve.|$|R
5000|$|In the Northern States, African-Americans {{had more}} access to formal {{schooling}} <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have basic reading and writing skills. The Quakers were important in establishing education programs in the North {{in the years before}} and after the Revolutionary War.|$|R
