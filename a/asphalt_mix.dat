5000|$|FMA is a gap-graded {{mix with}} a high coarse {{aggregate}} (stone) content of 70-80 %, binder (asphalt) content of 6 % and filler (limestone sand) content of around 7-11 %. The percentage of cellulose fibre that {{is required for the}} FMA is 0.4 % and air voids of around 4 %. The skeletal formation of the coarse aggregate provides high resistance to deformation. Adding the fibres to the binder will prevent the asphalt from draining off during storage, transport and paving. The mastic fills the voids and retaining the aggregate in place. It has an additional stabilising effect, as well as providing the designed air voids. The result is a highly durable rut resistant <b>asphalt</b> <b>mix.</b> FMA can be used on all types of road and it is suitable for roads with heavy traffic loads and frequency. It is high binder content gives a longer lifetime than conventional mixes. Furthermore, it allows for the bitumen to bulk or thicken in order to prevent it from running off the aggregate before compaction. Its coarse and open texture generally provides high skid resistance at all speeds, as well as good drainage and fewer spray problems. Modification and stabilization of the asphalt binder is the approach to improve the pavement performance especially for the gap-graded mixtures such as FMA, which required higher viscosity asphalt binder. The method for this asphalt binder modification is by adding cellulose fibre and other oil- based materials are being used to enhance the viscosity of the base binder.|$|E
5000|$|StreetPlanter: Bio-retention Cells are {{depressions}} {{that contain}} vegetation grown in an engineered soil mixture placed above a gravel drainage bed. They provide storage, infiltration and evaporation of both direct rainfall and runoff captured from surrounding areas. Street planters consist of concrete boxes {{filled with an}} engineered soil that supports vegetative growth. Beneath the soil is a gravel bed that provides additional storage. The walls of a planter extend 3 to 12 inches above the soil bed to allow for ponding within the unit. The thickness of the soil growing medium ranges from 6 to 24 inches while gravel beds are 6 to 18 inches in depth. The planter's capture ratio is the ratio of its area to the impervious area whoserunoff it captures. Raingarden:Rain Gardens are a type of bio-retention cell consisting of just the engineered soil layer with no gravel bed below it.Rain Gardens are shallow depressions filled with an engineered soil mix that supports vegetative growth. They are usually used on individual home lots to capture roof runoff. Typical soil depths range from 6 to 18 inches.The capture ratio is {{the ratio of the}} rain garden's area to the impervious area that drains onto it. GreenRoof: Green Roofs are another variation of a bio-retention cell that have a soil layer laying atop a special drainage mat material that conveys excess percolated rainfall off of the roof. Green Roofs (also known as Vegetated Roofs) are bio-retention systems placed on roof surfaces that capture and temporarily store rainwater in a soil growing medium. They consist of a layered system of roofing designed to support plant growth and retain water for plant uptake while preventing ponding on the roof surface.The thickness used for the growing medium typically ranges from 3 to 6 inches. InfilTrench: infiltration trenches are narrow ditches filled with gravel that intercept runoff from upslope impervious areas. They provide storage volume and additional time for captured runoff to infiltrate the native soil below. [...] PermPave or Permeable PavementsContinuous Permeable Pavement systems are excavated areas filled with gravel and paved over with a porous concrete or <b>asphalt</b> <b>mix.</b> Continuous Permeable Pavement systems are excavated areas filled with gravel and paved over with a porous concrete or <b>asphalt</b> <b>mix.</b> Modular Block systems are similar except that permeable block pavers are used instead. Normally all rainfall will immediately pass through the pavement into the gravel storage layer below it where it can infiltrate at natural rates into the site's native soil. Pavement layers are usually 4 to 6 inches in height while the gravel storage layer is typically 6 to 18 inches high. The Capture Ratio is the percent of the treated area (street or parking lot) that is replaced with permeable pavement. [...] Cistern: Rain Barrels (or Cisterns) are containers that collect roof runoff during storm events and can either release or re-use the rainwater during dry periods. Rain harvesting systems collect runoff from rooftops and convey it to a cistern tank where it can be used for non-potable water uses and on-site infiltration. The harvesting system is assumed to consist of a given number of fixed-sized cisterns per 1000 square feet of rooftop area captured. The water from each cistern is withdrawn at a constant rate and is assumed to be consumed or infiltrated entirely on-site. VegSwale: Vegetative swales are channels or depressed areas with sloping sides covered with grass and other vegetation. They slow down the conveyance of collected runoff and allow it more time to infiltrate the native soil beneath it. Infiltration basins are shallow depressions filled with grass or other natural vegetation that capture runoff from adjoining areas and allow it to infiltrate into the soil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Considering the hot <b>mix</b> <b>asphalt</b> {{compaction}} {{quality is}} difficult to reach {{and it can be}} destroyed easily, the warm <b>mix</b> <b>asphalt</b> is used for thin overlay of airport cement concrete pavement. The mixture proportion of warm <b>mix</b> <b>asphalt</b> was designed, the performance of the base asphalt and the modified emulsify asphalt were measured, and the optimum asphalt quantity was determined, then the performance comparison between warm <b>mix</b> <b>asphalt</b> and hot <b>mix</b> <b>asphalt</b> were analyzed. Results indicate that warm <b>mix</b> <b>asphalt</b> has the same performance with hot <b>mix</b> <b>asphalt,</b> it can also satisfy the requirement of the airport cement concrete pavement thin overlay. Finally, in order to validate the project application effect, the warm <b>mix</b> <b>asphalt</b> was used in a northwest airport cement concrete pavement thin overlay. After four years use, the construction of the pavement is in good condition, and no disease emerging, the performance can meet the using requirements of the airport...|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{concerns of}} global warming and increasing exhaustion of greenhouse gases, the asphalt industry is looking for alternatives for hot <b>mix</b> <b>asphalt</b> (HMA). Warm <b>Mix</b> <b>Asphalt</b> (WMA) is a fast emerging new technology which has a potential of revolutionizing the production of asphalt mixtures. WMA technology allows the mixing, lay down and compaction of <b>asphalt</b> <b>mixes</b> at significantly lower temperatures compared to Hot <b>Mix</b> <b>Asphalt</b> (HMA). The technology can reduce production temperatures {{by as much as}} 30 percent. <b>Asphalt</b> <b>mixes</b> are generally produced at 150 º C or greater temperatures depending mainly on the type of binder used. WMA mixes can be produced at temperatures of about 120 ºC or lower. In this study an attempt has been made to compare HMA and WMA with organic additive (Sasobit) with various dosages on the Marshall properties for Dense Bituminous Macadam(DBM) Grade 2. The adopted mixing temperatures for HMA was 155 °C, 130 °C and 115 °C and the mixing temperatures for WMA was 130 °C and 115 °C. The laboratory study concludes that Stability & Marshall properties were improved for the WMA mix by the addition of the additive...|$|R
