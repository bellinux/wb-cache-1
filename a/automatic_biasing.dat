40|$|The authors {{argue that}} {{implicit}} measures of social cognition {{do not reflect}} only automatic processes but rather the joint contributions of multiple, qualitatively different processes. The quadruple process model proposed and tested in the present article quantitatively disentangles the influences of 4 distinct processes on implicit task performance: the likelihood that <b>automatic</b> <b>bias</b> is activated by a stimulus; that a correct response can be determined; that <b>automatic</b> <b>bias</b> is overcome; and that, {{in the absence of}} other information, a guessing bias drives responses. The stochastic and construct validity of the model is confirmed in 5 studies. The model is shown to provide a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the interplay of multiple processes in implicit task performance, including implicit measures of attitudes, prejudice, and stereotyping.

Past research investigating people’s ability to control <b>automatic</b> <b>bias</b> has produced mixed findings. The current research tested the utility of an implementation intention, a promising strategy for reducing the effects of <b>automatic</b> <b>bias</b> on behavior. An implementation intention is an if-then plan that links an environmental cue to a specific response; it is hypothesized to automate the execution of the response intention when the cue is encountered. In the first two experiments, participants were asked to identify an object (e. g., gun or tool) after being presented with either an African American or a Caucasian face. Half of the participants formed a counter-stereotypical implementation intention to think the word, “safe”, when they saw Black faces. Participants in the control condition received an implementation intention that was not associated with the relevant racial stereotype. These experiments demonstrated that automatic stereotyping was reduced only when participants had formed a counter-stereotypical implementation intention, even though all participants had been warned about being biased.

40|$|This article {{attempted}} {{to clarify the}} role played by section 156 (4) of the Constitution by tracing some of the origins and manifestations of the principle of subsidiarity, on which this provision is modelled. It was argued that, although modelled on it, section 156 (4) is different from the classic manifestation of subsidiarity, which would have established a principled and <b>automatic</b> <b>bias</b> for local government that only gives way to a reasoned argument in favour of other spheres of government. Section 156 (4) works the other way around. It establishes a preference and not an <b>automatic</b> <b>bias</b> for local government. This preference must be substantiated with an argument that the assignment of the power to local government is functional in that it enables such government to achieve its developmental objects. It was further argued that section 156 (4) of the Constitution may not be easily enforced separately by the courts, {{in part because of the}} deference shown by the courts to political decisions surrounding the configuration of the state. However, the experience of judicial enforcement of the subsidiarity principle in Germany may offer some guidance in this respect. The principle of subsidiarity should play a guiding role in lawmaking and the interpretation of competencies by the courts. A brief review of legislation and court judgments surrounding, for example, local government's role in land use management, indicates that the principle is not given nearly the recognition it deserves.

40|$|The {{evidence}} for whether intentional control strategies can reduce automatic stereotyping is mixed. Therefore, the authors tested {{the utility of}} implementation intentions— specific plans linking a behavioral opportunity to a specific response—in reducing <b>automatic</b> <b>bias.</b> In three experiments, automatic stereotyping was reduced when participants made an intention to think specific counterstereotypical thoughts whenever they encountered a Black individual. The authors used two implicit tasks and process dissociation analysis, which allowed them to separate contributions of automatic and controlled thinking to task performance. Of importance, the reduction in stereotyping was driven by a change in automatic stereotyping and not controlled thinking. This benefit was acquired with little practice and generalized to novel faces. Thus, implementation intentions may be an effective and efficient means for controlling automatic aspects of thought...|$|R

Across four experiments, we found that situational cuing can also trigger materialistic mind-sets, with similarly negative personal and social consequences. Merely viewing desirable consumer goods resulted in increases in materialistic concerns and led to heightened negative affect and reduced social involvement (Experiment 1). Framing a computer task as a “Consumer Reaction Study” led to a stronger <b>automatic</b> <b>bias</b> toward values reflecting self-enhancement, compared with framing the same task as a “Citizen Reaction Study” (Experiment 2). Consumer cues also increased competitiveness (Experiment 3) and selfishness in a water-conservation dilemma (Experiment 4).

In Experiment 1, we also observed an attentional bias towards non-affective semantic stimulus information inthe non-affective group but not in the affective groups. We argue that these effects are due to a modulation of automatic stimulus processing by feature-specific attention allocation.

Recently, distinct IOR mechanisms have been revealed that may have collicular and cortical origins: While standard luminance stimuli cause IOR in both manual and saccadic eye movement responses, “S cone” stimuli, which are invisible to the direct collicular pathway, caused manual IOR but not saccadic IOR. However, it has not been shown that the separate mechanisms are both inhibition of return, rather than facilitation due to attentional momentum or a visual motion transient. Here, we examined this question using four target and cue locations instead of two. Inhibition at the cued location predicts that responses for all noncued locations should be similar, whereas facilitation at the location opposite the cue predicts that the perpendicular locations would be more similar to the cued location than to the opposite location.

Methods: Amygdala activity was recorded in response to masked displays of angry, sad and happy facial expressions by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. In a subsequent experiment, the patients performed an affective priming task that characterizes automatic emotion processing by investigating the biasing effect of subliminally presented emotional faces on evaluative ratings to subsequently presented neutral stimuli. Results: Significant associations between (right) amygdala reactivity and <b>automatic</b> negative judgmental <b>bias</b> were replicated in our patient sample (r = – 0. 59, p < 0. 001). Further, negatively biased evaluative processing was associated with severity and longer course of illness (r = – 0. 57, p = 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractWe examine a) whether texts about {{predictive}} inferences {{that contain}} {{a high level}} of contextual constraints, that is, a high likelihood of dangerous outcomes (89 %), facilitate drawing danger-related predictive inferences in high anxiety individuals; this would be a sign of a danger inferential bias, and b) whether such context constraints speed up the time course of predictive inferences and are produced automatically. Participants with different levels of trait anxiety –high vs. low- read predictive contexts, which are danger-related and non-danger-related, and from which either a highly likely outcome or a non-predictable one can be inferred. In Experiment 1, the high-anxiety group drew more danger-related inferences than non-danger-ones, and the low-anxiety group made more non-danger-related inferences. In Experiment 2, with a 500 ms SOA interval between the inducing context of the inference and the target word confirming or disconfirming the predictable event, all participants made danger- related inferences. Results demonstrate that high contextual constraints help high-anxiety individuals focus their resources on the most dangerous outcomes rather than on other harmless information and the former is then selected when answering. This shows an inferential bias linked to anxiety. However, although such constraints speed up the time course of predictive inferences, they do not produce an <b>automatic</b> <b>bias...</b>|$|R
40|$|How do stimuli in the {{environment}} interact {{with the goals of}} observers? We addressed this question by showing that the relevance of an abruptly appearing visual object (cue) changes how observers orient attention toward a subsequent object (target) and how this target is represented in the activity of neurons in the superior colliculus. Initially after the appearance of the cue, attention is driven to its locus. This capture of attention is followed by a second bias in orienting attention, where observers preferentially orient to new locations in the visual scene-an effect called inhibition of return. In the superior colliculus, these two <b>automatic</b> <b>biases</b> in orienting attention were associated with changes in neural activity linked to the appearance of the target-relatively stronger activity linked to the capture of attention and weaker activity linked to inhibition of return. This behavioral pattern changes when the cue predicts the upcoming location of the target-the benefit associated with the capture of attention is enhanced and inhibition of return is reduced. These goal-driven changes in behavior were associated with an increase in pretarget- and target-related activity. Taken together, the goals of observers modify stimulus-driven changes in neural activity with both signals represented in the salience maps of the superior colliculi...|$|R
40|$|Trait {{anxiety is}} {{associated}} with an excessive processing of danger-related stimuli, predisposing individuals to quickly detect threatening cues. Early, automatic mechanisms {{are believed to be}} responsible for the production of these cognitive biases; however, limitations in the paradigms most commonly used to achieve visual suppression or attentional unawareness have left open the possibility of strategic mechanisms influencing these early stages of information processing. Establishing whether symptoms of anxiety are associated with truly <b>automatic</b> <b>biases</b> in processing is an essential step in determining their etiology and in developing targeted cognitive interventions. We addressed this question using continuous flash suppression (CFS), a novel and robust method of visual suppression capable of rendering a stimulus invisible from awareness for extended durations. We specifically investigated the degree to which trait anxiety influenced the suppression of threatening, positive, and neutral faces. Forty-nine individuals, with no reported history of psychological problems and varying levels of anxiety, were recruited. Higher trait anxiety scores were associated with an increased speed to detect fearful compared with happy faces. These results indicate that the bias toward threatening information associated with symptoms of anxiety operates, at least partly, at an early stage of information processing. This suggests that cognitive interventions for anxiety may benefit from directly targeting such early and potentially preconscious processes. (PsycINFO Database Recor...|$|R
