50|$|The codings {{generated}} by algorithms implementing a linear generative {{model can be}} classified into codings with soft sparseness and those with hard sparseness. These refer to the distribution of basis vector coefficients for typical inputs. A coding with soft sparseness has a smooth Gaussian-like distribution, but peakier than Gaussian, with many zero <b>values,</b> some small <b>absolute</b> <b>values,</b> fewer larger <b>absolute</b> <b>values,</b> and very few very large <b>absolute</b> <b>values.</b> Thus, many of the basis vectors are active. Hard sparseness, on the other hand, indicates {{that there are many}} zero values, no or hardly any small <b>absolute</b> <b>values,</b> fewer larger <b>absolute</b> <b>values,</b> and very few very large <b>absolute</b> <b>values,</b> and thus few of the basis vectors are active.

5|$|The {{electromagnetic}} field {{can be understood}} as a gauge field, i.e., as a field that results from requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently at every position in spacetime. For the {{electromagnetic field}}, this gauge symmetry is the Abelian U(1) symmetry of complex numbers of <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> 1, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex field without affecting observables or real valued functions made from it, such as the energy or the Lagrangian.|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{identical}} particles because they cannot {{be distinguished from}} each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons {{must be able to}} swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, , where the variables r1 and r2 correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively. Since the <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. Bosons, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner product}} between two state vectors {{is a complex}} number known as a {{probability}} amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, {{the probability that a}} system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator—which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must be real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.|$|E

In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the wave function, commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (ψ). When the <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> of this function is squared, it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location—a probability density.|$|E
5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in <b>absolute</b> <b>value)</b> and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E
