In 1921, gold tracer mining was also initiated. During this period, the copper mining operations were not profitable and as a result, the mines were closed and the gold tracer studies were also discontinued.

50|$|Hall Island (Ostrov Gallya) is {{an almost}} {{completely}} glacierized large island of 1049 km² sq mi immediately {{to the east of}} MacKlintok Island. It lies within latitude 80.30° N and longitude 56.00° E. The highest point on the island is 502 m and its mapped shore length is 174.7 km. It was named after American Arctic explorer Charles Francis Hall. The only relatively large areas free of permanent ice are located in its southern end, where there are two headlands, Cape Tegethoff, and Cape Ozernyy, on the Littov Peninsula. Cape Tegethoff has a range of hill peaks. The <b>airborne</b> <b>surveys</b> revealed 400 m thick mantles of ice and also in Graham Bell Island’s ice capes. There is also a very small unglacierized area around its eastern cape, Cape Frankfurt, and another in its northwestern point, Cape Wiggins. Its highest point is 502 m near its southwestern side, and there is also a peak of 421 m in the northcentral part of the island. There is a wide bay on the southeastern side of Hall Island known as Hydrographer Bay and a smaller one west of the Littov Peninsula, known as Bukhta Surovaya. To the southeast, there is a wider strait separating Hall Island from Salm Island, known as Proliv Lavroka. The strait to the east is known as Avstriskiy Proliv.|$|E

40|$|The role of high {{resolution}} <b>airborne</b> <b>surveys</b> is extending {{well beyond the}} traditional areas of mineral and hydrocarbons exploration and regional mapping, which were often focused on the relatively unpopulated and remote regions of the world. As an increasing proportion of the Earth’s surface is affected by human activity, airborne survey techniques are being adapted and applied to development-related issues in more populated areas. The value of radiometric and electromagnetic data (in particular) has been recognised for addressing a range of environmental issues and, more generally, <b>airborne</b> <b>surveys</b> are seen as an effective, non-invasive means of providing multiple development-related geoscience data sets in a single operation.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{findings from}} sampling and analyses of soils across the Blackwater drain catchments, {{part of the}} Wensum demonstration test catchment (DTC) project funded by Defra. Recent studies have shown how spectroscopic techniques {{can be used to}} estimate soil properties and airborne spectroscopy could be an effective means to aid continuous mapping of soil properties across the landscape. Before an <b>airborne</b> <b>survey</b> is undertaken it is important to assess whether the relationships between infra red (IR) spectra and soil properties are sufficiently strong for the cost of the <b>airborne</b> <b>survey</b> to be justified. A secondary objective was to determine the concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC) in soils across the cultivated parts of the catchment to determine whether there is any evidence that low SOC concentrations might indicate that the topsoil may exhibit poor structural stability contributing to enhanced sediment in stream and drainage channels...|$|R

Kinematic GPS positioning has been widely used, but the available commercial software systems are normally only suitable for the short or medium range kinematic baseline. However, in polar areas, <b>airborne</b> <b>surveys</b> have baselines ranging from a few hundred kilometers to even more than one thousand kilometers due to logistic limitations. It is a challenge to the traditional kinematic GPS software based on double differenced models, such as GPSurvey or GrafNav.
