25|$|The Kirkwall scroll is a floor cloth which {{contains}} many masonic symbols, many more opaque images, and cryptic writing which may either be a code or badly painted Hebrew. It {{hangs on the}} west wall of the temple of Lodge Kirkwall Kilwinning No. 38(2) in Orkney, but is too long to be completely displayed. It is 18ft 6in long and 5ft 6in wide, and is composed of a full-width central strip stitched at each side to two half-width side strips. The left border appears to show the wanderings of the Israelites before they arrived in Egypt, and reads from top to bottom. The right shows their wanderings in the wilderness after the Exodus, with the route marked in years from 1 to 46, and branching many times at the end. The central cloth contains seven painted scenes and tableaux. The bottom scene shows an altar flanked by two pillars, all surrounded by more or less familiar masonic symbols. Working upwards, the second has an altar surrounded by {{a different set of}} symbols, the third has the altar and pillars together with the cherubim present on the arms of the Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Ireland and the United Grand Lodge of England. Above this is <b>a</b> <b>schematic</b> <b>of</b> the tabernacle of the Ark of the Covenant, followed by what may be the last judgement. The sixth shows a cross atop a pyramid, surmounted by a rainbow, surrounded by masonic and alchemical symbols, and at the top a naked woman, assumed by early authors to be Eve, sitting under a tree surrounded by animals. In the distance is a sea or lake full of fish, and beyond this are mountains. The whole is painted in oil, mainly in pale blue. In the top tableau the woman, fish and animals are pink, the sea green, and the tree and mountains brown.|$|E

500|$|According to Famitsu, Mega Man & Bass for the GBA sold 91,097 {{copies in}} Japan between its release date and {{the week of}} December 23, 2002. Nintendo Power listed Mega Man & Bass as the 14th best GBA game of all time in its 20th anniversary issue in 2008. A related game {{exclusive}} to Japan titled [...] was released for the WonderSwan handheld in 1999. The plot consists of the titular duo's struggle against an adversary named [...] "Rockman Shadow". As Mega Man & Bass was released directly after Mega Man 8 and it shares plot and gameplay characteristics {{with the rest of}} the numbered titles in the series, many believed it to be the ninth main game in the series; however, the actual Mega Man 9 would not be released until 2008. Inafune explained in an interview with the Brazilian magazine Nintendo World that the ninth installment follows the storyline of Mega Man 8 and that the worlds for Mega Man & Bass and Mega Man 9 are meant to coincide with one another, as evidenced by <b>a</b> <b>schematic</b> <b>of</b> Bass in the ending of the game. In 2010, Bass was made playable via downloadable content in Mega Man 10. As in Mega Man & Bass, he is able to dash, fire in seven directions with his buster, and fly by combining with Treble.|$|E

2500|$|In 1741, Pope wrote {{a fourth}} {{book of the}} Dunciad and had it {{published}} the next year as a stand-alone text. He also began revising the whole poem to create a new, integrated, and darker version of the text. The four-book Dunciad appeared in 1743 as a new work. Most of the critical and pseudo-critical apparatus was repeated from the Dunciad Variorum of 1738, {{but there was a}} new [...] "Advertisement to the Reader" [...] by Bishop Warburton and one new substantial piece: <b>a</b> <b>schematic</b> <b>of</b> anti-heroes, written by Pope in his own voice, entitled Hyper-Critics of Ricardus Aristarchus. [...] The most obvious change from the three book to the four book Dunciad was the change of hero from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.|$|E
2500|$|Volta {{developed}} the voltaic cell about 1792, and presented his work March 20, 1800. Volta correctly identified {{the role of}} dissimilar electrodes in producing the voltage, but incorrectly dismissed any role for the electrolyte. Volta ordered the metals in a 'tension series', “that is to say in an order such that any one in the list becomes positive when in contact with any one that succeeds, but negative by contact with any one that precedes it.” A typical symbolic convention in <b>a</b> <b>schematic</b> <b>of</b> this circuit ( [...] –||– [...] ) would have a long electrode 1 and a short electrode 2, to indicate that electrode 1 dominates. [...] Volta's law about opposing electrode emfs implies that, given ten electrodes (for example, zinc and nine other materials), 45 unique combinations of voltaic cells (10 × 9/2) can be created.|$|E

2500|$|The SCO {{phenomenon}} has potential uses as switches, data storage devices and optical displays {{due to the}} inherent bistability (HS and LS) which leads {{to changes in the}} colour of the material and major magnetic changes. Molecular switches, like electrical switches, require a mechanism that for turning ON and OFF, as is achieved with the abrupt spin transitions with hysteresis. In order for the size of data storage devices to be reduced while the capacity of them increase, smaller units (such as molecules) that exhibit a bistability and thermal hysteresis are required. One research goal is to develop new materials where the SCO response time can be decreased from nanoseconds, as we know it, to femtoseconds. [...] One of the advantages of SCO phenomena is the absence of fatigue, because there is an intraelectronic transition instead of an electron displacement through space. [...] Figure 18 shows <b>a</b> <b>schematic</b> <b>of</b> the two different output signals that can be obtained from an FeII compound upon an external stimuli. Molecules that exhibit SCO could also be used to write an image to a screen when a thermal change induces the SCO.|$|E
2500|$|Systems biology {{approaches}} to Alzheimer’s disease that consider the biochemical pathways {{that are important}} in CNS disease evolution have been developed by research that was funded outside NASA. Figure 6-8 shows <b>a</b> <b>schematic</b> <b>of</b> the biochemical pathways {{that are important in}} the development of Alzheimer’s disease. The description of the interaction of space radiation within these pathways would be one approach to developing predictive models of space radiation risks. For example, if the pathways that were studied in animal models could be correlated with studies in humans who are suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, an approach to describe risk that uses biochemical degrees-of-freedom could be pursued. Edelstein-Keshet and Spiros [...] have developed an in silico model of senile plaques that are related to Alzheimer’s disease. In this model, the biochemical interactions among TNF, IL-1B, and IL-6 are described within several important cell populations, including astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Further, in this model soluble amyloid causes microglial chemotaxis and activates IL-1B secretion. Figure 6-9 shows the results of the Edelstein-Keshet and Spiros model simulating plaque formation and neuronal death. Establishing links between space radiation-induced changes to the changes that are described in this approach can be pursued to develop an in silico model of Alzheimer’s disease that results from space radiation.|$|E
2500|$|SCO is also {{influenced}} by the application of pressure which changes {{the population of the}} HS and LS states. [...] Upon application of pressure, a conversion from the HS state to the LS state and a shift from T1/2, (the temperature at which half of the complex is in a LS state), to higher temperatures will occur. [...] This is due to an increase in the zero point energy difference, ΔE°HL, caused by an increase in the relative vertical displacement of the potential wells and a decrease in the activation energy, ΔW°HL, which favors the LS state. Figure 14 shows <b>a</b> <b>schematic</b> <b>of</b> the pressure influence on an FeII-L compound and Figure 15 shows the effect of pressure on the magnetic susceptibility of Fe(phen)2(SCN)2. At high pressures the LS state predominates and the transition temperature increases. At high pressures the compound is almost entirely transformed to the LS state at room temperature. [...] As a result of the application of pressure on the Fe(phen)2(SCN)2 compound, the bond lengths are affected. [...] The difference in M-L bond lengths in both HS and LS states changes the entropy of the system. The change in spin transition temperature, T1/2 and pressure obeys the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship: ...|$|E
