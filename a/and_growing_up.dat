5|$|Tallon's form saw him {{selected}} for the 1948 Ashes tour {{as part of the}} side that would become known to cricket history as the Invincibles. Tallon was the first-choice wicket-keeper, with Saggers as his deputy. Having spent the majority of his life in sunny Queensland <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in tropical Bundaberg, the cold English climate initially caught Tallon off guard. He did not wet his inner gloves as was his custom due to the temperature. As England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, this meant that the ball would more frequently be in a favourable state for fast bowling, since it would swing more. As a result, Australia adopted a pace-oriented strategy and Johnson was the only spinner regularly used in the Test matches. McCool was not to play a Test on the tour, depriving Tallon of an opportunity to show his stumping abilities standing up at the stumps to his Queensland team-mate.|$|E

25|$|Changes {{in rates}} {{and types of}} {{infection}} alone however, {{have been unable to}} explain the observed increase in allergic disease, and recent evidence has focused attention on the importance of the gastrointestinal microbial environment. Evidence has shown that exposure to food and fecal-oral pathogens, such as hepatitis A, Toxoplasma gondii, and Helicobacter pylori (which also tend to be more prevalent in developing countries), can reduce the overall risk of atopy by more than 60%, and an increased rate of parasitic infections has been associated with a decreased prevalence of asthma. It is speculated that these infections exert their effect by critically altering TH1/TH2 regulation. Important elements of newer hygiene hypotheses also include exposure to endotoxins, exposure to pets <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> on a farm.|$|E

25|$|Born in Bombay <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in the city, young Sunil {{was named}} India's Best Schoolboy Cricketer {{of the year}} in 1966. He scored 246*, 222 and 85 in school cricket in his final year of {{secondary}} education, before striking a century against the touring London schoolboys. He made his first-class debut for Vazir Sultan Colts XI against an XI from Dungarpur, in 1966/67, but remained in Bombay's Ranji Trophy squad for two further years without playing a match. An alumnus of Bombay's renowned St. Xavier's College, he made his debut in the 1968/69 season against Karnataka, but made a duck and was the subject of derisive claims that his selection was due to the presence of his uncle Madhav Mantri, a former Indian Test wicketkeeper, on Bombay's selection committee. He responded with 114 against Rajasthan in his second match, and two further consecutive centuries saw him selected in the 1970/71 Indian team to tour the West Indies.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{lyrics are}} {{described}} as 'politically, socially and personally conscious', incorporating themes such as corporate greed, racism <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in a broken home. Butler says it is [...] "an ode to the disenfranchised and disaffected youth" [...] and about accepting that {{we will never be}} perfect. Some of the lyrics reflect on his early life where he had to raise his sister and grow up at the same time. He added ambiguity to the lyrics to [...] "facilitate" [...] ideas for the listeners. Freeman said that the lyrics [...] "reveal just how self-aware he is, which is a good counterpoint to those who feel that his constant vocalizing equates to selfishness." ...|$|E

500|$|... "My Father's Song" [...] was a {{brand new}} song {{recorded}} specifically for Streisand's seventeenth studio album, Lazy Afternoon (1975). Produced by Jeffrey Lesser and Rupert Holmes, the latter had written the song after Streisand had told him different stories about her childhood <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> with her father; the songwriting process consisted of Streisand sharing personal tales of her father and what she felt about him. Streisand worked closely with Holmes during {{the creation of the}} album. Prior to their collaboration, Holmes was considered to be relatively unknown. After finishing up with Holmes and in order to thank him for the collaborations, Streisand hand-wrote him a note that read, [...] "Dear Rupert, don't be frightened, you're the best, love Barbra". In the official liner notes of Lazy Afternoon, she stated that the track was [...] "a very personal gift [...] mean a great to deal to me"; responding to her comments in a 1988 interview with a Streisand fan, Holmes claimed that the process was simple and that he had only [...] "put in [...] everything that a daughter might want to hear her father say" [...] in the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|One day, Lazzara was {{checking}} his emails {{and saw the}} phrase [...] "Best Places to Be a Mom" [...] roll across the news ticker. He thought it was [...] "funny and in context it is". The track {{started out as a}} slow song before being sped up by Reyes. [...] "Sad Savior" [...] feature Nolan playing a 1950s Buddy Holly-esque guitar riff reminding Lazzara that he had missed John Nolan's guitar playing:"...I missed ... John's guitar playing, especially coupled with Eddie 's." [...] Lazzara said, [...] "Money (Let It Go)" [...] has a James Bond [...] "kind of spy/surf-y vibe" [...] and features a [...] "really cool surf-y solo" [...] by Nolan. O'Connell created the chord progression for [...] "This Is All Now", while Nolan came up with the melody for the song's chorus. The track's lyrics went through three or four different drafts. Lazzara said it was about the group's relationship with [...] "faith <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> {{in and out of the}} church". The band referred to the bridge in [...] "Since You're Gone" [...] as the [...] "Beatles bridge" [...] because it was [...] "very unlike us," [...] according to Lazzara. Lazzara described [...] "Call Me in the Morning" [...] a [...] "ballady kind of sentimental tune". When the group recorded the track, they sat in a circle [...] "with this crazy microphone in the middle and we were all playing together". [...] "You Were Right" [...] started as an acoustic song, written by Nolan.|$|E
