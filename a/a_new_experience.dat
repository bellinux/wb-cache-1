5|$|Following {{the success}} of Cauldron, Palace {{employee}} Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>experience,</b> a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.|$|E

Dining centers excite new students because this is <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>experience,</b> therefore they grab more than what they should. It’s something new and it’s what they’re paying for.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of Islam, the arch and dome began to be used and the mosque or masjid too began to form part of the landscape, adding to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>experience</b> in form and space. The most famous Islamic {{building}} type in India is the tomb or the mausoleum which evolved from the basic cube and hemisphere vocabulary of the early phase into a more elaborate form during the Mughal era where multiple chambers are present and tombs were set in a garden known as the char-bagh. Well known examples are the Gol Gumbaz, Bijapur and the Taj Mahal, Agra, the latter renowned for its beauty in white marble, its minarets and its setting. With colonisation, a new chapter began. Though the Dutch, Portuguese and the French made substantial forays, it was the English who had a lasting impact. The architecture of the colonial period varied from the beginning attempts at creating authority through classical prototypes to the later approach of producing a supposedly more responsive image through what is now termed Indo-Saracenic architecture- a mixture of Hindu, Islamic and Western elements.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{viewing the}} {{proposed}} expanded {{version of the}} film, I felt that the cut was simply too long and the pacing completely thrown off.

I chose to go in and recut that proposed long version into a more streamlined and polished alternate version of the film.

500|$|This London {{engagement}} was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>experience</b> for Robey, who {{had only}} been familiar with provincial pantomimes and week-long, one-man comedy shows. Aside from pantomime, he had never taken part in a long-running production, {{and he had never}} had to memorise lines precisely or keep to schedules enforced by strict directors and theatre managers. The Bing Boys Are Here ran for 378 performances and occupied the Alhambra for more than a year. The theatrical press praised Robey as [...] "the first actor of the halls".

500|$|Working on studio sets was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>experience</b> for Rathborne, whose {{previous}} work {{had all been}} filmed on location. She also found it refreshing {{to work with the}} series' ensemble cast, recalling that Miguel Ferrer often had the cast and crew laughing at the way he approached his material, imbuing the atmosphere during filming with a mix of comedy and drama. Rathborne has also noted the use of ordinary, almost banal, daily life in the series, finding it a necessary element {{to be able to play}} the series' more violent and surreal elements against effectively. She particularly singled out Cooper as a wholesome [...] "boy next door" [...] character who allowed the town's more unusual residents to stand out more starkly.|$|E

Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>experience</b> for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has said he wants me to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say can you make it a little more green. Huh? It's tricky." [...] He added, [...] "Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single.

500|$|Recording {{the track}} was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>experience</b> for Pettibone {{since it was}} the first time that he worked with live musicians and arrangements. Pettibone took the demo of the song, and added live drums, piano and strings to it. They did not have any strings written {{originally}} for the song, and chose composer Jeremy Lubbock for the music arrangement; Lubbock had previously worked with Madonna on her soundtrack album I'm Breathless (1990). Madonna recorded the song on a Shure SM57 microphone, with the melody being played over and over again, accompanied by the piano, organ, strings and a basic rim-looping sound on a portable Macintosh computer. Pettibone spent the rest of the recording session working on the verses and final structure of [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] was completed. The day after the song was finished, Madonna traveled to Oregon to work on her next film, Body of Evidence, giving Pettibone the time to finish off the songs for Erotica.|$|E

[...] The Lost World (1997) finished {{as one of the}} ten highest-grossing films in history to that point, and was pivotal in making Moore a sought-after actress: [...] "Suddenly I had a commercial film career," [...] she said. The Myth of Fingerprints was her second film released in 1997. During its production she met her future husband in director Bart Freundlich. Later that year, Moore made a cameo appearance in the dark comedy Chicago Cab.|$|E
