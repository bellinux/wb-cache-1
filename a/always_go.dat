25|$|In certain regions, such as Hawaii and {{northern}} Brazil, dolphins spend the daytime resting in shallow bays near deep water. At dusk, they travel offshore to feed. They travel {{along the shore}} during foraging trips, and the individuals that occupy the same bay may change daily. Some individual dolphins do not <b>always</b> <b>go</b> to a bay to rest; however, in Hawaii, dolphins do seem {{to return to the}} same site each trip.|$|E
25|$|The tribe went on buffalo hunts {{in summer}} and winter. Upon their return, the {{inhabitants}} of a lodge would often move into another lodge, although they generally remained within the village. Men's lives were more transient than those of women. They had obligations {{of support for the}} wife (and family they married into), but could <b>always</b> <b>go</b> back to their mother and sisters for a night or two of attention. When young couples married, they lived with the woman's family in a matrilocal pattern.|$|E
25|$|The chiefs <b>always</b> <b>go</b> {{armed with}} a fusee and a stick headed with iron, to the other {{extremity}} of which is affixed a small bunch of cow's hair; they cover their heads with a cap made of red wollen cloth. It is by their caps, above all, {{that they can be}} distinguished by their subjects. The authority of these chiefs is very much limited; yet in the province of Carcanossi {{they are supposed to be}} the proprieters of all the land, which they distribute among their subjects, in order to be tilled and cultivated. For this they require a small quit-rent, which, in the language of the country, is called faensa.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration {{can be traced}} back to several origins. One of these is the former 7th Special Police Corps, which was {{expanded}} from the late and unique River Patrol squadron of the Taipei County (now New Taipei City) Police Department. The land branches of Coast Guard Administration originate from the controversial Taiwan Garrison Command, which no longer exists, but the formations of land patrol forces were inherited from the ROC Army. Because of its interesting and complicated origins, the Coast Guard Administration does not <b>always</b> <b>go</b> along well with the police, especially when problems related to legal jurisdiction on land occur.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} high {{rank and}} high status <b>always</b> <b>go</b> together because no high ranking woman would ever marry a commoner, and no chief would ever marry a low ranking woman. In fact when prince Alaivahamamao eloped with {{the daughter of}} a low chiefess Tuimala, he was stripped from his royal status and had to flee to Hawaii. Children from that marriage, grandchildren of the king, would have obtained no significant rank. Albeit later, after a divorce, Alai was reconciled with his father and married princess Alaileula from Sāmoa. He did not however become prince again and died in 2004 with only the noble title Māatu.|$|E
25|$|These heavy-handed efforts did not <b>always</b> <b>go</b> unopposed: {{when the}} {{government}} installed Carrasco {{as the head of}} the SNTMMSRM, a number of locals bolted from the union to form the National Miners Union. When a strike broke out at the Nueva Rosita coal mine in 1950, the employer managed to force local businesses to refuse to sell food to the strikers. In the meantime the government declared martial law in the area, arrested the rebel union leaders, seized the union's treasury and prohibited further meetings. The government used similar tactics in 1959 after the nationalization of the rail industry, firing thousands of strikers and sentencing union leaders to more than ten years in prison. The CTM approved these and other measures to isolate or eliminate independent unions and rebel movements within its membership.|$|E

25|$|Each parish {{also had}} an assembly, where every parishioner was present and {{decisions}} were only taken unanimously. If {{they were not able}} to come to a mutual understanding the matter had to rest and be resumed later until everybody agreed. In the community houses the village's prominent people, so called byalag, gathered to decide on mutual concerns such as split-rail fences, ditch construction and agricultural related stuff. The central figure in each district was the priest. He dealt with most matters since he was in contact with every parishioner. He meddled in conflicts and gave advice and comfort in various situations. Besides preaching and informing the priest was also a farmer himself, often a forerunner in the field. The priest did not <b>always</b> <b>go</b> the authority's errand, sometimes he tried to help his fellow parishioners fend off extra taxes and military services.|$|E
25|$|Bernard Lewis has {{cited the}} Greek philosopher Aristotle who, in his {{discussion}} of slavery, stated that while Greeks are free by nature, 'barbarians' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, in that it is in their nature to be more willing to submit to despotic government. Though Aristotle does not specify any particular races, he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from Greece. While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies don't <b>always</b> <b>go</b> together, implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body. This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist Benjamin Isaac.|$|E
25|$|Mercado Juárez {{was opened}} in 1912, {{the last major}} market to open before the Mexican Revolution brought market {{development}} to a halt. The war disrupted food production and distribution with the abandonment of haciendas, lack of manpower in the agricultural sector and the disruption of transportation systems. With {{the exception of the}} Abelardo L. Rodríguez market in 1934, there were no new markets constructed in Mexico City, other than small ones for newly established neighborhoods in the growing city. Outside of Mexico City, formal markets were still be introduced to replace older tianguis. The installation of fixed structures to replace tianguis did not <b>always</b> <b>go</b> well. In Xalapa, Veracruz a new, modern and at the time, spacious market was built and promoted in the 1940s to replace the weekly market at the Plazuela del Carbón. However, at first no one would go and shop there, making it a distinct failure. It took fifteen years of efforts to make the market accepted and profitable.|$|E

25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they <b>always</b> <b>go</b> out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E
