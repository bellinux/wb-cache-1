40|$|Work-family {{conflict}} (WFC) {{has been}} a consistent subject of concern for many employees in the modern economy. Scholars have explored this phenomenon in various conceivable dimensions {{in an attempt to}} assist employees with the important balancing act of their work and family life. While majority of previous studies has focused on gender, corporate and healthcare professionals, research among <b>academics</b> has been limited. This study explores the extent to which WFC exists among <b>academics</b> based in Malaysia. The study also investigates whether WFC impacts on the teaching performance on these <b>academics,</b> the salient factors that cause this circumstance and the strategies deployed by <b>academics</b> or institutions for mitigating WFC. Primary data was obtained qualitatively through semi-structured interviews conducted with 10 married <b>academics</b> (5 males and 5 females) from four different Private Higher Education institutes in Malaysia and who were either having or not having a child. Findings suggested that WFC definitely exists in the modern economy and <b>academics</b> understand WFC as a common concept with most descriptions parallel to present literature. In general, male <b>academics</b> continue to dominate in the work-to-family (WTF) path conflict while female <b>academics</b> lead in the family-to-work (FTW) path conflict and overall WFC is marginally higher for female <b>academics</b> than male <b>academics.</b> <b>Academics</b> with a child experience higher FTW path conflict while <b>academics</b> with no child experience higher WTF path conflict. For <b>academics,</b> WFC has an insignificant impact on their teaching performance but has a significant impact on their research publications which is an important finding and a contribution towards existing literature. Juggling between various work demands or family demands hinders their desire to produce adequate research papers that institutes value. WFC iv further results into adverse health consequences and positive or negative behavior outcomes. A number of personal strategies have been executed by <b>academics</b> to alleviate WFC with additional support from institutes. However, further implementation strategies of moderating WFC have been recommended by <b>academics</b> for institutes to seriously consider and assist <b>academics</b> in achieving the much anticipated balance between work and family life. This is an essential finding that contributes towards numerous studies in the WFC literature. This research has also made an important addition towards the unusual studies conducted in the Asian context over the several studies of WFC dominated by western contexts...|$|R

This article is a contribution to addressing this gap, summarising the views of a sample of <b>academics</b> at one Australian university about the promises and problems of outperformance pay. The resultant close-up perspective reveals several important contrasts, most notably (a) the very different responses of business <b>academics</b> and <b>academics</b> in non-business disciplines {{to the concept of}} pay for outperformance (with business <b>academics</b> tending to be strongly in favour and non-business <b>academics</b> tending to be strongly opposed) and (b) where a pay for outperformance scheme exists, as it does in the faculty of business discussed here, the contrast between views about pay for outperformance in principle (strongly supported) and as actually implemented (widely criticised). In addition to these contrasts, the material presented raises many issues for universities considering pay for outperformance and for <b>academics</b> interested in the realities of such schemes, including the many (perhaps insurmountable) challenges surrounding implementation and the real possibility that, for <b>academics</b> achieving at or above base-level expectations, outperformance pay may actually de-motivate in the long term. 12 page(s...|$|R
