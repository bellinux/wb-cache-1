5|$|A {{visit by}} Dahlia Brinkley, the only Springfield Elementary {{graduate}} ever to enter an Ivy League college, gives Lisa a severe inferiority complex {{because she is}} involved in very few extracurricular activities. When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her résumé and takes the position. Since she knows nothing <b>about</b> <b>baseball,</b> she seeks advice from the patrons of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and they rise in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all {{the fun out of}} the game, and hits a home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.|$|E

25|$|He {{is also a}} {{longtime}} fan of baseball, with favourite teams including the Detroit Tigers, the Chicago Cubs, and the Toronto Blue Jays. In the 1980s, Lee began reading the works of Bill James, particularly The Bill James Baseball Abstracts, which led to an interest in sabermetrics and participation in a fantasy baseball keeper league. He collects baseball memorabilia, once donating part of his collection to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, and threw the ceremonial first pitch to inaugurate the 2013 Toronto Blue Jays season. In 2016, Lee plans to produce an independent film <b>about</b> <b>baseball</b> in Italy.|$|E
25|$|He {{once had}} a {{friendship}} with Ty Cobb, with whom he often had discussions <b>about</b> <b>baseball.</b> He often touted Rogers Hornsby as being the greatest right-handed hitter of all time. This assertion actually led to a split {{in the relationship between}} Ty Cobb and Ted Williams. Once during one of their yearly debate sessions on the greatest hitters of all-time, Williams asserted that Hornsby {{was one of the greatest}} of all-time. Cobb apparently had strong feelings about Hornsby and he threw a fit, expelling Williams from his hotel room. Their friendship effectively terminated after this altercation. This story was later refuted by Ted Williams himself.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Carúpano, a city located in the eastern coastal area of Sucre state in Venezuela. Despite his short, stocky build, he was a gifted athlete and knew more <b>about</b> <b>baseball</b> than his playmates, so he became the natural leader in pickup games and later in school. He was also a fine, {{dependable}} third baseman and, from the start, he {{had the ability to}} hit the ball to all fields, regardless of size or capacity. Owner of a strong throwing arm, he had good range, being able to catch fly balls from his left field and infield teammates, making everything look easy.|$|E

500|$|Musial's {{rookie year}} with Williamson in 1938 {{was a period}} of {{adjustment}} {{both on and off the}} field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge <b>about</b> <b>baseball</b> strategy while posting a 6–6 win–loss record and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA), to go along with a [...]258 batting average. Off the field, he experienced feelings of homesickness while learning to live comfortably and independently on his $65-per-month salary. Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season his numbers improved to a 9–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a [...]352 batting average.|$|E
500|$|Becoming {{immediately}} {{known for}} his quiet nature, Alston was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "The Quiet Man". Alston's personality contrasted with that of Dressen, who was much more outspoken. Sportswriters had difficulty writing about Alston at first because he did not say much. He also seemed more conservative in his decisions on the field, which drew criticism from his players even though he had managed many of them in the minor leagues. Don Zimmer said that he had learned more from Dressen and that Dressen knew more <b>about</b> <b>baseball</b> than Alston. Jackie Robinson did not like Alston at first either, according to Robinson's wife.|$|E

During those {{formative}} years {{he worked in the}} family's pastry shop, where intellectuals of the neighborhood gathered in the evening to discuss social and political issues with his father. Those debates gave birth to Cotillo's early social consciousness that formed the basis of his adult devotion to social reform legislation. The young Cotillo was passionate <b>about</b> <b>baseball</b> and became a New York Giants fan. [...] In return for free tickets he used to clean the stadium seats.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the hardest}} pieces of editing was the hypnotist segment, which {{featured}} several of the guest stars speaking in unison. It was difficult because the parts were recorded {{over a period of}} several months and thus it was hard to sync their voices. Rich Moore was originally intended to direct the episode, but as he did not know anything <b>about</b> <b>baseball</b> he was switched with Jim Reardon, who was a baseball fan. Moore was given the episode [...] "Lisa the Greek" [...] instead. Many of the player designs were difficult, because the animators had a hard time designing real world people during the early seasons.|$|E
500|$|Musial {{was born}} in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six {{children}} (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musiał ( [...] , [...] ). His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and {{his father was a}} Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanisław Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced [...] "Stashu". Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer. Musial also had the benefit of learning <b>about</b> <b>baseball</b> from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher. When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.|$|E
500|$|While both Duchovny and Carter {{had wanted}} to write an episode <b>about</b> <b>baseball</b> for several years, Duchovny first {{conceived}} the basic premise for [...] "The Unnatural" [...] during the home run race in 1998 between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa when he read a newspaper report about Joe Bauman. Bauman was a baseball player who, despite hitting 72 home runs during the 1954 season—at the time, a record for a professional player—never {{made it to the}} Major Leagues. Duchovny immediately connected the story of Bauman, who played for the Roswell Rockets, with the 1947 Roswell Incident, saying [...] "I just made the association...What if this guy was an alien? and I just started working on that idea." [...] Duchovny later said that [...] "these happy chronological coincidences" [...] facilitated the development of the story. Duchovny worked on his idea alone, later admitting that he was satisfied that he did not receive any help.|$|E

500|$|In {{literature}} Tunis' contributions {{have sometimes}} been direct. His baseball books, especially The Kid from Tomkinsville, {{have been cited}} as one source of inspiration for Bernard Malamud's book The Natural, <b>about</b> <b>baseball</b> star Roy Hobbs. Among other similarities, both Hobbs and Tucker started as pitchers but, thanks to accidents, ended up as outfielders and power-hitters. It has been suggested by Michele Schiavone in her study of Tunis' influence on Malamud and Roth that, as an early fan of the Dodgers, Malamud was familiar with Tunis' books and borrowed from them, [...] "consciously or not". Bruce Brooks' introduction to the 1987 edition of The Kid from Tomkinsville [...] says that Tunis [...] "obviously" [...] inspired Mark Harris, author of Bang the Drum Slowly. And in what D. G. Myers in Best Baseball Books Ever called [...] "one of the best pieces of (literary) criticism ever written", The Kid from Tomkinsville is referenced by Nathan Zuckerman, the main character in Philip Roth's novel American Pastoral. For Zuckerman, Tunis' book and pitcher Roy Tucker become what Schiavone called [...] "a template for Zuckerman's view of the Swede", and his realization of the [...] "tragic underside to the American Dream".|$|E
500|$|Stengel {{was born}} in Kansas City, Missouri. He began in 1910 a {{professional}} baseball career that would span over half a century. After almost three seasons in the minor leagues, Stengel reached the major leagues as an outfielder for the Brooklyn Dodgers. His six seasons there saw some success, including {{as a member of}} Brooklyn's 1916 [...] National League championship team, but he also developed a reputation as a clown. After repeated clashes with the Dodgers owner, Charlie Ebbets over pay, Stengel was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1918, but that summer enlisted in the Navy for the remainder of World War I. He continued his pay disputes, resulting in trades to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1919, and to the New York Giants [...] in 1921. There he learned much <b>about</b> <b>baseball</b> from the manager, John McGraw, and had some of the glorious moments in his career, such as hitting an inside-the-park home run in Game 1 of the 1923 World Series to defeat the Yankees. His major league playing career ended with the Boston Braves in 1925, but he then began a career as a manager.|$|E
500|$|With the New York Yankees of the American League (AL) not {{performing}} well, Yankees owners Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston sought to replace [...] "Wild" [...] Bill Donovan as manager. Ban Johnson, [...] AL president, suggested Huggins to Ruppert {{as a replacement}} for Donovan. Huston, who had been in Europe at the time that Ruppert had made the appointment, disliked Huggins and wanted to hire Wilbert Robinson, his drinking buddy. Ruppert himself had been put off by Huggins' wool cap and practice of smoking pipes in public, which he felt was the mark of the working class. However, Ruppert interviewed Huggins upon Johnson's recommendation, and agreed that Huggins knew much <b>about</b> <b>baseball.</b> Ruppert offered the job to Huggins, who initially did not want to take the position, as the Yankees were in no better a position than the Cardinals. J. G. Taylor Spink of The Sporting News eventually convinced Huggins to accept the offer, and he signed a two-year contract. The hiring of Huggins drove a wedge between the two co-owners that culminated in Huston selling his shares of the team to Ruppert in 1922.|$|E
