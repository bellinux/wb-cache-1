5000|$|At 08:30 local Mars time on Sol [...] (May 14, 2008), {{they allowed}} Opportunity to direct as much current as {{possible}} to the warm, joint-1 <b>azimuth</b> <b>motor</b> {{in order to get the}} robotic arm into a usable position, in front of the rover. It worked.|$|E
50|$|This {{strategy}} {{worked for}} Opportunity until Sol 654 (November 25, 2005), when the Joint-1 <b>azimuth</b> <b>motor</b> stalled {{because of increased}} electrical resistance. Rover operators responded by delivering higher-than-normal current to the motor. This approach also worked, though Joint 1 continued to stall periodically. Typically, the rover's handlers simply tried again the next sol and the joint worked. They determined that the Joint-1 motor stalls were most likely due to damage caused by the extreme temperature cycles the joint experienced during deep sleep. As a precaution, they started keeping the robotic arm {{out in front of}} the rover overnight, rather than stowing it underneath the rover deck, where it would be virtually unusable in the event of a Joint-1 motor failure. They stowed the arm only while driving and unstowed it immediately at the end of each drive.|$|E
40|$|The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) {{needs to}} {{maintain}} precise {{positioning of the}} optical elements to deliver unprecedented image quality. Any vibration from observatory sources must therefore be minimized; model-based analysis leads to maximum allowable forces from any individual source typically of order a Newton or less in the most sensitive frequency band. Careful attention throughout the design process is needed to ensure that these challenging requirements are satisfied. We focus here in particular on cogging forces from the <b>azimuth</b> <b>motor</b> drive. Each motor yields periodic tangential and vertical forces of order 100 's of Newtons, with higher harmonics of the waveform potentially exciting telescope structural resonances. There are 56 drive motors, and appropriate phasing between them can ideally cancel most of the net torque or net vertical force. However, the moment created between non-collocated forces still produces image motion even if the net force cancels, and further, small errors in forcer positioning result in imperfect cancellation. We provide a general methodology for estimating total cogging forces and then present {{an example of the}} expected TMT performance impact from motor cogging placed in context with the larger challenge of demanding vibration requirement...|$|E

The altitude and the <b>azimuth</b> <b>motors</b> are hold together by a right angle bracket. The azimuthal plate has been shimmed horizontally using a level. Both motors have an elementary step of 1 °/ 400 = 9 ”. The optical axis of the LED-head is materialized by a parallel beam, the “artificial planet” (AP), which angular aperture is 40 ”...|$|R
5000|$|... a. to {{position}} the azimuth, pitch and roll gimbals of the platform. The basic sequence is that the gyro precession error due to airplane maneuvering is sensed and fed to the platform azimuth synchro resolver. The gyro signals are resolved into pitch and roll error voltages which are amplified in the computer. The computer drives the platform roll and pitch gimbal servo motors. The lower gyro is torqued to precess in azimuth to drive the <b>azimuth</b> gimbal <b>motors.</b> The upper gyro is caged to the lower gyro in azimuth. The gimbal servo motors position the gimbals {{to compensate for the}} original deviation.|$|R
40|$|An {{airborne}} tracking Sun photometer apparatus has a rotatable dome. An <b>azimuth</b> drive <b>motor</b> {{is connected}} to rotate the dome. The dome has an equatorial slot. A cylindrical housing is pivotally mounted inside the dome at the equatorial slot. A photometer is mounted in the housing {{to move in the}} equatorial slot as the housing pivots. The photometer has an end facing from the slot with an optical flat transparent window. An elevation drive motor {{is connected to}} pivot the cylindrical housing. The rotatable dome is mounted in the bulkhead of an aircraft to extend from the interior of the aircraft. A Sun sensor causes the photometer to track the Sun automatically. Alternatively, the photometer may be oriented manually or by computer...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the {{attitude control system}} of the MASCO experiment. The MASCO project is a balloon-borne gamma ray telescope in final phase of development at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE - Brazil). This experiment is a low energy gamma ray telescope that employs a Modified Uniformly Redundant Array (MURA) coded mask in an one-piece mask-antimask configuration. This is the first experiment to use such a mask pattern (MURA) and configuration for astrophysical purposes. The angular resolution is approximately 14 ' over 13 deg. field of view, which requires that the expected pointing accuracy of the attitude control system should be better than {{that in order to}} allow the accomplishment of the scientific goals. Several kinds of sensors (an electronic compass, an axis encoder, a two-axes solar sensor, two accelerometers, a gyroscope and two CCD cameras) are used by this system for redundancy and some of them achieve a precision better than 0. 1 deg. The main actuators are: a reaction wheel for azimuth control, an <b>azimuth</b> <b>motor</b> located in the gondola-balloon decoupling mechanism for desaturation of the reaction wheel and a telescope elevation motor with a harmonic drive reduction. The control system software architecture consists basically of two main files, one with the main calculation routines and the other with the interface routines. The main program starts with the initialization routines and enters a loop of sequential execution of tasks. For each operation mode there is a different sequence of routines. 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of optical telescope {{in the past}} was dominated by {{the construction of the}} telescope body and the precision of optical surface. This thesis fits into a larger project with a goal of controlling a flexible telescope in order to help a cheaper telescope achieve higher accuracy. In order to understand the internal motion of telescope, the goal of this thesis is to build a state space model of a two-degree-of-freedom telescope using a known star location as feedback. The model presented in this thesis may be used for the telescope simulation and the control design in the future. This project considers a light weight flexible structured telescope and uses state space formulation to model dynamic motion of the telescope since state space model is better for modeling and analyzing a multiple-inputs and multiple-outputs system. A one-degree-freedom experimental test stand is built to generate a series of telescope motion data in order to examine whether the telescope simulation model can represent a real telescope system. To record the telescope motion, a wheel encoder mounted on the <b>azimuth</b> <b>motor</b> and a LED light density sensor installed at the end of telescope body are used as feedbacks. The results show that the state space model can simulate many system dynamic behaviors as shown in the experimental result; however, it is not feasible to obtain all of telescope’s physical parameters from the system feedbacks...|$|E
40|$|Athletes {{are always}} seeking {{ways to improve}} their performance. Down time {{and a lack of}} capable throwers prevent {{athletic}} receivers from practicing their skills. We hope to aid athletes in receiving drills within their respective sports and increase practice efficiency. In order to achieve this, the machine has one major axis of rotation driven by a motor. This enables it to adjust where the ball is being thrown. Using an Arduino Uno coupled with a Roboteq AX 1500 motor driver, the Automated Precision Passing System is able to throw a ball to a specified point in space by adjusting both the <b>azimuth</b> and ball-throwing <b>motor</b> speed. Our testing shows that our prototype has the ability to position itself in three different orientations as well as adjust the launch motor speed, but we were unable to launch the ball the original distance that we desired. From this project, we gained valuable knowledge in the areas of machine design, control systems, and project management. In order to continue the project and create a functional consumer product there are several improvements that need to be made to the system. The Automated Precision Passing System needs to be more rigid, have more power, and include more throwing positions...|$|R
40|$|SLR 2000 is {{a concept}} for a totally {{automated}} subcentimeter SLR system presently being studied at GSFC. If funding permits, a prototype would be installed and tested at the Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory (GCAO) in FY 98 and {{a small number of}} automated stations would be fielded by the year 2000. Unlike present systems, the "SLR 2000 " system is being designed to: 1) operate autonomously without the need for onsite operators; 2) present no hazards (i. e., optical, electrical, and/or chemical) to personnel in the vicinity or to overflying aircraft; and 3) have a mean time between failures (MTBF) of at least three months. It is assumed that the systems are located at "friendly" sites where some level of security is provided and where certain low level service functions (e. g. commercial power, communications, heat pump service cleaning, etc.) are available or can be contracted for locally on an as-needed basis. The main system consists of two parts - an optical head and electronics rack. The optical head contains the laser transmitter and power supply, transmit/receive switch, optical telescope, tracking angle sensor (intensified CCD camera), detector and power supply, two angular encoders, <b>azimuth</b> and elevation <b>motors,</b> and a protective dome. The optical head mounts directly {{to the top of a}} concrete pier which contains the geodetic monument and forms part of the environmental housing for the hardware and servicing personnel. It is equipped with electronic levels for leveling the mount and monitoring its stability...|$|R
40|$|A {{low-cost}} rigid foam-based concentrator {{technology development}} program {{was funded by}} the DOE SunShot Initiative to meet installed cost goals of $ 75 /m^ 2 vs. current costs of ∼ $ 200 – 250 /m^ 2. Phase 1 of the project focused on design trades and cost analyses leading to a cost-optimized self-powered autonomous tracking heliostat concept with a mirror surface area in the 100 m^ 2 range. In Phase 2 30 -year accelerated testing of the mirror modules based on ReflecTec film with 94 % specular reflectivity bonded on composite foam substrate were initiated and completed in Phase 3. The tests with 15 coupons showed optical performance degradation of less than 5 % in specular reflectance following 30 -year equivalent UV testing and other abuse testing such as acid rain, bird dropping, thermal cycling, etc. A small scale prototype (3 m× 2 m) heliostat design based on modular truss elements with removable mirror modules was developed in detail. In this phase components such as the dual-axis actuators were sized and selected based on wind load requirements and pointing accuracy demands were completed. Finite Element analyses for the mechanical structure with mirror modules were performed using three separate commercial codes — ANSYS, COMSOL and SolidWorks to validate the optical errors induced by wind loads on the structure up to 35 mph. Results indicated that the RMS deflections contributed to less than 0. 4 mrad pointing error. Dynamic response of the heliostat indicated that the first 5 eigenmodes were in the 17 – 20 Hz range. The individual structure elements such as the trusses and c-rails were fabricated locally and assembled with the mirror facets in the lab for initial fit check and testing. The nine mirror facet surface errors were characterized using photogrammetry and verified using Reverse Hartmann techniques and showed to be in the order of 1 mrad or less. A three-level controller (main, gateway and heliostat) was architected and built. Tracking of the sun is done using NREL’s Sun Tracking Algorithm implemented in the gateway controller. Target-pointing vectors are calculated for each heliostat and conveyed wirelessly to the individual heliostat controllers for actuating the <b>azimuth</b> and elevation <b>motors.</b> The power subsystem consisting of solar panels and a battery provide 24 V for the actuators and controller boards. The system was sized to provide adequate power for a period of 5 hrs of operation when power is not available. Initial calibration will be performed with on-site camera tracking the sun’s image on a target located approximately 52 m from the heliostat. Testing of the heliostat pointing under calm and windy conditions will be done to demonstrate overall performance that meet DOE targets of 4 mrad under 27 mph winds. Commercialization efforts are underway to transition the design to the commercial sector. The project is {{well on its way to}} approaching overall cost targets and current estimates are approximately S 90 – 110 /m^ 2 and lower costs can be achieved with alternates to the film we have identified...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the author}} {{describes}} all the developmental {{work of an}} automated surveying tracking theodolite referred to as The Anglescan Tracking System. This system consists of an optical system, an electronic system (with detailed schematics and printed circuit artwork, included) the software system which is approximately 100 pages of C source code, system identification and controller simulation, modelling and design, and finally instrument calibration and testing effort over a 2 year period. The project is a collaboration between the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the School of Surveying at the University of Tasmania. It is supported by an ARC university research fund granted to the School of Surveying over a two year period. The initial investigation into the feasibility {{of the project was}} carried out by Dr. A. Sprent, then at the North East London Polytechnic (Sprent, 1. 12). During this time the optical system of the instrument was developed. Following this investigation, it was decided to further undertake the continuation of the project as a Master's Degree in order to develop the electronics, measurement, tracking and control software. The Anglescan system is similar to a standard surveying theodolite mounted on a tripod and capable of determining the position of a retro-reflective mirror based within the instrument's field of view with respect with its optical centre of field (in both azimuth and elevation planes). This involves a new and different technique for target location than the currently existing electronic theodolites (see sections 1. 5, 1. 6). One of the main advantages of this method is the improved target locating accuracy, it has been field tested with an accuracy of + 1 - 1 second of arc, and simplicity in optical design. The disadvantages however include increased complexity of both the hardware (electronics), software, and calibration involved. The instrument deviates from a standard theodolite in that it has been fitted with precision DC servomotor drives on the azimuth and elevation axes for target tracking. The servomotors also include optical rotary encoders for measurement [...] While tracking, the system operates by continuously locating the target mirror with respect to its centre of field of view, then applying a feedback control signal to the <b>azimuth</b> and elevation <b>motors</b> in order to re-centre the instrument directly onto the target, this is updated at a rate of 30 samples/second. Part of the objectives of this work is to design the necessary hardware and software to achieve this task, this includes the design of a return (laser) analog signal processor card, the design of a target position measurement card, and azimuth/elevation servo <b>motors</b> interface cards (<b>azimuth</b> card and elevation card). Furthermore, the project also requires the design of an appropriate target acquisition and control loop strategy to allow smooth and accurate tracking of a moving target. A number of control system designs have been investigated, including proportional control, pole placement design and linear quadratic control. We have also used system identification techniques to obtain an accurate model of the plant which is necessary for controller design and simulation. To achieve the high precision required in measurement, it is necessary to calibrate the instrument. The calibration method is a complex procedure which uses least squares techniques to produce the required calibration accuracy (this is discussed in detail in section 5). The instrument finds applications in areas such as monitoring earth movements, motion of large structures such as building and bridges, locating earth working machinery such as tractors, bulldozers, graders, concrete and asphalt paving machines where an accurate level surface is required. Another application of particular interest is in surface contour mapping where we require to map a 3 dimensional surface (obtain the surface contour or topography), this application is a slightly more complex problem requiring the use of two instruments, this then becomes a multivariable control problem. As a result of this research work, one paper was presented at the IREECON - 91 conference in Sydney and is published in the proceedings [Dirita 1. 13]. Another paper was presented at the CONTROL- 92 conference held in Perth in November 1992 and is published in the proceedings [Dirita 4. 4]...|$|R
