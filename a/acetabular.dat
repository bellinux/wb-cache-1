5|$|After playing 48 {{games in}} the 2006–07 NHL season, Kesler {{suffered}} a torn <b>acetabular</b> labrum and missed {{the remainder of the}} regular season, finishing the season with sixteen points. Kesler returned to the Canucks lineup for the first game of their quarterfinal playoff series versus the Dallas Stars. While blocking a shot in the fourth overtime of the game, Kesler was re-injured, suffering a displaced index finger. Despite finishing the game, Kesler was forced to undergo surgery to repair the damage and missed the remainder of the playoffs. In the off-season, the Canucks re-signed Kesler to a three-year, $5.25-million contract extension on May 24, 2007. In comparison to his previous contract, facilitated by the Flyers' offer sheet, the deal represented a $150,000 paycut in terms of average annual salary.|$|E
5|$|He {{opened his}} 2011 {{season with a}} run in the 150m {{straight}} race at Manchester's Great City Games and timed 14.51 seconds (the second fastest after Bolt's 2009 run). His season's best run of 9.79sec for the 100m came in June in Clermont, Florida and ranked it him as the third fastest {{in the event that}} year. Gay was defeated by Steve Mullings at the adidas Grand Prix in New York – Mullings failed a doping test later that month and was banned for life. A nagging hip injury led to Gay's withdrawal from the 2011 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships and in July he underwent <b>acetabular</b> labrum surgery; almost a year passed until the next time he competed.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of the <b>acetabular</b> cup influences the range of motion of the leg, and also affects the risk of dislocation. For this purpose, the <b>acetabular</b> inclination and the <b>acetabular</b> anteversion are mesurements of cup angulation in the coronal plane and the sagittal plane, respectively.|$|E
25|$|File:Range of <b>acetabular</b> {{inclination}}.png|Acetabular inclination {{is normally}} between 30 and 50°. A larger angle {{increases the risk}} of dislocation.|$|E
25|$|File:Range of <b>acetabular</b> {{anteversion}}.png|Acetabular anteversion {{is normally}} between 5 and 25°. An anteversion below or above this range {{increases the risk}} of dislocation. There is an intra-individual variability in this method because the pelvis may be tilted in various degrees in relation to the transverse plane.|$|E
25|$|The <b>acetabular</b> cup is the {{component}} which is placed into the acetabulum (hip socket). Cartilage and bone {{are removed from}} the acetabulum and the <b>acetabular</b> cup is attached using friction or cement. Some <b>acetabular</b> cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either UHMWPE (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is {{held in place by}} a metal coating {{on the outside of the}} cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are sintered beads and a foam metal design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force. Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a Morse taper.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosthetic}} implant used in {{hip replacement}} {{consists of three}} parts: the <b>acetabular</b> cup, the femoral component, and the articular interface. Options exist for different people and indications. The evidence {{for a number of}} newer devices is not very good, including: ceramic-on-ceramic bearings, modular femoral necks, and uncemented monoblock cups. Correct selection of the prosthesis is important.|$|E
25|$|File:Center of {{rotation}} of hip prosthesis.jpg|Center {{of rotation}}: The horizontal center of rotation is calculated as {{the distance between}} the <b>acetabular</b> teardrop and the center of the head (or caput) of the prosthesis and/or the native femoral head on the contralateral side. The vertical center of rotation instead uses the transischial line for reference. The parameter should be equal on both sides.|$|E
25|$|Similar causes as extra-articular {{snapping}} hip syndrome but often with an underlying mechanical {{problem in the}} lower extremity. The pain associated with internal variety {{tends to be more}} intense and therefore more debilitating than the external variety. Intra-articular {{snapping hip}} syndrome is often indicative of injury such as a torn <b>acetabular</b> labrum, recurrent hip subluxation, ligamentum teres tears, loose bodies, articular cartilage damage, or synovial chondromatosis (cartilage formations in the synovial membrane of the joint).|$|E
25|$|The modern total hip {{replacement}} was pioneered by Sir John Charnley, expert in tribology at Wrightington Hospital, England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could {{be replaced by}} implants cemented to the bone. His design consisted of a stainless steel one-piece femoral stem and head and a polyethylene, <b>acetabular</b> component, {{both of which were}} fixed to the bone using PMMA (acrylic) bone cement. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty and its derivative designs were the most-used systems in the world. This formed the basis for all modern hip implants.|$|E
25|$|A few {{patients}} {{who have had a}} hip replacement suffer chronic pain after the surgery. Groin pain can develop if the muscle that raises the hip (iliopsoas) rubs against the edge of the <b>acetabular</b> cup. Bursitis can develop at the trochanter where a surgical scar crosses the bone, or if the femoral component used pushes the leg out to the side too far. Also some patients can experience pain in cold or damp weather. Incision made {{in the front of the}} hip (anterior approach) can cut a nerve running down the thigh leading to numbness in the thigh and occasionally chronic pain at the point where the nerve was cut (a neuroma).|$|E
25|$|Initial hip {{designs were}} made of a {{one-piece}} femoral component and a one-piece <b>acetabular</b> component. Current designs have a femoral stem and separate head piece. Using an independent head allows the surgeon to adjust leg length (some heads seat more or less onto the stem) and to select from various materials from which the head is formed. A modern acetabulum component is also made up of two parts: a metal shell with a coating for bone attachment and a separate liner. First the shell is placed. Its position can be adjusted, unlike the original cemented cup design which are fixed in place once the cement sets. When proper positioning of the metal shell is obtained, the surgeon may select a liner made from various materials.|$|E
25|$|To combat {{loosening}} {{caused by}} polyethylene wear debris, hip manufacturers developed improved and novel {{materials for the}} <b>acetabular</b> liners. Ceramic heads mated with regular polyethylene liners or a ceramic liner were the first significant alternative. Metal liners to mate with a metal head were also developed. At the same time these designs were being developed, the problems that caused polyethylene wear were determined and manufacturing of this material improved. Highly crosslinked UHMWPE {{was introduced in the}} late 1990s. The most recent data comparing the various bearing surfaces has shown no clinically significant differences in their performance. Potential early problems with each material are discussed below. Performance data after 20 or 30 years may be needed to demonstrate significant differences in the devices. All newer materials allow use of larger diameter femoral heads. Use of larger heads significantly decreases the chance of the hip dislocating, which remains the greatest complication of the surgery.|$|E

500|$|A month into 2008–09 season, Kariya {{suffered}} a hip injury after being hit from behind {{in a game}} against the Anaheim Ducks on November 5, 2008, tearing muscle fibers near the top his left thigh. The injury was initially undisclosed at the time and was erroneously reported as having resulted from a blocked shot. At the time of the injury, he had 15 points (2 goals and 13 assists) over 11 games, tying him for sixth in NHL scoring. After nearly two months of recovery, he began practicing with the Blues, but had a setback in late-December; a subsequent MRI exam revealed additional hip damage. Undergoing surgery for a torn <b>acetabular</b> labrum on January 5, 2009, the team listed him as sidelined indefinitely, while Blues President John Davidson told reporters he might be back late that season or the next. The following month, another MRI revealed a torn labrum in the opposite side of his hip, as well, requiring a second surgery. Despite the loss of Kariya, the Blues made the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 2004. With the Blues matching up against the Vancouver Canucks in the first round, Kariya began practicing with the team in hopes of a comeback for the playoffs. He told reporters that he felt [...] "stronger than ...since 1999." [...] The Blues were swept in four games however, before Kariya could return.|$|E
500|$|Jackson has had {{multiple}} injuries. In 2008, after the Olympics, she had surgery to fix her ankle. In 2009, {{she had two}} stress fractures in her back. In December 2010, she had an Achilles injury. [...] She sustained the injury playing in Australia. Between January 2011 and February 2012, she had surgeries to assist with Achilles and hip injuries. She had surgery on her left hip <b>acetabular</b> labrum in June 2011 in Vail, Colorado at the Richard Steadman Clinic. [...] She said of the surgery: [...] "This is a really, really tough decision, but after talking with my doctors and my family, we felt that immediate surgery is {{the best course of}} action. With something painful like this hip injury, I want to be especially proactive. I plan to stay in Seattle to be here with my team and try my best to be back on the court as soon as possible. My goal is to be at full strength {{by the end of the}} season." [...] She did rehab twice a day in an attempt to speed recovery. Afterwards, Jackson injured her right knee, requiring surgery in 2012. Another knee injury while playing in China in 2014 degraded into arthritis and required many surgical intervention in the following years, including a hospitalization in January 2016 once the operated knee joint got infected. All the consequences of this knee problem lead to Jackson's retirement in March. Jackson has expressed interest in undergoing a knee reconstruction, as [...] "I don't want to walk with a limp for the rest of my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{replacement}} joint, {{which was}} known as the Low Friction Arthroplasty, was lubricated with synovial fluid. The small femoral head (...) was chosen for Charnley's belief that it would have lower friction against the <b>acetabular</b> component and thus wear out the acetabulum more slowly. Unfortunately, the smaller head dislocated more easily. Alternative designs with larger heads such as the Mueller prosthesis were proposed. Stability was improved, but <b>acetabular</b> wear and subsequent failure rates were increased with these designs. The Teflon <b>acetabular</b> components of Charnley's early designs failed within a year or two of implantation. This prompted a search for a more suitable material. A German salesman showed a polyethylene gear sample to Charnley's machinist, sparking the idea to use this material for the <b>acetabular</b> component. The ultra high molecular weight polyethylene or UHMWPE <b>acetabular</b> component was introduced in 1962. Charnley's other major contribution was to use polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement to attach the two components to the bone. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty, and derivative designs were the most used systems in the world. It formed the basis for all modern hip implants.|$|E

2500|$|Adjustments {{are made}} to part of the hip-bone. Many {{operating}} methods and variations have been developed. [...] They are defined {{by the type of}} cut and adjustment made. Some <b>acetabular</b> procedures are named after the surgeons who first described them as Salter (R. Salter), Dega (W. Dega), Sutherland (D.H. Sutherland), Chiari (K. Chiari): other names one may encounter are Ludlov, P. Pemberton, and James B. Steele. Some are named after the shape of cut (e.g. Chevron, Wedge) or the way the bones are aligned (Dial=old style rotary dial phone).|$|E
2500|$|DARthroplasty (dorsal <b>acetabular</b> rim arthroplasty) is a {{technique}} developed by Dr. Barclay Slocum and Theresa Devine Slocum whereby cortico-cancellous bone strips, taken from the iliac crest, are contoured over the femoral head and sutured to the dorsal hip joint capsule and packed with additional cancellous bone graft dorsally to eventually anchor to drill holes in the original dorsal acetabulum. The new [...] "shelf" [...] eventually becomes {{an extension of the}} original acetabulum, thereby providing support and eliminating subluxation of the hip joint. The joint capsule becomes the new joint surface.|$|E
2500|$|A {{skeletal}} {{survey is}} useful to confirm the diagnosis of achondroplasia. The skull is large, with a narrow foramen magnum, and relatively small skull base. The vertebral bodies are short and flattened with relatively large intervertebral disk height, and there is congenitally narrowed spinal canal. The iliac wings are small and squared, with a narrow sciatic notch and horizontal <b>acetabular</b> roof. The tubular bones are short and thick with metaphyseal cupping and flaring and irregular growth plates. Fibular overgrowth is present. The hand is broad with short metacarpals and phalanges, and a trident configuration. The ribs are short with cupped anterior ends. If the radiographic features are not classic, {{a search for a}} different diagnosis should be entertained. Because of the extremely deformed bone structure, people with achondroplasia are often [...] "double jointed".|$|E
2500|$|The {{articular}} interface is {{not part}} of either implant, rather it is the area between the <b>acetabular</b> cup and femoral component. The articular interface of the hip is a simple ball and socket joint. Size, material properties and machining tolerances at the articular interface can be selected based on patient demand to optimise implant function and longevity whilst mitigating associated risks. The interface size is measured by the outside diameter of the head or the inside diameter of the socket. Common sizes of femoral heads are , [...] and [...] While [...] was common in the first modern prostheses, now even larger sizes are available from 38 to over 54mm. Larger-diameter heads lead to increased stability and range of motion whilst lowering the risk of dislocation. At the same time they are also subject to higher stresses such as friction and inertia. Different combinations of materials have different physical properties which can be coupled {{to reduce the amount of}} wear debris generated by friction. Typical pairings of materials include metal on polyethylene (MOP), metal on crosslinked polyethylene (MOXP), ceramic on ceramic (COC), ceramic on crosslinked polyethylene (COXP) and metal on metal (MOM). Each combination has different advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
