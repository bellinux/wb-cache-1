25|$|International Harvester never {{recovered}} from the strike. In November 1981, IH asked the UAW for $100 million in wage and benefit concessions.

But with the firm's financial condition rapidly worsening, the UAW opened negotiations in March 1982. Negotiators reached a tentative agreement nearly two years to the day after the 19791980 strike ended, giving Harvester $200 million in wage, benefit, pension, and other savings over three years.|$|E

25|$|Religious {{leaders have}} often been {{prominent}} among those who considered smoking immoral or outright blasphemous. In 1634 the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus' forbade the sale of tobacco and sentenced {{men and women who}} flouted the ban to have their nostrils slit and their backs whipped until skin came off their backs. The Western church leader Pope Urban VII likewise condemned smoking in a papal bull of 1590. Despite many concerted efforts, restrictions and bans were almost universally ignored. When James VI and I, a staunch anti-smoker and the author of A Counterblaste to Tobacco, tried to curb the new trend by enforcing <b>a</b> <b>whopping</b> 4000% tax increase on tobacco in 1604, it proved a failure, as London had some 7,000 tobacco sellers by the early 17th century. Later, scrupulous rulers would realise the futility of smoking bans and instead turned tobacco trade and cultivation into lucrative government monopolies.|$|E
25|$|After {{promising}} {{seasons in}} 2005 and 2006, {{it was expected}} that the Tigers would take the next step in 2007, and play finals football.

Their first premiership points came in a draw against the Brisbane Lions in Round 10, and their first win of the season didn't come until Round 12 against fellow straggler Melbourne. After Round 18 of the season, the Tigers had registered a mere 1 win, 1 draw, and 16 losses, and were looking like recording their worst ever recorded season. However, late-season victories over old rivals Collingwood in Round 19, and Essendon in Round 21, saved them from this fate.

500|$|Knight {{appreciated}} {{that there were}} problems with Gorman's claims, but he [...] "either misinterpreted, or deliberately ignored" [...] them. Knight admitted that parts of Gorman's story were wrong but claimed that such mistakes were [...] "stronger support {{of the fact that}} he was telling the truth". Realising that Anderson's absence in Switzerland meant that Anderson could not have been an accomplice, Knight considered Walter Sickert a much more likely culprit than Anderson, and suggested that he was the [...] "third man" [...] to participate in the crimes. This was not the first accusation made against Sickert. He had been previously mentioned as a potential suspect in Donald McCormick's 1959 book The Identity of Jack the Ripper. However, Sickert was in France with his mother and brother in the late summer of 1888, and is unlikely even to have been in London at the time of at least four of the murders. After Knight implicated Sickert, Joseph Gorman withdrew his testimony, admitting to The Sunday Times newspaper that [...] "it was a hoax... <b>a</b> <b>whopping</b> fib".|$|E
500|$|The {{next month}} in New York City, a January 15–21, 1898 double-elimination, five-man {{invitational}} 18.2 balkline tournament was arranged, again in Chicago.

Without having {{to rely on the}} 600-point handicap, Spinks beat Schaefer flat-out, 260–139 (with a high [...] of 48 vs. Schaefer's 38) in his January 18 second game. [...] Spinks (with a high run of [...] "only" [...] 44) was defeated in a very close 249–260 third game a day later by Catton (high run 56) – by way of comparison, the same night Ives trounced Sutton by <b>a</b> <b>whopping</b> 400–160. [...] By January 20, Spinks seemed to be running out of steam, as Sutton took him 260–118, (high runs 73 vs. 30), and he lost again 154–400 (with another high run of 44) to Ives a day later. (In Spinks's defense, he not only did better against Ives than Catton had, but Ives also had a very impressive high run of 136, making it virtually impossible to catch up.) [...] This loss put Spinks out of the tournament at 4th place.|$|E

As Jackson’s first album to land atop the Billboard 200, it marked professional and personal breakthroughs. Distancing herself from the immense Jackson family shadow, she created {{one of the most}} influential projects across contemporary R and pop music. And not only was Jackson’s maiden voyage with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis at the forefront of R, pop and hip-hop’s intersection, it birthed a novel sound in the process." [...] MTV's Meaghan Garvey asserted [...] "it’s hard to overstate the significance of Control, whether in terms of the pop landscape, the evolution of the music video as a vessel for promotion and expression, or Top 40 feminist anthems." [...] She also argued [...] "it’s important to note that Control’s self-actualization anthems were expressions of black female pride. Control spawned <b>a</b> <b>whopping</b> six videos—great ones, at that—which played an immeasurable role in the shift toward visible black pop." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of Los Angeles Times wrote that Jackson's continued influence is evident in the careers of Rihanna, Beyoncé, Ciara, FKA Twigs and Tinashe in that [...] "all of them take cues from Jackson's blueprint. And all that began with Control." ...|$|E

[...] GamePro criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system. [...] According to reviewer Blake Snow, [...] "Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if {{you were one of the}} unlucky souls who completely bought into Sega's add-on frenzy, you would have spent <b>a</b> <b>whopping</b> $650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog." [...] Writing for GamesRadar, Reparaz noted that [...] "developers—not wanting to waste time on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn't split their user base with pricey add-ons." [...] Reparaz went on to criticize Sega's decision to release the 32X, noting that [...] "(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out." [...] Writing for IGN, Buchanan also notes that [...] "Notice that we haven't seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And that's a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience." ...|$|E

[...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "The minions are still wacky scene-stealers– and once again, we don't get nearly enough of them– but Gru and his daughters have been blanded down to bad-sitcom level." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "With its predecessor having made <b>a</b> <b>whopping</b> $540 million globally, it's no wonder that Universal saw fit to order a sequel. But it's not enough just to trot out legions of minions and cobble together a plot. Audiences deserve more imagination and inventiveness than this wan recycling." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C' grade, saying [...] "By the end, every child in the audience will want his or her own monster-minion toy.

[...] Capobianco commended tracks like [...] "Be Where You Are," [...] and [...] "Love Lost", commenting that [...] "tracks like that show that he is indeed ready for the next step." [...] Andrew Rennie of Now said, [...] "slight deviations from R classic formula allow Trey Songz wiggle room to play with his multi-octave voice. This offering sets him apart from other acts and may secure his spot in the canon of bedroom crooners." [...] Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that after making his name for singing hooks on rap songs, that he [...] "shows his smooth R vocals can hold the spotlight all on their own." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 3½ out of 5 stars and wrote that Songz [...] "takes cues from R. Kelly, slyly mocking the self-parodying excesses of boudoir R while supplying the utilitarian goods: the sumptuous vocal harmonies and sultry beats upon which long nights beneath ceiling mirrors depend". A writer for USA Today said the album reflects his broad appeal, and that Songz's proves [...] "he's comfortable as a rogue or romantic. Even though the review pointed out that [...] "he occasionally falls back on booty-call clichés," [...] it did point out that [...] "his song craft shines on the edgy [...] "Black Roses" [...] and regretful [...] "Love Lost."
