30|$|Low-rank coals, such as lignites, have {{considerable}} natural permeability {{and can be}} exploited for UCG {{without the need for}} linking technologies. However, high-rank coals, such as <b>anthracites,</b> are far less permeable, making the gas production rate more limited if UCG is employed [35]. For the use of high-rank coals in UCG, a method of linking must be employed to increase the permeability and fracture the coal seam [36]. The boreholes in traditional LVW gasifiers are linked by special methods including forward combustion, reverse combustion, fire linkage, electric linkage, hydrofracturing, and directional drilling to create sizable gasification channels [35, 37].|$|R

5|$|Utica's {{location}} on the Erie and Chenango canals encouraged industrial development, allowing the transport of <b>anthracite</b> from northeastern Pennsylvania for local manufacturing and distribution. Utica's economy centered around the manufacture of furniture, heavy machinery, textiles and lumber. The combined effects of the Embargo Act of 1807 and local investment enabled further expansion of the textile industry. Like other upstate New York cities, mills in Utica processed cotton from the Deep South, a slave society. Much of the New York economy was closely involved with slavery; in the antebellum period, half of New York's exports were related to cotton.|$|E
40|$|International audienceCO 2 {{injection}} in unmineable coal seams {{could be}} one interesting option for both storage and methane recovery processes. The objective {{of this study is}} to compare and model pure gas sorption isotherms (CO 2 and CH 4) for well-characterised coals of different maturities to determine the most suitable coal for CO 2 storage. Carbon dioxide and methane adsorption on several coals have been investigated using a gravimetric adsorption method. The experiments were carried out using both CO 2 and CH 4 pure gases at 25 °C from 0. 1 to 5 MPa (1 to 50 bar). The experimental results were fitted using Temkin's approach but also with the corrected Langmuir's and the corrected Tóth's equations. The two last approaches are more accurate from a thermodynamical point of view, and have the advantage of taking into account the fact that experimental data (isotherms) correspond to excess adsorption capacities. These approaches allow better quantification of the adsorbed gas. Determined CO 2 adsorption capacities are from 0. 5 to 2 mmol/g of dry coal. Modelling provides also the affinity parameters of the two gases for the different coals. We have shown these parameters determined with adsorption models could be used for classification and first selection of coals for CO 2 storage. The affinity ratio ranges from a value close to 1 for immature coals to 41 for high rank coals like <b>anthracites.</b> This ratio allows selecting coals having high CO 2 adsorption capacities. In our case, the modelling study of a significant number of coals from various ranks shows that <b>anthracites</b> seem to have the highest CO 2 storage capacities. Our study provides high quality affinity parameters and values of CO 2 and CH 4 adsorption capacities on various coals for the future modelling of CO 2 injection in coal seams...|$|R

Emission factors for four pollutants (particulate matter, CO 2, total hydrocarbons, and NO x) were 2 - 4 times higher for bituminous coals than for <b>anthracites.</b> In past inventories of carbonaceous emissions used for climate modeling, these two types of coal were not treated separately.

40|$|High-temperature H- 1 NMR and rheometry {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} on 4 : 1 wt/wt blends of a medium volatile bituminous coal with two <b>anthracites,</b> two petroleum cokes, charcoal, wood, a low-temperature coke breeze, tyre crumb, and active carbon {{to determine the effects}} on fluidity development to identify the parameters responsible for these effects during pyrolysis and to study possible relationships among the parameters derived from these techniques. Positive, negative, and neutral effects were identified on the concentration of fluid material. Small positive effects (ca. 5 - 6 %) were caused by blending the coal with petroleum cokes. Charcoal, wood, and active carbon all exerted negative effects on concentration (18 - 27 % reduction) and mobility (12 - 25 % reduction in T- 2) of the fluid phase, which have been associated with the inert character and high surface areas of these additives that adsorb the fluid phase of the coal. One of the <b>anthracites</b> and the low-temperature coke breeze caused deleterious effects to a lesser extent on the concentration (7 - 12 %) and mobility (13 - 17 %) of the fluid material, possibly due to the high concentration of metals in these additives (ca. 11 % ash). Despite the high fluid character of tyre crumb at the temperature of maximum fluidity of the coal (73 %), the mobility of the fluid phase of the blend was lower than expected. The comparison of H- 1 NMR and rheometry results indicated that to account for the variations in minimum complex viscosity (eta(*)) for all the blends, both the maximum concentration of fluid phase and the maximum mobility of the fluid material (T- 2 L) had to be considered. For individual blends, two exponential relationships have been found between the complex viscosity and the concentration of solid phase in both the softening and resolidification stages but the parameters are different for each blend...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} {{effects of}} inherent mineral matters {{on the evolution}} of char structure, the microcrystalline structures of chars from the pyrolysis of raw, HCl-washed (CW) and HCl & HF-washed <b>anthracites</b> (CFW) were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) respectively. Stacking height (Lc), interlayer spacing (d(002)) and crystallite width (La) were used as parameters for char structure estimation. The results showed that with increasing contents of inherent mineral matters, Lc of char decreased, whereas don and La increased. To study effects of a single inorganic matter, CFW was impregnated with Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, and CaO respectively. It was found that all of them (oxides) have resulted in the decrease in Lc and increase in La and d(002). Differing from Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, and CaO, the introduction of Fe 2 O 3 has caused the reduction for both La and Lc values simultaneously, especially when the Fe 2 O 3 contents in the coal were high...|$|R
