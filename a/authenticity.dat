5|$|In 2016 {{a team of}} Mayanists {{including}} Coe {{published a}} review of the evidence and presented further arguments in support of the <b>authenticity</b> of the document; in 2017, a critical review of the argument by Bruce Love concluded that the alleged codex's <b>authenticity</b> remains doubtful.|$|E
5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: integrity and <b>authenticity.</b> Integrity is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). <b>Authenticity</b> refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the <b>authenticity</b> of evidence.|$|E
5|$|In Korea a Limited Collector's Edition DVD was {{released}} {{which included a}} leather wallet, Stephen Chow's Palm Figure with his signature, a photo album and Special Kung Fu's Booklet with a Certificate of <b>authenticity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The €200 note {{contains}} several complex {{security features}} such as watermarks, invisible ink, holograms and microprinting that document its <b>authenticity.</b> In September 2011, there were about 178,838,200 €200 banknotes in circulation around the eurozone.|$|E
5|$|These {{instructions}} {{stated that}} {{the objectives of the}} Partisans meant that there could be no cooperation between them and the Chetniks. They also appointed Đurišić as a Chetnik vojvoda. Some historians have challenged the <b>authenticity</b> of these instructions; they say the document was a forgery made by Đurišić after he failed to reach Mihailović. Other historians either do not mention any controversy about the provenance of the instructions, mention evidence supporting their <b>authenticity,</b> or explicitly state they consider them to be authentic.|$|E
5|$|According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the Sangam poems {{were created}} between the 1st century and 4th century {{and many of}} them are free from {{literary}} conceits. The Macropaedia mentions that the historical <b>authenticity</b> of sections of Sangam literature has been confirmed by archaeological evidence.|$|E
5|$|As screenwriter, Fellowes {{sought to}} make the film as {{historically}} accurate as possible. With this in mind, Academy Award-winning costume designer Sandy Powell and historical consultant Alastair Bruce were hired, and filming for The Young Victoria took place at various historical landmarks in England to further the film's <b>authenticity.</b> Despite this, {{various aspects of the}} film have been criticised for their historical inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|Bhanu Athaiya, an Oscar {{winner for}} Gandhi, was the costume {{designer}} for the film. With {{a large number}} of extras, it was difficult for her to make enough costumes. She {{spent a lot of time}} researching to lend <b>authenticity</b> to the characters.|$|E
5|$|Maximilian Hell {{published}} {{the results of}} his expedition in 1770, in Copenhagen. Based on {{the results of his}} own expedition, and of Wales and Cook, in 1772 he presented another calculation of the astronomical unit: 151.7 million kilometers. Lalande queried the accuracy and <b>authenticity</b> of the Hell expedition, but later he retreated in an article of Journal des sçavans, in 1778.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{radiocarbon}} dating techniques date {{an object of}} popular interest, for example the Shroud of Turin, a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. Three separate laboratories dated samples of linen from the Shroud in 1988; the results pointed to 14th-century origins, raising doubts about the shroud's <b>authenticity</b> as an alleged 1st-century relic.|$|E
5|$|Other T206 Wagners, both {{legitimate}} and fake, have surfaced in recent years. Some {{of the real}} cards have fetched {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars in auctions. One particular T206 Honus Wagner owned by John Cobb and Ray Edwards has attracted media controversy over its <b>authenticity,</b> with many leading hobby experts regarding it as a fake.|$|E
5|$|Other tablets {{appear to}} have been cut with a steel blade, often rather crudely. Although steel knives were {{available}} after the arrival of the Spanish, this does cast suspicion on the <b>authenticity</b> of these tablets.|$|E
5|$|The <b>authenticity</b> of {{the head}} has long been debated, and has {{resulted}} in several scientific analyses. The most notable and detailed of these was Karl Pearson and Geoffrey Morant's study conducted in the 1930s, which concluded that the Wilkinson head was that of Cromwell. Rumours and conspiracy theories have circulated since Cromwell's head fell from Westminster Hall.|$|E
5|$|The broad {{variety of}} work {{produced}} using a semi-mechanized process with many collaborators, Warhol's popularity, {{the value of}} his works, and the diversity of works across various media and genre have created a need for the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board to certify the <b>authenticity</b> of works by Warhol.|$|E
5|$|The {{commissioning}} aside, Delaroche {{was inspired}} to create Bonaparte Crossing the Alps because {{he felt that he}} both looked like Napoleon, and that his achievements were comparable to Napoleon's. It is likely that Delaroche's painting is relatively historically accurate; details such as Napoleon's clothes appear to have been researched by Delaroche in an effort at <b>authenticity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{head was}} {{conclusively}} seen on Westminster Hall {{as late as}} 1684, {{and it was on}} the south side of the Hall. Archaeological evidence also disproved its <b>authenticity.</b> The skull was pierced from the top, not from the bottom; and the skull had no trace of skin or hair, showing it had never been embalmed.|$|E
5|$|The hundred euro note {{contains}} several complex {{security features}} such as watermarks, invisible ink, holograms and microprinting that document its <b>authenticity.</b> In May 2012, there were approximately 1,652,287,100 hundred euro banknotes in circulation in the eurozone.|$|E
5|$|The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury praised Æthelnoth's wisdom. A {{story of}} {{doubtful}} <b>authenticity</b> tells how {{he refused to}} crown King Harold Harefoot, as he had promised Cnut to crown none but a son of the king by his wife, Emma.|$|E
5|$|The {{revelations of}} Nosaka's {{involvement}} in Yamamoto's death shocked the JCP, already reduced to six {{seats in the}} Diet after the 1991 elections. Akahata ("Red Flag"), a prominent communist newspaper, sent a team of journalists to Moscow to investigate the allegations, and they confirmed the <b>authenticity</b> of the documents.|$|E
5|$|The state seal is {{maintained}} by the Governor of Indiana. It is used to certify the <b>authenticity</b> of official state documents. The seal is placed on departmental reports, bills the Governor signs into law, and official communications from the Governor to other high-ranking office holders. The seal is also used on all commissions granted by the state as proof of the commission's authority.|$|E
5|$|The €50 note {{contains}} several complex {{security features}} such as watermarks, invisible ink, holograms and microprinting that document its <b>authenticity.</b> In January 2016, there were about 8,170,000,000 fifty euro banknotes in circulation in the eurozone. It {{is by far the}} most widely circulated denomination, compromising over 44% of the total banknotes.|$|E
5|$|Though {{there are}} {{doubts about the}} <b>authenticity</b> of the White Horse Prophecy as a whole, several sources {{attribute}} to Smith {{the idea that the}} United States Constitution would one day hang by a thread, and LDS Church leaders have issued similar warnings with regard to the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|When the Cicero {{documents}} predicted Allied bombing {{missions in}} the Balkans, {{which took place}} on the predicted date, the <b>authenticity</b> of the information was supported and his reputation enhanced. Moyzisch told Cicero {{that at the end of}} the war Hitler intended to give him a villa.|$|E
5|$|While {{designing}} the Creighton-Ward Mansion sets, Bell {{and his staff}} strove for <b>authenticity,</b> ordering miniature Tudor paintings, -scale Georgian- and Regency-style furniture and carpeting {{in the shape of}} a polar bear skin. This realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste and electronics shops. For example, a vacuum cleaner pipe serves as Virgil Tracy's launch chute.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal did {{not mention}} either of these events—or Kohlrautz's part in them—when testifying to American {{investigators}} in May 1945, or in an affidavit he made in August 1954 about his wartime persecutions, and researcher Guy Walters questions their <b>authenticity.</b> Wiesenthal variously reported that Kohlrautz was killed on the Soviet Front in 1944 or in the Battle of Berlin on 19 April 1945.|$|E
5|$|A partial {{recreation}} of the Kowloon Walled City {{exists in}} the Kawasaki Warehouse, an amusement arcade that opened in 2009 in the Japanese suburb of Kawasaki, Kanagawa. The designer's desire to accurately replicate {{the atmosphere of the}} Walled City is reflected in the arcade's narrow corridors, electrical wires, pipes, postboxes, sign boards, neon lights, frayed posters, and various other small touches that provide an air of <b>authenticity.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater <b>authenticity</b> began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s {{provided}} {{a basis for}} staging the work in its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional clues to the original orchestration. These new finds {{became the basis for}} Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Academy Award-winning costume {{designer}} Sandy Powell {{heard about the}} script and contacted King, who in turn hired her. Powell was granted exclusive access to Victoria's wedding dress and coronation robes while researching. Based upon his work on The Lives of Others and his German nationality, Hagen Bogdanski {{was selected as the}} director of photography. Fellowes enlisted his friend Alastair Bruce's help with the coronation ceremony's historical <b>authenticity,</b> which led to Bruce's employment as the film's historical consultant, his first film credit.|$|E
5|$|After King Henry's {{death in}} 1135, Basset was not {{employed}} as a royal official, either as a justice or as a sheriff. He appears once as a witness to a charter of King Stephen's in 1136, but the <b>authenticity</b> of this document has been questioned. He had built a castle in Normandy at Montreuil-au-Houlme, but Basset did not have possession of it in 1136, when it was held against Stephen's opponents by William de Montpincon.|$|E
5|$|After signing to Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{recorded}} the album at The Record Plant in New York with producer Todd Rundgren, {{who was known}} for his sophisticated pop tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain later said Rundgren successfully captured how the band sounded live. Their music on the album incorporates carefree rock and roll, Brill Building pop influences, and campy sensibilities, while Johansen's colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explore themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and <b>authenticity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among {{those who}} {{defected}} to El Buen Pastor Church was Lino Figueroa, the pastor who had re-baptized González in 1938. González {{had a vision}} in July 1943 where the baptism by Figueroa was invalidated and {{he was ordered to}} re-baptize himself invoking Jesus' name. The whole congregation was re-baptized as well, as now Joaquín was the source of baptismal legitimacy and <b>authenticity.</b> With all those who had challenged him gone, Joaquín was able to consolidate leadership of the Church.|$|E
5|$|An {{impression}} of the Great Seal of a state (or its coat of arms) has long been required on official documents ranging from deeds to legislative acts. It was the emblem that certified the <b>authenticity</b> of a given document or that {{the authority of the}} state was invested in said document. Judicial decisions upheld the need for a valid seal and/or coat of arms on notarized documents.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier was {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} authors. Jean Price Mars's Ainsi parla l'oncle (So Spoke the Uncle) presents two arguments that Carpentier applied to his historical approach: firstly, {{from the perspective of a}} Haitian peasant, the Revolution did nothing more than replace leaders, since the exploitation continued; secondly, Price Mars assumes the <b>authenticity</b> of the belief in African gods, in contrast with a shallow Catholicism. William Seabrook's The Magic Island made connections between religion and history and was considered a beautiful book by Carpentier.|$|E
5|$|Collaborations was {{presented}} in an unusually lavish package, designed by Drew Lorimer and Olivia Harrison. Housed in a hinged box, the four discs sit on cardboard bases inside album covers measuring 8½ by 8½ inches, with the enlargement from CD and DVD dimensions allowing for a closer replication of the original LP jackets. A limited-edition release, each copy of the box set came with an individually numbered certificate of <b>authenticity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite Stroheim's {{reputation}} as a perfectionist, Greed contains anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Stroheim {{did his best to}} avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only those buildings that were from the era Greed was set in, and he kept motor vehicles out of sight while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for <b>authenticity,</b> Stroheim sometimes had walls knocked out of real locations to achieve a desired camera position.|$|E
5|$|During the Edo period Noh {{continued}} to be aristocratic art form supported by the shogun, the feudal lords (daimyōs), as well as wealthy and sophisticated commoners. While kabuki and joruri popular {{to the middle class}} focused on new and experimental entertainment, Noh strived to preserve its established high standards and historic <b>authenticity</b> and remained mostly unchanged throughout the era. To capture the essence of performances given by great masters, every detail in movements and positions was reproduced by others, generally resulting in an increasingly slow, ceremonial tempo over time.|$|E
