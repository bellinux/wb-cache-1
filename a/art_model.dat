25|$|In {{the postmodern}} era, the nude has {{returned}} to gain some acceptance in the art world, but not necessarily the <b>art</b> <b>model.</b> Figure drawing is offered in most art schools, but may not be required for a fine art degree. Peter Steinhart says that in trendy galleries, the nude has become passé, while according to Wendy Steiner {{there has been a}} revival in the importance of the figure as a source of beauty in contemporary art. Some established living artists work from models, but more work from photographs, or their imagination. Yet privately held open drawing sessions with a live model remain as popular as ever.|$|E
25|$|The Bombardier <b>ART</b> <b>model</b> has {{undergone}} several redesigns {{from the original}} UTDC ICTS model, and the Mark II design has been updated by Bombardier, with this newest offering being the Innovia Metro 300. Dimensions {{are similar to the}} Mark II, with capacity improvements offered over the outgoing model through redesigned car layout. TransLink ordered 28 Mark III cars, which began delivery in 2015, and went into service beginning in August 2016. The vehicles appear sleeker, with larger windows {{on the sides of the}} train, and redesigned windows and headlights on the ends of the cars. The interior is largely similar to the second generation of Mark II cars, with the some seats removed to better accommodate bicycles and strollers. TransLink has claimed that the interior of the Mark III offers better sound and heat insulation. TransLink ordered the cars for the Evergreen Extension in a 4-car articulated configuration, with two centre cars, to allow full length train movements by passengers. However, due to a shortage of trains, the Mark IIIs are being used on the Expo Line, while 2-car Innovia 200 (Mk2) serve the Millennium Line. On December 16, 2016, TransLink ordered 28 more Mark III cars, which will bring the total number of Mark III cars to 56 once they go into service in early 2019.|$|E

[...] She {{appeared}} {{in more than}} twenty paintings, including notable works such as Lise (1867) and In Summer (1868), {{and she was the}} model for almost all of Renoir's work featuring female figures at this time. Tréhot married Georges Brière de l'Isle in 1883 and raised four children to whom she bequeathed two of Renoir's paintings, Lise Sewing (1867–68) and Lise With a White Shawl (1872), both of which are currently held by the Dallas Museum of Art.|$|E

2500|$|An <b>art</b> <b>model</b> poses for any visual {{artist as}} part of the {{creative}} process, providing a visual reference for the human figure in a work of art. However, more than being simply the subject of art, models are often thought of as muses, a source of inspiration without whom the art would not exist. The most common types of art works that use models are figure drawing, figure painting, sculpture and photography, but almost any medium may be used. Art models are often paid professionals with skill and experience but are rarely employed full-time, and artists may also rely on friends and family to pose. Paid art models are usually anonymous and unacknowledged subjects of the work. Models are most frequently employed for art classes or by informal groups of artists that gather to share the expense of a model. Models are also employed privately by professional artists. [...] Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in illustration, its artwork commonly employs models. For example, Norman Rockwell used his friends and neighbors as models for both his commercial and fine art work. An individual who is having their own portrait painted or sculpted is usually called a [...] "sitter" [...] rather than a model, since they are paying to have the work done rather than being paid to pose.|$|E

40|$|Modeling of {{parasitic}} {{semiconductor device}} capacitances {{has always been}} a difficult task due to their nonlinearities. In this paper, we present a novel charge based model which provides simplification and ease of the modeling process. Further-more, convergence errors are reduced and the simulation speed is enhanced by up to a factor of two compared to state of the <b>art</b> <b>models.</b> This is especially important for novel SiC and GaN devices which allow for increased switching frequencies and thus a higher number of switching cycles per time period. Moreover, the presented modeling approach can easily be automated which is a significant advantage compared to state of the <b>art</b> <b>models</b> consisting of arbitrary mathematical equations...|$|R
