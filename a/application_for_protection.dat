50|$|The UPOV Convention also {{establishes}} a multilateral system of national treatment, under which citizens of any member state {{are treated as}} citizens of all member states {{for the purpose of}} obtaining plant breeders rights. It also sets up a multilateral priority filing system, under which an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>protection</b> filed in one member state {{establishes a}} filing date for applications filed in all other member states within one year of that original filing date. This allows a breeder to file in any one member country within the one-year period required to preserve the novelty of their variety, and the novelty of the variety will still be recognized when the filing is done in other member countries within one year of the original filing date. However, if the applicant does not wish to make use of priority filing, he or she has four years in which to apply in all other member states, excepting the USA, for all species except tree and vine species in which case he or she has six years to make application. More information can be obtained in Article 10 (1) (b) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2100/94 of 27 July 2004.

40|$|Recent {{years the}} {{numerical}} method of the simulation for the airbag deployment {{process has been}} improved with new material model and thermodynamic model, {{and has become a}} standard application of finite element codes. With such simulation tools, it is possible to attempt supporting the airbag module design and evaluating the injuries of dummy in airbag hazard area or out-of-position. Although the simulation model for the airbag’s deployment process is usually correlated with the static airbag deployments and reaction force results, up-to-date the numerical approach to represent the fluid flow within the airbag is both costly and time consuming. This paper will provide an overview of the correlation process for reducing the resource to be invested. The following two tests are conducted for acquiring the reference data. 1. Static deployment test for acquiring the airbag internal pressure during the deployment process and 2. Drop tower test for acquiring the fully deployed airbag’s reaction force. The drop tower test is simulated to determine the parameter related to the leakage of fabric and vent holes with the airbag model using the uniform pressure method offering the relatively short solving time. And then Static deployment test is simulated for determining the parameter related to the unfolding phase with the airbag model using the corpuscular (particle) method. These two simulations are compared to the test results and satisfactory correlation is found in both the cases. The drop tower simulation using the uniform pressure method leads to reduce the total correlation time and to easily extend the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>protection</b> of the driver occupant while in-position.

40|$|People {{living with}} HIV {{and without a}} {{residence}} permit {{have to deal with}} a serious chronic condition on one hand, and their lack of legal residence status on the other, including the ever-present risk of being deported to their country of origin. Objectives: The objectives of the study were to generate new insight into the daily lives of people living with HIV and without a residence permit, and to generate understanding of how they perceive, experience and relate to their HIV infection and conceive of health and a healthy life in the context of irregular exile in Norway. Methods: This study was carried out in the greater Oslo area in 2011 - 2012. Six persons who were living with HIV and without a residence permit participated in the study. They had backgrounds from different Sub-Saharan countries and had lived in Norway from 3 - 4 to 9 - 10 years. Data was produced through a combination of three qualitative research methods: dialogical interviews, participant observation and review of relevant documents and media reporting. Findings: A combination of several types of external power, constraints and control mechanisms was palpably present {{in the lives of the}} study participants. This web of power shaped their everyday lives to a considerable degree, and was also what the men and women in this study understood as most challenging to their own health. While they perceived of HIV as a significant life disruption, having had their <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>protection</b> rejected in Norway was portrayed as considerably more disruptive, and of greater significance for their own health. A double homelessness could be said to exist in the lives of the study participants: the sense of losing ground and grounding due to a serious illness, and the loss of home and a place in the world due to illegalised exile. Conclusion: For people living with HIV, health is considerably more than HIV and HIV treatment, and illegalised exile in Norway shapes the everyday lives of people living with HIV in ways that generate a range of negative predictors of health. How the consequences of this influence the overall health of individuals and the course of the HIV-infection, should be explored further...|$|E
40|$|U radu se analizira razvoj nacionalnih pravnih sredstava za zaštitu prava na suđenje u razumnom roku u Hrvatskoj. Pristupom Europskoj konvenciji za zaštitu ljudskih prava bila je preuzeta i obveza da se osiguraju djelotvorna sredstva unutar domaćeg pravnog poretka kojima bi se stranke mogle poslužiti u slučaju dugotrajnosti sudskih postupaka. Prikazuju se dvije faze razvoja tih pravnih sredstava. U prvoj (2000. – 2005.), u središtu je {{institut}} ustavne tužbe čije se pravno uređenje i primjena u praksi više puta mijenjala radi usklađivanja s praksom Suda u Strasbourgu. U drugom dijelu analizira se novo pravno sredstvo uvedeno 2005. – zahtjev za zaštitu prava na suđenje u razumnom roku. Zaključuje se da su sva analizirana sredstva nedostatna bez opsežnih strukturalnih reformi usmjerenih na otklanjanje uzroka problema dugotrajnosti postupaka. In up today’s {{case law}} of the European Court for Human Right, {{the largest number of}} judgments declaring violation of rights guaranteed by the European Convention for Protection of Human Rights, with regards to Croatia, was related to violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time and right to an efficient legal remedy. When considering the ladder, we should note that the most violations with regard to Art. 13 of the Convention also related to non-existence of efficient means for suppression of lengthy procedures. For that reason, this paper deals with European Court’s standpoint on efficiency of domestic means for the length of procedure as well as with development of those means. The means developed under the influence of Strasbourg court 2 ̆ 7 s case law, and partly for inner reasons. In the article, the development of the system of legal remedies for protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time is analysed – starting from the constitutional claim from Art. 59 para. 4 of the Constitutional Act on Constitutional Court of 1999, via new Art. 63 of the same Act of 2002 until the new Chapter III of Courts Act of 2005. Besides general questions and doubts regarding the relation of constitutional law protection system (constitutional claim) and the new legal remedy (<b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>protection</b> of right to a hearing within a reasonable time), a special attention is given to practical functioning and analyse of available statistics on use of new remedies. The new system of legal remedies for length of procedure is analysed {{from the perspective of the}} European court’s case law announcing, based on new judgments, a possible development in the future. The author warns us at the trend of expansive growth of the number of cases as well as the paid fees for the length of the court proceedings (the number of cases more than doubled yearly in the first three years). Based on these indications, a worst possible scenario of the future events is developed. It is shown that such a scenario, although not being completely feasible, is based on concrete data and indicators. Lastly, it is concluded that the system of legal remedies for protection of a right to a hearing within a reasonable time, although might be useful for solving isolated and individual cases, cannot be an adequate substitute for immense structural reforms...|$|E
40|$|LIKE most Western countries, Australia removes, or ‘deports’, {{asylum seekers}} whose {{applications}} for refugee protection are refused. This is the logical {{outcome of a}} fair and reliable refugee assessment system, an outcome that maintains the integrity and strength of refugee protection and limits potential abuse by non-refugees seeking residency. In Australia this outcome is prescribed {{as a process of}} law. But what happens to asylum seekers while the law runs its course? Outstripping its Western counterparts, Australia maintains a range of asylum policies which contribute to the deterioration of the physical and mental health of asylum seekers while their claims for protection are being processed. Such policies include the use of mandatory, indefinite detention (both on-shore and off-shore) and bridging visas with conditions which deny access to health care, permission to work or income support. The impact of these policies are compounded by the length of time asylum seekers live under these conditions in uncertainty and fear. The government has maintained and furthered these policies despite evidence of the significant damage which is inflicted on this vulnerable population. These policies result in an asylum seeker’s right to health being left unfulfilled for years at a time. Australia fails to fulfil this responsibility in multiple and varied ways: some asylum policies and practices cultivate ill health; some limit or prevent the treatment of ill health; and some fail to prevent ill health. This strong association between ill health and the asylum process in Australia has significant implications when considering the practical and moral dilemmas involved in removal. It also introduces greater levels of responsibility for the future health of asylum seekers in countries of return. For most asylum seekers, removal is a traumatic event leading to a difficult future in countries struggling to meet the basic needs of their populations. For removees who are seriously ill, removal can mark the “beginning of the end” as they anticipate the rapid deterioration of their health in places unable to provide adequate conditions of care. This is most likely when someone is removed to a country with limited basic resources, poor health care services or which {{is in the midst of}} an ongoing war or violent instability. These conditions are not generally considered adequate reasons to prevent removal, as the returned asylum seekers are returning to the unfortunate circumstances faced by all people in their country of origin. As Australia is unable to offer visas to all individuals living in such situations, it is argued we have no responsibility to offer relief to those seriously ill individuals facing removal. Such dispassionate logic has allowed Australia to pursue removal outcomes with a serious disregard for the health and wellbeing of removees. It has also neglected our responsibility towards those whose health has deteriorated as a result of Australia’s damaging policies. Our interviews highlighted the devastating consequences of these policies for individuals. One asylum seeker became destitute after living on a bridging visa with no work rights or income support. He took a job illegally in order to avoid starvation. As a result, he was taken into immigration detention for breaching his visa conditions. While in detention, he experienced stomach pains and was treated for ulcers. With the support of a charity, he was released from detention on another bridging visa. In the community, a doctor took pity on him and treated him as a patient for free. He was soon diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, not ulcers. The cancer progressed quickly, and as the man was ineligible for health care he struggled to obtain proper treatment. In the terminal stages of the illness, he was threatened with removal as his <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>protection</b> has been refused at all levels. Clearly unfit for travel, he lived out his remaining months in Australia living off the charity of others while his illness progressed without appropriate access to treatment or palliative care. Another man held in immigration detention for many years became severely depressed and suicidal. Such severe mental health issues have been linked to long term detention. His claims for refugee protection were finally refused at all levels. In the days before he was removed, he was held in an isolation room within the detention centre for observation as he was considered to be at a high risk of suicide. The bible was removed from the room in case he tore out the pages to choke himself to death. Two mental health professionals assessed him as being suicidal and, consequently, unfit for travel. Despite these concerns for his mental health, he was removed to a country with no arrangements for support or handover on arrival. These are two of the men who have lived out the drastic consequences of asylum policy. Recent changes within the Department of Immigration and Citizenship have made some major progress in the asylum and removal practices. However, the underlying policies remain unaltered. Changes must be made to ensure Australia’s policies are not detrimental to the health and wellbeing of asylum seekers. Plans to implement removal should be reconsidered for seriously ill individuals who have no prospect of ongoing care on return. There are gross inequalities throughout the world in terms of health care, wealth and security, and the removal of seriously ill asylum seekers from Australia brings to light these stark differences. The current system means this tragic reality is compounded by the actions of the Australian government. Removing asylum seekers from Australia is a painful consequence of government policy. Removing those whose illness has been cultivated, or even induced, by government policy is an abhorrent neglect of responsibility. • Robyn Sampson is a research officer at the Refugee Health Research Centre at La Trobe University and has recently published the report Removing Seriously Ill Asylum Seekers from Australia in conjunction with the Asylum Seeker Project at Hotham Mission.

Literature on immigration detention in Europe has also neglected the use of detention in border procedures.
