5|$|Stackpole {{returned}} to San Francisco in 1912 and married Adele Barnes, two months younger than he, an art student of Xavier Martinez {{and one of}} the first graduates of the California Academy of Arts and Crafts. Adele Stackpole was a perfectionist in many ways, including the precision of her bookplate engravings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> she placed on her relationships. On June 15, 1913, the Stackpoles' son Peter was born in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|The growing Polish-Soviet tension was {{beginning}} to strain Western-Soviet relations {{at a time when}} the Poles' importance to the Allies, significant in the first years of the war, {{was beginning}} to fade, due to the entry into the conflict of the military and industrial giants, the Soviet Union and the United States. In retrospective review of records, both British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt were increasingly torn between their commitments to their Polish ally <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> by Stalin and his diplomats.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of pycnofibers (<b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of flight) imply that pterosaurs were endothermic (warm-blooded). The absence of pycnofibers on pterosaur wings {{suggests that the}} coat {{did not have an}} aerodynamic function, lending support to the idea that pycnofibers evolved to aid pterosaur thermoregulation, as is common in warm-blooded animals, insulation being necessary to conserve the heat created by an endothermic metabolism.|$|E

5|$|Austrian {{troops were}} also promised, to be {{dispatched}} from the Austrian Army fighting the French in Northern Italy. These troops could only reach Toulon by sea, scheduled to embark {{from the city}} port of Genoa, capital of the Italian state of the Republic of Genoa, which {{at this stage of}} the war was officially neutral. Genoa was however, in common with other Northern Italian cities, in a state of political upheaval. The French Revolution had inspired similarly-minded revolutionaries in Italy to support Republican ideas, and there was a substantial Republican faction in the Genoese government which supported France's cause. Food supplies were regularly shipped from Genoa to the Republican armies in Southern France, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of Francis Drake, Ambassador to Genoa, that this trade cease went unheeded.|$|E
5|$|In September rumours {{were already}} {{circulating}} among the evacuees, and in Gibraltar, {{that the possibility}} of re-evacuating the Gibraltarians once more was being mooted, this time the destination being Jamaica, in the West Indies. After much contention, it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island, and 1,093 evacuees left for Jamaica direct, on 9 October, with more following later on. However petitions followed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> were met, partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping. The situation at the end of 1940, therefore, was that approximately 2,000 evacuees were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira, with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the London area.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} year than the female, {{at a time when there}} is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E

5|$|On 17 October 1942, Australian Prime Minister John Curtin cabled British Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{to request}} that the 9th Division be {{returned}} to Australia. In the cable Curtin stated that, owing to Australia's manpower shortage <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> {{of the war in}} the Pacific, it was no longer possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain the division in the Middle East. The British Government initially resisted this request {{on the grounds that the}} 9th Division was required for the upcoming offensive at El Alamein. On 29 October (six days into the battle) Curtin again cabled Churchill, stating that Australia needed the division in the Pacific and in a fit state to participate in offensive operations. On 1 November, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to Curtin proposing to send another US Army division to Australia if the Australian Government agreed to retain the 9th Division in the Middle East. Curtin, acting on the advice of MacArthur, responded to Roosevelt on 16 November rejecting this suggestion, and again requested that the 9th Division be returned.|$|E

25|$|Collective {{linguistic}} rights {{apply to}} states because they express themselves {{in one or}} more languages.

States are held in check by international conventions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of the citizens.

25|$|In 2009, the Pakistani {{government}} implemented an autonomy {{package for}} Gilgit-Baltistan, which entails rights {{similar to those}} of Pakistan’s other provinces. Gilgit-Baltistan thus gains province-like status without actually being conferred such status constitutionally. Direct rule by Islamabad has been replaced by an elected legislative assembly under a chief minister. The 2009 reform has not satisfied locals who demand citizenship rights and it has continued to leave Gilgit Baltistan's constitutional status within Pakistan undefined; although it has added to the self-identification of the territory. According to Antia Mato Bouzas, the PPP-led Pakistani government had attempted a compromise between its official position on Kashmir <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of a population where the majority may have pro-Pakistan sentiments.|$|E
