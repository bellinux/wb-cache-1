50|$|Recently, {{a project}} has been {{initiated}} which is called 'European Learning Network on Functional AgroBiodiversity', of which the secretariat is held by ECNC. The goal of this network is to exchange knowledge and experience between across country and language borders and between different actors {{within the field of}} Functional <b>AgroBiodiversity.</b> For more information on this project and functional <b>agrobiodiversity,</b> you can visit the network's websitehttp://www.eln-fab.eu/.|$|E

50|$|SAVE Foundation (Safeguard for Agricultural Varieties in Europe) {{was founded}} 1993 as a European NGO {{that acts as}} an {{umbrella}} organisation {{for the conservation of}} <b>agrobiodiversity</b> in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The website lists {{contacts}} {{of individual}} national organisations and connects different activities in Europe. National, regional and European networks that are listed are all committed {{for the conservation}} of <b>agrobiodiversity.</b>|$|E
50|$|Functional <b>AgroBiodiversity</b> {{provides}} regulating, provisioning {{and cultural}} ecosystem {{services that are}} essential for human well-being. Positive synergies often exist among regulating, provisioning and cultural services and with biodiversity conservation {{as can be seen}} from this conceptual diagram. The green area in the diagram highlights the core focus of the European Learning Network. The red area highlights positive spin-off of Functional <b>AgroBiodiversity</b> to the local (e.g. water quality, recreation) and global environment (e.g. climate change) and society as a whole. The graph is adapted from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). Supporting services are not included as they are not directly used by the people.|$|E
50|$|Category V {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{flexible}} classifications of protected areas. As a result, protected landscapes and seascapes may be able to accommodate contemporary developments, such as ecotourism, at the same time as maintaining the historical management practices that may procure the sustainability of <b>agrobiodiversity</b> and aquatic biodiversity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Agrobiodiversity,</b> {{which carries}} of {{advanced}} {{research in the}} fields of Genomics and Crop Science and Agriculture, Environment and Landscape. It has laboratories at Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche i.e. CNR and also collaborates with University of Pisa, Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa and is under patronage of the Rome-based international Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).|$|E
5000|$|However, {{agricultural}} biodiversity, {{sometimes called}} <b>Agrobiodiversity,</b> [...] "encompasses {{the variety and}} variability of animals, plants and micro-organisms which are necessary to sustain key functions of the agroecosystem, its structure and processes for, and in support of, food production and food security". It further [...] "comprises genetic, population, species, community, ecosystem, and landscape components and human interactions with all these." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Agrobiodiversity</b> {{is under}} threat due {{to use of}} high {{yielding}} varieties, destruction of natural habitat, overgrazing, land fragmentation, commercialisation of agriculture and the extension of modern highyielding varieties, indiscriminate use of pesticides, population growth and urbanisation, and changes in farmer’s priorities (MFSC, 2000).More factors for loss of biodiversity include landslide and soil erosion, pollution, fire, overgrazing, illegal trade, hunting and smuggling.|$|E
50|$|Awareness raising event {{about the}} {{importance}} of <b>agrobiodiversity.</b> There are various activities of the national organisations in the SAVE Network in their own countries. The aim of the event is to inform consumers about rare breeds and varieties in each country, raise public awareness on the need for conservation and launch positive messages to governments. The EAD is held always on Michaelmas, 29 September.|$|E
50|$|MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) has {{characterized}} this variety of rice {{in terms of}} descriptors developed by National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) and International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI). More than 40 descriptors {{have been used in}} this characterization. The Community <b>Agrobiodiversity</b> Center in Kalpetta, Wayanad, established by MSSRF has actively been involved in efforts to conserve these specialty varieties of rice since 1997.|$|E
50|$|Rare and {{endangered}} livestock breeds and old cultivated plants have largely disappeared from agricultural production units but {{they continue to}} live on numerous Ark-farms, livestock parks, variety gardens, open-air museums and other institutions. Arca-Net is unique collection of establishments conserving the traditional breeds of their region and makes these institutions known and initiates visits. Moreover, Arca-Net offers easily understandable background information and raises about the topic of <b>agrobiodiversity.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Bolivian {{concept of}} “food sovereignty” {{differs from that}} of “food {{security}}”. While food security places emphasis on the quantity of food production and increasing access to food, sovereignty is concerned with how, where, and by whom food is produced and how Bolivian communities are affected by an increasingly foreign-influenced market. The food sovereignty ideal has gained traction as a framework for conserving <b>agrobiodiversity,</b> as well as an increased global interest in sustainable and organic agriculture.|$|E
50|$|Food sovereignty, first {{coined by}} {{indigenous}} and peasant advocacy organization Vía Campesina, is the “right to produce, distribute, and consume nutritious, culturally appropriate {{food in a}} way that is ecologically sustainable” The goals of food sovereignty are to preserve <b>agrobiodiversity,</b> strengthen Bolivia’s internal markets, renew social value for local foods, and secure more power for indigenous and peasant groups in deciding what they eat and how it is produced. In Bolivia, food sovereignty is part of a larger post-neoliberal, decolonized agenda of the state. Pestalozzi notes traditional agricultural systems are quite fluid and incorporate modern agricultural strategies, and that the goals of food sovereignty should be to allowed indigenous groups and farmers to produce and consume food as they wish and in accordance with their values regarding nature.|$|E
50|$|The {{management}} of issues regarding {{animal genetic resources}} on the global level is addressed by the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA), which is a body of FAO. In May, 1997, The CGRFA established an Intergovernmental Technical Working Group on Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITWG-AnGR). The ITWG-AnGR's objectives are to review the situation and issues related to <b>agrobiodiversity</b> of animal genetic resources for food and agriculture and advise and make recommendations to the Commission on these matters, and consider progress resulting from proposed interventions. This group worked with many partners and countries to produce the First Report on the State of Animal Genetic Resources, which served {{as the basis for}} creating the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources (GPA). In 2007, the GPA was adopted by 109 countries as the first agreed international framework for the {{management of}} livestock biodiversity. The implementation of the GPA is overseen, monitored and evaluated by the CGRFA. The funding for this program arrives {{from a wide range of}} actors, under the guidelines of the Funding Strategy for the Implementation of the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources.|$|E
50|$|The {{push-pull}} technology involves use of behaviour-modifying stimuli {{to manipulate the}} distribution and abundance of stemborers and beneficial insects for management of stemborer pests. It is based on in-depth understanding of chemical ecology, <b>agrobiodiversity,</b> plant-plant and insect-plant interactions, and involves intercropping a cereal crop with a repellent intercrop such as Desmodium uncinatum (silverleaf) (push), with an attractive trap plant such as Napier grass (pull) planted as a border crop around this intercrop. Gravid stemborer females are repelled from the main crop and are simultaneously attracted to the trap crop. Napier grass produces {{significantly higher levels of}} attractive volatile compounds (green leaf volatiles), cues used by gravid stemborer females to locate host plants, than maize or sorghum. There is also an increase of approximately 100-fold in the total amounts of these compounds produced in the first hour of nightfall by Napier grass (scotophase), the period at which stemborer moths seek host plants for laying eggs, causing the differential oviposition preference. However, many of the stemborer larvae, about 80%, do not survive, as Napier grass tissues produce sticky sap in response to feeding by the larvae, which traps them, causing their mortality. Legumes in the Desmodium genus (silverleaf, D. uncinatum and greenleaf, D. intortum), on the other hand, produce repellent volatile chemicals that push away the stemborer moths. These include (E)-β-ocimene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, semiochemicals produced during damage to plants by herbivorous insects and are responsible for the repellence of Desmodium to stemborers.|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{and policy}} {{interest}} in the biological diversity of agriculture (<b>agrobiodiversity)</b> is expanding amid global socioeconomic and environmental changes and sustainability interests. The majority of global <b>agrobiodiversity</b> is produced in smallholder food-growing. We use meta-analyses in an integrated framework to examine the interactions of smallholder <b>agrobiodiversity</b> with: (1) livelihood processes, especially migration, including impacts on <b>agrobiodiversity</b> {{as well as the}} interconnected resource systems of soil, water, and uncultivated habitats; and (2) plant-soil ecological systems. We hypothesize these interactions depend on: (1) scope of livelihood diversification and type resource system; and (2) plant residues and above-/belowground component ecological specificity. Findings show: (1) livelihood diversification is linked to varied environmental factors that range from rampant degradation to enhancing sustainability; and (2) significant ecological coupling of aboveground and soil <b>agrobiodiversity</b> (AGSOBIO assemblages). The environmental impacts of livelihood interactions correspond to variation of diversification (migration, on-farm diversification) and resource system (i. e., <b>agrobiodiversity</b> per se, soil, water). Our findings also reveal mutually dependent interactions of aboveground and soil <b>agrobiodiversity.</b> Results identify livelihood diversification-induced reduction of environmental resource quality with lagged <b>agrobiodiversity</b> declines as a potentially major avenue of global change. Our contribution re-frames livelihood interactions to include both <b>agrobiodiversity</b> and ecological systems. We discuss this integrated social-environmental re-framing through the proposed spatial geographic schema of regional agri-food spaces with distinctive matrices of livelihood strategies and relations to biodiversity and resources. This re-framing can be used to integrate livelihood, <b>agrobiodiversity,</b> and ecological analysis and to guide policy and scientific approaches for sustainability in agriculture and food-growing...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a study to assess to what extent current ecolabels contain standards that stimulate conservation and sustainable use of on-farm biodiversity of agricultural landscapes (<b>agrobiodiversity).</b> First, we developed an <b>agrobiodiversity</b> management yardstick to assess and compare the labeling schemes of ecolabels for arable farming. Key characteristics of the yardstick are the five levels linking the abstract notion of <b>agrobiodiversity</b> management to concrete measures on a farm and its foundation upon expert judgment regarding the effect of farming practices on <b>agrobiodiversity.</b> Several environmental themes, among them <b>agrobiodiversity</b> management, are regulated through the standards of labeling schemes of ecolabels. With the aid of this yardstick, the labeling schemes were scrutinized and the number, average efficacy, and compulsory nature of relevant standards was determined for 10 categories of farm management. The results show that all examined ecolabels contain at least some standards that stimulate conservation and sustainable use of <b>agrobiodiversity,</b> but there are large differences between the labels. We consider {{the results of the}} five ecolabels to be insufficient to warrant their usefulness as a governance strategy that the Dutch government could refer to and depend on as part of a national <b>agrobiodiversity</b> policy to stimulate <b>agrobiodiversity.</b> © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2007...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the relationship between}} <b>agrobiodiversity</b> conservation and sustainable agricultural intensification. A stylised theoretical model is used to explore the conditions by which both <b>agrobiodiversity</b> and conventional input intensification may increase through optimal adjustments of input use in agrobiodiversity-poor agroecosystems. The model shows that this result can arise in quite general circumstances where there is (1) an agricultural production technology that allows {{a positive relationship between}} ecological integrity of a given agricultural area and agricultural productivity, and (2) decision maker preferences that recognise this positive relationship and generate resource allocation decisions that support it. While increase in <b>agrobiodiversity</b> conservation is a necessary condition for optimal resource adjustments, whether input use will increase or decrease along this optimal path depends on the buffering effect of <b>agrobiodiversity</b> on ecosystem damage and the relative societal welfare impacts of agricultural output (e. g., food and fibre) reductions and ecosystem damage. Thus we identify conditions that promote <b>agrobiodiversity</b> as a supporting service for the sustainable intensification of agricultural production. A provocative hypothesis derived from the model points at the possibility that ecosystem damage (<b>agrobiodiversity</b> loss) can optimally decline even when agriculture undergoes an intensification process. <b>Agrobiodiversity</b> Sustainable agricultural intensification Ecosystem services...|$|E

The 53 recommendations of the task group cover the whole data flow, from publishing to data use with a focus on <b>agrobiodiversity,</b> also considering the role of nodes in data mobilization and in promotion and training. Some key recommendations are to (i) promote GBIF to the <b>agrobiodiversity</b> community, (ii) integrate the terms from the long-standing Multi Crop Passport Data standard (MCPD) already used for several decades by agricultural gene banks into Darwin Core indexed attributes, (iii) by installing proper governance, the Darwin Core germplasm extension can be maintained as a stable international standard, (iv) develop <b>agrobiodiversity</b> user profiles on GBIF data portal to improve the user experience in accessing data of interest, (v) add infraspecific taxonomy levels to ensure adequate publication of <b>agrobiodiversity</b> data, by means of integrating into the GBIF taxonomic backbone the reference taxonomies used by the community with additional attributes related to the crop wild relative species, landraces and cultivars, (vi) publish existing digitized ABD data collections, such as the Bioversity Collecting Mission database 1 and the Crop Wild Relative Global Occurrence dataset 2, to support capacity building of <b>agrobiodiversity</b> data publishers, (vii) provide quality filtering of the data only using attributes of interest to the <b>agrobiodiversity</b> data users. Additionally, GBIF needs to provide tools and services to discover, mobilize, or link to additional specialized data sources commonly used by the <b>agrobiodiversity</b> community. Integrated access from GBIF to external sources of key <b>agrobiodiversity</b> data would be an added value for the community. (viii) Assign a level of confidence to individual data records, and (ix) channel feedback to data suppliers. The task group identified increasing the knowledge of the nodes about <b>agrobiodiversity</b> data through training as a key step to enable them to play a more prominent role in the mobilization of locally available information resources on ABD. A priority setting of these recommendations, with the feedback of the ABD community, the GBIF country parties and the expert knowledge of the GBIF secretariat and nodes, is needed.

40|$|<b>Agrobiodiversity</b> is {{a crucial}} {{environmental}} resource. Much of the <b>agrobiodiversity</b> remaining in situ today is found on the semi-subsistence farms of poorer countries and the small-scale farms or home gardens of more industrialised nations. The traditional farms of Hungary are an example. Labelled “home gardens” {{as a reflection of}} their institutional identity during the collectivisation period, they are micro-agroecosystems that provide important functions such as food security and diet quality. This paper applies the choice experiment method to estimate the private benefits farmers derive from four components of the <b>agrobiodiversity</b> found in Hungarian home gardens: richness of crop varieties and fruit trees; crop landraces; integrated crop and livestock production; and soil micro-organism diversity. The analysis is based on primary data collected in three environmentally sensitive areas where pilot agri-environmental programmes have been initiated as part of the Hungarian National Rural Development Plan. Findings demonstrate variation in the private values of home gardens and their attributes across households and regions, contributing to understanding the potential role of home gardens in these agri-environmental schemes.

40|$|Shifting {{cultivation}} is {{the most}} widespread agroforestry system in the tropics that may contribute to biodiversity conservation under certain conditions. Despite their common use, traditional biodiversity indexes prove ill-suited for assessing complex systems of this type. This study proposes a novel index, AGB, to assess <b>agrobiodiversity</b> in systems that mix species, varieties, lifeforms, and uses. The AGB index was tested using <b>agrobiodiversity</b> inventories in Vanuatu, where we compared <b>agrobiodiversity</b> levels and patterns of change {{over the course of}} a crop cycle between different field types. The 297 sampled fields contained a total of 127 species with an average of 10. 1 species and of 11. 6 varieties per field. During the cropping cycle, species and varietal richness diminish. The AGB index was compared with the Shannon and Pielou indexes and proved to be accurate for assessing and monitoring <b>agrobiodiversity</b> at the species and varietal levels. It may be a useful tool for <b>agrobiodiversity</b> monitoring in agricultural systems undergoing changes in practices and for achieving a better understanding of their biocultural resilience...|$|E
40|$|<b>Agrobiodiversity</b> plays {{a central}} role in the coping {{strategies}} of rural communities and indigenous peoples. It is an important part of the livelihood strategies of poor farmers, contributing not only to meeting food and shelter requirements, but also providing medicines and fuels, contributing to the provision of ecosystem support and regulating services and meeting cultural needs. Climate change is bringing new challenges to rural communities and indigenous communities who are have to adapt to changing production conditions and environments in addition to the problems they already face. The Platform for <b>Agrobiodiversity</b> Research (PAR), which aims to enhance the sustainable management and use of <b>agrobiodiversity</b> by improving knowledge of all its different aspects, has undertaken a survey aimed at identifying the extent to which farmers around the world are using <b>agrobiodiversity</b> to cope with climate change.
