5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the <b>approaching</b> cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the <b>approaching</b> cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the <b>approaching</b> cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E
5|$|An {{ideal is}} by {{definition}} unattainable in a given time and space. However, by persistently and dynamically <b>approaching</b> it, the process results in a sustainable system.|$|E
50|$|The Initial <b>Approach</b> Fix (IAF) is {{the point}} where the initial <b>approach</b> segment of an {{instrument}} <b>approach</b> begins. An instrument <b>approach</b> procedure may have more than one Initial <b>approach</b> fix and initial <b>approach</b> segment. The initial <b>approach</b> fix is usually a designated intersection, VOR, NDB, or DME fix. The initial <b>approach</b> fix may be collocated with the intermediate fix (IF) of the instrument <b>approach</b> and in such case they designate the beginning of the intermediate segment of the <b>approach.</b> When initial <b>approach</b> fix, and intermediate fix are combined there is no initial <b>approach</b> segment.|$|R

30|$|Two {{commonly}} used <b>approaches</b> in THA are the Moore <b>approach</b> (posterior <b>approach)</b> and the modified Hardinge <b>approach</b> (direct lateral <b>approach)</b> (Pellicci et al. 1998; Hardinge 1982; Finnish Arthroplasty society 2015; Madsen et al. 2004). Other possible <b>approaches</b> are the Smith-Petersen direct anterior <b>approach</b> and the Watson-Jones anterolateral <b>approach</b> (Smith-Petersen 1949; Watson-Jones 1934). Chechik et al. surveyed 292 orthopedic surgeons from 57 countries {{and found that}} the posterior <b>approach</b> was used by 45 % and the direct lateral <b>approach</b> by 42 %. The anterior <b>approach</b> was used by 10 % of the surgeons and other <b>approaches</b> by 3 % (Chechik et al. 2013).|$|R

30|$|For pushing recommendations, {{four types}} of <b>approach</b> are identified. They are preference-based <b>approach</b> [46], {{knowledge-based}} <b>approach</b> [4, 5], content-based <b>approach</b> [47] and hybrid <b>approach.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} <b>approaches</b> in {{educational}} research.

30|$|There {{are several}} <b>approaches</b> in {{classifying}} intended touches and unintended touches. Annett et al. [5] have researched such <b>approaches</b> {{and made a}} comparison. They categorized the various <b>approaches</b> in four types: user adaptions, firmware <b>approaches,</b> operating system <b>approaches</b> and application-specific <b>approaches.</b> Schwarz et al. [6] categorized existing <b>approaches</b> into hardware solution and software solution.|$|R

50|$|Planning {{theory is}} the body of {{scientific}} concepts, definitions, behavioral relationships, and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning. There are eight procedural theories of planning that remain the principal theories of planning procedure today: the rational-comprehensive <b>approach,</b> the incremental <b>approach,</b> the transactive <b>approach,</b> the communicative <b>approach,</b> the advocacy <b>approach,</b> the equity <b>approach,</b> the radical <b>approach,</b> and the humanist or phenomenological <b>approach.</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{be able to}} {{understand}} the value of integrating advanced technologies into existing technology education programmes, it is necessary to look at the features of various <b>approaches</b> that can be distinguished in various countries.

The integration of advanced technologies into these <b>approaches</b> can stimulate the enhancement of characteristics not present, or poorly represented, in the various <b>approaches...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{modified}} nonparametric Baumgartner–Weiß–Schindler test and investigate {{its use in}} testing for trends among K binomial populations. Exact conditional and unconditional <b>approaches</b> to p-value calculation are explored {{in conjunction with the}} statistic in addition to a similar test statistic proposed byNeuhäuser (2006), the unconditional <b>approaches</b> considered including the maximization <b>approach</b> (Basu, 1977), the confidence interval <b>approach</b> (Berger and Boos, 1994), and the E+M <b>approach</b> (Lloyd, 2008). The procedures are compared with regard to actual Type I error and power and examples are provided. The conditional <b>approach</b> and the E+M <b>approach</b> performed well, with the E+M <b>approach</b> having an actual level much closer to the nominal level. The E+M <b>approach</b> and the conditional <b>approach</b> are generally more powerful than the other p-value calculation <b>approaches</b> in the scenarios considered. The power difference between the conditional <b>approach</b> and the E+M <b>approach</b> is often small in the balance case.

40|$|Since {{the first}} report of {{endoscopic}} subtotal parathyroidectomy in 1996, a variety of endoscopic surgical <b>approaches</b> has been reported. These endoscopic <b>approaches</b> include the minimally-invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy (MIVAT), the endoscopic lateral <b>approach,</b> the lateral mini-incision <b>approach,</b> the anterior/chest (hybrid) <b>approach,</b> the transaxillary <b>approach,</b> the axillobreast <b>approach,</b> the post-auricular and axillary <b>approach,</b> and other novel experimental <b>approaches.</b> Some of these <b>approaches</b> could {{be done with the}} assistance of the da Vinci robot (i. e. robotic-assisted thyroidectomy). For simplification, these <b>approaches</b> could be categorized into the cervical/direct <b>approach</b> and the extra-cervical/indirect <b>approach.</b> Each technique or <b>approach</b> has its own benefits and weaknesses. Currently, there is no preferred <b>approach</b> in the literature and the choice seems to be determined by the surgeon’s own experience and the patient’s preference. In our experience, the transaxillary <b>approach</b> was a technically more challenging procedure and was associated with longer hospital stay, longer operating time, more immediate pain, and increased overall RLN injury and morbidity than MIVAT.
