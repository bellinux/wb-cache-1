50|$|An {{alternating}} Turing {{machine is}} a non-deterministic Turing machine whose states {{are divided into}} two sets: existential states and universal states. An existential state is <b>accepting</b> if some transition leads to an <b>accepting</b> state; a universal state is <b>accepting</b> if every transition leads to an <b>accepting</b> state. (Thus a universal state with no transitions <b>accepts</b> unconditionally; an existential state with no transitions rejects unconditionally). The machine as a whole <b>accepts</b> if the initial state is <b>accepting.</b>|$|R

5|$|Most records {{received}} by the committee are processed within a year and published in its annual report in British Birds.
