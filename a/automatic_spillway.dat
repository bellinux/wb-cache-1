40|$|Northern States Power Company (NSP) is {{examining}} various alternatives {{to modify the}} <b>automatic</b> <b>spillway</b> gates at the Wissota Hydro Plant on the Chippewa River at Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. The gates are called "stauwerke" gates. The main {{purpose of the study}} is to assure that the <b>automatic</b> <b>spillway</b> gates operate properly during a probable-maximum-flood (PMF) as required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The position of the gates must be controllable {{so that they can be}} fully lowered or raised with Lake Wissota at its normal elevation of 898. 0 ft. The gates must go down for the design flood which currently is the PMF. The spillway has 13 automatic gates, each 64 feet, wide in the configuration shown in Fig. 1. NSP conducted field tests on Gate 1 at the south end of the spillway on April 15, 1988, in which the gate was pulled down to 7. 2 ft. It was not possible to test the prototype gates from 7. 2 ft down to the fully lowered position of 10. 8 ft. During the tests, pulldown forces, piezometric pressures, and water surface profiles were measured. The results of the field tests down to 7. 2 ft were correlated with a physical hydraulic model at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. These studies are summarized in a previous project report* by the Laboratory. As reported in these studies, good correlation was observed between the field tests and the model tests. The model studies were expanded to include gate positions down to 10. 8 ft (the full-down position of the gate), and the results were extrapolated to the prototype. It was concluded from the calculated gate hinge moments that the gates would probably not remain in the full-down position at the higher discharges without additional force being applied.

The gates are called "stauwerke" gates. The main {{purpose of the study}} is to assure that the <b>automatic</b> <b>spillway</b> gates operate properly during a probable-maximum-flood (PMF) as required by the Federal Energy Re&ulatory Commission (FERC) and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The position of the gates must be controllable {{so that they can be}} fully lowered or raised with Lake Wissota at its normal elevation of 898. 0 ft. The gates must also be fully open during a PMF. The spillway has 13 automatic gates each 64 feet wide in the configuration shown in Fig. 1. Figure 2 shows a photo of the prototype spillway with gate 1 starting at the south abutment on the right. Each gate is connected to a 144. 5 ton counterweight through linkages and arms as shown in Fig. 3. Records of openings and closings from 1982 to 1985 show that the gates have operated automatically. Gates 2 through 13 open when the lake elevation is about 0. 6 ft above the normal elevation of 898 ft and close when the elevation drops about 0. 5 ft below normal. Gate 1 is controlled by a chain hoist and can be pulled down to about 6 ft and used to somewhat control the lake elevation. When the gates open automatically, they open a distance of 3. 1 to 3. 6 feet. The maximum opening of the gates was 6 feet in the 1941 flood. The 13 gates were expected to be capable of passing 263, 000 cfs. With the PMF of 363, 000 cfs, other means have to be provided to pass the extra 100, 000 cfs. Therefore, the questions are whether or not the gates will operate properly, and if the anticipated flow can be passed. Presently, in the fully lowered position the gates will be 10 feet below pool El. 898 ft. By removing curbs around the gate arm openings, the gates would be horizontal and thus down 10. 83 feet. It is not possible to test the prototype gates in the fully lowered position. Therefore, NSP proposed to run field tests on Gate 1 of the Wissota Dam spillway, correlate the results with a physical hydraulic model at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory, and expand the model studies to test conditions not possible in the prototype.
