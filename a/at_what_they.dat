5|$|The Dutch {{public was}} furious <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{believed}} a hostile German act, which caused German diplomats to spread rumors of an impending British {{invasion of the}} Netherlands to divert the unwanted attention.|$|E
5|$|According to the Pakistani foreign ministry, the {{operation}} was conducted entirely by the U.S. forces. Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) {{officials said they were}} present <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> called a joint operation; President Asif Ali Zardari flatly denied this. Pakistan's foreign secretary Salman Bashir later confirmed that Pakistani military had scrambled F-16s after they became aware of the attack but that they reached the compound after American helicopters had left.|$|E
5|$|Around 02:45, several British destroyers {{mounted a}} torpedo {{attack against the}} rear half of the German line. Markgraf {{initially}} held her fire as {{the identities of the}} destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> thought was a submarine.|$|E

5|$|Visual effects {{producer}} James Tichenor {{claimed that}} visual effects work better when not highlighted, {{and that a}} major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. Replicator models were used to give the actors an idea <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were looking and to match their eyelines. One model was mounted on a plexiglass rod and shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic Replicator hologram. The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good looks. The reflections of the green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship ("green spill", usually an undesired side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen.|$|E
5|$|Kulesza {{left his}} job soon afterwards; {{according}} to Majchrzak, he resigned in protest at the players' punishments, which he thought were too harsh. Officials at Widzew Łódź accused the PZPN of bias, saying the association had not supervised the players properly and should shoulder {{some of the}} blame. Directors at Widzew and ŁKS Łódź briefly considered resigning their PZPN memberships and organising their own league championship, but did not. The national team players' council, at that time comprising Marek Dziuba, Paweł Janas and Wojciech Rudy, wrote an open letter expressing surprise <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> saw as excessive sanctions against Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk. They admitted the goalkeeper's conduct had been far from exemplary, but contended that the incident was only minor, and had been exacerbated by disproportionately prominent and negative press coverage.|$|E
5|$|The crisis {{escalated}} into {{violence in}} late April. On 24 April, the petitioners {{and some of}} their supporters held a four-day demonstration outside the Government Palace in Dili calling for the establishment of an independent commission to address their grievances. Violence broke out on 28 April when some of the petitioners and gangs of youths who had joined the protest attacked the Government Palace. The PNTL failed to contain the protest and the Palace was badly damaged. After violence spread to other areas of Dili, Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri requested that the F-FDTL help restore order. Troops with no experience in crowd control were deployed to Dili on 29 April and three deaths resulted. On 3 May Major Alfredo Reinado, the commander of the F-FDTL's military police unit, and most of his soldiers including Lt Gastão Salsinha abandoned their posts in protest <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> saw as the army's deliberate shooting of civilians.|$|E

5|$|While Rowley and Hamelin had sparred in the Indian Ocean, Corbet {{had made}} the lengthy journey back to Britain. During his time in command of Nereide, Corbet had already {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} strict disciplinarian, regularly beating his men for the slightest infractions, {{to the extent that he}} had provoked a brief mutiny on Nereide in 1808. His reputation spread before him, and when he switched commands with Captain Richard Raggett of HMS Africaine, he was met with a storm of protest from Africaines crew. Although none of the men aboard Africaine had served with Corbet before, his preference for brutal punishment was well known in the Navy and the crew sent a letter to the Admiralty insisting that they would not serve under him. Concerned <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> considered to be mutiny, the Admiralty sent three popular officers to Africaine with the message that if the protest was quietly dropped there would be no courts-martial for mutiny but if not, the entire crew would be liable to attack. To emphasise the threat, the frigate HMS Menelaus was brought alongside with her gunports open and her cannon ready to fire. Chastened, the crew of Africaine allowed Corbet aboard and the frigate sailed for the Indian Ocean a few days later, carrying instructions for the authorities at Madras to prepare an expeditionary force to invade Isle de France.|$|E

They refilled the pit, kept the skulls briefly, and reburied them with icons and prayers.|$|E
25|$|These demonstrations, and the {{concessions}} from city leaders {{to the majority}} of demonstrators' demands, were met with fierce resistance in Birmingham. In the weeks following the September 4 integration of public schools, three further bombs had been detonated in Birmingham.

The new, often large, agricultural operations produced grain for export, which quickly became highly profitable. The two opposing sides were firmly committed to their own interests.|$|E
25|$|As events unfolded, some police {{officers}} were still deployed making a cordon three-quarters {{of the way down}} the pitch to prevent Liverpool supporters reaching the opposing supporters. Without public address announcements to explain the situation, many Nottingham Forest fans on the other end were chanting for their team and whistled their anger <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> saw as a pitch invasion, incensing some of the Liverpool supporters. Some fans tried to break through the cordon simply to ferry injured fans to waiting ambulances on the Nottingham Forest end but were forcibly turned back.|$|E

About 400 Chongroyn supporters scuffled with police after they gathered in protest <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> called an act of political suppression and racial discrimination.|$|E

After {{joining forces}} with fellow musician, Norah Chambers, a {{graduate}} of the Royal Academy of Music in London, the pair formed a camp choir. Dryburgh wrote down pages of music from memory, from baroque to contemporary, for the Vocal Orchestra to perform, as well as pieces of her own light classical compositions. The music was arranged in four parts, which were hummed by the women to give the effect of an orchestra, and included pieces by Handel, Chopin, Brahms and Beethoven. Even the Japanese soldiers were said to be amazed <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> heard, inviting themselves to the concerts. The Captives' Hymn was one of the pieces written by Dryburgh, and was sung each Sunday during church services.|$|E
25|$|In early 1994 Kelvin MacKenzie, {{former editor}} of The Sun newspaper, was {{appointed}} managing director of BSkyB, Sky News's parent company at the time.

The most ferocious battle occurred when Mackenzie wanted Sky News to run an interview with Lady Bienvenida Buck. Frykberg refused to air the interview and resigned shortly afterwards. The interview was broadcast on Sky One. MacKenzie announced his resignation in August 1994, but not before Sky News had transmitted live pictures of the freeway chase of OJ Simpson white Bronco on 17 June 1994 bringing US helicopter journalism to the UK.|$|E
