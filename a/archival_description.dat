In the United States, ISAD(G) is implemented through Describing Archives: A Content Standard, popularly known as [...] "DACS".

50|$|Several {{standards}} govern <b>archival</b> <b>description,</b> {{some national}} and some international. ISAD(G), the General International Standard <b>Archival</b> <b>Description,</b> defines {{the elements that}} {{should be included in}} a finding aid. Other content standards also pertain. In the United States, proper names may be checked against the Library of Congress Name Authority Files and subject headings are drawn from the LCSH. Genre terms are often taken from the Art & Architecture Thesaurus. Many finding aids are encoded (marked up) in XML; in such cases, the Encoded <b>Archival</b> <b>Description</b> (EAD) standard can be used. In addition, repositories may follow local practices designed to make finding aids serve their particular mission.|$|E

Brocade supports EAD and EAC formats for exchange of ISAD records and ISAAR authorities.

In this context, the International Council of Archives has developed a conceptual model for the description called Records in context. This model unifies the ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF), ISDF, and ISDIAH standards and establishes the entities, properties, and relationships of the <b>archival</b> <b>descriptions.</b> The model facilitates decentralized semantic interoperability and enables the development of an OWL ontology for the representation and publication of archival datasets using semantic web technologies. Records in context places archival resources within the dynamics of direct Web publishing and offers a great opportunity to adopt new approaches in the search, access, and use of archival information...|$|R

50|$|A {{fundamental}} characteristic of archives {{is that they}} have to keep the context in which their records have been created and the network of relationships between them in order to preserve their informative content and provide understandable and useful information over time. The {{fundamental characteristic}} of archives resides in their hierarchical organization expressing the context by means of the archival bond.Archival descriptions are the fundamental means to describe, understand, retrieve and access archival material. At the digital level, archival descriptions are usually encoded by means of the Encoded <b>Archival</b> <b>Description</b> XML format. The EAD is a standardized electronic representation of <b>archival</b> <b>description</b> which makes it possible to provide union access to detailed archival descriptions and resources in repositories distributed throughout the world.|$|E
40|$|Digital environments {{aimed at}} {{offering}} services on historical archives should put together domain standards with typical features of digital libraries. The current tendency is often to adopt two separated methodological approaches: standards-compliant <b>archival</b> <b>descriptions</b> (multi-level, multiple-relations based, providing access just by provenance expressed by original titles, material-centric, careless of the interoperability with general search engines), or digital technologies (horizontal, providing access by subject, {{sensitive to the}} “aboutness”, user-centric, focused on item-level descriptions based on Dublin Core-like models). Some issues are coming {{more and more to}} surface: how could a web archival environment face users expectations and what content (and how) may be offered to cultural aggregators? How can move archives on line from the plain delivery of cultural information to the facilitation of a cultural experience? This paper examines most of those issues, the necessary difference between input and output to ensure high quality contents, the upside-down changing role of the professional mediation, the peculiarities of web displays for <b>archival</b> <b>descriptions.</b> Moreover, studies of end-users are crucial to guarantee the profitable investment, although the first purpose of the investment should be end-users’ satisfaction. The authors look into those topics by reviewing the international state of the art, and in light of their coordination of a huge user study project as well. It was launched in order to test the prototype of Una Città per gli Archivi, a portal disseminating the results of a several-year project of preservation and valorization of documentary funds of the city of Bologna (Italy).
