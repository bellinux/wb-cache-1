5|$|The lepton epoch was {{the period}} in the {{evolution}} of the early Universe in which the leptons dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created. Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of the Universe was then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon epoch.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is rare}} on Earth, helium is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} element in the known Universe (after hydrogen), constituting 23% of its baryonic mass. The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton-proton chain reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation {{is known as the}} cosmic microwave background radiation. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when {{the universe}} was only 10–17 million years old.|$|E

5|$|Detailed {{observations}} of the morphology and distribution of galaxies and quasars are {{in agreement with the}} current state of the Big Bang theory.

5|$|In 2011, astronomers {{found what}} {{they believe to be}} {{pristine}} clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang, during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Quantico {{continues}} to be popular in Australia, Canada, France and India. The premiere episode had 2.6 million viewers in Canada, the largest audience for a new television series that year. It was the most-watched episode, behind The Big Bang Theory (which had 2.8 million). Averaging 2.17 million viewers, Quantico was Canada's most-watched drama series, most-watched new series and second-most-watched series (<b>after</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Bang Theory) in 2015. It was the most-watched drama series of 2015 in Australia and the second-most-watched series overall (<b>after</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Bang Theory). In France, the series premiered to 4.9 million viewers (a 21-percent audience share) and averaged 3.1 million viewers during its first season. According to a Business Insider report (with 2.1million views per month), Quantico was the 12th-most-popular TV show of 2016 based on ratings, peer-to-peer sharing, social-media chatter and viewer demand.|$|E

5|$|The quark–gluon plasma {{would be}} {{characterized}} by a great {{increase in the number}} of heavier quark pairs in relation to the number of up and down quark pairs. It is believed that in the period prior to 10−6 seconds <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang (the quark epoch), the universe was filled with quark–gluon plasma, as the temperature was too high for hadrons to be stable.|$|E
5|$|From {{approximately}} 10−6 seconds <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang, {{during a}} period {{is known as the}} hadron epoch, the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the Universe was dominated by hadrons. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in thermal equilibrium. However, as the temperature of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle annihilation reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the Universe was about one second old.|$|E

5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in the early universe, making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E

The following night on ECW on Sci Fi, Van Dam lost the ECW title to The Big Show, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Show received assistance from Paul Heyman, who declined to make the three-count for Van Dam, but instead gave the pinfall to the Big Show.

5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} {{as they were}} in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E
