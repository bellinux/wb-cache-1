5|$|At Fort Donelson, Tennessee, Buckner {{had become}} the first Confederate general of the war to {{surrender}} an army; <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans,</b> he became the last. The surrender became official when Smith endorsed it on June 2, (Only Brigadier General Stand Watie held out longer; he surrendered the last Confederate land forces on June 23, 1865).|$|E
5|$|After being towed to Mound City {{for more}} {{permanent}} repairs, Osage {{was transferred to}} the West Gulf Blockading Squadron on 1 February 1865 for the attack on Mobile, Alabama. She participated in the Battle of Spanish Fort, defending Mobile from the east, but struck a mine in a previously swept channel and sank rapidly on 29 March. Two crewmen were killed and some others wounded. The ship was later refloated and sold at auction <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> 22 November 1867, along with three ex-Confederate ships, for $20,467.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Texas, {{ticket sales}} {{likewise}} were rapid. On {{the first day}} of sales, Texas' ticket office received 10,500 orders. The demand was so great that some students camped overnight in front of the ticket office to ensure they would receive a ticket. Despite that initial surge in orders, as late as December 27, four days before the game, tickets were still readily available. In terms of chartered flights and the number of fans spending money <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> businesses, Texas also trailed Virginia Tech.|$|E
50|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Brass was {{a hockey}} {{team in the}} ECHL from 1997 to 2002. The team was at one time {{affiliated}} with the San Jose Sharks.

5|$|Milwaukee was {{initially}} {{assigned to the}} Mississippi Squadron upon commissioning, but saw no action before she was ordered south to join West Gulf Blockading Squadron. The ship departed Mound City, Illinois on 15 October and arrived <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans,</b> Louisiana 12 days later. Lieutenant Commander James H. Gillis relieved Magune on 22 November. She was still under repair there on 27 November, although Milwaukee reached Mobile Bay by 1 January 1865.|$|E
5|$|USS Concord (PG-3) was {{commissioned}} on 14 February 1891 {{under the command}} of Commander O.A. Batcheller. Concord operated on the coast of New England, and sailed from New York City on 17 November 1891 on a cruise to the West Indies and South America with her squadron, then arrived <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans,</b> Louisiana, on 27 April 1892 and cruised up the Mississippi River as far as Cairo, Illinois, visiting various ports en route.|$|E
5|$|After {{a stop at}} Pearl Harbor for boiler {{repairs and}} to offload her Army passengers, Yancey sailed for Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, {{reaching}} there {{on the last day}} of the year; she was the last ship to transit the Panama Canal in 1945. On 6 January 1946, Yancey cleared Cristobal, Canal Zone, bound for Louisiana. After a brief stop <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans,</b> the attack cargo ship proceeded on, via Jacksonville, Florida, to Norfolk, where she arrived on 29 January. Less than a month later, on 27 February, Yancey sailed farther north and reached the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard the following day.|$|E

5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse was {{diagnosed}} with lung cancer in 1992. After a successful operation to remove a tumor and part of his lung, he began chemotherapy a few months later, when a routine exam revealed a recurrence of the cancer. Despite his health problems, he remained a hard worker until the end, and even went hunting in Tanzania only four days after having part of his lung removed. An experimental procedure failed to stop the cancer, and he died on August 25, 1994, at the Medical Center of Louisiana <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans.</b> He was survived by wife Joy, daughter Gay, and son Hugh, Jr.|$|E
5|$|He {{was more}} {{directly}} involved in the activities of the commissioned raiders, ships of the Confederate States Navy that were sent out to destroy rather than capture enemy commerce. He first proposed their use as early as April 18, 1861. The first raider, , avoided the Union blockade <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> on June 30, 1861. From then until after the war was over, the small group of raiders plundered Union shipping, inflicting damage on the American Merchant Marine that persists to the present day. They failed of their primary purpose, however, because Welles maintained the Union blockade, and international trade continued as before, carried in ships flying foreign flags.|$|E

5|$|In 1789 Marshall {{was elected}} again to a {{convention}} to consider separation from Virginia. After Kentucky's separation from Virginia in 1792, {{he was elected}} to represent Woodford County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. The most notable piece of legislation he authored was an act that simplified the classification and taxation of land. He was reelected to his position in 1794. He opposed allocating men or supplies for George Rogers Clark's proposed attack upon the Spanish <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans.</b> The attack was promoted by Edmond-Charles GenÃªt, and Marshall accused sitting governor Isaac Shelby of complicity in the matter.|$|E
5|$|In December 1862, Nathaniel P. Banks {{replaced}} Butler {{in command}} <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans.</b> Banks, a Massachusetts Republican with prohibitionist sympathies, had known Dow before the war, but he initially displeased Dow {{by refusing to}} repeal Butler's order against confiscation of rebel property. He did, however, allow Dow to return to New Orleans {{to take part in}} the planned spring offensive. As the Union armies looked to complete their control over the Mississippi River, only Vicksburg, Mississippi and Port Hudson, Louisiana held out against federal control. Major General Ulysses S. Grant moved on Vicksburg from the north while Banks advanced to Port Hudson from the south. By May 21, the town was surrounded.|$|E
5|$|Interned <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans,</b> Louisiana at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Breslau was seized in 1917 by the United States after her entry into the war and commissioned into the Navy as USS Bridgeport. Originally slated to be a repair ship, she was reclassified as a destroyer tender the following year. Bridgeport completed several transatlantic convoy crossings before she was stationed at Brest, France, where she remained in a support role {{after the end of}} World War I. After returning to the United States in November 1919, she spent the next five years along the East Coast and in the Caribbean tending destroyers and conducting training missions. She was decommissioned in November 1924 and placed in reserve at the Boston Navy Yard.|$|E

5|$|Most {{newspaper}} mentions of West Corum do {{not report}} {{what sorts of}} cargo she carried, but a January 1922 Associated Press story in The Christian Science Monitor reveals her cargo for one voyage from Argentina. In what the news item said was the first full load of cargo leaving Buenos Aires in nearly a year, West Corum carried 107,000 animal hides, estimated to be enough for 1,000,000 pairs of shoes, along with consignments of wool and linseed. The ship continued calling at Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, Argentina, as late as 1927, but by 1939, West Corum had been laid up in a reserve fleet <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> on 6 July, Chickasaw was decommissioned. She {{temporarily}} bore the name Samson between 15 June and 10 August 1869 before resuming her original name. She was sold on 12 September 1874 to the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company who modified the ship into a coal barge {{with the name}} of Samson. The railroad converted the ship into a train ferry in 1880 and changed her to side-wheel propulsion under the name Gouldsboro. She was sold in the 1940s to the New Orleans Coal & Bisso Towboat Co. and converted into a work barge. It sank off the Greenville Bend of the Mississippi River in New Orleans sometime during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|All {{repair work}} on the New Orleans Arena was {{finished}} by March 2006, and a new scoreboard and video displays were added during the process. In June 2006, Shinn stated he {{was pleased with the}} ongoing recovery process in New Orleans and again reaffirmed his desire to permanently return for the 2007â08 season. However, the Hornets also announced that they {{were in the process of}} negotiating with Oklahoma City to play the 2007â08 season at the Ford Center as a contingency plan. The Hornets opened the 200607 season <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> with a win over the Boston Celtics. They improved their final record from the previous season by one game, and again finished tenth in the Western Conference, three games out of the playoffs. Their attendance declined slightly compared to the previous season, and they finished 15th overall in attendance.|$|E

5|$|Drawn by the city's prosperous economy, the Blackburns {{relocated}} to Natchez, Mississippi, in 1847. Luke Blackburn quickly became {{an active member}} of the community, helping found a temperance society, joining a militia group, and becoming the administrator of a local hospital. He became a close associate of Jefferson Davis and William Johnson. In 1848, Blackburn served as the city's health officer and implemented the first successful quarantine against a yellow fever outbreak in the Mississippi River valley. Using his own personal funds, he established a hospital for boatmen who navigated the Mississippi River. He also successfully lobbied the Congress to establish a hospital in Natchez; upon its completion in 1852, he was appointed surgeon there. In 1854, he implemented another successful quarantine against yellow fever. The Mississippi Legislature commissioned Blackburn to lobby the Louisiana State Legislature to establish a quarantine <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> to protect cities along the Mississippi River; Louisiana authorized him to organize such a system.|$|E
5|$|Mickal was {{the first}} player from LSU to ever be drafted into the NFL, {{selected}} in the sixth round of the 1936 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. However, he did not play in the NFL. He instead chose to complete his medical degree at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine, where he graduated from in 1940. He served as a major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War II. After the war, he worked in obstetrics and gynecology <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Charity Hospital from 1946 to 1949, shortly after which he was hired to the LSU medical faculty. In 1959, he became the head professor of the LSU Medical School, a position he served in {{until his retirement in}} 1980. He was {{a founding member of the}} Society of Gynecologic Oncology and the Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, and served as president of the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons from 1981 to 1982. From 1985 until his death in 2001 he was vice president for medical affairs at Kenner Regional Medical Center.|$|E
5|$|Munnerlyn started 14 {{games at}} right cornerback for the Panthers {{in his third}} season with the team and responded with a then career-high 58 tackles {{to go along with}} two sacks, one quarterback pressure, one forced fumble, one fumble {{recovery}} and seven passes defensed. He also accounted for six special teams tackles. In Week 5 <b>at</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Saints on October 9, he registered his first career sack, dropping quarterback Drew Brees for a six-yard loss on a blitz. In a Week 8 game against the Minnesota Vikings, he got his second sack of the season when he tackled Christian Ponder for a one-yard loss after he scrambled to the right to escape from pressure. Later in the game, he also stripped and recovered a fumble by Vikings wide receiver Percy Harvin a yard shy of the endzone. In Week 15, he suffered a strained left hamstring at Houston and was therefore placed on injured reserve on December 23.|$|E
