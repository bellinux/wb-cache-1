2500|$|Kelo was {{the first}} major eminent domain case heard at the Supreme Court since 1984. [...] In that time, states and {{municipalities}} had slowly extended their use of eminent domain, frequently to include economic development purposes. [...] In the Kelo case, Connecticut had a statute allowing eminent domain for “economic development” {{even in the absence of}} blight. There was also an <b>additional</b> <b>twist</b> in that the development corporation was ostensibly a private entity; thus the plaintiffs argued that it was not constitutional for the government to take private property from one individual or corporation and give it to another, if the government was simply doing so because the repossession would put the property to a use that would generate higher tax revenue.|$|E
6000|$|Then the old gentleman spun himself {{round with}} {{velocity}} {{in the opposite}} direction, continued to spin until his long cloak was all wound neatly about him, clapped his cap on his head, very much on one side (for it could not stand upright without going through the ceiling), gave an <b>additional</b> <b>twist</b> to his corkscrew mustaches, and replied with perfect coolness: [...] "Gentlemen, I wish you a very good morning.

60|$|The precipitating {{manner in}} which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby of London, had not been {{unattended}} with some small violence to his own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an <b>additional</b> <b>twist</b> and wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.|$|E

60|$|He {{had thought}} at first {{that they were all}} of common stature and costume, with the evident {{exception}} of the hairy Gogol. But as he looked at the others, he began to see in each of them exactly what he had seen in the man by the river, a demoniac detail somewhere. That lop-sided laugh, which would suddenly disfigure the fine face of his original guide, was typical of all these types. Each man had something about him, perceived perhaps at the tenth or twentieth glance, which was not normal, and which seemed hardly human. The only metaphor he could think of was this, that they all looked as men of fashion and presence would look, with the <b>additional</b> <b>twist</b> given in a false and curved mirror.|$|E

50|$|The High Altar in {{the central}} nave is formed from the {{sarcophagus}} of the Archbishop Pietro Capuano (died 1214). Above the altar is a painting by Andrea dell'Asta of The Martyrdom of St. Andrew. The boxed ceiling dates to 1702 and its artwork includes the Flagellation, the Crucifixion of the Apostle, and the Dell'Asta's 1710 Miracle of the Manna. The triumphal arch is held up by two Egyptian granite columns. There are two <b>additional</b> <b>twisted</b> columns and two pulpits {{that were part of}} the 12th century ambo.

50|$|While rope may be {{made from}} three or more strands, modern braided rope {{consists}} of a braided (tubular) jacket over strands of fiber (these may also be braided). Some forms of braided rope with untwisted cores have a particular advantage; they do not impart an <b>additional</b> <b>twisting</b> force when they are stressed. The lack of added twisting forces is an advantage when a load is freely suspended, as when a rope is used for rappelling or to suspend an arborist. Other specialized cores reduce the shock from arresting a fall when used {{as a part of}} a personal or group safety system.|$|R
