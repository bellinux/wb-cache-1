These secretions block the exocrine movement of the digestive enzymes into the duodenum and result in irreversible damage to the pancreas, often with painful inflammation (pancreatitis). The pancreatic ducts <b>are</b> <b>totally</b> plugged in more advanced cases, usually seen in older children or adolescents. This causes atrophy of the exocrine glands and progressive fibrosis.|$|E

The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} role of {{an internal}} drainage board is to manage the water level within its district. The majority of lowland rivers and watercourses have been heavily modified by man or <b>are</b> <b>totally</b> artificial channels. All are engineered structures designed and constructed for the primary function of conveying surplus run-off to their outfall efficiently and safely, managing water levels to sustain a multitude of land functions. As with any engineered structure it must be maintained in order to function at or near its design capacity. Annual or bi-annual vegetation clearance and periodic de-silting (dredging) of these rivers and watercourses is therefore {{an essential component of}} the whole life cycle of these watercourses.|$|E

One of the deepest-living family is the Pourtalesiidae, strange bottle-shaped irregular sea urchins that live only in the hadal zone and have been collected as far as 6850 meters deep in the Java trench. Nevertheless, this makes sea urchin the class of echinoderms living the least deep, compared to sea cucumbers and crinoids that remain abundant below 8000m.|$|E
