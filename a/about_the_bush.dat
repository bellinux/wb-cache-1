5|$|Saunders {{attended}} the local mission school at Lake Condah, {{where he did}} well in maths, geometry and languages. His father, meanwhile, taught Reg and Harry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush,</b> and encouraged them to read Shakespeare and Australian literature. After completing eight years of schooling, Saunders earned his merit certificate. His formal education thus ended, {{he went to work}} at the age of 14 as a millhand in a sawmill. Employers regularly withheld payments for Aboriginal labourers at this time, but Saunders refused to work unless he was paid his full entitlement, and his employer relented. He worked and furthered his education until 1937, when he went into business with his father and brother, operating a sawmill in Portland, Victoria; the sawmill was destroyed in a bushfire in 1939.|$|E

His columns argued that the large deficits during that time were generated by the Bush administration {{as a result of}} decreasing taxes on the rich, increasing public spending, and fighting the Iraq war. Krugman wrote that these policies were unsustainable in the long run and would eventually generate a major economic crisis. The book was a best-seller.|$|E

I have never understood the controversy. I had no idea if Iraq was or was not involved, {{but it would have}} been irresponsible for any administration not to have asked the question." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cleland {{was one of}} the 29 Senate Democrats who {{backed the}} {{authorization}} to go to war in Iraq.

In 2005, he said [...] "it was obvious that if I voted against the resolution that I would be dead meat in the race, just handing them in a victory."

He was hit by two bullets, first in the thigh and then in the chest, and died after a few minutes.|$|E
6000|$|His dim eyes brightened for {{a moment}} with old {{pleasant}} memories of days spent in observing these birds; and leading me to a spot among the trees, from which there was {{a view of the}} open country beyond, he pointed to a great green down, a couple of miles away, and told me that on the other side I would come on a large patch of furze, and that by sitting quietly there for half an hour or so I might see a dozen furze wrens. Then he added: [...] "A dozen, did I say? Why, I saw not fewer than forty or fifty flitting <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> <b>the</b> very last time I went there, and I daresay if you are patient enough you will see quite as many." ...|$|R

2500|$|Palin {{answered}} a 2006 gubernatorial questionnaire by choosing support for funding of abstinence-before-marriage programs over support for [...] "explicit sex-education programs, school-based clinics {{and the distribution}} of contraceptives in schools". In a subsequent radio interview with KTOO (FM) in Juneau, Alaska, she clarified her position by saying she was against explicit sex education, but was in favor of contraceptive education. She characterized in-school discussion of condoms as [...] "relatively benign" [...] and not something that would define an [...] "explicit" [...] program. Palin said of contraception that [...] "kids who may not hear about it at home should hear about it in other avenues." [...] Rebecca Traister of Salon.com analyzed Palin's political record as one that demonstrated her lack of enthusiasm <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> era promotion of abstinence-before-marriage education, and one that showed she did not work against existing sex education laws in Alaska.|$|E
2500|$|After his rescue, Jonah obeys {{the call}} to prophesy against Nineveh, causing {{the people of the}} city to repent and God to forgive them. Jonah is furious, however, and angrily tells God that this is the reason he tried to flee from Him, as he knew Him to be a just and merciful God. He then beseeches God to kill him, a request which is denied when God causes a tree to grow over him, giving him shade. Initially grateful, Jonah's anger returns the next day, when God sends a worm to eat the plant, {{withering}} it, and he tells God {{that it would be better}} if he were dead. God then points out: [...] "You are concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush,</b> for which you did not labour and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night. And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left, and also many animals?

2500|$|Cole {{was asked}} to address {{the pros and cons}} of the {{building}} war against Iraq in January 2003 for the journal of the University of Michigan International Institute. He warned that any invasion of Iraq would inevitably be rejected by Iraqis and the Arab world as a form of neocolonialism. He wrote, [...] "The Sunnis of Iraq could well turn to groups like al-Qaida, having lost the ideals of the Baath. Iraqi Shi'ites might become easier to recruit into Khomeinism of the Iranian sort, and become a bulwark for the shaky regime in Shi'ite Iran." [...] Considering the problem of ethnic politics, he said, [...] "A post-war Iraq may well be riven with factionalism that impedes the development of a well-ensconced new government." [...] He rejected the argument that Baathist Iraq's [...] "weapons of mass destruction" [...] or backing of terrorism posed threats to the United States. [...] Cole admitted that he had had [...] "mixed feelings" [...] on the issue—i.e., he opposed Saddam Hussein's regime, but feared disaster and opposed international illegality. He was insistent that any war would be illegal without a UN Security Council resolution (which was not obtained by the Bush administration). His position on the war resembled that of the French government, which is generally held to have opposed it. By January 2003, he said he had become [...] "cynical" [...] <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration motives for the war. On the day of the U.S. invasion Cole wrote that [...] "for all the concerns one might have about the aftermath, the removal of Saddam Hussein and the murderous Baath regime from power will be worth the sacrifices that are about to be made on all sides." [...] He has explained that this posting was not intended to show support for the invasion: [...] "The passage quoted ... was not about whether the war was legal or not. Being from a military family, it mattered to me as an ethical issue whether troops lives were being lost for no good reason, in an illegal boondoggle. I decided on careful deliberation that even though the war was wrong, the lives lost would not be in vain, since a tyrannical regime would have fallen. To say that some good could come of an illegal act is not to endorse the illegal act." ...|$|E
