The shape {{and size of the}} compound (eluent) determine how the compound interacts with the gel (stationary phase). To determine <b>approximate</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight,</b> the elution volumes of compounds with their corresponding molecular weights are obtained and then a plot of “Kav” vs “log(Mw)” is made, where Kav = (Ve-Vo)/(Vt-Vo) and Mw is the molecular mass.

The Ve component represents the volume at which the intermediate molecules elute such as molecules that have partial access to the beads of the column. In addition, Vt is the sum of the total volume between the beads and the volume within the beads. The Vo component represents the volume at which the larger molecules elute, which elute in the beginning.

Lac- Prt+ and Lac+ Prt- mutants were isolated after treatment with ethidium bromide. Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid was isolated by cesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium density gradient centrifugation from the parent cultures as well as from their Lac- Prt-, Lac- Prt+, and Lac+ Prt- mutants. Five distinct plasmid sizes of <b>approximate</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weights</b> of 2, 4, 8, 21, and 27 million were found in S. lactis C 10, whereas the Lac- Prt- derivative lacked the 8 - and 21 -million-dalton plasmids, but the 8 -million-dalton plasmid was present in the Lac-Att mutant. In S. lactis m 18 five plasmids possessing <b>molecular</b> <b>weights</b> of about 2, 4, 10, 18 and 27 million were observed.

A three-layered cell wall structure, one layer on each side of the peptidoglycan layer, was reconstituted when only the 150, 000 -molecular-weight protein was used. Both five- and three-layered cell walls reconstituted in vitro also contained hexagonally arranged arrays with the same lattice constant as that of the total and Triton-insoluble envelopes. A mutant, strain 47 - 57, which was isolated as a phage-resistant colony, had a two-layered cell wall consisting of the middle and inner wall layers and contained only 150, 000 -molecular-weight protein as the major cell wall protein. The cell envelopes of the mutant revealed the hexagonal arrays with the same lattice constant as that of the wild-type cell envelopes.
