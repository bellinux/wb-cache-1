5|$|The {{first chapter}} places the player {{in control of}} either Jennifer or Helen, {{escaping}} from Scissorman within the university research building. The second chapter will have the player retrieve the Demon Idol, {{a clue to the}} murder investigation. The scenario in which the idol is retrieved can change depending on choices made by the player earlier. Helen may search for it within the city library, or reporter Nolan Campbell or detective Stan Gotts will search for it in the home of a Barrows family butler. The final chapter occurs at Barrows Castle, putting the player in control of the same character they controlled in chapter one. Jennifer or Helen must use the Demon Idol to open a vortex in the castle basement and destroy Scissorman. Depending on the narrative followed <b>and</b> <b>choices</b> made along the way, 10 different endings can be seen.|$|E

40|$|Notice <b>and</b> <b>Choice</b> is {{the model}} for {{protecting}} privacy online in the United States. Under the model, users of online services are given notice about services information and privacy practices {{in the form of}} privacy policies. Based on this information, users can choose whether to use particular online services and whether to exercise any options for protecting their privacy that the services might offer. In theory, Notice <b>and</b> <b>Choice</b> seems like a sound regulatory mechanism. Indeed, state and federal regulatory agencies prefer the model as a basis for privacy enforcement action. But Notice <b>and</b> <b>Choice</b> faces harsh criticism from privacy advocates. This Note adds a new critique to the list—that Notice <b>and</b> <b>Choice</b> leaves individual consumers who are affected by privacy policy breaches, legally, empty-handed. This is because website privacy policies—the principal mechanism for effectuating Notice and Choice—are generally not considered to be legally binding agreements. As a result, individuals’ contract theory-based actions against companies for privacy policy breaches almost categorically fail. As a result, the users of online services are largely left without individual redress for privacy policy breaches. Much has been written about Notice <b>and</b> <b>Choice,</b> <b>and</b> even more has been written about online contracting. Yet, like Notice <b>and</b> <b>Choice</b> <b>and</b> contract theory themselves, these two bodies of scholarship remain misaligned. This Note fills that gap by addressing Notice <b>and</b> <b>Choice</b> in the context of contracts, and offers alternative solutions to give individuals the opportunity to seek redress in the Notice <b>and</b> <b>Choice</b> scheme through contract theory...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in modelling how people make choices that involve both risks and delays, i. e., risky inter-temporal choices. We investigated an untested assumption underlying several proposed risky inter-temporal choice models: that pure risky <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> pure inter-temporal <b>choices</b> are special cases of risky inter-temporal choice. We tested this assumption by presenting a single group of participants with risky <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> inter-temporal <b>choices.</b> We then compared {{the performance of a}} model that is fit to both choice types simultaneously, with the performance of separate models fit to the risky <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> inter-temporal <b>choice</b> data. We find, using Bayesian model comparison, that the majority of participants are best fit by a single model that incorporates both risky <b>and</b> inter-temporal <b>choices.</b> This result supports the assumption that risky <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> inter-temporal <b>choices</b> may be special cases of risky inter-temporal choice. Our results also suggest that, under the conditions of our experiment, interpretation of monetary value is very similar in risky <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> inter-temporal <b>choices...</b>|$|R

They all rejected the existing order, decrying it as stale and overly hierarchic. They offered what they described as more spiritual, candid and simple substitutes.
