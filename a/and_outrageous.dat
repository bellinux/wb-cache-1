500|$|That same year, Divine {{decided to}} get back in contact with his estranged parents. His mother had learned of his {{cinematic}} and disco career after reading an article about the films of John Waters in Life magazine, and had gone to see Female Trouble at the cinema, but had not felt emotionally able {{to get back in}} contact with her son until 1981.

The relationship was mended, and Divine bought them lavish gifts and informed them of how wealthy he was. In fact, according to his manager Bernard Jay, he was already heavily in debt due to his extravagant spending. In 1982, he then joined forces with young American composer Bobby Orlando, who wrote a number of Hi-NRG singles for Divine, including [...] "Native Love (Step By Step)," [...] "Shoot Your Shot", and [...] "Love Reaction".

[...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "This is epic, funny, tragic, demanding, strange, original, boldly sincere filmmaking. And the climax, the portion that either sinks the entire movie or self-critically explains how so many others derail, is bananas." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek felt Meryl Streep had not [...] "been this much fun to watch in years", while Mike Clark of USA Today gave a largely negative review, mainly criticizing the ending: [...] "Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like, this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot." ...|$|E
