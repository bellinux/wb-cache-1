5|$|During this time, {{women were}} also given a more {{official}} standing.

5|$|Mary Wilson's {{brother died}} {{unexpectedly}} {{that night in}} Hull; although {{she and her husband}} did not <b>attend</b> <b>for</b> a second day's racing, they asked all the other guests not to interrupt the plans, and the remainder of the party attended, watching the St. Leger Stakes. During the journey to the racecourse, Lycett Green asked Edward Somerset his advice, telling the peer that several members of the party were convinced of Gordon-Cumming's guilt. Edward Somerset decided to consult his cousin, Arthur Somerset, and the two men suggested that Lycett Green inform the prince's senior courtier, Lord Coventry.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly was {{strictly}} {{under the control}} of Parliament, and was only to debate topics which Parliament directed. Assembly members were not permitted to state their disagreements with majority opinions or share any information about the proceedings, except in writing to Parliament. Parliament chose William Twisse, an internationally respected theologian, to be the Assembly's prolocutor or chairman. Due to Twisse's ill health, Cornelius Burges, whom Parliament appointed as one of several assessors, served as prolocutor pro tempore for most of the Assembly. Twenty-two appointed members of the Assembly died before 1649, and they along with those who did not <b>attend</b> <b>for</b> other reasons were replaced by another nineteen members. Three non-voting scribes were also added in 1643.|$|E
5|$|Bennett was to {{find that}} heading a leading music college was {{incompatible}} with {{a career as a}} composer. The post of Principal was traditionally not arduous. He was contractually required to <b>attend</b> <b>for</b> only six hours a week, teaching composition and arranging class-lists. But Bennett had not only to run the RAM but to save it from imminent dissolution. The RAM had been temporarily saved from bankruptcy by grants from the government, authorised by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1864 and 1865. The following year Gladstone was out of office, and the new Chancellor, Disraeli, refused to renew the grant. The directors of the RAM decided to close it, over the head of Bennett as Principal. Bennett, {{with the support of the}} faculty and the students, assumed the Chairmanship of the board of directors.|$|E
5|$|Honorees are {{inducted}} {{for work}} in any area of wrestling, including competing in the ring, managing, refereeing, promoting, and announcing. During the ceremony, personalities from the NWA deliver speeches and present the inductees with plaques. These plaques have the logo of the NWA Legends Fanfest and are identical aside from the year of induction and the inductee's name. Many presenters {{have been involved in}} the inductee's career; for example, Gary Hart, who managed Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson, inducted both men, and Buddy Roberts was inducted by Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin, both of whom were fellow members of The Fabulous Freebirds. Inductees and other former NWA wrestlers are seated at tables with fans to provide an intimate atmosphere. Although most people honored by the hall attend the dinner and induction ceremony, some are inducted posthumously and others are unable to <b>attend</b> <b>for</b> medical reasons.|$|E

Rabbi Shmuel Butman announced his plan to crown the Rebbe. The Rebbe, who had been paralyzed and speechless since March the previous year, would join the daily prayers on a special balcony that was built for him to easily be wheeled. Butman planned to crown the Rebbe on January 30, 1993 after the evening prayers. However, when the Rebbe got word of the planned event, he communicated to his secretaries Leibel Groner and Yudel Krinsky that he would only <b>attend</b> <b>for</b> the usual evening service. Both Groner and Krinsky, then followed by Butman, announced that the event was actually not a coronation {{and should not be}} intended as such.|$|E

Painter Sir John Everett Millais, born in 1829, was baptised in the church. The Law Commission estimate that the last debt relating to the construction of the building would have been paid by 1840.
