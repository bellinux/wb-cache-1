5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with <b>a</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E

50|$|The most {{striking}} and lasting of Cardinal Logue's legacies to the cathedral were, however, {{the scheme of}} mosaics he commissioned to adorn every inch of blank wall in the cathedral. Significant thought was given to how best {{to deal with the}} decoration of the walls of the building. Archbishop McGettigan had completed a scheme of painted murals and stencilling of the walls but, as a result of Armagh's damp climate, these had perished within a few years of completion. It was therefore decided to adopt a mosaic decorative scheme, the initial great cost being defrayed by the future saving on repainting a mural scheme. The material employed was Italian pottery of various colours in dice-shaped cubes with glass cubes for the gilt portions to prevent tarnishing and to give greater lustre. The sections were put together in two workshops in London and were carefully glued, face downwards, on strips of paper. These were then applied to <b>a</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> special cement on the walls in a manner resembling the hanging of wallpaper.|$|R

[...] Behind the scenes, however, the change led to shifts in the shooting schedule, notably changes in the number of night scenes filmed because of curfew issues and restrictions imposed.

Joshua Topolsky of The Verge also criticized the design, noting lack of icon consistency in different parts of the OS, as well as writing that [...] "instead of correcting issues with the notification panel and alerts, Apple has simply given them <b>a</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> paint and several layers of sub-navigation [...] doing nothing to actually speed up your productivity on the device." ...|$|E
40|$|Heat-exchangers, {{particle}} filters, turbines, {{and other}} components in integrated coal gasification combined cycle system must withstand the highly sulfiding {{conditions of the}} high temperature coal gas {{over an extended period}} of time. The performance of components degrades significantly with time unless expensive high alloy materials are used. Deposition <b>of</b> a suitable <b>coating</b> on a low cost alloy may improve is resistance to such sulfidation attack and decrease capital and operating costs. The alloys used in the gasifier service include austenitic and ferritic stainless steels, nickel-chromium-iron alloys, and expensive nickel-cobalt alloys. During this reporting period we conducted two exposure tests with coated and uncoated coupons. The first one was aborted after a short period, because of a leak in the pressure regulator of a CO/CO{sub 2 }/H{sub 2 } gas mixture gas cylinder that was used to prepare the simulated coal gas stream. Nevertheless, this run was very instructive as it showed that during the brief exposure when the concentration of H{sub 2 }S increased to 8. 6 %, even specialty alloys such as HR 160 and I 800 were badly corroded, yet the sample of a SS 405 -steel that was coated with Ti/Ta showed no signs of corrosion. After replacing the pressure regulator, a second run was conducted with <b>a</b> <b>fresh</b> set <b>of</b> <b>coated</b> and uncoated samples. The Ti/Ta-coated on to SS 405 steel from the earlier runs was also exposed in this test. The run proceeded smoothly, and at the end of test the uncoated steels were badly damaged, some evidence of corrosion was found on coupons of HR 160 and I 800 alloys and the Cr-coated steels, but again, the Ti/Ta-coated sample appeared unaffected...|$|R

40|$|In {{many regions}} of the world, {{groundwater}} is contaminated {{with a high level}} of arsenic that must be treated before it can be safely used as drinking water. In situ immobilization of arsenic from groundwater within subsurface environment could have major advantages over the conventional above-ground chemical coagulation-precipitation treatment process. In this study, we develop a novel technique that can in situ emplace iron oxides onto the sand grain surface of porous media under mild chemical and temperature conditions. The technique involves sequential injections of a preconditioned ferrous iron solution and an oxidant solution and then orchestrate the advective-diffusive transport of the two reagents in porous media to create an overlapped reaction zone where ferrous iron is oxidized and precipitated on the sand grain surfaces. We demonstrate through bench-scale column tests the feasibility of using this technique to create a large-scale iron oxide-enriched reactive barrier in subsurface environment for in situ removal of arsenic. A sand filter with <b>a</b> <b>fresh</b> iron oxide <b>coating</b> can treat thousands of pore volumes of water contaminated with dozens of ppb arsenic before the coating needs to be regenerated. Arsenic breakthrough curves through the sand filter suggest that both reversible adsorption and irreversible precipitation are responsible for removing arsenic from the water.

60|$|I {{have lived}} a {{severely}} moral life. But {{it would be}} a mistake for other people to try that, or for me to recommend it. Very few would succeed: you have to have a perfectly colossal stock of morals; and you can't get them on a margin; you have to have the whole thing, and put them in your box. Morals are an acquirement--like music, like a foreign language, like piety, poker, paralysis--no man is born with them. I wasn't myself, I started poor. I hadn't a single moral. There is hardly a man in this house that is poorer than I was then. Yes, I started like that--the world before me, not a moral in the slot. Not even an insurance moral. I can remember the first one I ever got. I can remember the landscape, the weather, the--I can remember how everything looked. It was an old moral, an old second-hand moral, all out of repair, and didn't fit, anyway. But if you are careful with a thing like that, and keep it in a dry place, and save it for processions, and Chautauquas, and World's Fairs, and so on, and disinfect it now and then, and give it <b>a</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> whitewash once in a while, you will be surprised to see how well she will last and how long she will keep sweet, or at least inoffensive. When I got that mouldy old moral, she had stopped growing, because she hadn't any exercise; but I worked her hard, I worked her Sundays and all. Under this cultivation she waxed in might and stature beyond belief, and served me well and was my pride and joy for sixty-three years; then she got to associating with insurance presidents, and lost flesh and character, and was a sorrow to look at and no longer competent for business. She was a great loss to me. Yet not all loss. I sold her--ah, pathetic skeleton, as she was--I sold her to Leopold, the pirate King of Belgium; he sold her to our Metropolitan Museum, and it was very glad to get her, for without a rag on, she stands 57 feet long and 16 feet high, and they think she's a brontosaur.

Often known as 'dark and dank,' the building is distinct from the quad area located across the campus green, known as the Dustbowl. Built in 1963, Carney has an unusual structure seeming to face away from the rest of campus. Contrary to popular belief, the building was not built backwards but rather styled to allow more offices to have windows, according to BC Historian, Professor Thomas O'Connor. The Beacon Street side of the building contains a fountain {{in the middle of the}} courtyard; the fountain has been dry for decades as the result of the frequent use of powdered soap pranks by undergraduate students.
