Gupte said his character keeps the frame unpredictable {{and that it}} provided him with a foil to express rage and anguish.

Dutta, who played Shumona Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealingsaid {{that he did not have}} much time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai, where Bhardwaj briefed him.|$|E

5|$|In late 1869, Earp courted 20-year-old Urilla Sutherland (c. 1849–1870), the {{daughter}} of William and Permelia Sutherland, who operated the Exchange Hotel in Lamar. They were married by his father Nicholas in Lamar on January 10, 1870, and in August 1870, Wyatt bought <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>on</b> {{the outskirts of town}} for $50, where he built a house. Urilla was pregnant and about to deliver their first child when she suddenly died from typhoid fever. In November, Earp sold the lot and a house on it for $75. Hoping to keep the office to which he had been appointed, he ran against his elder half-brother Newton for the office of constable. The Earps may have hoped to keep the job in the family one way or another. Wyatt won by 137 votes to Newton's 108, but their father Nicholas lost the election for justice of the peace in a very close four-way race.|$|E

He bought <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>on</b> west bank of river Aura and built there a shipbuilding cradle and a timber storage. Fithie got commercial rights in November 1741. The war broken out in the previous summer led to Russian occupation of Finland, and although many escaped to Sweden, Fithie stayed in Turku. The Russians ordered him to build ten galleys. Eventually, just six units were built, because the Ostrobothnian shipbuilders resisted the project and escaped to Sweden – reportedly, taking Fithie with them.|$|E

25|$|Vogt and Due's {{concession}} {{was transferred}} to a company, A/S Kristiania Sporveisselskab, which was incorporated on 26 August 1874. The share capital was set to 200,000 speciedaler. The company bought <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>on</b> Pilestredet 10,000 speciedaler, which became the site of Homansbyen Depot, including the company's administration. In its original design it had places for 44 vehicles and 116 horses, {{as well as a}} smithy, offices, apartments, a laboratory for the veterinary and a sick bay for twelve horses. The company was permitted to use tracks on top of the roads, although the municipality retained the right at any time to require them to be dug down. The company opted for standard gauge, presumably because this was most common amongst horsecars and eased procurement. Track-laying started in May 1875. Because of the location of the depot and the low traffic estimates along Drammensveien, KSS opted to instead build a branch to Homansbyen.|$|E

25|$|The {{shooting}} lasted {{nearly twenty}} consecutive hours, {{and it was}} exhausting for Kalomira and for the team that worked {{under the guidance of}} director Kostas Kapetanidis. The director decided to focus {{on the face of the}} young performer and so chose to do the shoot in a studio and not outdoors. Sometimes alone, sometimes flanked by dancers, Kalomira danced and sang while wearing clothes selected from the collection of J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez. In some scenes of the video, impressive objects with bright colors such as a red Ducati motor bike, a huge disco ball, and big letters with the title of the song were used. The choreography was by Svitailof Ivan and the styling was George Segredaki and Constantine Koutsomichou while the hair and make-up were overseen by Dimitris Giannetos. Through the video clip, Kalomira reveals another side of: sexy, feminine, charming but always innocent and sweet in a quick clip of the montage.
