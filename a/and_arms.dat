5|$|At the 2008 ICF Congress in Rome, a {{new program}} for the championships was approved. This marked the first change in the program since the {{addition}} of the K-4 1000 m women's event at the 2001 championships in Poznań. Men's C-4 500 m, men's K-4 500 m, women's K-4 1000 m events were replaced by C-1 4 × 200 m relay (men only) and K-1 4 × 200 m relay (both men and women). Women's C-1 200 m, C-1 500 m, C-2 200 m and C-2 500 m events were shown as exhibition. Paddleability exhibition events of K-1 200 m LTA (men & women), K-2 200 m TA (mixed), and C-2 200 m LTA (mixed) also took place (LTATA – Legs, Trunks, <b>and</b> <b>Arms</b> or Trunks and Arms; LTA – Legs, Trunks, and Arms; and TA – Trunks <b>and</b> <b>Arms,</b> or Arms). Support for women's Canadian and the paddle ability events were confirmed at an ICF Board of Directors meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 18–20 March 2009. A training camp was held for women's canoe in conjunction with the championships.|$|E
5|$|Eggman sneaks {{away with}} the last Emerald <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> the Eclipse Cannon. When he tries to fire it, the colony begins falling and a {{prerecorded}} message from Gerald broadcasts: he programmed the ARK to collide with Earth if the Emeralds were used, destroying it in revenge for the government condemning his research and killing his colleagues, including his granddaughter Maria. Everyone works to access the cannon's core and neutralize the ARK using the Master Emerald.|$|E

In August 1967, Bagramyan accompanied General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and Premier Alexei Kosygin to North Vietnam, where they met with Vietnamese leaders as he, serving in the role of a military expert, helped negotiate the transfer of logistics <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> to the country during the Vietnam War.|$|E

According to {{the status}} of the lack of {{reliability}} data for MEMS fuze, this paper mainly studied the reliability factors of MEMS Safety <b>and</b> <b>Arming</b> System by using Dynamic simulation method. Through simulation analysis, the mainly reliability factors, weakness and potential failure modes of MEMS Safety <b>and</b> <b>Arming</b> System can be obtained, which can provide theory reference and data support for the design and application of the MEMS Safety <b>and</b> <b>Arming</b> System...|$|R

5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The {{composition is}} built from the geometric shapes that form {{the lines of the}} woman's veil, neckline, face, <b>and</b> <b>arms,</b> and by the fall of the light that illuminates her face and headdress. The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.|$|E

The X chromosome is submetacentric (with one arm slightly longer than the other) and the Y chromosome is small and acrocentric (with one very short and one long arm). The karyotype is conserved among species of Miniopterus; the number of chromosomes <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> is identical in M.griveaudi, the Malagasy M.aelleni and M.gleni, and even the Asian M.fuliginosus.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} showing that dromaeosaurids were covered in feathers. Some dromaeosaurid fossils preserve long, pennaceous feathers on the hands <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> (remiges) and tail (rectrices), as well as shorter, down-like feathers covering the body. Other fossils, which do not preserve actual impressions of feathers, still preserve the associated bumps on the forearm bones where long wing feathers would have attached in life. Overall, this feather pattern looks very much like Archaeopteryx.|$|E

In Albania the Expendables retrieve the item, but are then ambushed by international criminal <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> dealer Jean Vilain, his right-hand man Hector and his mercenary group (the Sangs), who have captured Billy. Vilain demands the item in exchange for Billy's life. The team gives up the item, but Vilain roundhouse kicks a knife through Billy's heart and flees with the Sangs by helicopter. Ross recovers a note for Sophia from Billy's body; the team buries their fallen comrade, swearing vengeance on Vilain.|$|E
5|$|After {{the three-year}} {{transition}} period ended with Nasser's official assumption of power, his domestic and independent foreign policies increasingly {{collided with the}} regional interests of the UK and France. The latter condemned his strong support for Algerian independence, and the UK's Eden government was agitated by Nasser's campaign against the Baghdad Pact. In addition, Nasser's adherence to neutralism regarding the Cold War, recognition of communist China, <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> deal with the Eastern bloc alienated the United States. On 19 July 1956, the US and UK abruptly withdrew their offer to finance construction of the Aswan Dam, citing concerns that Egypt's economy would be overwhelmed by the project.|$|E
5|$|Another very ancient seat is the {{so-called}} “Chair of Dagobert” in the Louvre. It is of cast bronze, sharpened with the chisel and partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back <b>and</b> <b>arms.</b> Its age has been much discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early Merovingian times, and it may in any case be taken as the oldest faldstool in existence.|$|E
