50|$|Only a few delay box {{manufacturers}} {{were willing}} to pay NHRA delay box <b>approval</b> <b>fees</b> and submit designs for the NHRA's approval without getting a non-disclosure agreement. Nor did many delay box manufacturers wish to be forced to comply with NHRA design change demands. These manufactures promptly went out of business or transitioned into non-racing related markets. As a result, very few companies manufacture delay boxes for drag racing today and each design is close in functionality to the next. The reduced competition allows these few companies to enjoy the entire market to themselves. Innovation has virtually ceased in the market. The approved manufacturers of delay boxes also enjoy a bonus of reduced competition in the market for their other on-board race timers such as: throttle stop timers, data loggers (data recorders), shifter timers, RPM switches, electronic nitrous oxide injection controllers and other devices. Delay box manufacturers that do not receive NHRA approval are shut out of the entire drag race electronics market.|$|R

50|$|Inclusionary zoning (IZ), {{also known}} as inclusionary housing, is an American term which refers to {{municipal}} and county planning ordinances that require a given share of new construction to be affordable by people with low to moderate incomes. The term inclusionary zoning indicates that these ordinances seek to counter exclusionary zoning practices, which aim to exclude low-cost housing from a municipality through the zoning code. There are variations among different inclusionary zoning programs. Firstly, they can be mandatory or voluntary. There are also variations among the set-aside requirements, affordability levels coupled with the period of control. In order to encourage engagements in these zoning programs, developers are awarded with incentives for engaging in these programs, such as density bonus, expedited <b>approval</b> and <b>fee</b> waivers.|$|R

40|$|Of most {{concern to}} {{business}} is the costs they face from local government planning and zoning assessment and {{building and construction}} regulation.   Key points 	Implementing and enforcing state and territory laws, rather than local laws, dominates local governments’ regulatory workload. 	While the Commonwealth has very limited powers to make laws for local government, it can influence them via national frameworks, such as food safety. 	In addition to local laws and quasi-regulatory instruments, rules can be imposed on business by ‘decisions’ determined under other laws, such as occurs with permits (including development approvals), licences, leases or registrations. Although they can impose costs on business and/or be anti-competitive, local instruments do not face as much scrutiny as state, territory or Commonwealth regulation. 	Burdens on business arise from delays, information requirements, restrictions on <b>approvals,</b> <b>fees</b> and penalties. Local governments can also prevent a business from operating or realising opportunities. Building, planning and land-use regulations impose the largest burdens on business. 	Unnecessary business burdens will be lower when local governments regulate well. The most important gaps in the support from states to local governments are: 	 		insufficient consideration of local governments’ capacity to administer and enforce regulation before a new regulatory role is delegated to them 		limited guidance and training on how to administer and enforce regulations 		no clear indication and ranking of state regulatory priorities. 	 	 	Leading practices for {{the states and the}} Northern Territory, include: 	 		guidance to local government in writing regulation, such as Victoria’s Guidelines for Local Laws 		incentives for local governments to achieve scale and scope economies in regulatory functions 		periodic assessment of the stock of local regulation and state regulation requiring a local government role 		efficient cost recovery for local government regulatory functions 		guidance to local government in the scrutiny of the impact of laws 		graduated review and appeal systems for both local government decisions and processes 		having regulatory decisions made by bodies which take account of all impacts 		removing or managing the conflicting objectives between local governments’ regulatory and other functions 		a comprehensive central register of the state laws for which local government has a role in administration, enforcement and/or referral. 	 	   Image: Laenulfean / flick...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, Brazilian Environmental State {{agencies}} improved their criteria to screen {{in or out}} proposed projects that {{should be subject to}} environmental licensing and environmental impact assessments. Few studies, however, have attempted to understand the extent to which EIA screening criteria are technically consistent and sound. The {{purpose of this study was}} to undertake a comparative analysis of the screening processes in four highly industrialized Brazilian States: Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Data were collected through literature reviews and numerous interviews (open-ended and semi-structured). The study selected four "real " projects that had been screened in for impact assessment in the Minas Gerais State agency and, based on their data, filled out environmental license applications in the other three State jurisdictions to understand how the "fictional " projects would be screened in or out for impact assessments. The "simulations " revealed a few similarities in the screening criteria used by the four jurisdictions. However, the differences among specific thresholds and units of analysis across the jurisdictions led to different screening scenarios, with had very relevant implications in terms of project <b>approval,</b> administrative <b>fees</b> and required studies. Similar projects were subjected to very different impact assessment studies. The study concludes by discussing the implications of such differences...|$|R

If approved this {{would be one of}} the largest awards of legal fees in American history.

GAO found that despite internal recommendations for a new system, SSA has repeatedly postponed its plans to improve the attorney fee payment process. Indeed, even though these improvements have been part of SSA's system's plans since 1998, SSA has yet to establish a firm schedule for carrying out its plans. Additionally, although SSA has a draft plan for improving the process, agency officials told GAO that the details of the plan have not been completed and SSA has yet to complete a cost estimate for the project. There are also other gaps in the plan [...] such as not creating an attorney master file or establishing an electronic connection between the payment processing staff and the Office of Hearings and Appeals <b>fee</b> <b>approval</b> staff [...] where taking additional actions could improve the process. Furthermore, SSA's performance plan did not have goals related to attorney fees [...] neither for cost reduction of the program nor payment timeliness.

Without such quantifiable goals, future efforts to track and oversee SSA's progress in these areas will be difficult. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{concern about the}} {{financial}} impact of government regulations and charges relating to the development process on the cost and affordability of housing in Australia (RDC 2006 a, UDIA 2007). With escalating housing unaffordability, this concern has stimulated serious discussion within the housing industry {{on the impact of}} the planning process on housing costs, including the costs of complying with building and design controls, time taken to secure <b>approval,</b> and <b>fees</b> and charges for administration, infrastructure or other public services associated with development. While there is {{a growing body of research}} addressing the indirect impacts of the planning system on the land and housing market (Barker 2006, Bramley 2007, Evans 2004), there remains considerable uncertainty over the nature of these costs and their impact in different locations and on different developers. The impact of these charges on developers and first purchasers is far from universal. Drawing on interviews with developers of various sizes and employees of local councils and state agencies from New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland under taken as part of a recent Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI) funded project, this paper argues that large developers are both more able and willing to incorporate development regulations/charges. In contrast, small developers are less supportive of state based infrastructure charges and development regulations as they are seen to have a greater impact on the development margin and the financial viability of a project. Further, it is found that large developers are in a more powerful position to negotiate the type and timing of contributions. In particular, this comes through significant ‘in-kind’ works and negotiated development and infrastructure plans with approval authorities (local councils or state agencies). This paper challenges the assertion that state charges and levies are passed first purchasers in all cases. 19 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Shareholder {{litigation}} challenging corporate mergers is ubiquitous, {{with the}} likelihood of a shareholder suit exceeding 90 %. The value of this litigation, however, is questionable. The vast majority of merger cases settle for nothing more than supplemental disclosures in the merger proxy statement. The attorneys that bring these lawsuits are compensated for their efforts with a court-awarded fee. This leads critics to charge that merger litigation benefits only the lawyers who bring the claims, not the shareholders they represent. In response, defenders of merger litigation argue that the lawsuits serve a useful oversight function and that the improved disclosures that result are beneficial to shareholders. This Article offers a new approach to assessing the value of these claims by empirically testing the relationship between merger litigation and shareholder voting on the merger. If the supplemental disclosures produced by the settlement of merger litigation are valuable, they should affect shareholder voting behavior. Specifically, supplemental disclosures that are, in effect, “compelled” by settlement should produce new and unfavorable information about the merger and lead to a lower percentage of shares voted in favor of it. Applying this hypothesis to a hand-collected sample of 453 large public company mergers from 2005 - 2012, we find no such effect. We find no significant evidence that disclosure-only settlements affect shareholder voting. These findings warrant a reconsideration of Delaware merger law. Specifically, under current law, supplemental disclosures are viewed by courts as providing a substantial benefit to the shareholder class. In turn, this substantial benefit entitles the plaintiffs’ lawyers to an award of attorneys’ fees. Our evidence suggests that this legal analysis is misguided and that supplemental disclosures do not in fact constitute a substantial benefit. As a result, and in light of the substantial costs generated by public company merger litigation, we argue that courts should reject disclosure settlements as a basis for attorney fee awards. Our approach responds to critiques of merger litigation as excessive and frivolous by reducing the incentive for plaintiffs’ lawyers to bring weak cases, but it would have an additional benefit. Current practice drags state court judges into the task of indirectly promulgating disclosure standards in connection with the <b>approval</b> of <b>fee</b> awards. We argue, instead, for a more efficient specialization between state and federal courts in the regulation of mergers: public company merger disclosure should be policed by the federal securities laws while state corporate law focuses on substantive fairness...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} aims {{to provide}} directions for some possible future amendments of domestic company law regulation. Intent of such amendments is to facilitate {{creation of a}} more competitive and understandable legal framework that will be equally attractive to both domestic and foreign investors. Establishment of such legal framework {{can contribute to the}} strengthening of economy and legal certainty as well as creation of a favourable investment environment. Contribution is divided into two distinct parts. First part provides suggestions relating to amendments in the field of company incorporation. For example, consideration is given to establishment of one stop shop service as well as online incorporation, introduction of the limited liability company without the minimal share capital requirement and other similar areas which can contribute to the simplification of company incorporation procedure (e. g. abolition of the founder’s statement of tax debt non-existence). Second part provides suggestions for amendments aimed at improvement of existing legal solutions and removal of ambiguities that undermine legal certainty which can result in non-uniform application in business dealings and judicial practice. For example, suggestions are given in regard to the clearance given to the management and supervisory board members of a private company limited by shares, decision making by shareholders through use of means that do not require them to be physically present at the general meeting of a private company limited by shares, <b>fee</b> <b>approval</b> {{to the members of the}} first supervisory board of a public company limited by shares, attendance of management board members at the supervisory board meetings and making counter-proposals by company shareholders before and during the general meeting of the company...|$|R
