5|$|The {{control pad}} {{may be used}} to move the hero in any {{direction}} and to move the flashing cursor in menu displays. Additional buttons confirm and cancel commands. In the English version, players use menu commands to talk to people, check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> or down stairs. However, in some of the game's later remakes, certain commands were assigned to buttons, navigating stairs became automatic, and the hero's speed was increased. In the Japanese version, characters always face forward, so players must choose a command and then a direction in which to perform that action. In the North American version, the hero turns to face the direction he is moving, making direction selection unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|In late 2008, the Russian {{government}} introduced protectionist measures, worth $5billion, {{to improve}} {{the situation in the}} industry. This included $2billion of bailouts for troubled companies and $3billion of credits for buyers of Russian cars. Prime minister Vladimir Putin described the move as vital in order to save jobs. The tariffs for imported foreign cars and trucks were increased to a minimum of 50% <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to 100%. The tariffs are linked to the engine size of the vehicle. The increased duties led to protests in Russian cities, most notably in Vladivostok, where the importation of Japanese cars is an important sector of the city's economy. To compensate for the losses of the Vladivostok businesses, Prime Minister Putin ordered the car manufacturing company Sollers to move one of its factories from Moscow to Vladivostok. The move was completed in 2009, and the factory now employs about 700 locals. It was planned to produce 13,200 cars in Vladivostok in 2010.|$|E

500|$|One World Trade Center's {{top floor}} is officially {{designated}} as floor 104, {{despite the fact}} that the tower only contains 94 actual stories.

Floors 91–99 and 103–104 are mechanical floors.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} site is {{on a steep}} hill, so the street-level entrance at the upper edge of the property is not the lowest floor. Four stories of apartments start at the ground floor <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> and two more floors consisting of a 10-car garage and a sub-basement storage space are below grade, jutting out to the east because of the slope. [...] A manager's apartment was added in 1947 by extending steel beams from the garage and suspending a two-floor unit with steel cables. Structural engineer W.S. Ellison oversaw construction of the primarily wooden frame structure, built atop a foundation and two utility floors made of reinforced concrete to meet exacting state requirements for stability.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the tenth}} of Nisan occurs {{a few days}} before the Passover holiday, when schools are not in session, the school system will also mark the holiday on the seventh of the Hebrew month of Heshvan.

2500|$|The [...] "Pepsi Can" [...] {{paint scheme}} was used on Amtrak Dash 8-32BWH diesel locomotives. The Pepsi Can paint scheme is a {{spin-off}} {{from the standard}} Phase III.

Close {{to the rear of the}} engine, the red and blue stripes make a [...] "turn" [...] <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> the side of the engine after crossing over each other. Because of the Dash 8-32BWH's shape and the paint scheme, the nickname [...] "Pepsi-Can" [...] was given to the engines. Even though the engines have been converted over to Phase IV and V paint, the nickname is still used by many in different variations, such as 'Diet Pepsi' for Phase IV and 'Crystal Pepsi' for Phase V.|$|E

[...] Those who lived near Jerusalem brought fresh figs and grapes, and those who lived far away brought dried figs and raisins. Leading the pilgrimage procession was an ox with horns overlaid with gold wearing a crown of olive branches. The sounds of the flute announced the pilgrims' coming until they neared Jerusalem when they sent messengers ahead and arranged their first fruits ( [...] , bikkurim) for presentation. A delegation of the Temple's leaders and treasurers came out to meet them, varying in relation to the procession. Jerusalem's artisans would stand and greet them, saying: [...] "People of such and such a place, we welcome you." [...] They played the flute until they reached the Temple Mount. On the Temple Mount, even King Agrippa would carry the basket of first fruits on his shoulder and walk to the Temple Court.
