5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> {{with the}} NIF lasers {{is that the}} flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
5|$|In COPD, it {{may take}} longer to breathe out than to breathe in. Chest {{tightness}} may occur but is not common and {{may be caused by}} <b>another</b> <b>problem.</b> Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the chest with a stethoscope. A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning may occur as the disease worsens.|$|E
5|$|Junior {{is placed}} {{under house arrest}} as he awaits trial. Richie, {{frustrated}} with Tony's authority over him, entreats Junior to have Tony killed. Junior feigns interest, then informs Tony of Richie's intentions, leaving Tony with <b>another</b> <b>problem</b> to address. However, the situation is defused unexpectedly when Janice kills Richie in a violent argument; Tony and his men conceal all evidence of the murder, and Janice returns to Seattle.|$|E

30|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problems</b> is the classifier. Current {{scholars}} tend to {{use either}} artificial neural network (ANN) or support vector machine (SVM).

5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses <b>another</b> <b>problem.</b> Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{football}} in Africa {{as a whole}} faces several challenges, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental gender inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> with the development for the national team, one faced throughout the continent, is if quality female football players are found, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States.|$|E
5|$|Adding to the problems, the zip fuel {{program was}} {{canceled}} in 1959. After burning, the fuel turned into liquids and solids that increased wear on moving turbine engine components. Although the B-70 {{was intended to}} use zip only in the afterburners, and thus avoid this problem, the enormous cost of the zip program for such limited gains led to its cancellation. This by itself was not a fatal problem, however, as newly developed high-energy fuels like JP-6 were available to make {{up some of the}} difference. Most of the range lost in the change from zip fuel was restored by filling one of the two bomb bays with a fuel tank. However, <b>another</b> <b>problem</b> arose when the F-108 program was canceled in September 1959, which ended the shared development that benefited the B-70 program.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required to replace it with a simpler system.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> {{exposed by}} Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking. Its aircraft {{had been designed}} and its pilots trained for strategic operations against the Soviet Union – for nuclear, not conventional war. The new campaign exposed years of neglect in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited to the task at hand. The Air Force was also embarrassed {{by the fact that}} the Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible for the development of the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber, which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|Changes of {{sediment}} {{patterns in the}} creek have also created <b>another</b> <b>problem.</b> Stemming from the construction of structures interfering with stream flow, and increased runoff from the urban areas adjoining the creek, excessive erosion has created problems not limited to just the creek. The creek is eroding material from its bed and transporting it to the ocean, but naturally, sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study that up to $4.2million in damage occurs per year {{as a result of}} the pollution of Aliso Creek and its neighbor San Juan Creek. This includes physical damage to creek banks, bridges, pipes and other creekside structures.|$|E
5|$|In 1127 Theobald {{was made}} prior of Bec, after Boso succeeded William as abbot. Theobald became abbot in 1137, {{following}} Boso's death in June 1136. The monks of Bec unanimously elected {{him to be}} their new abbot without first consulting the Archbishop of Rouen, Hugh de Boves, who consequently threatened to void the result. Audoen, the Bishop of Evreux, and brother of Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, intervened with Hugh and persuaded him to ratify the election. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> then arose when Hugh demanded a written profession of obedience from Theobald, which Theobald refused to provide; no previous abbot had made such a profession. Theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through the intercession of Peter the Venerable, Abbot of Cluny, allowing Theobald to give a verbal profession to Hugh.|$|E
5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. The Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> were the 305mm guns and turrets as the armament factories were focused on the higher-priority guns for the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Prototypes of neither had been completed {{by the time the}} Germans invaded. The situation was not much better for the smaller guns as mountings for both the 152mm and 100mm guns were still incomplete on 22 June 1941 and all of these programs were terminated quickly afterwards.|$|E

50|$|Apart from submodular {{minimization}} and maximization, <b>another</b> natural <b>problem</b> is Difference of Submodular Optimization.

This problem admits bounded approximation guarantees. <b>Another</b> optimization <b>problem</b> involves partitioning data based on a submodular function, so as to maximize the average welfare. This problem is called the submodular welfare problem.|$|R

5|$|One major {{controversy}} {{related to}} the preliminary route of US 50. The through route {{had been assigned to}} the Old Santa Fe Trail, while the spur U.S. Route 250 followed the competing New Santa Fe Trail to the south. As a compromise, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways approved a split configuration—U.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S—in January. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> was in western Utah, where no improved road existed for US 50 to use. The final numbering plan, approved in November 1926, left a gap in US 50 between Ely, Nevada and Thistle, Utah. Finally, rather than ending US 50 at Wadsworth, where the Lincoln and Victory Highways merged, it was sent over the Lincoln Highway's Pioneer Branch, past the south side of Lake Tahoe, to Sacramento, California.|$|E
5|$|The Central Committee ordered Lazar Kaganovich {{to solve}} the railway crisis in 1935. Kaganovich first prioritised {{bottleneck}} areas over other less-traveled areas; his second priority was investing in heavy traffic lines, and thirdly, the least efficient areas of the rail network were left to themselves. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> facing rail transport was the massive industrialisation efforts pushed on by the authorities. The industrialisation {{proved to be a}} heavy burden on the railways, and Vyacheslav Molotov and Kaganovich even admitted this to the 18th party congress. Even so, the Soviet Government continued their industrialisation efforts to better prepare themselves for a future war with Germany, which became reality in 1941.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{bought an}} example of, and plans for, the {{machinery}} of the later Duca d'Aosta-class cruisers and had some difficulty in adapting the smaller hull for the larger and more-powerful machinery, {{so much so that}} it delayed the start of construction. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> was that the Italian design had to be adapted to use the Soviet preference for a mix of longitudinal framing for the hull framing amidships and transverse framing for the ends, while also reinforcing the hull structure to withstand the more-severe weather conditions that the Soviets commonly encountered.|$|E

5|$|The state {{constitution}} had come under considerable criticism {{beginning in the}} 1840s because it allowed most government positions to be filled by appointment. The problem with this method of filling positions did not manifest itself until {{the advent of the}} state's political parties. Once in power, a party could stack the government with its own members, making it difficult for the minority to regain power. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> was that the authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities. For example, if a man was to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before he or she could legally remarry.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{financial}} position was poor. Supporters of the dictatorship attempted to block progress on reforming the economy. The {{redistribution of wealth}} supported by the new government seemed {{a threat to the}} richest, in light of the recent Wall Street Crash and the onset of the Great Depression. The government attempted to tackle the dire poverty in rural areas by instituting an eight-hour day and giving the security of tenure to farm workers. Landlords complained. The effectiveness of the reforms was dependent on the skill of the local governance, which was often badly lacking. Changes to the military were needed and education reform was <b>another</b> <b>problem</b> facing the Republic. The relationship between central government and the Basque and Catalan regions also needed to be decided.|$|E
5|$|The two commanders {{believed}} that training by both airborne troops and aircrews could {{be completed by}} the end of February, when there would be suitable meteorological conditions for such an operation to take place.
