40|$|Replacing <b>associated</b> {{consistency}} in Hamiache's axiom system by dual similar <b>associated</b> consistency, we axiomatize the Shapley value as the unique value verifying the inessential game property, continuity and dual similar <b>associated</b> consistency. Continuing the matrix analysis for Hamiache's axiomatization of the Shapley value, we construct the dual similar <b>associated</b> game and introduce the dual similar <b>associated</b> transformation matrix M_λ^DSh as well. In the game theoretic framework {{we show that}} the dual game of the dual similar <b>associated</b> game is Hamiache's <b>associated</b> game of the dual game. For the purpose of matrix analysis, we derive the similarity relationship M_λ^DSh=QM_λ Q^- 1 between the dual similar <b>associated</b> transformation matrix M_λ^DSh and <b>associated</b> transformation matrix M_λ for Hamiache's <b>associated</b> game, where the transformation matrix Q represents the duality operator on games. This similarity of matrices transfers <b>associated</b> {{consistency in}}to dual similar <b>associated</b> consistency, and also implies the inessential property for the limit game of the convergent sequence of repeated dual similar <b>associated</b> games. We conclude this paper with three tables summarizing all matrix results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Floating knee {{injuries}} are usually <b>associated</b> with other significant injuries. Do these injuries have implications on {{the management of}} the floating knee and the final outcome of patients? Our study aims to assess the implications of <b>associated</b> injuries in the management and final outcome of floating knee. Methods 29 patients with floating knees were assessed in our institution. A retrospective analysis of medical records and radiographs were done and all <b>associated</b> injuries were identified. The impact of <b>associated</b> injuries on delay in initial surgical management, delay in rehabilitation & final outcome of the floating knee were assessed. Results 38 <b>associated</b> injuries were noted. 7 were <b>associated</b> with ipsilateral knee injuries. Lower limb injuries were most commonly <b>associated</b> with the floating knee. Patients with some <b>associated</b> injuries had a delay in surgical management and others a delay in post-operative rehabilitation. Knee ligament and vascular injuries were <b>associated</b> with poor outcome. Conclusion The <b>associated</b> injuries were quite frequent with the floating knee. Some of the <b>associated</b> injuries caused a delay in surgical management and post-operative rehabilitation. In assessment of the final outcome, patients with <b>associated</b> knee and vascular injuries had a poor prognosis. Majority of the patients with <b>associated</b> injuries had a good or excellent outcome. </p...|$|R
