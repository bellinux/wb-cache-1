In the moving receiver case, the dwell time on target is defined by the receiving <b>antenna</b> <b>beam</b> <b>width</b> and the speed of the receiving platform. This is because GNSS satellites have a wide antenna footprint on the ground which is enough to illuminate the same area on the ground for hours with an almost constant power density. Typically, dwell times are in the order of 30 – 40 s, and over this interval the satellite’s trajectory may be approximated as a straight line. In addition, due to the much closer proximity of the receiver to the imaging scene, image resolution in the azimuth direction is predominantly defined by the relative motion of the receiver relative to the imaging area, while the contribution of the transmitter’s motion is almost negligible [13].|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Availability is a {{critical}} requirement in any modern information system. For many classes of sensor networks, random deployment cannot be avoided and the associated wireless network connectivity characteristics significantly impact system availability. A highly available network {{must be able to}} sustain services such as data gathering and event-detection even during link losses owing to reasons that include intermittent interference and network attacks. Improved availability is often achieved by rerouting the traffic along alternative paths. Accordingly, k-connectivity is a key property of highly available networks. In this paper, we analyze k-connectivity of hybrid wireless networks that incorporate both omniand sectorized uni-directional antennas. We present results that help understand the relationship between node density, transmission radius, <b>antenna</b> <b>beam</b> <b>width</b> and the existence of disjoint paths between the network’s member nodes and a sink. Analytical and simulation-based results are provided to motivate the use of this emerging paradigm.

The ERS- 1, JERS- 1, RadarSAT and NASA’s Mission to Planet Earth projects are designed to study the changing global environment. In all these endeavors, the key instrument is the radar or scatterometer. The advantage of microwave radar {{is that it is}} hindered very little by clouds, fog or solar radiation. Polarimetrie sensors like the shuttle-borne SIR-C radar, provides additional information compared to single polarization systems. Correct interpretation of polarimetrie data necessitates proper understanding of the scattering mechanism. Thus theory of polarization synthesis is discussed. Solution to the Kennaugh eigenvalue problem for point targets is derived. Polarimetrie signatures of point targets are shown as surfaces of spherical co-ordinates based on the Poincare sphere. Statistics of the covariance matrix elements for distributed targets are presented. The main topic of this research report is the design and development of a multifrequency, polarimetrie scatterometer for biosphere remote sensing. The system was developed using a standard HP network analyzer, a crossed log-periodic dipole antenna and a reflector. The scatterometer functions in a linear polarization basis between the L- and X-bands and gathers full-polarimetric information. The standard S-parameter measurements using the network analyzer were related to surface and volume scattering coefficients of rough surface, snow cover and vegetation media. The scatterometer measurements were carried out in the frequency domain to make use of narrow band filters in the receiver chain. The fast Fourier transform was used to convert the frequency domain measurements to the time domain. The range resolution of the system was 20 cm; azimuthal and elevation resolutions are determined by the <b>antenna</b> <b>beam</b> <b>widths.</b> Range side lobes were reduced by making use of appropriate weighting (Kaiser-Bessel window) functions. In the process of receiver design, we developed a number of signal processing techniques which are illustrated using appropriate numerical examples. The accuracy of target characterization depends on the quality of scatterometer calibration. A novel technique to estimate the absolute gain and crosstalk of the radar system was developed. Using a distortion matrix approach, the cross-polarization response of the system was improved by 10 to 25 dB. The radar measurements were validated by comparing point target radar observations with the corresponding theoretical values. Also, measurements of fading decorrelation distance and decorrelation bandwidth of rough surfaces were in good agreement with the theory. Backscatter observations of vegetation and snow cover were comparable to earlier published values for a similar environment. Based on initial test results and operations capability, we propose to use the present scatterometer for ground-truthing in support of ERS- 1 missions. Direct comparisons of electromagnetic backscatter coefficients are possible between the ERS- 1 and the present scatterometer. These joint studies are beneficial for developing inverse scattering techniques, designing new experiments and calibrating ERS- 1 radar systems for distributed target environments. Diss.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} the <b>beam</b> <b>width</b> evolution of astigmatic hollow Gaussian beams propagating in highly nonlocal nonlinear media. The input-power-induced different evolutions of the <b>beam</b> <b>width</b> are illustrated: (i) the <b>beam</b> <b>widths</b> in two transverse directions are compressed or broadened {{at the same}} time; (ii) the <b>beam</b> <b>width</b> in one transverse direction keeps invariant, {{and the other is}} compressed or broadened; (iii) furthermore, the <b>beam</b> <b>width</b> in one transverse direction is compressed, whereas it in the other transverse direction is broadened...|$|R
