Curcumin has antioxidant and <b>anticonvulsant</b> <b>activities,</b> therefore this <b>study</b> was conducted to assess involvement of Bax and Bcl 2 in protective effect of curcumin in epileptic rats. Methods: 28 rats were divided into sham, curcumin-pretreated sham, epileptic (kainate), and curcumin-pretreated epileptic groups. Experimental model of epilepsy was induced by intrahippocampal administration of kainic acid. Rats received curcumin at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Finally, Nissl staining and Bax and Bcl 2 immunohistochemistry were conducted on hippocampal sections and {{data were analyzed using}} one-way ANOVA and unpaired t-test. The p-value less than 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Induction of epilepsy was followed by a significant seizure and curcumin pretreatment significantly reduced seizure intensity (p< 0. 01).

Cordierite supported Fe-BEA samples were exposed to 10 or 50 ppm H 3 PO 4 for 14, 24 and 48 h in a continuous gas flow reactor at 350 C. The catalytic activity of the samples was studied by NH 3 - and NO-oxidation, NH 3 inhibition and NH 3 -SCR experiments. The phosphorous exposed samples were further characterized by NH 3 - and NO-TPD, XPS and XRD. The results from the <b>activity</b> <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> {{that the degree of}} deactivation due to phosphorous exposure is strongly dependent on the exposure time, while the rate of deactivation is the same for exposure with 10 and 50 ppm H 3 PO 4. The XPS results show that primarily phosphorous pentoxides (P 2 O 5) are formed after short time of phosphorous exposure while longer time of exposure results in formation of metaphosphates (PO 3 -). The relative amount of metaphosphates after 48 h of H 3 PO 4 exposure was about 45 % compared to phosphorous pentoxides. The storage capacity of NO was shown to decrease with increasing relative amount of metaphosphates. The <b>activity</b> <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> that longer time of phosphorous exposure results in significantly decreased activity indicating that the active iron species are very sensitive to phosphorous forming metaphosphates. We suggest that metaphosphates replace the hydroxyl groups on the active iron species in Fe-BEA as the main mechanism for the decreased activity for NH 3 -SCR in connection with phosphorous exposure. Furthermore, the NH 3 inhibition experiments show that the increased amount of strongly bound ammonia due to phosphorous exposure does not contribute to buffer the active iron sites with ammonia during transient SCR conditions...|$|R

Results: The preliminary phytochemical screening carried out on the crude ethanol extract revealed the presence of saponins, carbohydrates, flavonoids, tannins, anthraquinones and steroids. Similarly, tannins, flavonoids and steroids/terpenes were found to be present in the ethyl acetate fraction. In the pharmacological screening, 150 mg/kg of the fraction protected 83. 33 % of animals against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure in mice whereas sodium valproate a standard anti-epileptic drug offered 100 % protection. In the 4 -aminopyridine-induced seizure model, the fraction produced a significant (P< 0. 05) increase in the mean onset of seizure in unprotected animals.
