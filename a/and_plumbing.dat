5|$|Caligula had {{two large}} ships {{constructed}} for himself (which were {{recovered from the}} bottom of Lake Nemi around 1930). The ships were among the largest vessels in the ancient world. The smaller ship was designed as a temple dedicated to Diana. The larger ship was essentially an elaborate floating palace with marble floors <b>and</b> <b>plumbing.</b> Thirteen years after being raised, the ships were burned during an attack in the Second World War, and almost nothing remains of their hulls, though many archaeological treasures remain intact in the museum at Lake Nemi and in the Museo Nazionale Romano (Palazzo Massimo) at Rome.|$|E
5|$|The major {{applications}} of copper are electrical wire (60%), roofing <b>and</b> <b>plumbing</b> (20%), and industrial machinery (15%). Copper is used mostly as a pure metal, but when greater hardness is required, it {{is put into}} such alloys as brass and bronze (5% of total use). For more than two centuries, copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and shellfish. A {{small part of the}} copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture. Machining of copper is possible, although alloys are preferred for good machinability in creating intricate parts.|$|E

Rails for the line had arrived and were being stored in the station cavern; {{about one-third of the}} rails for the line had arrived by then, enough for tracks to be laid from 105th to 87th Streets. By spring 2014, the mezzanine was completed, and roof slabs were being installed; tracks and signal brackets were also installed north of the station. By April 2015, the station was 67% complete, and by April 2016, the station was 91% complete. The station was scheduled to be completed by June 2016, but this was later pushed back to fall 2016.|$|E

5|$|The Winslow Ames House is a {{prefabricated}} modular International Style {{house in}} New London, Connecticut, United States. It {{was designed by}} Robert W. McLaughlin, Jr. and was built in 1933. Winslow Ames, a professor of art history at Connecticut College and the art director of the Lyman Allyn Museum, had the home built after attending the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. Constructed for $7,500, the prefabricated house {{is one of two}} surviving Motohomes produced by McLaughlin's company American Houses Inc. The modular house, comprising three rectangles and a flat roof, was constructed on a concrete slab with a welded steel framework. It was made with asbestos panels and features a core component that provides the heating <b>and</b> <b>plumbing</b> functions for the house. The other two modules feature two bedrooms and a one-car garage.|$|E
5|$|To {{overcome}} elevator issues, {{the tower}} will use its {{large number of}} efficient elevators {{as well as its}} three sky lobbies, which allows transfers to be made between elevators serving a specific area with no elevator being overburdened. Much was learned from Burj Khalifa that helped with the design of Jeddah Tower not only structurally, but in methods for designing practical mechanical, electrical, <b>and</b> <b>plumbing</b> (MEP) systems, as well as adhering to local regulations and international building codes. Despite all the physical challenges, Adrian Smith states that practicality is still the greater challenge over structural durability, even in such super-tall designs, and that as with all buildings, Jeddah Tower's form was primarily derived respective of what the building's uses would be, then in accordance with the structural factors {{that would have to be}} considered to deliver it.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 News International owner Rupert Murdoch caused {{controversy}} when {{he moved}} publication of The Times and The Sun away from Fleet Street to new premises in Wapping, East London. Murdoch believed {{it was impossible to}} produce a newspaper profitably on Fleet Street {{and the power of the}} print unions, the National Graphical Association (NGA) and the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT), was too strong (an opinion endorsed by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher). All Fleet Street print staff were sacked and new staff from the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications <b>and</b> <b>Plumbing</b> Union were brought in to operate the presses at Wapping using modern computer-operated technology, rendering the power of the old unions obsolete. The resulting Wapping dispute featured violent protests at Fleet Street and Wapping that lasted over a year, but ultimately other publishers followed suit and moved out of Fleet Street towards Canary Wharf or Southwark. Reuters was the last major news outlet to leave Fleet Street in 2005. The same year, The Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph announced they were returning to the centre of London from Canary Wharf to new premises in Victoria in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Renovation {{began in}} 1994 under the {{direction}} of architect Gerhard Spangenberg, with the objective of returning the building so far as possible to its original condition while not ignoring the events of the more recent past. The first priority was the removal of iron girders, particle board, and chipboards. Relics of the GDR period deemed worthy of preservation were placed either in the Museum of German History in the former Prussian arsenal or in the House of History in Bonn. The original murals and reliefs, painted over and enclosed during the GDR period, were then restored. The fountain in the Klosterstraße vestibule was accurately recreated. Four bronze bear sculptures by Ignatius Taschner were returned from the Märkisches Museum and reinstalled on replacement stone columns in the Judenstraße vestibule. Exterior restoration of the building required either restoration or replacement with replicas of some 180 sculptural elements from the tower, including the allegorical figures of the virtues, giant vases, window embrasures, and one of the columns, which had bomb damage and had merely been patched. In addition, the original mansard roof was reconstructed in 1998/99 on the west, main facade facing Jüdenstraße. The technical facilities were also updated, including ventilation equipment, elevators, lighting, <b>and</b> <b>plumbing.</b> It proved impossible to use the tower for offices because it lacked the second exit required by safety regulations. This was later rectified by the addition of office space in the roof cavity.|$|E

40|$|We pooled the {{mechanical}} probe data from two experiments to develop regression equations to predict beef longissimus tenderness. Fifty-three USDA Select strip loins were evaluated at 2 days postmortem with three mechanical probes to predict trained sensory panel (TSP) tenderness and Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) of cooked steaks aged 14 days. The sharp needle, sharp blade, <b>and</b> <b>plumb</b> bob probes were correlated to TSP tenderness (r=- 0. 51, - 0. 45, and - 0. 35, respectively) and WBSF (r= 0. 56, 0. 53, and 0. 36, respectively). Regression equations developed from sharp needle, sharp blade, <b>and</b> <b>plumb</b> bob probe measurements and L* (lightness) values accounted for 49, 50, and 47 % {{of the variation}} in TSP tenderness. The predicted values of equations were also used to classify the strips as tough or tender, and this classification was compared to the actual TSP tenderness classification. Of the steaks predicted to be tender by the equations using the sharp needle, sharp blade, <b>and</b> <b>plumb</b> bob probes <b>and</b> WBSF 88, 88, 84, and 87 %, respectively, were actually tender according to TSP. The sharp needle, sharp blade, <b>and</b> <b>plumb</b> bob probe prediction equations were comparable to WBSF in classifying carcasses into sensory panel determined tenderness groups, and they were superior to WBSF in simplicity and cost...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{mechanical force}} measurements on uncooked longissimus muscle {{as a means}} to predict Warner- Bratzler shear force (WBSF) and trained sensory panel tenderness (SPT) of cooked strip loin steaks. Uncooked steaks from 24 USDA Select strip loins (IMPS 180) were evaluated at 2 and 14 days postmortem using <b>plumb</b> bob <b>and</b> needle probe devices attached to an Instron Universal Testing Machine. Cooked steaks aged 14 days were then evaluated for WBSF and SPT. Regression models to predict SPT from needle probe <b>and</b> <b>plumb</b> bob measurements individually taken at 2 days postmortem had R 2 of 0. 54 and 0. 51, respectively. Combining needle probe <b>and</b> <b>plumb</b> bob measurements resulted in an R 2 of 0. 76; however, when quadratic terms for both variables were in the model, R 2 was 0. 80. Regressing needle probe <b>and</b> <b>plumb</b> bob measurements at 2 days postmortem with WBSF produced R 2 of 0. 51 and 0. 45, respectively. When linear terms of both probes were combined, R 2 improved to 0. 77. An equation to predict WBSF including both the linear and quadratic terms of needle probe <b>and</b> <b>plumb</b> bob measurements resulted in R 2 of 0. 84. Using <b>plumb</b> bob <b>and</b> needle probe combined on uncooked longissimus muscle at 2 days postmortem can predict cooked WBSF and SPT of strip loin steaks aged for 14 days...|$|R
