2500|$|The three color {{records are}} stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top {{to keep the}} {{non-visible}} ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light. [...] Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image. [...] When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color. [...] This forms a dye [...] "cloud" [...] (like {{a drop of water}} on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue). [...] There are two layers to each color; a [...] "fast" [...] and a [...] "slow." [...] The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light. [...] Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are {{on the top of the}} film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure. [...] Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed. [...] Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the film base is an <b>anti-halation</b> <b>layer</b> that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is [...] "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.|$|E
50|$|Black-and-white {{infrared}} negative {{films are}} sensitive to wavelengths in the 700 to 900 nm near infrared spectrum, and most also have a sensitivity to blue light wavelengths. The notable halation effect or glow often seen in the highlights of infrared photographs is an artifact of Kodak High Speed Infrared (HIE) black-and-white negative film and not an artifact of infrared light. The glow or blooming {{is caused by the}} absence of an <b>anti-halation</b> <b>layer</b> on the back side of Kodak HIE film, this results in a scattering or blooming around the highlights that would usually be absorbed by the <b>anti-halation</b> <b>layer</b> in conventional films.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lack of an}} <b>anti-halation</b> <b>layer</b> in Kodak's High Speed Infrared film (HIE) (HIE) is {{the cause}} of the {{ethereal}} [...] "glowing" [...] effect often associated with infrared photography, rather than an artifact of IR itself.|$|E
5000|$|The {{acetic acid}} that is {{released}} in cellulose acetate negatives can trigger the retrieval {{of the color}} dyes in the backing layer, known as the <b>anti-halation</b> <b>layer,</b> giving the negative a blue or pink appearance. This is irreversible.|$|E
50|$|The <b>anti-halation</b> <b>layer</b> is {{rendered}} transparent or washed out during processing of the film, for example, the K-14 process for Kodachrome still film and the ECN2 process for color motion picture film both have steps which remove this layer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prominent}} blooming or [...] "glow" [...] {{often seen}} in the highlights of infrared photographs is an artifact of HIE and not of infrared light itself (nor even of all IR-sensitive films). This is because although conventional photographic films have an <b>anti-halation</b> <b>layer</b> that absorbs scattered light, HIE lacks this backing.|$|E
5000|$|An {{anti-halation backing}} is a layer {{found in most}} {{photographic}} films. It is usually a coating {{on the back of}} the film base, but sometimes it is incorporated between the light-sensitive emulsion and the base. The light that passes through the emulsion is absorbed by the <b>anti-halation</b> <b>layer.</b> This prevents any light from being reflected back through the emulsion from the rear surface of the base, or from anything behind the film, such as the pressure plate of the camera, and causing a halo-like effect around bright points or edges in the image.|$|E
