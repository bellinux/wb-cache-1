50|$|Ebalzotan (NAE-086) is a {{selective}} 5-HT1A receptor agonist. It was under development as an antidepressant and <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> but produced undesirable side effects in phase I clinical trials and was subsequently discontinued.|$|E
5000|$|Tranylcypromine (INN, USAN, BAN; {{original}} {{trade name}} Parnate, generic for decades) [...] is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) â€” it is a nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). It {{is used as}} an antidepressant and <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> in the clinical treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Condensation of 4-Acetylpyridine with N,N-Dimethylformamide {{dimethyl}} acetal (DMFDMA) gives the [...] "enamide" [...] (3). This is then condensed with (3-Amino-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)(2-pyridinyl)methanone (4) (96219-90-8). This {{is the same}} intermediate as {{was used in the}} synthesis of zaleplon in which the nitrile is replaced by a 2-acetylpyridil moiety. This affords the <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> ocinaplon (5).|$|E
50|$|An {{anxiogenic}} or panicogenic {{substance is}} one that causes anxiety. This effect {{is in contrast to}} <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents,</b> which inhibits anxiety. Together these categories of psychoactive compounds may be referred to as anxiotropic compounds.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents</b> are minor tranquilizers, the {{founding}} compound {{of which was}} meprobamate, marketed in the United States as Miltown. Meprobamate was eventually eclipsed by the benzodiazepines. The target of both categories of anxiotropic compounds is the GABAA receptor.|$|R
50|$|Use of {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., sertraline) {{is a common}} cause of medication-induced secondary hyperhidrosis. Other medications associated with secondary hyperhidrosis include tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glyburide, insulin, <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents,</b> adrenergic agonists, and cholinergic agonists.|$|R
50|$|Clovoxamine (INN) (developmental {{code name}} DU-23811) {{is a drug}} that was {{discovered}} in the 1970s and was subsequently investigated as an antidepressant and <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> but was never marketed. It acts as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), with little affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine, histamine, adrenergic, and serotonin receptors. The compound is structurally related to fluvoxamine.|$|E
50|$|Pagoclone is an <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> {{from the}} cyclopyrrolone family, related to better-known {{drugs such as}} the {{sleeping}} medication zopiclone. It was synthesized by a French team working for Rhone-Poulenc & Rorer S.A. Pagoclone belongs to the class of nonbenzodiazepines, which have similar effects to the older benzodiazepine group, but with quite different chemical structures. It was never commercialised.|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} of this experiment {{can be modified}} depending on the behavior being measured. To examine anxiety a single animal {{is placed in the}} apparatus for five minutes where it is observed and then removed. Another animal that has been injected with an <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> is then placed in the apparatus and then observed. Increased dose of anxiolytics leads to sedation.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the root}} cause of anxiety is {{idiopathic}} animal models are difficult to create and therefore flawed. But because changes are seen through administration of <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents,</b> they are pharmacologically proven. In the HBT studies show inconsistent results when administrating known anti-anxiety medication such as benzodiazepines.|$|R
40|$|Mindfulness-based stress {{reduction}} (MBSR), cognitive-behavioral {{stress reduction}} (CBSR), and somatic relaxation are all effective therapies for psychosocial stress. Exercise also reduces stress and improves mental health (SOR B, based on small randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). <b>Anxiolytic</b> <b>agents</b> and antidepressants {{may be used}} in refractory cases.

40|$|Some common {{aspects of}} the misuse of psychotropic drugs are {{discussed}} {{against the background of}} disparate development of psychiatric and medical sciences. Particular attention is granted the <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents,</b> antidepressants, and neuroleptic drugs, and the related psychiatric conditions are considered correspondingly. Popular errors in applying psychiatric medication are thus discussed with their adverse consequences...|$|R
50|$|Lometraline (INN; codenamed CP-14,368) {{is a drug}} {{which is}} an aminotetralin derivative. A {{structural}} modification of the investigative neuroleptic pinoxepin, lometraline was originally patented by Pfizer as an antipsychotic, tranquilizer, and antiparkinsonian agent (likely as an anticholinergic). However, it was instead later studied as a potential antidepressant and/or <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent,</b> but clinical studies revealed no psychoactivity at the doses used and further investigation was suspended. However, further experimental modifications of the chemical structure of lometraline directly resulted in the discovery of tametraline, a potent inhibitor of the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, which in turn led {{to the discovery of}} the now widely popular antidepressant sertraline, which, remarkably, acts contrarily as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).|$|E
50|$|Pinazepam {{differs from}} other benzodiazepines {{in that it}} has a {{propargyl}} group at the N-1 position of the benzodiazepine structure. It is less toxic than diazepam and in animal studies it appears to produce anxiolytic and anti-agitation properties with limited hypnotic and motor coordination impairing properties. Pinazepam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The main active metabolites of pinazepam are depropargylpinazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam, nordazepam) and oxazepam. In humans pinazepam acts as a pure <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> in that it does not possess to any significant degree the other pharmacological characteristics of benzodiazepines. Its lack of intellectual, motor and hypnotic impairing effects makes it more appropriate than other benzodiazepines for day time use. The elimination half-life is longer in the elderly.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} starts by {{conversion of}} the pyridine dicarboxylic acid (1) to its acid chloride; rxn with MeOH then affords the ester (2). Catalytic hydrogenation serves to reduce the pyridine ring to a piperidine of undefined stereochemistry (3). Alkylation of this intermediate with chloroacetonitrile affords (4). Treatment of that intermediate with Raney nickel reduces the cyano group to the corresponding primary amine; this product then undergoes an internal ester-amine interchange to yield the cyclized lactam (5). LAH serves to reduce the lactam to an amine; the ester on the other ring is reduced to a carbinol in the process, affording the aminoalcohol (7). The basic function is next alkylated with 2-chloropyrimidine (7). Rxn of the alcoholin (8) with MsCl leads to the mesylate; that group is next displaced by sodium azide (9); the azide group is next reduced to the primary amine. Resolution of this product as its mandelate salt then yields (10) as a single enantiomer. Rxn of that product with succinic anhydride converts the pendant amine to a succinimide, affording the <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> sunepitron (1).|$|E
40|$|Substance P (neurokinin- 1 [NK 1]) {{receptor}} antagonists {{appear to}} be effective antidepressant and <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents,</b> as indicated in 3 double-blind clinical trials. In laboratory animals, they promptly attenuate the responsiveness of serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine [5 -HT]) and norepinephrine (NE) neurons to agonists of their cell-body autoreceptors, {{as is the case}} for some antidepressant drugs that are currently in clinical use. Long-term, but not subacute, antagonism of NK 1 receptors in rats increases 5 -HT transmission in the hippocampus, a property common to all antidepressant treatments tested thus far. This enhancement seems to be mediated by a time-dependent increase in the firing rate of 5 -HT neurons. Mice with the NK 1 receptor deleted from their genetic code also have an increased firing rate of 5 -HT neurons. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that NK 1 antagonists could become a new class of antidepressant and <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
25|$|Both {{amphotericin}} B and doxorubicin {{have been}} investigated as potentially effective against CJD, but as {{yet there is no}} strong evidence that either drug is effective in stopping the disease. Further study has been taken with other medical drugs, but none are effective. However, anticonvulsants and <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents,</b> such as valproate or a benzodiazepine, may be administered to relieve associated symptoms.|$|R
50|$|Azapirone-type drugs (e.g., buspirone), which act as 5-HT1A {{receptor}} agonists {{and partial}} agonists {{have been developed}} as <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents</b> that are not associated with the dependence and side-effect profile of the benzodiazepines. The hippocampal neurogenesis produced by various types of antidepressants, likewise, {{is thought to be}} mediated by 5-HT1A receptors. Systemic administration of a 5-HT1A agonist also induces growth hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release through actions in the hypothalamus.|$|R
5000|$|Flumexadol (INN) (developmental {{code name}} CERM-1841 or 1841-CERM) {{is a drug}} {{described}} and researched as a non-opioid analgesic which was never marketed. It {{has been found to}} act as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A (pKi = 7.1) and 5-HT2C (pKi = 7.5) receptors and, to a much lesser extent, of the 5-HT2A (pKi = 6.0) receptor. According to Nilsson (2006) in a paper on 5-HT2C receptor agonists as potential anorectics, [...] "The (+)-enantiomer of this compound showed ... affinity for the 5-HT2C receptor (Ki) 25 nM) ... and was 40-fold selective over the 5-HT2A receptor in receptor binding studies. Curiously, the racemic version ..., also known as 1841 CERM, was originally reported to possess analgesic properties while no association with 5-HT2C receptor activity was mentioned." [...] It is implied that flumexadol might be employable as an anorectic in addition to analgesic. Though flumexadol itself has never been approved for medical use, oxaflozane (brand name Conflictan) is a prodrug of the compound that was formerly used clinically in France as an antidepressant and <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo study {{anxiolytic}} {{property of}} hydro alchohol extract and to estimate polyphenols {{present in the}} extract by HPLC. MethodsTo evaluate anxiolytic property two animal models were used viz. Elevated T maze and hyponeophagia. Diazepam (1 mg/kg body wt.) served as the standard <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> for all the tests. The dried extract of the plant leaf in doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight was administered orally to mice for duration of 15 or 30 days and locomotor and anxiolytic activities were performed. Polyphenols was estimated using HPLC. ResultsThe HPLC analysis of the polyphenols revealed the presence chlorogenic acid, vanillin, epicatechin, caffeic acid, rutin hydrate, sinapic acid, quercetin- 3 -rhamnoside, p-coumeric acid and quercitin. Time spent and number of entries into the open arm was improved in 30 days treated animals than that of 15 days treated groups, 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight treated group showed significant results when comparing with the control group. ConclusionsThe hydro alcohol extract rich in Polyphenols and other secondary metabolites is a potent <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Increased anxiety {{correlates}} with increased complications after acute myocardial infarction. Anxiety levels {{and use of}} anxiolytic agents have not been compared between smokers and nonsmokers hospitalized because of acute myocardial infarction. â€¢ OBJECTIVES To compare anxiety level, sociodemographic factors, and clinical variables between smokers and nonsmokers hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction and to examine predictors of use of Î²-blockers and anxiolytic agents among smokers and nonsmokers. â€¢ METHODS Secondary data analysis of a prospective multisite study on anxiety in 181 smokers and 351 nonsmokers with acute myocardial infarction. Anxiety was measured by using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the anxiety subscale of the Basic Symptom Inventory within 72 hours of admission. â€¢ RESULTS Smokers reported higher anxiety levels than nonsmokers reported on both anxiety scales. Female smokers reported the highest anxiety and peak pain levels of all, yet women were {{the least likely to}} receive anxiolytic agents. Smoking status was not a predictor for anxiety level when sex, peak pain, use of Î²-blockers in the hospital, and age were controlled for. However, smokers were twice as likely as nonsmokers to receive an <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> and 60 % more likely to receive a Î²-blocker in the emergency department, and smokers were 80 % more likely than nonsmokers to receive an <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> durin...|$|E
40|$|Withdrawal of <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents</b> such as ethanol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines {{may result}} in a {{syndrome}} characterised in its most severe form by delirium and seizures. There is increasing evidence that anxiolytic drugs produce their pharmacological effects by enhancing brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission. During long-term exposure to anxiolytics, brain GABA synapses show evidence of adaptive changes which would tend to reduce the effect of the anxiolytic and restore normal GABA function. Abrupt cessation of anxiolytic treatment might therefore lead to an acute reduction in GABA function; this change could underlie the severe symptoms associated with tranquilliser withdrawal...|$|R
50|$|Hydroxyzine is {{prescribed}} {{when the}} onset of an organic disease state manifests through anxiety, as generalized anxiety disorder, or in other more serious cases as psychoneurosis, and is therefore prescribed {{as a means of}} regulating normal function. Hydroxyzine has shown to be as effective as the benzodiazepine drug bromazepam in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. However, a systematic review concluded that compared with other <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents</b> (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability, however there is insufficient evidence to recommend it as a treatment for generalised anxiety disorder due to bias in the reviewed studies.|$|R
40|$|Powerful {{behavioural}} {{treatments for}} many patients with anxiety disorders {{have been widely}} available since the 1970 s. Despite this, the majority of such patients have continued {{to be treated with}} psychotrophic drugs. Recent litigation against the manufacturers of benzodiazepine drugs has made the public increasingly concerned about the prescription of <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents.</b> In parallel with the fall in popularity of drug treatment, advances have been made which increase the availability and applicability of behavioural treatments for these patients. This paper examines the impact of the development of self-exposure and cognitive methods on a number of common anxiety syndromes. Clinical examples of self-exposure are given to demonstrate the simplicity of the technique...|$|R
30|$|The forced-swim {{test was}} {{performed}} essentially {{according to the}} procedures described by Porsolt et al. (1977). The apparatus consisted of a plexiglass cylinder (26.6 cm in height and 12 cm in diameter) filled with water (25 Â°C) up to a height of 15 cm. Mice were placed individually into the cylinder, and their behavior was recorded by video camera for 10 min. Chlordiazepoxide, <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent,</b> did not affected the duration of immobility even in doses which produced noticeable ataxia, indicating this test does not reflect anxiety (Porsolt et al. 1978).|$|E
40|$|T he use {{of herbal}} {{medications}} has increasedtremendously in recent years; however, herbalmedications are not necessarily safe or effec-tive.

This article will examine {{three of the most}} com-monly used herbal medicationsâ€”St. Johnâ€™s wort, echinacea, and ginkgo bilobaâ€”focusing on therapeutic uses, safety issues, and drug interactions. ST.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the effect of}} pregabalin (previously S-Isobutylgaba and CI- 1008) in two distinct rat models of anxiety. Pregabalin binds with high affinity and selectivity to the Î± 2 Î´ subunit of voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCC). Its corresponding R-enantiomer (R-isobutylgaba) is approximately 10 fold weaker. Pregabalin dose-dependently induced anxiolytic-like effects in both the rat conflict test and elevated X-maze with respective minimum effective doses (MED) of 3 and 10 [*]mg[*]kgâˆ’ 1. In contrast, R-isobutylgaba only showed activity at the highest dose of 100 [*]mg[*]kgâˆ’ 1 in the conflict test. These data indicate that pregabalin may possess clinical utility as a novel <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> and demonstrates {{the importance of the}} Î± 2 Î´ subunit of VDCC in the mediation of anxiety related behaviours...|$|E
40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} translocator protein (TSPO) mediates {{the synthesis}} of neurosteroids in the CNS, which have been demonstrated to enhance the neurotransmitter GABA response, exhibiting related behavioural properties. Selective TSPO ligands are able to stimulate steroidogenesis with great efficacy, thus representing potential <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents.</b> This review describes {{the development of a}} class of high affinity ligands to TSPO, N,N-dialkylindol- 3 -ylglyoxylamides (IGA), from the initial stages of design to the pharmacological characterization of selected compounds for their anxiolytic activity. Affinity data and SARs of the new class of ligands are discussed; the potential applications of compounds characterized by the indolylglyoxylyl scaffold in diagnostic imaging are also pointed out...|$|R
50|$|While {{some of the}} listed {{properties}} such as 5-HT2A and D2 blockade may {{be useful}} in certain indications such as in the treatment of schizophrenia (as with perospirone and tiospirone), all of them except 5-HT1A agonism are generally undesirable in anxiolytics and only contribute to side effects. As a result, further development has commenced to bring more selective of <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents</b> to the market. An example of this initiative is gepirone, which is currently in clinical trials in the United States for the treatment of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Another example is tandospirone which has been licensed in Japan for the treatment of anxiety and as an augmentation to antidepressants for depression.|$|R
25|$|Benzodiazepines all bind unselectively to the GABAA receptor. Some theorize {{that certain}} benzodiazepines (hypnotic benzodiazepines) have {{significantly}} higher {{activity at the}} Î±1 subunit of the GABAA receptor compared to other benzodiazepines (for example, triazolam and temazepam have significantly higher activity at the Î±1 subunit compared to alprazolam and diazepam, making them superior sedative-hypnoticsâ€“ alprazolam and diazepam, in turn, have higher activity at the Î±2 subunit compared to triazolam and temazepam, making them superior <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents).</b> Modulation of the Î±1 subunit is associated with sedation, motor impairment, respiratory depression, amnesia, ataxia, and reinforcing behavior (drug-seeking behavior). Modulation of the Î±2 subunit is associated with anxiolytic activity and disinhibition. For this reason, certain benzodiazepines may be better suited to treat insomnia than others.|$|R

Fenobam inhibited quisqualate-evoked intracellular calcium re-sponse mediated by human mGlu 5 receptor with IC 50 58 2 nM.

30|$|The NMDA-type {{glutamate}} receptor antagonist ketamine holds {{promise as}} a suitable anesthetic for GABAA receptor PET studies, as subanesthetic ketamine doses {{were shown to}} have minimal effect on [11 C]flumazenil binding in the human brain [32]. Furthermore, ketamine treatment did not increase interstitial GABA levels in an MR spectroscopy study in healthy humans [33], however, more recent studies showed increases in humans with obsessive compulsive disorder [34] and major depressive disorder [35]. The Î± 2 -adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine is an <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> often used to sedate children undergoing MRI scans [36]; however, synergistic interactions between Î± 2 -adrenergic agonists and benzodiazepine binding sites on GABAA receptors have been described [37]. For example, a pilot study in healthy humans showed that dexmedetomidine sedation evoked a slight (4.9 â€“ 6.0 %) increase in the grey matter binding potential (BPND) of [11 C]flumazenil [19].|$|E

Among many psychiatric disorders anxiety disorders, are the most dominant problems and about 10 â€“ 30 % of general population is suffering from these throughout the world [6]. Benzodiazepines are the most frequently prescribed synthetic drugs for their anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, sedative-hypnotic and anticonvulsant actions [7]. Not only impairment in cognitive functions, physical dependence and tolerance side effects, these psychoneural drugs also cause harmful effects on respiratory, digestive and immune systems of the body [5].

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that ethanol (EtOH) has a rel-atively specific effect on excitatory synaptic transmission by inhibiting function of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. We have found that EtOH potently inhibits N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated synaptic currents in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region associated with actions of <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents</b> such as EtOH. This inhibitory effect of EtOH requires the presence of magnesium (Mg 11). The dependence of the effect of EtOH on the presence of Mg 11 suggests a possible molecular site of the action of EtOH in the vicinity of Mg 11 binding sites on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-channel complex.
