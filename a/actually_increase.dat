5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may <b>actually</b> <b>increase</b> the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
5|$|Frog {{mutations}} {{and genetic}} defects have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes {{have been identified}} or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn {{on the surface of}} ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae. Probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An {{increase in the number of}} frogs eaten by birds may <b>actually</b> <b>increase</b> the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.|$|E
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not <b>actually</b> <b>increase</b> seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E

5|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is the {{simplest}} stable molecule {{with an odd}} number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, {{it is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not <b>actually</b> <b>increase</b> the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.|$|E

25|$|Cooperation {{in animals}} appears to occur mostly between relatives.

25|$|As {{with other}} very deep-chested breeds, gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus (also known as bloat) {{is the most}} common serious health problem in the borzoi.

25|$|Impurity {{concentrations}} can {{be controlled}} by crystal growth or direct addition of impurities to the crystal solutions. Although impurities in the silver bromide lattice are necessary to encourage Frenkel defect formation, studies by Hamilton have shown that above a specific concentration of impurities, the numbers of defects of interstitial silver ions and positive kinks reduce sharply by several orders of magnitude. After this point, only silver-ion vacancy defects, which <b>actually</b> <b>increase</b> by several orders of magnitude, are prominent.|$|E

In 2007, Laffer said that the curve should not be the sole basis for raising or lowering taxes.|$|E
25|$|The malaria {{parasite}} has {{a complex}} lifecycle and spends {{part of it}} in red blood cells. In a carrier, {{the presence of the}} malaria parasite causes the red blood cells with defective haemoglobin to rupture prematurely, making the Plasmodium parasite unable to reproduce. Further, the polymerization of Hb affects the ability of the parasite to digest Hb in the first place. Therefore, in areas where malaria is a problem, people's chances of survival <b>actually</b> <b>increase</b> if they carry sickle-cell trait (selection for the heterozygote).|$|E
25|$|Hypomania is the milder form of mania, {{defined as}} at least four days of the same {{criteria}} as mania, but does not cause {{a significant decrease in}} the individual's ability to socialize or work, lacks psychotic features such as delusions or hallucinations, and does not require psychiatric hospitalization. Overall functioning may <b>actually</b> <b>increase</b> during episodes of hypomania and is thought to serve as a defense mechanism against depression by some. Hypomanic episodes rarely progress to full blown manic episodes. Some people who experience hypomania show increased creativity while others are irritable or demonstrate poor judgment.|$|E

25|$|The immune {{responses}} of antibodies, {{that are trying}} to fight off the foreign virus, <b>actually</b> <b>increase</b> transmission and make the infection worse. Scientists found levels of protein D7 to be more prevalent in salivary glands of dengue-infected mosquitoes compared to those uninfected. D7 is found in mosquito saliva and was thought to assist the process of blood feeding. Despite the prior assumptions, D7 can modulate the host cell and act against the virus to prevent virus infection. Unfortunately D7 proteins provoke immune responses, which raise anti-D7 antibody levels. These antibodies inhibit the function of D7 proteins, which enhance transmission of dengue virus.|$|E
25|$|The estuary is shallow {{because of}} this {{constant}} deposition. Isostatic recoil is, however, causing the area to sink {{at the rate of}} 3mm annually and global warming is making the sea level rise. The combined effects of these processes mean that the sea in the estuary may be half a metre higher by the year 2050. A large area around the estuary consists of land which lies below the present high-water mark. Flood defences offer only a short-term and local answer and may <b>actually</b> <b>increase</b> the long-term risks. Managed realignment of the coast by setting back the coastal defences will provide new intertidal habitats and harness natural equalising processes and is the preferred long term solution.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of the Davis–Bacon Act {{contend that}} these costs {{differences}} either don't exist {{or may be}} justified. One contention is that higher paid labor may be paid more because they have superior skills and are more productive. Under this assumption, a union journeyman would be worth the additional money because he works faster, more accurately, and with less supervision than an inexperienced worker. For example, four union journeyman paid $25 per hour might perform as well as or better than five entry level workers being paid $20 per hour. Others point out that federal projects {{tend to be more}} complex and require more skilled labor than on either private or state projects. Yet another counterpoint is that by inflating wages, such requirements direct more income into the middle class rather than paying rock bottom dollars to unskilled labor through federal programs while supporting their families through social service programs. Finally, blogger Matthew Yglesias has suggested that because union workers tend to vote overwhelmingly Democratic, and because Democrats favor more federal projects, then Davis-Bacon may <b>actually</b> <b>increase</b> the amount of infrastructure built by supporting those who indirectly vote for more programs.|$|E
