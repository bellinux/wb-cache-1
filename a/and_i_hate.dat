500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> to say this, because it sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E

In January 2007, the band toured through Europe with Becoming the Archetype, and Shaped by Fate. By this time, yet another bass player had been recruitedJon [...] "KC Wolf" [...] Kindler. In April {{of the same}} year, after delays relating to lineup changes, their second album, The Fiancée, was released. [...] The record was produced by Matt Goldman. The writing and recording process had been driven by time constraints. [...] "It was actually a very easy record to write," [...] said Scogin, [...] "It came more naturally to us." [...] However, Scogin waited until the music was written before writing lyrics, an exercise he vowed never to attempt again. Hayley Williams of Paramore made a guest performance on the track [...] "Then Came To Kill" [...] as did Aaron Weiss of mewithoutYou when he played the harmonica on [...] "Forgive Me Nashville"; Scogin had been friends with both artists for many years. The Fiancée broke the Billboard 200it debuted at No.169, selling 6,800 copies and was well received in the Christian and secular markets. The group played a release tour with Misery Signals, I Am Ghost, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Hate</b> Sally, and then made a short run on the Warped Tour in summer. Another leg of The Fiancée Tour extended into spring 2008 with LoveHateHero, Alesana, Our Last Night, and Sky Eats Airplane. The lineup underwent another drastic change in mid-2008, as Jake Ryan, Dan Eaton and Jon Terry all decided to step down. Ryan and Eaton went on to form the indie pop band Queens Club and were signed to Tooth & Nail Records.|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, the Chick tract Unforgiven was {{distributed}} by Bible Baptist Church in Garden City, Roanoke, Virginia and drew outrage from the area's Muslim community. The tract {{tells the story}} of an African-American man who, while in prison, is coerced into joining the Islamic faith and changes his name to Muhammad. [...] Upon his release he threatens his Christian grandmother. Hussain Al-Shiblawi, a local man, told WDBJ-TV that he gets pamphlets from the church every Sunday and that they are typically inspirational, but that this one was different. “It basically indicated that the people are violent, the religion itself is violent, and the facts in here are not true,” he said. “It shows him trying to kill his mother saying, ‘If you weren’t my grandma, I’d kill you where you stand, Allahu Akbar.’” In one scene, the grandmother begs Lamont to return to the Christian faith, telling him he’ll “die in [...] sins” and be unforgiven by God if he doesn’t. But the young man isn’t swayed by her pleas. “I choose Muhammad! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> your Jesus, your Bible and you!,” he screams. “Get out of my house you infidel!” Bible Baptist Church said the church did not write the tract and simply distributed it.|$|E

2500|$|Vergne's {{right hand}} {{was injured in}} the {{collision}} with Piquet and required an X-ray scan after complaining {{he was unable to}} move it correctly.

Vergne stated that he would ensure that he was fit for the next race of the season in Paris but felt the incident [...] "destroyed" [...] his race in Monaco. He believed that the crash prevented him from finishing on the podium and chose not to speak to Piquet after the event ended. Piquet was annoyed at Vergne's attempts at overtaking him, labelling him [...] "impatient" [...] and felt he could have been easily passed during the pit stop phase. He thought Vergne would slow down because the latter was unwilling to be overtaken around the outside, and that Vergne had placed himself in that situation, deeming it [...] "unnecessary" [...] but felt it was a [...] "racing incident": [...] "It's a shame, I hate that it happened with him <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> these kinds of situations. I don't like bad feelings and I'm sure he's very upset and thinks I did it on purpose, but I was just going to defend my position."
