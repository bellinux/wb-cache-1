5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Real Madrid was widely seen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> the {{sovereign}} oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond: Santiago Bernabéu, the former club president for whom their stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War. During the Spanish Civil War, however, {{members of both}} clubs such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael Sánchez Guerra suffered {{at the hands of}} Franco supporters.|$|E

In the city, a huge tree grows 500 meters tall in three years, which contains the orb of light from Kotarou and Kagari. The five heroines, now in high school, investigate the tree {{as members of the}} occult research society and transform Kotarou into a familiar, but he refuses to do what they demand. Kotarou takes the girls to the Moon where they are shown circled around a seedling (<b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> the Moon's Kagari) sprouting on the otherwise barren regolith.|$|E

50|$|In Egypt, {{the bull}} was worshiped <b>as</b> Apis, <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> Ptah and later of Osiris. A {{long series of}} ritually perfect bulls were {{identified}} by the god's priests, housed in the temple for their lifetime, then embalmed and encased in a giant sarcophagus. A long sequence of monolithic stone sarcophagi were housed in the Serapeum, and were rediscovered by Auguste Mariette at Saqqara in 1851. The bull was also worshipped <b>as</b> Mnevis, <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> Atum-Ra, in Heliopolis. Ka in Egyptian is both a religious concept of life-force/power and the word for bull.|$|R

5|$|Ambohimanga {{has been}} viewed by many Merina since the late 19th century <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> an ideal social order blessed by the ancestors. The {{significance}} attached to the site in Imerina increased further when its sister rova in Antananarivo was destroyed by fire in 1995, contributing to a sense that Ambohimanga was the last remaining physical link to this sanctified past. A small intellectual elite among the Tsimahafotsy clan of Ambohimanga and the nobles (andriana) believe that only Ambohimanga possesses the ancestral benediction (hasina) {{to serve as the}} national capital and imbue national leaders with the legitimacy and wisdom needed to rightly govern the country. The descendents of the andriana have consequently been key in promoting and protecting Ambohimanga, such as by playing a significant role in successfully lobbying UNESCO to list Ambohimanga as a World Heritage Site.|$|E
25|$|The Wendigo is seen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> gluttony, greed, and excess: never {{satisfied}} after {{killing and}} consuming one person, they are constantly searching for new victims.|$|E

25|$|Martin Kramer {{writes that}} in Islamic tradition, in {{striking}} {{contrast with the}} Christian concept of the eternal Jew, the contemporary Jews were not presented <b>as</b> archetypes—as <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> Jews in all times and places.|$|R

25|$|The Romans {{adapted the}} myths and {{iconography}} of her Greek counterpart Aphrodite for Roman art and Latin literature.

25|$|Some Rastas regard Haile Selassie <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> Jah Rastafari, God himself, {{manifested}} in human form. For them, Haile Selassie was the living God. For other Rastas, Haile Selassie {{is seen as}} a messenger of God rather than a manifestation of God himself.|$|E
50|$|Articulatory gestures, {{when seen}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{physical}} <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> speech and sign language symbols, provide {{a link between}} these two language types, and show how speech resembles sign language more closely than is generally presumed.|$|R

50|$|Diogenes of Sinope (c. 412 - c. 323 BCE) is most {{frequently}} seen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> perfect <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> philosophy. The Stoics themselves saw him <b>as</b> one of <b>the</b> few, if not only, {{who have had}} achieved the state of sage.|$|R
25|$|The Raj Darbhanga {{royal family}} was looked upon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> Mithila and the Maithili {{language}} {{by people in}} the region.

25|$|According to Martin Kramer, the Quran {{speaks of}} Jews in a {{negative}} way and reports instances of Jewish treachery against the Islamic prophet Muhammad. However, Islam didn't hold up those Jews who practiced treachery against Muhammad as archetypes nor did it portray treachery <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> Jews in all times and places. The Quran also attests to Muhammad's amicable relations with Jews.|$|E
25|$|Its mystic mode of {{explaining}} some commandments was applied by its commentators to all religious observances, {{and produced a}} strong tendency to substitute mystic Judaism {{in the place of}} traditional rabbinic Judaism. For example, Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, began to be looked upon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> God in temporal life, and every ceremony performed on that day was considered to have an influence upon the superior world.|$|E
25|$|Steven Sheehan {{explains}} {{the popularity of}} The Honeymooners <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> working-class masculinity {{in the character of}} Ralph Kramden, and postwar ideals in American society regarding work, housing, consumerism, and consumer satisfaction. The series visually demonstrated the burdens of material obligations and participation in consumer culture, as well as the common use of threats -- even though The Honeymooners never showed or even hinted at actual violence -- of domestic violence in working class households.|$|E

25|$|Al-Manar often airs {{music videos}} and fillers in between {{full-length}} programs and during commercial breaks. The music videos are generally {{dedicated to the}} following seven purposes: {{the promotion of the}} Hezbollah, highlighting the importance of armed resistance against Israel, the glorification of martyrdom, spreading of anti-Americanism, denunciation of Israel and Zionism <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiments</b> <b>of</b> terrorism, <b>the</b> appeals for the destruction of Israel, and the depiction of the future of Arab youths. The videos are on average three minutes long. The videos are usually professionally produced by the station itself and each usually takes about three to four days to make. The filler material usually consists of appeals to donate money to the Hezbollah, lists of demonstrations taking place worldwide, and slogans in English, Hebrew, or Arabic.|$|R
25|$|Matters {{came to a}} head {{during the}} years running up to the English Civil War, when the cross was seen to {{encompass}} the doctrinal debates of the period. To puritanical reformers, it was identified with 'Dagon', the ancient god of the Philistines and was seen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> Royal Catholic tradition. At least one riot was fought in its shadow as opponents of the cross descended upon it to pull it down and supporters rallied to stop them.|$|E
25|$|The Christian {{elements}} in the Nusayri religion are unmistakable.

The Dalai Lama belongs to the Gelugpa school, and is regarded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>of</b> the Bodhisattva of Compassion.|$|E

500|$|There are two {{contrasting}} {{interpretations of}} Chhinnamasta {{with regard to}} sexual desire.
