40|$|Ludwigia grandiflora (Water primrose) is an aquatic {{invasive}} {{species in the}} Vilaine Basin (North-West of France). It invades rivers, lakes and marshes and it can develop a terrestrial form in floodplains. Its dense mats cause changes in ecosystem functioning and undermine both human fishing activities and navigation. It is spreading through vegetative growth from cuttings and flooding allows dispersion far away. To control it, management must be realised at catchment river scale. Maps of a large area and for inaccessible sites can be produced from remote sensing images. Remote sensing data are SPOT 5 data have been acquired during summer, when water primrose forms large and dense mats and is flowering, for the years 2003 and 2005. For these years, maps of L. grandiflora distribution are available. In order to use a supervised classification, nine classes have been identified with visual interpretation. Pixels are selected on a site where stands of L. grandiflora are large and dense. The defined classes are: water primrose, aquatic vegetation (few dense and with a lower spectral response in the near infrared than water primrose), 4 classes for crops, 2 classes for forest, and water. Firstly, no class for <b>amphibious</b> <b>vegetation</b> is defined, because it forms heterogeneous stands, with spatial variability in species and density. The classification based on these pixels is applied on two other sites, distant from 15 km: a marsh where mats of L. grandiflora are in mixture with water and other <b>amphibious</b> <b>vegetation</b> and a site with lakes and a network of channels. This extension is realised to assess if {{it is possible to}} map L. grandiflora on a large region, with data from a localised site. Results are compared with historical maps and experts knowledge about colonisation by water primrose of aimed sites. The distinction/confusion between water primrose and the other classes, and with <b>amphibious</b> <b>vegetation</b> is studied in order to define precisely the accurate of obtained maps. These results show that remote sensing is useful to map large stands of water primrose and is a base to monitor evolution of colonisation by this species. Complementary researches are needed to determine minimal size of mats that can be detected with this type of sensor and to define confusion sources, which appear during classifications...|$|E
40|$|This RNDr. thesis {{focuses on}} the species {{composition}} and cover in the littoral of the Lipno Reservoir in 2006. Aquatic macrophytes are {{an essential component of}} littoral communities in lakes. Their reasonable development positively affects biodiversity and stability of the aquatic ecosystems and water quality. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterise the development of littoral macrophytes in Lipno Reservoir, an artificial lake with seasonal water level fluctuation, and highlight controlling factors for macrophyte occurrence. The development of macrophytes was examined at 114 segments of the shoreline, each 50 m long, situated along the whole reservoir perimeter in regular 1 km distances. The segments were surveyed for phytocenology, shore morphology, pedological characteristics of substrate, and anthropogenic impact. The survey identified 53 macrophyte species (24 hydrophilic terrestrial, 17 emergent, 1 floating-leaved, 2 free-floating, 4 submersed, and 5 <b>amphibious).</b> The average <b>vegetation</b> cover of the examined segments was 14 %, with approximately one third of the segments without any macrophytes and another third with vegetation cover less than 10 %. Macrophytes occurred only in the uppermost eulittoral zone down to the level of 75 % probability of water surface exceedance. On the basis of a correlation analysis, the major factors affecting macrophyte occurrence in the littoral zone were shore morphology, light conditions in water and erosion effect of waves that together with water level fluctuation caused loss of fine particles from and degradation of the substrate in the littoral zone...|$|R
