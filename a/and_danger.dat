5|$|Likewise, in Middle English {{and early}} modern Scottish evidence, while still {{appearing}} as causes of harm <b>and</b> <b>danger,</b> elves appear clearly as human-like beings. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and {{particularly with the}} idea of a Fairy Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the source material. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies and replace them with changelings.|$|E
5|$|This onomatopoeic singing {{undercuts}} {{the dangerous}} {{scene with a}} sense of humour. Tolkien achieves balance of humour <b>and</b> <b>danger</b> through other means as well, as seen in the foolishness and Cockney dialect of the trolls and in the drunkenness of the elven captors. The general form—that of a journey into strange lands, told in a light-hearted mood and interspersed with songs—may be following the model of The Icelandic Journals by William Morris, an important literary influence on Tolkien.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to further Cossack attacks Tatar incursions continued as well, in 1623 and 1624 reaching almost as far west as the Vistula, with the attendant plunder and taking of captives. More effective defense {{was put together}} by the freed Koniecpolski and Stefan Chmielecki, who defeated the Tatars on several occasions between 1624 and 1633, using the quarter army supported by the Cossacks and general population. More warfare with the Ottomans took place in 1633–1634 and ended with a peace treaty. In 1644 Koniecpolski defeated Tugay Bey's army at Okhmativ and before his death planned an invasion against the Crimean Khanate. King Władysław IV's ideas of a grand international war-crusade against the Ottoman Empire were thwarted by the inquisition sejm in 1646. The state's inability to control {{the activities of the}} magnates and the Cossacks had contributed to the semi-permanent instability <b>and</b> <b>danger</b> at the Commonwealth's south-eastern frontiers.|$|E

5|$|Extending {{the line}} through the Sunnyside Yard and onto the LIRR Montauk Branch, running {{directly}} to the lower level of the Archer Avenue Line in Jamaica. The Montauk Branch in Queens is currently used for freight service, last seeing passenger service in 1998, {{and would have been}} rebuilt and electrified. The Montauk line would merge with the BMT Jamaica elevated at Lefferts Boulevard just west of 121st Street, using the BMT approach to the Archer Avenue subway. The Jamaica El would truncated to Crescent Street in Brooklyn and replaced by bus service. New stations would be built at Thomson Avenue within the Sunnyside Yard, and at Fresh Pond Road (the site of the former Fresh Pond station) and Woodhaven Boulevard (at the former Ridgewood station site) along the Montauk Branch. The now-closed Richmond Hill station on the Montauk Branch would be renovated and lengthened for subway service. The LIRR would have exclusive use of the tracks during overnight hours for freight service. This $594 million option would be open by 1997, but people living around the Montauk Branch opposed the proposal due to fears of increased traffic <b>and</b> <b>danger</b> from the Montauk Branch's multiple grade crossings, though plans called for new overpasses and access roads to eliminate these crossings.|$|E
