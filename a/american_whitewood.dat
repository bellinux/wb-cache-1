50|$|A {{double-decker}} horsecar tram {{was built}} by William Moor & Son in November 1880 for the Canterbury Tramway Company, possibly the first built in New Zealand. The car was a facsimile of imported carriages; with ash framing, panelling of <b>American</b> <b>whitewood,</b> and roofs and window frames of oak and hickory. Brass fittings were supplied by Scott Brothers of Christchurch, and the only imported parts were the chilled cast iron wheels. A contemporary report described the car as a most creditable specimen of local industry. The coachwork was {{equal to that of}} the American vehicles, and a much needed improvement had been made on the roof 'by the addition of a board running along the outside, for the special benefit of the female patronisers of the tramway'.|$|E
