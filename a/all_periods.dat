5|$|An {{estimated}} 70,000 Roman coins from <b>all</b> <b>periods</b> {{were found}} in Poland, starting with the 2nd century BC silver denarii. A treasure {{of these and other}} coins, some as early as the 1st century AD, was found in Połaniec, Staszów County, probably a booty captured around 19 AD from King Marbod of the Marcomanni. Greater waves of Roman money found their way to Poland throughout 1st and 2nd centuries and then again during 4th and 5th centuries, this time as bronze and golden solidi. The barbarians did not use them for commerce; they were being accumulated in dynastic treasuries of rulers and occasionally used for ceremonial gift exchange. The chiefs also kept large golden Roman medallions or their local imitations. The largest barbarian medallion, an equivalent of 48 solidii, {{is a part of the}} gold and silver treasure found in Zagórzyn near Kalisz.|$|E

Indeed, all the various functionaries, not excluding the emperors themselves, who succeeded the censors in this portion of their duties, may be said to have exercised a devolved censorial jurisdiction.|$|E

Additionally, the proportion of cousin marriage among urban families stayed constant: it was only rural families that drove the increase. For <b>all</b> <b>periods</b> the proportion of cousin marriage among highly educated women was somewhat lower than among uneducated women. It is hypothesized that decreases in infant mortality during the period may have created a larger pool of eligible cousins to marry.|$|E
