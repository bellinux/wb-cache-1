5|$|After leaving school, Chappell {{spent two}} years as a clerk in a sharebroker's office, which he left to play league cricket in England. He then worked as a {{promotions}} representative for Nestlé and, later, the cigarette manufacturer WD & HO Wills. After eight years with Wills, Chappell capitalised on his fame as Australian captain by forming his own company specialising in advertising, promotion and journalism, which has remained his profession. He is twice married, and has a daughter (Amanda) with his first wife Kay. Chappell now lives in Sydney with his second wife Barbara-Ann. In recent years, Chappell has been a high-profile activist for better treatment of asylum seekers by the Australian government, in particular its policy of mandatory detention. He supports Australia cutting ties with the United Kingdom and becoming a republic, being {{a founding member of}} the <b>Australian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Movement.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Sowada made a brief {{return to}} {{political}} life {{when she was}} nominated to become an <b>Australian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Movement</b> delegate to the Constitutional Convention on whether Australia should become a republic. She became a prominent spokesperson for the <b>Australian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Movement</b> during the convention, vigorously opposing direct election {{of the president and}} supporting the movement's sometimes-controversial leader, Malcolm Turnbull.|$|E

5000|$|Stephen [...] "Steve" [...] Crowe (born 20 April 1969) is {{a former}} Australian rugby league footballer of the 1990s who played for the Newcastle Knights in the National Rugby League. After his playing career finished, {{he went on to}} enjoy an off-field career with the club in a number of {{marketing}} and management roles. He is a republican, having {{been a member of the}} <b>Australian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Movement's</b> (ARM) NSW Committee in the lead-up to the 1999 republican referendum. He also led the Hunter Region branch of the ARM during that period.|$|R
25|$|From its {{foundation}} until the 1999 referendum, the <b>Australian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Movement</b> (ARM) supported the bi-partisan appointment model, which {{would result in}} a President elected by the Parliament of Australia, with the powers currently held by the Governor-General. It is argued that the requirement of a two-thirds majority in a vote of both houses of parliament {{would result in a}} bi-partisan appointment, preventing a party politician from becoming president.|$|E
25|$|In early 2014, a ReachTEL poll of 2,146 Australian {{conducted}} {{just after}} Australia Day showed only 39.4% supported a republic with 41.6% opposed. Lowest support {{was in the}} 65+ year cohort followed by the 18–34-year cohort. Geoff Gallop, the then chairman of the <b>Australian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Movement,</b> said higher support for a republic among Generation X and baby boomer voters {{could be explained by}} them having participated in the 1999 referendum and remembering the 1975 constitutional crisis.|$|E
500|$|Gillard {{supports}} Australia {{becoming a}} republic and {{has suggested that}} the end of Queen ElizabethII's reign would be [...] "probably the appropriate point for a transition". Following the elevation of republican Malcolm Turnbull to the prime-ministership in September 2015, Gillard along with Rudd tweeted their support for Peter FitzSimons, the head of the <b>Australian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Movement,</b> and his call for new members to join the movement.|$|E

2500|$|The Australian Labor Party {{advocated}} for the republic, while the Liberals permitted members {{to campaign for}} either side. [...] Notable campaigners for the republic included all the living former Labor Prime Ministers and former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and incumbent Treasurer Peter Costello. Notable Monarchists included Prime Minister John Howard, Justice Michael Kirby of the High Court of Australia, former Labor opposition leader Bill Hayden and Liberal Aboriginal elder Neville Bonner. Future leaders of the Liberal Party Malcolm Turnbull who led the <b>Australian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Movement</b> and Tony Abbott who supported Australians for Constitutional Monarchy took opposing views.|$|E
2500|$|The Australian Labor Party (ALP) {{first made}} republicanism its {{official}} policy in 1991, with then Prime Minister Bob Hawke describing a republic as [...] "inevitable". Following the ALP decision, the <b>Australian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Movement,</b> the leading republican advocacy group, was born. Hawke's successor, Paul Keating, pursued the republican agenda much more actively than Hawke and established the Republic Advisory Committee {{to produce an}} options paper on issues relating to the possible transition to a republic to take effect on the centenary of federation: 1 January 2001. The committee produced its report in April 1993 and in it argued that [...] "a republic is achievable without threatening Australia's cherished democratic institutions." ...|$|E
2500|$|A central {{argument}} made by Australian {{republicans is}} that, as Australia {{is an independent}} country, it is inappropriate for Australia to share the person of its monarch with the United Kingdom. Republicans argue that the Australian monarch is not Australian and, as such, {{a person who is}} a national of another country cannot adequately represent Australia, either to itself or {{to the rest of the}} world. Former Chief Justice Gerard Brennan stated that [...] "so long as we retain the existing system our head of state is determined for us essentially by the parliament at Westminster". As <b>Australian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Movement</b> member Frank Cassidy put it in a speech on the issue: [...] "In short, we want a resident for President." ...|$|E

The aim of the AERM {{is to provide a}} network for cross-party <b>republican</b> <b>movements</b> in all the countries of Europe that have a monarch as their head of state, in order to share information, resources and ideas and provide mutual assistance. Each member organisation will retain their autonomous national campaigns however, in recognition of their particular political and constitutional circumstances.|$|R

2500|$|In November 2013 Bryce {{delivered}} the annual ABC Boyer Lecture. Bryce stated {{she would like}} to see an Australia where: [...] "people are free to love and marry whom they choose [...] And where perhaps, my friends, one day, one young girl or boy may even grow up to be our nation's first head of state". Her comments drew severe criticism, not merely for their support of a republic while still serving as the Queen's representative, but because the role is meant to be strictly non-partisan. Senator Dean Smith called them, [...] "a {{slap in the face to}} many, many Australians, and a significant breach of trust". Amanda Vandstone accused her of possible grandstanding, and wrote: [...] "In publicly declaring these views, she has brought that high office into a political realm in which it does not belong....Someone might explain to her that the job is not about her … it's about us." [...] Although the <b>Australian</b> <b>republican</b> <b>movement</b> supported her comments, head of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy David Flint stated that [...] "There's this sense of division that she's created and the position is not intended to be divisive—it's intended to unite and be above politics." [...] The Prime Minister Tony Abbott supported her right to comment, saying [...] "It's more than appropriate for the Governor-General, approaching the end of her term, to express a personal view on a number of subjects, and that's what she was doing." ...|$|E
