50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it has supported over 300,000 waterbirds, including over 1% of the world populations of freckled and pink-eared ducks, Australian pelicans, straw-necked ibises, royal spoonbills, little black cormorants, red-necked avocets and sharp-tailed sandpipers. It also supports Australian bustards and grey grasswrens. Large numbers of <b>Australian</b> <b>pratincoles,</b> black-tailed godwits and flock bronzewings have been recorded.|$|R
5000|$|The IBA {{supports}} the largest recorded numbers of star finches and yellow-rumped munias, {{as well as}} smaller number of Australian bustards, Bush stone-curlews, white-gaped and yellow-tinted honeyeaters, white-browed robins, masked and long-tailed finches, and sometimes over 1% {{of the population of}} <b>Australian</b> <b>pratincoles.</b> [...] Other birds found in the IBA include brolgas, little curlews and black-backed bitterns.

[...] A large colony of Australian pelicans breeds on an island at the north-eastern end of the lake. The Barrolka Lakes hold several cormorant colonies. Other birds recorded in substantial numbers include hardheads, white-headed stilts, glossy ibises, grey teals, black-tailed nativehens, <b>Australian</b> <b>pratincoles,</b> whiskered terns and Pacific black ducks, with smaller numbers of freckled ducks and white-winged black terns.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>pratincole</b> is {{slightly}} slimmer and smaller in size with longer legs than oriental pratincole (Glareola maldivarum). Juveniles with worn plumage and birds in non-breeding plumage {{could also be}} confused with the oriental pratincole ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>pratincole</b> is {{a medium}} sized slender shorebird with long legs, long pointed wings {{and a short}} decurved bill. It is 19-24 cm long, has a {{wingspan}} of 50-60 cm and weighs 55-75grams. The sexes look alike however their breeding and non-breeding plumage differs.|$|E
50|$|The {{habitat of}} the <b>Australian</b> <b>pratincole</b> is treeless, open and sparse wooded plains, grasslands, claypans and gibberstone. Most {{of these areas}} are usually in arid and {{semi-arid}} rainfall zones. They are also sometimes found around the margins of wetlands, creeks, river beds, bore drains, lagoons, springs, claypans and sewage farms. During the breeding season they need scattered low shrubland as the chicks use the shrubs to hide and shelter in.|$|E
50|$|A 1240 km2 {{tract of}} land, {{corresponding}} {{to the area of}} the lake when fully inundated, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it has supported up to 116,000 waterbirds when flooded, including over 1% of the world population of plumed whistling-ducks. It also provides habitat for Australian bustards and yellow-tinted honeyeaters. Bird species recorded in substantial numbers include the <b>Australian</b> pelican, Oriental <b>pratincole</b> and little curlew. The IBA is the only known inland breeding site in the Northern Territory for great egrets.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>pratincole</b> (Stiltia isabella) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Glareolidae. It breeds in Australia's interior; it winters to {{northern}} and eastern parts of the island, Indonesia and New Guinea.It is a medium sized nomadic shorebird which is commonly found in arid inland Australia. It breeds predominantly from south-western Queensland to northern Victoria and through central Australia to the Kimberley region in Western Australia.The Australian population is estimated at 60 000. They are a migratory species that generally move to the southern parts of their distribution range to breed during spring and summer. During winter they migrate to northern Australia, New Guinea, Java, Sulawesi and southern Borneo to over-winter [...] Although they are common, their occurrence is unpredictable and varies in location.|$|E
