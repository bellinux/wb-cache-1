25|$|In Rome, Mark {{attempts}} to read Rose's letter during class. He is {{distracted by the}} intense gaze of a beautiful student (Ania Pieroni), who leaves suddenly; Mark follows, leaving the letter behind. His friend Sara (Eleonora Giorgi) picks up the letter, and later reads it. Horrified by the letter's contents, she takes a taxi to a library and finds a copy of The Three Mothers. Sara is attacked by a monstrous figure who recognizes the book. She throws the book {{to the ground and}} escapes. Returning to her home, she phones Mark telling him to come and asks a neighbour, Carlo (Gabriele Lavia), to keep her company. The lights suddenly go out and both Sara and Carlo are stabbed to death by <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> killer. Mark discovers the bodies and two torn fragments from Rose's letter. After the police arrive, he walks out of Sara's apartment and sees a taxi slowly driving by. In {{the back seat of the}} vehicle is the music student, staring at him intently again.|$|E
25|$|LucasArts' {{previous}} graphic adventure, Sam & Max Hit the Road (1993), {{introduced a}} new inventory and interaction system to replace those of their prior games, which had taken up the lower third of the player's screen. Full Throttle continued to refine on the changes introduced in Sam & Max Hit the Road: Objects or characters with which Ben can interact are indicated by a red square appearing around the cursor's crosshairs when the cursor is placed over the object. When this occurs, holding down the left mouse button causes a contextual pie menu {{to appear in the}} shape of the emblem of Ben's biker gang: a flaming circle topped by a skull and flanked by a boot and <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> hand. The player hovers the cursor over elements of the emblem and then releases the mouse button to attempt various interactions with the object; for example, selecting the skull's mouth to speak to a character, its eyes to examine an object, or the hand to pick up, use, or pull the object. Right-clicking anywhere on the screen brings up the player's inventory of collected objects, which can be examined or dragged and dropped in order to use them with other items in the inventory or with objects or characters in the scene. These gameplay features would be further developed for The Curse of Monkey Island (1997).|$|E

500|$|Following the lockout, Brashear voiced his displeasure {{with the}} new way the League called games, stating that the NHL changed the rules to favor [...] "superstars," [...] and he {{felt that there was}} no longer a way to [...] "get respect" [...] on the ice. His {{statement}} came following a game in which he attempted to fight Darius Kasparaitis, who the Flyers believed delivered a [...] "cheap shot" [...] to Simon Gagné in an Olympic game earlier in the year. After Kasparaitis refused to fight Brashear at various points in the game, Brashear hit Kasparaitis with <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> punch with 1:53 remaining in the game. Kasparaitis did not fight back, and instead covered up to protect himself. Brashear was assessed 29 PIMs for the incident, including an instigator penalty. Brashear was given a one-game suspension due to new League rules for the 2005–06 season; any player given an instigator penalty in the final five minutes of regulation or overtime would receive an automatic one-game suspension. At the end of the year, he was again in the top ten (eighth) in PIMs, accumulating 166, but his offensive production dropped to a mere nine points. The Flyers opted not to re-sign the enforcer.|$|E
2500|$|The Strokes {{released}} {{their debut}} album, Is This It, in the US in October 2001. The album {{was produced by}} Gordon Raphael, as was their follow-up album Room On Fire. RCA delayed the North American (US) release over concerns with the album’s cover and lyrics. The UK-released cover features a black-and-white photo of <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> hand on a woman's naked backside, shown in semi-profile (photographer Colin Lane's then-girlfriend,) while the North American version {{replaced it with a}} photo of particle collisions in the Big European Bubble Chamber. RCA replaced the track [...] "New York City Cops" [...] with [...] "When It Started", as the former featured potentially inflammatory lyrics {{in the wake of the}} [...] September 11 attacks. The track [...] "New York City Cops"—featuring the refrain, “New York City Cops, they ain't too smart”—was listed as No. 12 on New York Magazines [...] "Ultimate New York Playlist" [...] on March 1, 2010. Despite its delayed release (and the potential controversy), Is This It received critical acclaim—among other accolades, four stars from Rolling Stone, and a 9.1 from Pitchfork Media. The album made many critic's top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by Entertainment Weekly and TIME, and (in an article previewing summer concerts) NME urged readers to attend the Strokes’ shows—as they were touring some of the [...] "best pop songs ever." [...] While critics noted the influence of CBGB stalwarts Television, Casablancas and bandmates claimed to have never heard the band, instead citing the Velvet Underground as a reference point.|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{his days in}} the isolation ward, Lukwiya would sit {{with members of the}} WHO, CDC and other medical teams that had set up in the hospital compound to offer assistance and take blood samples that allowed them to map the course of the disease. [...] His main question for them was how to stop his staff members from becoming infected. [...] The likely explanation in most cases are momentary lapses. [...] Health workers at St. Mary's worked 14 hours shifts for weeks in a row while in layers of protective clothing that were stifling in the equatorial country. [...] All that would be required for infection is for a health worker to lose focus for a moment and, after touching a patient, slip <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> finger under their mask to scratch an itchy nose or rub an eye. [...] One infected St. Mary's health worker who may have been infected in this way was nurse Simon Ajok. [...] In the early morning of 20 November, Ajok was in the Ebola ward and critical, bleeding from both his nose and gums. [...] Fighting to breathe, Ajok pulled off his oxygen mask and coughed violently, sending a fine spray of blood and mucus against the nearby wall. [...] He then astonished and terrified the night-shift by rising to his feet and staggering into the hallway. [...] The night nurse on duty called Dr. Lukwiya for help. [...] Woken out of bed, Lukwiya put on protective clothing, mask, cap, gown, apron and two pairs of gloves, but not goggles or a face shield to protect the eyes. [...] Explanations for this range from grogginess at being newly awoken or haste to reach a colleague that he had helped train. [...] While it will never be known for certain, the care for Simon Ajok, who died one hour after the physician arrived, is the most likely candidate for Lukwiya's infection.|$|E

He had driven it since sunrise, and it was dusk of evening then, and his wants were, as she knew, remarkably simple. He bore {{his share of the}} burden under a burning sun, but it seemed to her that, had Weston been in his place, he would have ridden around that farm with <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> hand on his hip, and would have raised it only now and then, imperiously, to direct the toilers. Then she thought of another man, who was like him in some respects, and was then, in all probability, plodding through the lonely bush.|$|E
60|$|Thus aroused, Austen {{made his}} way towards the vacant chair, {{and when he was}} seated raised his eyes to the gallery rail, and Mr. Crewe, the {{legislative}} chamber, and its audience ceased to exist. It is quite impossible--unless one is a poetical genius--to reproduce on paper that gone and sickly sensation which is, paradoxically, so exquisite. The psychological cause of it in this instance was, primarily, the sight, by Austen Vane, of his own violets on a black, tailor-made gown trimmed with wide braid, and secondarily of an oval face framed in a black hat, the subtle curves of which no living man could describe. The face was turned in his direction, and he felt an additional thrill when he realized that she must have been watching him as he came in, for she was leaning forward with <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> hand on the railing.|$|E
