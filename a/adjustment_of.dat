5|$|A similar {{housing and}} land {{shortage}} existed in nearby Smethwick County Borough, which {{also resulted in}} the authority acquiring land from adjoining council areas. By 1914; the urban area of Bearwood had already spread over the border of Oldbury Urban District as far as Rathbone Road and Warley Park. A further <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the county boundary took place in 1928 and on this occasion however, Staffordshire gained territory from Worcestershire at Warley Woods (See Fig 4). This enabled Smethwick to build new housing estates at Londonderry and {{to the west of}} Rathbone Road.|$|E
5|$|As the Mk. XIV could {{calculate}} {{the effects of}} a shallow climb or dive (or glide as it is referred to in bombing), the computor included its own levelling mechanism. This was added to the range angle calculated by the computor to move the sight head. Levelling the system required <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> both the computor and the sight head. Since these were in a fixed relationship to each other, levelling could be carried out on the ground and then left alone. Any adjustments required were recorded on a card fixed {{to the front of the}} computor.|$|E
5|$|Panavision's first product—the Super Panatar {{projection}} lens—debuted in March 1954. Priced at $1,100, it {{captured the}} market. The Super Panatar was a rectangular box that {{attached to the}} existing projection lens with a special bracket. Its variable prismatic system allowed a range of film formats to be shown from the same projector with a simple <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the lens. Panavision improved on the Super Panatar with the Ultra Panatar, a lighter design that could be screwed directly {{to the front of}} the projection lens. Panavision lenses gradually replaced CinemaScope as the leading anamorphic system for theatrical projection.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> selective attention following errors and {{their relation to}} the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN), a correlate of errors in event-related potentials. We hypothesized that, if post-error adjustments reflect an adaptive mechanism that should prevent the occurrence of further errors, then <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> attentional selectivity should be observed only following errors due to insufficient selective attention. To test this, a four-choice flanker task was used in which errors due to insufficient selective attention (flanker errors) and other errors (nonflanker errors) could be distinguished. We found strong <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> selective attention following flanker errors but not following nonflanker errors. Moreover, the Ne/ERN amplitude was correlated with <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> selective attention on a trial-by-trial basis. The results provide support for {{the notion that the}} Ne/ERN is a correlate <b>of</b> adaptive <b>adjustments</b> following errors...|$|R

These factors are not easily estimated, so the calculated value for breathing duration will be more than the real value.|$|E
5|$|Catesby {{waited for}} Percy's {{return from the}} north, before making his decision. He thought the letter too vague to {{constitute}} any meaningful threat to the plan, and decided to forge ahead. As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder, other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands. Salisbury, already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, did not yet know {{the exact nature of}} the plot or who exactly was involved. He elected to wait, to see how events unfolded. On 3November, Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London. Although the nature of their discussion is unknown, Fraser theorises that some <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred, as later accounts told how Percy had been seen at the Duke of York's lodgings, enquiring as to the movements of the king's daughter. Nicholls mentions that a week earlier—on the same day that Monteagle received his letter—Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes, to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, Dugan {{was fascinated}} by the {{technical}} aspects of theatre. He worked as a lighting designer then transitioned to sound design in 1967. Dugan became interested in achieving the automatic <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> sound controls after a frustrating experience staging the musical Hair. His first automixer design was not fully practical but his second design was successful; it used a reference derived from a total of all of its microphone signals. Dugan devised a third improvement which helped prevent audio feedback in the presence of sound reinforcement loudspeakers. Dugan next produced an automixer design that could be inserted into an existing mixing console. This proved popular for broadcast and live sound applications. Each of Dugan's subsequent automixer models has been of the insertable type.|$|E

5|$|In the Western world, biographers {{began writing}} about Lenin {{soon after his}} death; some – like Christopher Hill – were {{sympathetic}} to him, and others – like Richard Pipes and Robert Gellately – expressly hostile. Some later biographers, such as Read and Lars Lih, sought to avoid making either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes. Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions. The Soviet view characterised {{him as a man}} who recognised the historically inevitable and accordingly helped to make the inevitable happen. Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived him as a person who manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies. More recently, revisionists in both Russia and the West have highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.|$|E
5|$|The docks {{maintenance}} {{facility was}} established {{on the land}} exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day. William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow surplus water to flow back into the New Cut, this {{was known as the}} 'Overfall'. By the 1830s, the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, however, able to devise a solution to this problem. In place of the Overfall he advised better use of three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful undertow sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide. The shallow sluices enabled <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the dock water level according to weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{astronomy}} employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200Å (10 to 320nm). Light {{at those}} wavelengths are {{absorbed by the}} Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited {{to the study of}} thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei. However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust, an <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> ultraviolet measurements is necessary.|$|E

25|$|<b>Adjustment</b> <b>of</b> status (AOS) – <b>Adjustment</b> <b>of</b> {{status is}} {{for when the}} {{immigrant}} is in the United States and entered the U.S. legally. Except for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, the immigrant must also be in legal status {{at the time of}} applying for <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> status. For immediate relatives and other relative categories whose visa numbers are current, <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> status can be filed for at the same time with the petition (step 1 above). <b>Adjustment</b> <b>of</b> status is submitted to USCIS via form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. The USCIS conducts a series of background checks (including fingerprinting for FBI criminal background check and name checks) and makes a decision on the application. Once the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> status application is accepted, the alien is allowed to stay in the United States even if the original period of authorized stay on the Form I-94 is expired, but he/she is generally not allowed to leave the country until the application is approved, or the application will be abandoned. If the alien has to leave the United States during this time, he/she can apply for travel documents at the USCIS with form I-131, also called Advance parole. If there is a potential risk that the applicant's work permit (visa) will expire or become invalid (laid off by the employer and visa sponsor) or the applicant wants to start working in the United States, while he/she is waiting for the decision about his/her application to change status, he/she can file form I-765, to get Employment Authorization Documents (also called EAD) and be able to continue or start working legally in the United States. In some cases, the applicant will be interviewed at a USCIS office, especially if it is a marriage-based adjustment from a K-1 visa, in which case both spouses (the US citizen and the applicant) will be interviewed by the USCIS. If the application is approved, the alien becomes an LPR, and the actual green card is mailed to the alien's last known mailing address.|$|E
