5000|$|Nucleoside analogs are a {{class of}} {{antiviral}} drugs that work by inhibiting viral nucleic acid synthesis. The nucleoside analogs acyclovir (ACV), zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), trifluridine, cidofovir, <b>adefovir,</b> and tenofovir (TDF) [...] are substrates of the OAT1 transporter. This may result in the buildup of these drugs in the proximal tubule cells. At high concentrations, these drugs inhibit DNA replication. This, in turn, may impair the function of these cells and may {{be the cause of}} antiviral induced Fanconi syndrome. The use of stavudine, didenosine, abacavir, <b>adefovir,</b> cidofovir [...] and tenofovir has been associated with Fanconi syndrome. Clinical features of tenofovir-induced Fanconi syndrome include glycosuria in the setting of normal serum glucose levels, phosphate wasting with hypophosphatemia, proteinuria (usually mild), acidosis, and hypokalemia, with or without acute renal failure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adefovir</b> {{works by}} {{blocking}} reverse transcriptase, an enzyme {{crucial for the}} HBV to reproduce in the body.

50|$|Four {{discrete}} {{regions of}} CyaA bind calcium-loaded calmodulin {{with a large}} buried contact surface. Of those, a tryptophan residue (W242) at an alpha-helix of CyaA makes extensive contacts with the calcium-induced, hydrophobic pocket of calmodulin. Mutagenic analyses show that all four regions of CyaA contribute to calmodulin binding and the calmodulin-induced conformational change of CyaA is crucial for catalytic activation. A crystal structure of CyaA-calmodulin with <b>adefovir</b> diphosphate, the metabolite of an approved antiviral drug, reveals the location of catalytic site of CyaA and how <b>adefovir</b> diphosphate tightly binds CyaA. The ACD of CyaA shares a similar structure and mechanism of activation with anthrax edema factor (EF). However, the interactions of CyaA with calmodulin completely diverge from those of EF. This provides molecular details of how two structurally homologous bacterial toxins evolved divergently to bind calmodulin, an evolutionarily conserved calcium sensor.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately, {{there are}} no agents {{available}} with high enough efficacy and safety to fully eradicate HBV. Neither interferon alpha, including standard and pegylated forms, nor nucleotide analogues (including lamivudine, <b>adefovir</b> dipivoxil, and most recently, entecavir) could eradicate HBV covalently-closed-circular DNA in liver cells, which is the replication model for HBV recurrence. However, no agents are available {{to break through the}} host's immune tolerance to HBV, which is another important reason for persistent infection with HBV, although some patients respond well temporarily to administration of interferon and nucleotide analogues alone or in combination regimens. Some traditional Chinese herbs, such as kushenin (Sophora flavescens) and some complex prescriptions, have some efficacy as antivirals and in the protection of liver function, although the specific mechanism and components need to be identified. The current treatment in China is the combination of antiviral agents (lamivudine, <b>adefovir</b> dipivoxil), immune modulators (interferon alpha, peginterferon alpha, thymosin), and hepatic protectors (such as glycyrrhizin, glucuronolactone). The Chinese spend around Ɲ900 billion (US$110 billion) on these regimens every year. Apart from cost, patients and carriers of HBV infection are often confronted with tough conditions and social pressures, although such discrimination is illegal in China.|$|E

50|$|Patients {{with chronic}} {{hepatitis}} B have antibodies against hepatitis B, but these antibodies {{are not enough}} to clear the infection of the affected liver cells. The continued production of virus combined with antibodies is a likely cause of the immune complex disease seen in these patients. A vaccine is available that will prevent infection from hepatitis B for life. Hepatitis B infections result in 500,000 to 1,200,000 deaths per year worldwide due to the complications of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B is endemic {{in a number of}} (mainly South-East Asian) countries, making cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma big killers. There are six treatment options approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) available for persons with a chronic hepatitis B infection: alpha-interferon, pegylated interferon, <b>adefovir,</b> entecavir, telbivudine, and lamivudine.

50|$|Nitazoxanide {{alone has}} shown {{preliminary}} evidence of efficacy {{in the treatment}} of chronic hepatitis B over a one-year course of therapy. Nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily resulted in a decrease in serum HBV DNA in all of 4 HBeAg-positive patients, with undetectable HBV DNA in 2 of 4 patients, loss of HBeAg in 3 patients, and loss of HBsAg in one patient. Seven of 8 HBeAg-negative patients treated with nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily had undetectable HBV DNA and 2 had loss of HBsAg. Additionally, nitazoxanide monotherapy in one case and nitazoxanide plus <b>adefovir</b> in another case resulted in undetectable HBV DNA, loss of HBeAg and loss of HBsAg. These preliminary studies showed a higher rate of HBsAg loss than any currently licensed therapy for chronic hepatitis B. The similar mechanism of action of interferon and nitazoxanide suggest that stand-alone nitazoxanide therapy or nitazoxanide in concert with nucleos(t)ide analogs have the potential to increase loss of HBsAg, which is the ultimate end-point of therapy.

Although metabolism of <b>adefovir</b> dipivoxil was more pronounced in the ex vivo and in situ models than in the Caco- 2 system, the transport of 'total adefovir' [= <b>adefovir</b> dipivoxil and its metabolites mono(POM) -PMEA and adefovir] was comparable in the three models.

The {{aim of this}} study was to characterize the dynamics of adefovir-resistant variant populations during <b>adefovir</b> monotherapy in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatitis B virus resistance to this class of nucleotide analogues. Patients included in a 240 -week clinical trial of <b>adefovir</b> monotherapy who developed <b>adefovir</b> resistance-associated substitutions were studied. The dynamics of hepatitis B virus populations were analyzed over time, after generating nearly 4, 000 full-length reverse transcriptase sequences, and compared with the replication kinetics of the virus during therapy. Whatever the viral kinetics pattern, <b>adefovir</b> resistance was characterized by exclusive detection of a dominant wild-type, adefovir-sensitive variant population at baseline and late and gradual selection by <b>adefovir</b> of several coexisting resistant viral populations, defined by the presence of amino acid substitutions at position rt 236, position rt 181, or both. The gain in fitness of one or the other of these resistant populations during <b>adefovir</b> administration was never associated with the selection of additional amino acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase. Conclusion: Our results suggest that <b>adefovir</b> administration selects poorly fit preexisting or emerging viral populations with low-level <b>adefovir</b> resistance, which subsequently compete to fill the replication space. Viral kinetics depends on the initial virological response to <b>adefovir.</b> Lamivudine add-on restores some antiviral efficacy, but adefovir-resistant variants remain predominant. Whether these <b>adefovir</b> resistance-associated substitutions may confer cross-resistance to tenofovir in vivo will need to be determined...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report a}} case {{suggesting}} the beneficial effect of <b>adefovir</b> dipivoxyl {{in patients with}} delta-related decompensated liver cirrhosis ineffectively treated with lamivudine. CASE SUMMARY: A 55 -year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), antihepatitis Be positive, and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) -related decompensated liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score B 9) was awaiting liver transplantation. During this time, she was treated with lamivudine 100 mg/day; however, the drug was stopped after 8 months {{because it did not}} produce viral clearance or return serum aminotransferase levels to within normal limits. The patient was not a candidate for interferon alfa therapy but was prescribed <b>adefovir</b> dipivoxyl 10 mg/day. Five months later, serum aminotransferase levels had normalized and, after 7 months of treatment with <b>adefovir,</b> the patient became negative for serum HBV-DNA and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antidelta. At the time of writing (20 mo of therapy), the HBV-DNA and IgM antidelta remained negative, whereas hepatitis B surface antigen and circulating HDV-RNA were positive. No adverse effects associated with <b>adefovir</b> were reported, and the Child-Pugh score (A 6) had improved. DISCUSSION: This is the first reported case of some beneficial biochemical and serologic effects of <b>adefovir</b> dipivoxyl in the treatment of delta cirrhosis. The virologic pattern of the patient after <b>adefovir</b> is indicative of poor liver disease activity and prospectively enhances liver transplantation outcome, indicating that <b>adefovir</b> might also be useful in the phase prior to liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Although we have no plausible explanation for our patient's favorable response to <b>adefovir</b> treatment, this case contributes to the knowledge regarding treatment of this very difficult condition as well as <b>adefovir</b> efficacy. Given the positive outcome, this report suggests that <b>adefovir</b> might be beneficial in patients with delta-related liver cirrhosis not responsive to previous lamivudine therapy.
