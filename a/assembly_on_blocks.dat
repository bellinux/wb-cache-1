40|$|When {{manufacturing}} {{axial piston}} pumps, mass difference of piston-slipper assembly is inevitable because of manufacturing precision limits. Small mass difference may not cause problems when the pump operates at low speeds, while it cannot be ignored at high speeds. One problem related to high speed is the cylinder block tilt {{resulting from the}} inertial effect of piston-slipper assembly. Recently, the speed of electro-hydrostatic actuator (EHA) pump in aircraft can reach more than 10, 000 rpm. Therefore, mass difference of pistonslipper assembly {{should be taken into}} account in future EHA pump design. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the effect of the mass difference of piston-slipper <b>assembly</b> <b>on</b> the cylinder <b>block</b> tilt in a high-speed EHA pump. A detailed set of relevant equations is developed to establish the relationship between the mass difference of piston-slipper assembly and cylinder block tilting moment. It is found that a tighter control over the mass difference of piston-slipper assembly should be guaranteed when it comes to high-speed EHA pumps...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{space and time}} {{allocation}} problem that arises in assembly halls producing large building blocks (namely, a shipyard which assembles prefabricated keel elements). The building blocks are very large, and, once a block {{is placed in the}} hall, it cannot be moved until all <b>assembly</b> operations <b>on</b> this <b>block</b> are complete. Each block must be processed during a predetermined time window. The objective is to maximize the number of building blocks produced in the hall. The problem is modeled as a 3 -dimensional bin packing problem (3 D-BPP) and is handled by a Guided Local Search heuristic initially developed for the 3 D-BPP. Our com- putational experiments with this heuristic demonstrate that excellent results can be found within minutes on a workstation, and that the heuristic outperforms a standard constraint programming approach. We also describe some additional real-life constraints arising in the industrial application and show how these constraints can be conveniently integrated in the model. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to evaluate effects of drinking water treatment sludge on crop quality. In this trial Zea mays L. (pioneer 32 w 86) was used, and the {{research was}} planned according to random blocks sampling design with three replicates. Increased amount of sludge, as of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 t da- 1, was applied <b>on</b> <b>blocks.</b> Zea mays L. seeds were sewed between rows within a distance of 65 cm, and on rows within a distance of 25 cm. Blocks were irrigated to stimulate germination during dry conditions. When the numbers of leaves were reached 8, 10 kg da- 1 of N fertilizer was applied. Plant length, first corncob height, corncob length, corncob diameter and number of corncob were observed and measured using randomly selected 10 plants from each block. As a result, the highest plant length, 206. 97 cm, was found <b>on</b> <b>blocks</b> of control. The lowest plant length 189. 76 cm was found <b>on</b> <b>blocks</b> with 1 t da- 1. The highest first corncob height, 85. 62 cm, was found <b>on</b> <b>blocks</b> with 1 t da- 1 sludge applied. The lowest first corncob height, 82. 09 cm, was found <b>on</b> <b>blocks</b> with 4 t da- 1 sludge applied. Average of the highest corncob number 1. 23 was found <b>on</b> <b>blocks</b> with 4 t da- 1 sludge applied. Average of the lowest corncob number 1. 03 was found <b>on</b> <b>blocks</b> with 1 t da- 1 sludge applied. The highest corncob length 22. 08 cm was found <b>on</b> <b>blocks</b> with 2 t da- 1 sludge applied. The lowest corncob length 19. 94 cm was found <b>on</b> <b>blocks</b> with 3 t da- 1 sludge applied. The highest corncob diameter 4. 15 cm was found <b>on</b> <b>blocks</b> with 0 t da- 1 sludge applied. The lowest corncob diameter 3. 86 cm was found <b>on</b> <b>blocks</b> with 1 t da- 1 sludge applied...|$|R
