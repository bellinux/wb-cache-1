2500|$|The PSP {{includes}} an 1800mAh battery (1200mAh on the 2000 and 3000 models) {{that will provide}} about 4–6hours of gameplay, 4–5hours of video playback, or 8–11hours of audio playback. Official accessories for the console include an AC adapter, car adapter, headset, headphones with remote control, extended-life 2200mAh battery, battery charger, carrying case, accessories pouch and cleaning cloth, and system pouch and wrist strap. [...] The PSP {{is equipped with a}} two-pin docking connector immediately below the <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor</b> jack for easy drop-in charging using a docking station that was to be sold separately for the PSP-1000 series. However no such charging dock was ever released by Sony. The two-pin docking station charging contacts were removed from the PSP-2000 and later versions.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A USB <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor</b> {{with a green}} USB {{connector}} supporting Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0.|$|E
50|$|Power for the {{instruments}} came from five AA batteries, with provision for connecting an aftermarket 7.5 volt <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|NEMA-1 plugs, rated 15 A at 125 volts, are {{compatible}} with both NEMA-1 receptacles and NEMA-5 receptacles; NEMA-1 is ungrounded (no earth), while NEMA 5 is grounded. The plug has two parallel blades. Early versions were not polarized, but most plugs are polarized today via a wider neutral blade on the plug that fits a wider neutral opening on the receptacle. (Unpolarized <b>AC</b> <b>adaptors</b> are a common exception.) ...|$|R
50|$|In July 2007 Sony started {{shipping}} {{a revision}} of the slimline PlayStation 2 (SCPH-7900x) featuring a reduced weight of 600 grams compared to 900 g of the SCPH-7700x, achieved through a reduction in parts. The unit also uses a smaller motherboard {{as well as a}} custom ASIC which houses the Emotion Engine, Graphics Synthesizer, and the RDRAM. The <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor's</b> weight was reduced to 250 g from the previous 350 g.|$|R
25|$|For older {{models of}} telephones, the headset {{microphone}} impedance {{is different from}} that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset. A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound amplification for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers. Most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone, mute function and switching between headset and handset. Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or <b>AC</b> <b>adaptors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The factory box {{comes with}} the {{following}} accessories: owner’s manual, sound and parameter list, <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor,</b> CD-ROM (with editor and USB MIDI driver), ferrite core, a band for fastening the core, and a leaflet ("Attaching the Ferrite Core").|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the light gun, the system featured two paddle controllers built directly into the console. Its reported features included [...] "on-screen digital scoring" [...] and three different difficulty settings (beginner, intermediate, pro). It required two nine-volt batteries or Coleco's Perma Power <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor</b> to power the system.|$|E
50|$|Electronic Quarterback is a {{handheld}} electronic game made by Coleco in 1978. It {{is powered by}} a 9-volt battery or an <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor,</b> and it differentiated itself from the other similar handheld electronic football games of the era, notably Mattel Electronics's version, by having two blockers and giving the quarterback the ability to pass.|$|E
40|$|Sony multi-lingual data discman {{electronic}} book-player, {{complete with}} five floppy discs, <b>AC</b> power <b>adaptor,</b> battery case, video connecting cord, operating manual and various leaflets, guarentees etc, all in small black plastic carrying tray [...] Maker: Sony. Date: 1991 - 1992 - from the The Betty Smithers Design Collection at Staffordshire University. ...|$|R
50|$|Like its {{predecessor}} the Nintendo DS Lite {{is compatible with}} the Nintendo DS Headset accessory. However the DS Lite uses an AC power adapter that differs from the one used for the original Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance SP due to a smaller <b>adaptor</b> <b>AC</b> port {{on the top of the}} unit.|$|R
40|$|The {{transduction}} {{of signals}} generated by protein kinases and phosphatases {{are critical for}} the ability of integrin αIIbβ 3 to support stable platelet adhesion and thrombus formation. Unlike kinases, it remains unclear how serine/threonine phosphatases engage the signaling networks that are initiated following integrin ligation. Because protein-protein interactions form the backbone of signal transduction, we searched for proteins that interact with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 Ac). In a yeast two-hybrid study, we identified a novel interaction between PP 2 <b>Ac</b> and an <b>adaptor</b> protein CIN 85 (Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa). Truncation and alanine mutagenesis studies revealed that PP 2 Ac binds to the P 3 block (396 PAIPPKKPRP 405) of the proline-rich region in CIN 85. The interaction of purified PP 2 Ac with CIN 85 suppressed phosphatase activity. Human embryonal kidney 293 αIIbβ 3 cells overexpressing a CIN 85 P 3 mutant, which cannot support PP 2 Ac binding, displayed decreased adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen. Platelets contain the ∼ 85 kDa CIN 85 protein along with the PP 2 Ac-CIN 85 complex. A myristylated cell-permeable peptide derived from residues 395 – 407 of CIN 85 protein (P 3 peptide) disrupted the platelet PP 2 Ac-CIN 85 complex and decreased αIIbβ 3 signaling dependent functions such as platelet spreading on fibrinogen and thrombin-mediated fibrin clot retraction. In a phospho-profiling study P 3 peptide treated platelets also displayed decreased phosphorylation of several signaling proteins including Src and GSK 3 β. Taken together, these data support a role for the novel PP 2 Ac-CIN 85 complex in supporting integrin-dependent platelet function by dampening the phosphatase activity...|$|R
50|$|The first Tecra {{notebook}} {{models were}} released in 1996, including the Tecra 500CS and the Tecra 500CDT. Both notebook models {{had the same}} design and featured similar hardware specification. The Tecra laptops built in 1996 dimensions of 299 x 235 x 58mm, with a weight of 3.4kg with integrated <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor.</b> The Lithium-Ion battery (not used in Satellite notebooks before 1997) offered a standard productivity up to two hours.|$|E
50|$|Some {{mechanically}} powered flashlights include additional {{functions and}} features beyond just {{a source of}} light. Models sold as emergency lights have additional functions useful in emergencies, such as flashing red or yellow lights for roadside emergencies, sirens, and AM/FM, weather or shortwave radios. They may also include alternative means of charging the battery, such as an <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor,</b> solar cells, or cords that plug into a car cigarette lighter socket.|$|E
5000|$|The first laptop {{charging}} trolley to {{be produced}} in the UK, the Mentor™, appeared in 2000 and was designed and manufactured by LapSafe Products to be sold into the UK. [...] Two different kinds of laptop charging was offered, ChargeLine, in which users plug a laptop's original <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor</b> into flush plug sockets inside the unit, and patented SmartLine, which replaces AC adaptors with pre-configured charging cables to save time.|$|E
50|$|In ads {{made for}} the system before the Cosmos' cancellation, Atari Inc. claimed that the {{holographic}} images were life like and 3D. While {{this may have been}} true, the images didn't influence the actual gameplay at all. There were only two images to a game, though they did enhance each game's appearance. The system was intended to run off of an <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor,</b> not batteries. The Cosmos would have supported up to 2 players.|$|E
50|$|Power {{consumption}} was low, requiring only {{either one}} AA battery or one gumstick-type rechargeable, with optional <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor</b> input. It is also {{equipped with an}} amorphous tape head capable of reproducing 20-20,000 Hz response, a gold-plated headphone jack, and a 2-millimetre-thick aluminum body. Sony made this model with only sound quality in mind at an affordable price, therefore it contains no gimmick features such as in-line remote control, music search, or LCD readout. Its only features are Dolby B/C noise reduction, EX DBB bass boost, tape and two auto reverse modes.|$|E

50|$|The {{same year}} that the Paddle Games were {{released}}, Atari released a TV game of their own which they called the Atari Flashback Console. The device was designed and produced by Atari consultant Curt Vendel through his engineering firm Legacy Engineering. With only a 10-week development window, what they produced looked like a minute version of the Atari 7800 console originally released in 1984, 20 years prior. The two controllers were small as well, having a joystick and two red buttons on each side. Twenty titles were built into the system. Unlike most plug-and-plays, the Flashback was not powered by batteries, but an (included) <b>AC</b> <b>adaptor</b> instead. The Flashback did fairly well in sales. Since the games were all recreated on hardware more closely resembling the Nintendo Entertainment System than the 7800, some of the aspects of certain games concerning the sound, graphics, or gameplay were either changed or omitted.|$|E
