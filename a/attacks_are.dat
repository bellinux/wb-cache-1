5|$|The {{casualties}} of the 1916 <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> {{listed in the}} International Shark Attack File—of which Burgess is director—as victims of a great white.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} many non-state attacks in Mumbai since the 13 coordinated bomb explosions that killed 257 people and injured 700 on 12 March 1993. The 1993 <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> {{believed}} to have been in retaliation for the Babri Mosque demolition.|$|E
50|$|All six Ninja Storm Rangers are playable, {{each with}} their own abilities. The Red Wind Ranger's special <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> Hawk Blaster, Blue Wind Ranger's special <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> Sonic Fin, Yellow Wind Ranger's special <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> Lion Hammer, Crimson Thunder Ranger's special <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> Crimson Blaster, Navy Thunder Ranger's special <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> Navy Antler and finally the Green Samurai Ranger's special <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> Shuriken Spin.|$|R
50|$|The Dinosaurs <b>Attack!</b> trading cards <b>were</b> {{created as}} a {{follow-up}} to the successful trading card series, Mars Attacks. Like Mars <b>Attacks,</b> Dinosaurs <b>Attack!</b> <b>was</b> intended as an homage and a parody of 1950s B-movies. While Mars <b>Attacks</b> <b>was</b> a parody of alien invasion movies, Dinosaurs <b>Attack!</b> <b>was</b> inspired by monster movies such as The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Godzilla.|$|R

5|$|Aikido {{techniques}} are usually {{a defense against}} an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks {{to be able to}} practice aikido with a partner. Although <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.|$|E
5|$|Attacks may {{be brought}} on by {{physical}} exertion, drinking alcohol, or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt. This may explain why <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> more common in summer, when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise. Exercise-related attacks tend to occur {{during a period of}} rest immediately after exercise; exercise may therefore be recommended to abort an attack.|$|E
5|$|England had {{suffered}} Viking raids {{in the late}} 8th century, but no <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> recorded between 794 and 835, when the Isle of Sheppey in Kent was ravaged. In 836 Egbert was defeated by the Vikings at Carhampton in Somerset, but in 838 he was victorious over an alliance of Cornishmen and Vikings at the Battle of Hingston Down, reducing Cornwall {{to the status of}} a client kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> planned at Tauheed Hotel, {{and a house}} rented {{for this}} purpose in Madina Colony, Walton Road. The auto rickshaws used in the <b>attack</b> <b>were</b> {{purchased}} by Samiullah.|$|R
25|$|The <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> {{believed}} to have been carried out by Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. In August 2016, three of the terrorists involved in the <b>attack</b> <b>were</b> killed during a police raid in Lahore. In October, the <b>attack's</b> mastermind <b>was</b> killed in eastern Afghanistan during a military operation, while hiding there.|$|R
5|$|Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the {{corporate}} {{administrator for the}} RDA mining operation. While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize {{the attacks on the}} Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary, and the attacks will be humane. When the <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.|$|E
5|$|Prostaglandins, local hormones {{produced}} in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes {{are responsible for the}} aggregation of platelets that form blood clots. Heart <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a major}} predator {{of smaller}} woodland birds, though only 10% of its hunting <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> successful. It hunts by surprise attack, using hedges, tree-belts, copses, orchards and other cover near woodland areas; its choice of habitat is dictated by these requirements. It also makes use of gardens in built-up areas, {{taking advantage of the}} prey found there.|$|E
50|$|The Shindo Renmei were a Japanese-Brazilian terror {{organization}} whose <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> {{focused on}} {{resistance to the}} Japanese surrender {{at the end of}} World War Two; <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> perpetrated against other Japanese-Brazilians.|$|R
50|$|The BlackNurse <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> a form {{of denial}} of service attack based on ICMP flooding. The <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> special because a modest {{bandwidth}} of 20Mbit/s can be effective for disrupting a victim's network.|$|R
25|$|Despite this, the {{probability}} of a port scan alone followed by a real <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> small. The probability of an <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> much higher when the port scan is associated with a vulnerability scan.|$|R
5|$|Although Australia was {{remote from}} the main battlefronts, there was {{considerable}} Axis naval activity in Australian waters during the Second World War. A total of 54 German and Japanese warships and submarines entered Australian waters between 1940 and 1945 and attacked ships, ports and other targets. Among the best-known <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> the sinking of HMAS Sydney by a German raider in November 1941, the bombing of Darwin by Japanese naval aircraft in February 1942, and the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour in May 1942. In addition, many Allied merchant ships were damaged or sunk off the Australian coast by submarines and mines. Japanese submarines also shelled several Australian ports and submarine-based aircraft flew over several Australian capital cities.|$|E
5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|E
5|$|Combat in {{the game}} is similar to its predecessor, with the main series of {{missions}} beginning after an opening tutorial. The game features ground-based hack-and-slash gameplay and aerial combat. In ground combat, the player controls multiple characters, switching between them via the pause menu {{in order to use}} their different weapons. The characters use physical attacks using character weapons for short-range battle, while magical <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> used for long-range attacks and groups of enemies. The magical attacks vary between the playable characters. Weapons, characters and magical abilities leave up and grow stronger as the player gains experience points in combat: weapons have a four-level cap.|$|E
50|$|Responsibility for the Quetta <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> {{claimed by}} Jamaat-ul-Ahrar and ISIL, while no group {{accepted}} {{responsibility for the}} Parachinar attack. According to the Pakistani military, both <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> coordinated from terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|The 13 June 2012 Iraq <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> {{a series}} of {{simultaneous}} bombings and shootings that killed 93 people and wounded over 300 others. The <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> carried out in seven different locations throughout Iraq.|$|R
50|$|The 1 April <b>Attacks</b> <b>were</b> {{a series}} of attacks across Cyprus in 1955 by the EOKA {{which led to the}} start of the Cyprus Emergency. Multiple British {{locations}} <b>were</b> <b>attacked</b> after midnight by EOKA members. This <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by the distribution of leaflets across Cyprus.|$|R
5|$|Doomfist is a fictional, playable {{character}} in the 2016 video game Overwatch whose design {{is based on a}} powerful, cybernetic gauntlet. As an offensive, brawler-style character, he uses mostly close-range attacks: a charged punch, uppercut, and slam. He is advantaged by his high mobility, but disadvantaged if left in a group while his <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> recharging. Doomfist was released in late July 2017 as the title's 25th hero, and the fourth introduced after the game's launch.|$|E
5|$|GioGio's Bizarre Adventure is an action-adventure game {{in which}} the player duels against enemies in 3D environments, {{controlling}} several characters who each have their own sets of moves: Giorno Giovanna, Bruno Bucciarati, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, Pannacotta Fugo, Leone Abbacchio, and Trish Una. The battle system includes physical attacks such as kicking and punching, {{and the ability to}} dodge attacks by rolling; physical <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> performed through a single-button input, and can be chained into a combination attack by pressing repeatedly.|$|E
5|$|Monsters {{will talk}} to the player during the battle, and the game will tell the players what the monster's {{feelings}} and actions are. Enemy attacks change based on how players interact with them: should players choose non-violent options, enemy <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> easy, whereas they become difficult if players choose violent options. The game relies {{on a number of}} metafictional elements in both its gameplay and story. When players participate in a boss battle on a second playthrough, the dialogue will be altered depending on actions in previous playthroughs.|$|E
30|$|The second <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> {{against the}} WeakAgreement (Des- Auth, DesDA 3 C) assertion, where the Intruder {{launches}} a replay attack and successfully impersonates the DesAuth. The message sequence {{involved in the}} <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> given below.|$|R
30|$|Adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA 2): This <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} the CCA, however the {{attacker}} can choose new ciphertexts depending on the received answer. This <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> considered very strong and much harder to implement.|$|R
50|$|In cryptography, the boomerang <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> {{a method}} for the {{cryptanalysis}} of block ciphers based on differential cryptanalysis. The <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> published in 1999 by David Wagner, who used it to break the COCONUT98 cipher.|$|R
5|$|The arcade {{release of}} Cross Generation of Heroes has a control scheme {{consisting}} of a joystick and four buttons. Wii versions of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have five control options: the Classic Controller, Nintendo GameCube controller, third-party arcade sticks, and two simplified control schemes—intended for inexperienced players—for the Wii Remote. Players use controller inputs to perform attacks; the most basic <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> executed by pressing one of three attack buttons: light, medium, or strong. Players may augment basic attacks with joystick or control pad directional inputs; for example, a standard strong attack can become a sweep when the down input is added. Basic attacks can be strung together to perform combos.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy III combines {{elements of}} the first two Final Fantasy games with new features. The turn-based combat system remains in place from the first two games, but hit points are now shown above the target following attacks or healing actions, rather than captioned as in the previous two games. Auto-targeting for physical attacks after a friendly or enemy unit is killed is also featured for the first time. Unlike subsequent games in the series, magical <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> not auto-targeted in the same fashion.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{central theme}} {{involves}} {{the examination of}} the human desire to detect patterns or meaning and the risks of finding patterns in meaningless data. Other themes include methods of interpretation of history, cultural familiarity with brand names, and tensions between art and commercialization. The September 11, 2001 <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> used as a motif representing the transition to the new century. Critics identify influences in Pattern Recognition from Thomas Pynchon's postmodern detective story The Crying of Lot 49.|$|E
40|$|A new {{distinguishing}} attack {{scenario for}} stream ciphers, allowing a resynchronization collision <b>attack,</b> <b>is</b> presented. The <b>attack</b> can succeed if {{the part of}} the state that depends on both the key and the IV is smaller than twice the key size. It is shown that the <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> applicable to block ciphers in OFB mode. For OFB mode, the <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> more powerful than the previously known generic distinguishing attack since it will directly recover a part of the plaintext while having the same asymptotic complexity as the generic distinguishing <b>attack.</b> The <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> also demonstrated on the eSTREAM candidate LEX. LEX is not vulnerable to any of the previously known generic distinguishing <b>attack</b> but <b>is</b> vulnerable to the new <b>attack.</b> It <b>is</b> shown that if approximately 265. 7 resynchronizations using LEX are performed for the same key, some plaintext might be recovered...|$|R
5000|$|For example, a Standard hit {{will simply}} push an enemy behind while attacking. This allows {{for any other}} type of Hit Class <b>attack</b> to <b>be</b> {{connected}} to do a Combo. A High Angle and Knock Down combo <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> another similar example. However, say if a Knock Down <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> applied to an enemy who has a [...] "Heavy" [...] weight followed by a High Angle hit, it will most probably miss since the enemy is still Knocked Down at that moment when the combo <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> made.|$|R
30|$|The uniform <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> the bluntest way {{to produce}} a flat histogram, and as we see, it breaks the preprocessing. An {{interesting}} question <b>is</b> if better <b>attacks</b> can <b>be</b> developed by combining the basic attacks already introduced. We introduce hybrid attacks as the <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> chosen independently for each sample according to some probability distribution.|$|R
