So with the advent of new research techniques into brain damage, Rocky was found to be normal among fighters, and he was suffering the results of a severe concussion. By today's standards Rocky Balboa would be given a clean bill of health for fighters.|$|E
5|$|His neck {{continued}} to cause him pain, and Prince Philip commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal. Trautmann attended that evening's post-match banquet despite {{being unable to}} move his head, {{and went to bed}} expecting the injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George's Hospital, where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E

Nonetheless, Breuer mentioned that Johnson told him that he was essentially fired from AC/DC and that he hadn't heard from the band since the announcement of the tour being postponed, adding that Angus Young wants to continue the band for at least another ten years and do at least one more studio album and world tour. Breuer later clarified his comments on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.|$|E

5|$|At Zeus Genetics clinic, Scully overhears a {{pregnant}} woman, Mary Hendershot (Saxon Trainor), who is telling her doctor {{that she does}} not want to be under his care any more. In order to avoid being seen, Scully hides in a storeroom, finding it full of preserved fetuses that resemble the alien child seen earlier, but she is discovered by a doctor, Dr. Lev. Scully then phones Dr. Parenti, who is dissecting an alien fetus. She asks him to compare her ultrasound scan with the one given to her earlier. Later, while waiting to be attended to by Dr. Parenti, she has another flashback, recalling the time she sought <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> about her ova from Dr. Parenti, and was told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor. In the present, she is called in to be attended to, and she is then assured her scans are in order. Later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has been sending to both Mulder and Dr. Lev. However, when the agents leave, Duffy makes a phone call to Lev, warning him that they are being investigated. In another flashback, Scully asks Mulder to be the donor, to which he happily agrees.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{his strong}} finish in 2012, Kendrick entered spring {{training}} assured of {{a spot in}} the Phillies' Opening Day starting rotation {{for the first time in}} five years and spent his first full season exclusively a member of the major league starting rotation. His 2013 season took the opposite trajectory of his 2012 campaign; he held a 4–1 record with a 2.47 ERA in his first eight starts, while he posted a 6–12 record with a 5.65 ERA in his final 22 starts. Some suggested that because Kendrick is a contact pitcher (i.e., he focuses on getting outs via batters hitting the ball rather than striking out), his career-worst batting average on balls in play indicated horrendous defense was the primary reason for his downturn, not necessarily poor pitching. However, both were likely contributing factors. On September 18, he was scratched from his scheduled start due to right rotator cuff tendinitis, which may have contributed to his poor pitching down the stretch. It was the first time in Kendrick's career he missed a start due to injury. He had initially planned on making his next start, but the Phillies announced on September 20 that Kendrick had been shut down for the remainder of the season after receiving <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> on the injury. The team placed him on the disabled list for his first career stint and Zach Miner took his spot in the rotation. Overall, he posted 10–13 with a 4.70 ERA in 182 innings pitched.|$|E

40|$|A key {{question}} in Mergers and Acquisitions {{is whether the}} transactions are fair. A common practice is to ask a financial advisor to evaluate the fair value of a transaction and provide a fairness opinion. However, fairness opinions have been viewed as a “rubber stamp ” since almost every target firm obtains one. Using a manually compiled data set over the period 1996 - 2011, I examine why some target firms choose to obtain <b>a</b> <b>second</b> fairness <b>opinion</b> and the wealth effects of this choice. More specifically, I test two competing hypotheses: the agency theory hypothesis which predicts {{the use of multiple}} opinions destroys shareholder value, and the shareholder interests hypothesis which argues that target firms obtain <b>a</b> <b>second</b> fairness <b>opinion</b> for strategic reasons. The results show that after controlling for endogeneity, the use of multiple opinions has a significantly positive impact on announcement returns. Target firms are more likely to obtain <b>a</b> <b>second</b> fairness <b>opinion</b> in management buyout deals, in hostile deals, and in large deals. <b>A</b> <b>second</b> fairness <b>opinion</b> is also more likely to be sought if the target has multiple business segments. Overall, my findings provide new evidence that is consistent with the shareholder interests hypothesis and is inconsistent with the agency theory hypothesis...|$|R

Rodriguez independently sought <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> on his quad strain on July 24 with a doctor who stated that there {{did not appear to}} be an injury; the Yankees were incensed by his decision, saying that he violated league rules for seeking <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> without the team's permission.

25|$|On May 12, 2014, Sabathia {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list due to right knee inflammation. Fluid buildup was detected in the knee and the buildup was drained by a shot with no surgery required. Seeking <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> with Dr. James Andrews, he received a stem-cell shot in the knee. Sabathia was transferred to the 60-day disabled list on July 1 (retroactive to May 11) being sidelined until early to mid-July or later. After making a rehab appearance with the Double-A Trenton Thunder, Sabathia began to experience swelling in his right knee, putting his season in jeopardy. The Yankees projected that Sabathia might need microfracture surgery, which could potentially end his career. On July 16, it was announced that Sabathia's 2014 season had ended. In only 8 starts in 2014, Sabathia went 3-4 with a 5.28 ERA. He underwent surgery on July 23 to repair his degenerated knee.|$|E
25|$|During the 1790s, the {{problems}} of effective drainage worsened, and the commissioners appointed Isaac Leatham, from Barton near Malton, to produce a comprehensive report with recommendations for the Ancholme Level. He addressed the issues of both drainage and navigation, and presented his plans on 29 August 1800, but commissioners thought the projected cost of £22,975 was excessive. They therefore approached John Rennie (the Elder) for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion,</b> and he produced a report on 9 November 1801. His proposals included constructing catchwater drains {{on either side of}} the main channel, enlarging the width and depth of the channel, building two new locks, and rebuilding the road bridge at Brigg. The cost was estimated to be £53,921, of which only 11 per cent was for improvements to navigation. Again, the commissioners were unhappy with the cost, and although Rennie suggested completing the work in stages, he later produced a modified plan which would only cost £25,413.|$|E
25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> which might have the desired outcome.|$|E
