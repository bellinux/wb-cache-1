In 1993 he published Summer of Love: The Making of Sgt Pepper (published in the U.S. as With <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Help</b> from My Friends: The Making of Sgt Pepper, co-authored with William Pearson), which also included interview quotations from a 1992 South Bank Show episode discussing the album. Martin also edited a 1983 book called Making Music: The Guide to Writing, Performing and Recording.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back at the}} ranch, Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance. The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, {{but it does not}} seem to be working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>help</b> from Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town. The boys eventually find the clone and take it to Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair. Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone, but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything the clone did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E

25|$|Certainly Benaud {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>help</b> {{from the}} roughened patches, {{but he could}} do what the off-spinners could not do: he could turn the ball, mostly slowly, sometimes with more life. His control was admirable, and when Benaud gets a batsman in trouble he rarely if ever gives him a loose one. He keeps him pinned down, probing and probing until the victim is well and truly enmeshed.|$|E
60|$|So perhaps {{among the}} many {{there may be some}} who for a moment will turn aside from tales of haughty Heroes, ruffling it in Court and Camp, to listen to the story of a very {{ordinary}} lad who lived with very ordinary folk in a modern London street, and who grew up to be a very ordinary sort of man, loving <b>a</b> <b>little</b> and grieving <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> <b>helping</b> <b>a</b> few and harming a few, struggling and failing and hoping; and if any such there be, let them come round me.|$|R

25|$|The plays {{swept the}} {{audience}} along {{a unique and}} enjoyable journey, an Odyssey of insights which recounted {{the story of one}} member of an invisible minority who struggled with her sexuality and, over time, grew increasingly confident and self-aware, with more than <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>help</b> from her friends. Heng hoped that the LGBT community would relate to the plays which included 'insider' jokes and references that could only be fully appreciated by the gay community, with scripts that were not dumbed down to accommodate a straight audience. Owing to its lesbian theme, the producers experienced great difficulty in securing a corporate sponsor.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcast}} {{takes its}} only break at 11pm local time {{to allow for}} the CTV affiliates to broadcast the CTV National News.

The broadcast always concludes with O Canada and a balloon and confetti drop during which time some of the volunteers take to the stage to celebrate; up through 2010, a rendition of With <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Help</b> from My Friends was included with the closing festivities.|$|E
25|$|Falkinburg {{continued}} wrestling {{and brought}} other wrestlers into his stable, The Diamond Mine, such as Scotty Flamingo (Raven) and Vinnie Vegas (Kevin Nash). The relationships between DDP, Flamingo, and Vegas {{were used in}} many angles over the following months. Falkinburg went {{in the corner of}} Scotty Flamingo, at Clash of the Champions XXI on November 18, 1992, when Flamingo fought Johnny B. Badd in a worked boxing match. Flamingo won this bout with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>help</b> from Falkinburg who filled Flamingo's glove with water. The following year, after Studd and Flamingo left the stable, Falkinburg teamed with Vinnie Vegas as the Vegas Connection. However, the team was disbanded shortly after its debut when Falkinburg suffered a torn rotator cuff in a match against Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce toward the end of 1992 and was later fired, while Nash left WCW for the World Wrestling Federation.|$|E

50|$|Ariel the <b>Little</b> Mermaid is <b>a</b> {{video game}} {{published}} by Sega in 1992 for the Mega Drive/Genesis and Game Gear (a Sega Master System version {{was released by}} Tec Toy in Brazil). The game lets the player control either Ariel or King Triton to defeat Ursula. Rescuing requires the player to simply swim into the unfortunate little victims as they hang about at fixed places in the watery world; while fending off and dodging enemies like eels, clams, sharks, and several other sea meanies. Friends like Flounder and Sebastian can also be summoned for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>helping</b> hand.|$|R
25|$|In April 1920, {{while the}} Azerbaijani army {{was locked in}} Karabakh {{fighting}} local Armenian forces, Azerbaijan {{was taken over by}} Bolsheviks. On 10 August 1920, Armenia signed a preliminary agreement with the Bolsheviks, agreeing to a temporary Bolshevik occupation of these areas until final settlement would be reached. In 1921, Armenia and Georgia were also taken over by the Bolsheviks who, in order to attract public support, promised they would allot Karabakh to Armenia, along with Nakhchivan and Zangezur (the strip of land separating Nakhchivan from Karabakh). However, the Soviet Union also had far-reaching plans concerning Turkey, hoping that it would, with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>help</b> from them, develop along Communist lines. Needing to placate Turkey, the Soviet Union agreed to a division under which Zangezur would fall under the control of Armenia, while Karabakh and Nakhchivan would be under the control of Azerbaijan. Had Turkey not been an issue, Stalin would likely have left Karabakh under Armenian control. As a result, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was established within the Azerbaijan SSR on 7 July 1923.|$|E
25|$|At NYU Schoonmaker {{also met}} filmmaker Michael Wadleigh and later edited his {{influential}} music festival documentary, Woodstock on which Scorsese also worked. Her first major film editing work on Woodstock gained Schoonmaker an Academy Award nomination for Best Editing. Her use of superimpositions and freeze frames brought the {{performances in the}} film to life, and added to the movie's wide appeal, thus helping to raise the artistry and visibility of documentary filmmaking to a new level. Among the most haunting of Woodstockâs brilliantly edited sequences are the relatively sedate, nearly painterly, composition of Joan Baezâs mesmerising rendition of âJoe Hillâ and her a cappella âSwing Low, Sweet Chariotâ, sung before a raptly silent audience of half-a-million and Joe Cockerâs âWith <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Help</b> from My Friendsâ, featuring the singerâs falsetto response to his own vocal on {{the other half of}} the split screenâ¦.Only infrequently does editing inspiration flag, notably on Jimi Hendrixâs very long guitar solo that concludes the âDirectorâs Cutââ¦.the Hendrix number evidences the flaccidity of material unmediated by the editing magic of Scorsese and Schoonmaker.|$|E

60|$|The deep {{below me}} was very terrible to look upon, and the {{casement}} being above the dry ditch, I had no water {{to break my}} fall, if fall I must.

500|$|... "I'm the Greatest" [...] is {{featured}} in Andrew Grant Jackson's book Still the Greatest: The Essential Solo Beatles Songs, where the author deems {{it to be}} the track that signalled the end of Starr's self-styled [...] "album block". Writing in MusicHound Rock, Gary Pig Gold identifies it as Starr's [...] "theme song" [...] as a solo artist, typifying both his propensity for nostalgia and the all-star collaborations suggested by his [...] "with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>help</b> from his friends" [...] approach. Gold also considers the song to be one of Lennon's [...] "best, most sarcastic creations ever". In the 2005 publication , Paul Moody included [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] among the [...] "ten solo gems" [...] from Starr's career, describing it as a [...] "Lennon-penned tribute to self-love" [...] on which Harrison [...] "weighs in with an electrifying lead guitar break". Music critic Tim Riley pairs the track with the Beatles' [...] "With <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Help</b> from My Friends" [...] as Starr's signature songs, while Ben Urish and Kenneth Bielen describe it as [...] "a sequel of sorts" [...] to [...] "With <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Help</b> from My Friends", adding: [...] "though not a monumental work, its humor and sense of fun recapture some of the true joy at the core of much of The Beatles' best work." ...|$|E
