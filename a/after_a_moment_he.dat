60|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>he</b> stopped awkwardly, and Adam {{raised his}} hand.|$|R
60|$|Therefore, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> consideration, <b>he</b> spoke up, with a {{firm and}} manly voice.|$|R
60|$|She {{heard him}} coming down, and almost {{hoped to be}} spared the meeting, but, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> pause, <b>he</b> entered.|$|R

6000|$|Gully, thus {{confronted with}} the lonely realities of his scheme, {{did not like the}} prospect. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> {{reflection}} <b>he</b> exclaimed: ...|$|R
60|$|NICHOLLS (impatiently). That's silly, Mr. Carmody. Gaynor {{knows his}} business. (<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> hesitation.) <b>He</b> {{told me all}} about Eileen's sickness.|$|R

6000|$|Uncle John {{refilled}} {{his pipe}} {{and looked at}} Patsy’s tense face inquiringly. The major stiffened, but could not wholly repress his curiosity. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> said: ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{considered}} this; {{he took it}} in, looking graver again; but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> qualified. [...] "Yet I shall {{want some}} day to give you something." ...|$|E
6000|$|The officer stood thunderstruck at what appeared, to him, {{to be an}} act of audacious insolence. However, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> pause, <b>he</b> said wrathfully: ...|$|R
6000|$|Tom was at sea--a Great Seal was {{something}} {{which he was}} totally unacquainted with. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> hesitation <b>he</b> looked up innocently and asked-- ...|$|R
60|$|With {{his long}} pole in his hand, he ascended {{to the top}} of the kiln. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> pause, <b>he</b> called to his son.|$|R
6000|$|Halson beamed for {{pleasure}} upon us, and even Minver said: [...] "Yes, that's rather nice." [...] <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> added: [...] "Rulledge thinks {{she put it}} there." ...|$|E
60|$|And Tottie obediently couched {{himself in}} the allotted corner and shut his eyes very hard, though <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> remarked that the snow got into his neck.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I don't know," [...] said Fulkerson, ruefully. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> said, desperately, [...] "Beaton, you've got {{a pretty}} good head; why don't you suggest something?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] Mr. Gerald said, disappointedly, but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> blank <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> {{apparently}} took courage. [...] "You're in {{the same}} line, though?" ...|$|R
60|$|The sailors were {{determined}} to make the attempt regardless of his warnings, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>he</b> refused to argue longer.|$|R
6000|$|Phonny seemed perplexed. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> pause <b>he</b> added, [...] "Couldn't we go {{down and}} tell Espy {{that there is a}} {{squirrel}} in his trap?" ...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Walters {{stared at}} her in honest amazement. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> remarked gruffly that the flavour of the ale itself {{was good enough for}} him. Rosa’s eyes sparkled.|$|E
60|$|He {{called a}} hansom {{and handed her}} in. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> {{hesitation}} <b>he</b> gave {{the address of the}} restaurant where he had first met Rice.|$|R
60|$|Benson looked {{disturbed}} and irresolute, but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>he</b> abruptly {{threw his}} cigar away {{and leaned forward}} with a decided air.|$|R

6000|$|... "So do I!" [...] Strether went on <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> But <b>he</b> had {{the next}} minute an inconsequent question. [...] "How comes Chad so mixed up, anyway?" ...|$|R
