5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the excavators found two stuck together <b>and</b> <b>peeled</b> them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he was}} able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E
5|$|The Gaza Strip's cooking {{style is}} similar to culinary styles adopted {{by the rest of}} the Levant countries, and is also {{influenced}} by the Mediterranean coast. The staple food for the majority of the inhabitants in the area is fish. Gaza has a major fishing industry and fish is often served either grilled or fried after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, red peppers and cumin and marinated in a mix of coriander, red peppers, cumin, and chopped lemons. Besides fish, as well as other types of seafood, Zibdieh, is a clay pot dish that consists of shrimp baked in a stew of olive oil, garlic, hot peppers, <b>and</b> <b>peeled</b> tomatoes. Crabs are cooked and then stuffed with a red hot pepper paste called shatta.|$|E

40|$|Gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} (GC-MS) and gas chromatographyolfactometry (GC-O) {{were used}} to determine the aromatic composition and aroma active compounds of fruit juice <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> oil of Jinchen sweet orange fruit. Totals of 49 and 32 compounds were identified in fruit juice <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> oil, respectively. GC-O was performed to study the aromatic profile of Jinchen fruit juice <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> oil. A total of 41 components appeared to contribute to the aroma of fruit juice <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> oil. Twelve components were the odorants perceived in both samples. The aromatic compositions of fruit juice were more complex than that of peel oil. Ethyl butanoate, ÃŽÂ²-myrcene, octanal, linalool, ÃŽÂ±-pinene, and decanal were found to be responsible for the aromatic notes in fruit juice <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> oil. Nineteen components have been perceived only in the juice and ten compounds were described as aromatic components of only the peel oil by the panelists. These differences lead to the different overall aroma between fruit juice <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> oil...|$|R

Taro grows in the fertile land of the Azores, {{as well as in}} creeks that are fed by mineral springs. Through migration to other countries, the inhame is found in the Azorean diaspora.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Green {{banana flour}} shows good {{potential}} as a functional ingredient for special-purpose foods, {{but there are no}} data in the literature concerning the use of a green banana pulp <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> flour for the development of products such as pasta. The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop tagliatelle pasta substituting the wheat flour with different concentrations of a green banana mixed pulp <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> flour. The pasta formulations were prepared replacing the wheat flour by the green banana mixed pulp <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> flour in two concentrations: 15 % and 30 %. A control formulation with wheat flour was also prepared. The green banana mixed pulp <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> flour presented higher ash, total fibre and total phenolic compound contents than traditional wheat flour. The pasta formulation with the addition of 15 % green banana flour showed the highest ash content and the best sensory acceptability of all the formulations. It was concluded that it was possible to develop a tagliatelle pasta with satisfactory acceptance replacing the wheat flour by a green banana mixed pulp <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> flour...|$|R

25|$|At 1:44 of the second, the Red Wings scored {{their second}} goal. On {{the final seconds}} of a power play, Fleury made a {{sprawling}} save on Datsuyk, the puck was cleared, and the penalty expired. However, as the Penguins attempted to make a line change, goaltender Chris Osgood fed a long pass for Detroit to Marian Hossa, who slipped a pass into the slot, enabling a streaking Valtteri Filppula to score on the backhand. Three straight penalty calls on Pittsburgh would then lead to Red Wing scores. A slashing minor on Sergei Gonchar eventually allowed a high wrist shot by Niklas Kronwall at 8:35 to find {{the back of the}} net. Kronwall scored after pinching into the corner and playing in a forward position. He then took a pass from Johan Franzen and patiently waited for Fleury to go down before lifting the puck. An elbowing penalty on Evgeni Malkin led to a Brian Rafalski goal at 11:34, which saw the defenceman take a pass from Datsyuk and score on a wrist shot from the right circle. A Chris Kunitz roughing penalty set up Henrik Zetterberg. At 15:40, Zetterberg took a shot-pass from Jiri Hudler <b>and</b> <b>peeled</b> {{to the front of the}} net to deposit the puck over Fleury's glove. After giving up the fifth goal, Fleury was replaced by Mathieu Garon, and the Penguins committed two more penalties in the second to give Detroit a two-man advantage on which they did not convert. The third period was mostly uneventful and the score remained 5–0 until the end of the game.|$|E
25|$|With this information, {{along with}} other {{intelligence}} reports available to them, FEAF confirmed that the Korean People's Army had, indeed, launched a full-scale invasion of South Korea. FEAF's first priority, however, was to evacuate United States citizens. On the morning of 26 June, the nearby Norwegian freighter Reinholte was sent to Inchon harbor to evacuate non-military personnel from Seoul, which lay directly in the invasion route. A flight of Twin Mustangs from the 68th F(AW)S was dispatched to the area, arriving at dawn to provide air protection for the evacuation. Two of the F-82s were dispatched to fly over the road from Seoul, while others flew top cover over the Inchon docks. The patrol went without incident until about 1300, when a pair of Soviet-built aircraft (the exact aircraft type has never been determined) {{came out of the}} clouds. Orders given to the F-82 pilots prohibited any aggressive action; however, gun switches were activated when the enemy leader tightened up his turn <b>and</b> <b>peeled</b> off at the F-82s with his wing man in close tail. The F-82s dropped their external tanks, turned on combat power and started a climbing turn towards the North Korean aircraft. For some reason, the North Korean leader fired while too far away, with his bullets falling short of the F-82s which then pulled up into the clouds and above the overcast, putting them in a position to return fire if the North Koreans followed them. However, they did not, and no further contact was made {{for the rest of the}} day. The evacuation at Inchon was successfully carried out with a total of 682 civilians being transported to Sasebo, Japan.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{any of its}} relatives, the King George whiting {{does not}} appear to feed on molluscs, which is unusual because in many parts of Southern Australia, the main bait used by {{recreational}} fishers to catch whiting is the cockle; a mollusc, but then, it has been deshelled. [...] An excellent bait for catching King George Whiting is raw king prawn, such as banana prawn. [...] They are better bought in the shell <b>and</b> <b>peeled</b> shortly before using, as this keeps the bait fresh. Also rare in the diet are echinoderms, which are frequent prey for other species of Sillago. [...] This may be a function of niche partitioning, as in many areas the King George whiting’s habitat overlaps with other species of the genus Sillago. Other minor components of the diet include crustaceans such as carids, leptostracans, stomatopods, crabs, tanaids, cumaceans and isopods as well as other fish and benthic algae.|$|E
