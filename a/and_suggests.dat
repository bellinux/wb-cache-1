5|$|After awakening, Jon Snow {{is greeted}} by Davos Seaworth and Melisandre. When asked by Davos {{what he can}} remember, Jon says he remembers only his {{assassination}} but nothing from being dead. Melisandre tells Jon that her religion prophesies the return of a heroic prince <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> that this prince may not be Stannis, as she first thought, but Jon. Jon enters the courtyard {{to meet with the}} wildlings. He meets with and embraces Tormund Giantsbane and Dolorous Edd, Tormund saying the Wildlings think he is a god.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{often makes}} digs {{at the expense}} of Daily Show host Jon Stewart. He has implied a {{strained}} relationship with Stewart, in contrast with the real Colbert's admiration for the comedian, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> that his departure from The Daily Show occurred under dubious circumstances. The character has described Stewart as a sexual predator and has been known to become tearful when his name is brought up. On the other hand, Colbert has also implied that he only got his own show by blackmailing Stewart with incriminating photographs.|$|E

5|$|David A. Wheeler's paper How to Prevent {{the next}} Heartbleed {{analyzes}} why Heartbleed wasn't discovered earlier, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> several techniques {{which could have}} led to a faster identification, as well as techniques which could have reduced its impact. According to Wheeler, the most efficient technique which could have prevented Heartbleed is an atypical test suite thoroughly performing what he calls negative testing, i.e. testing that invalid inputs cause failures rather than successes. Wheeler highlights that a single general-purpose test suite could serve as a base for all TLS implementations.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} 19th-century warfare, {{historian}} James Reid posits that Anderson suffered from delusional paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, and greatly enjoying, the ability to inflict fear and suffering in his victims, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> he suffered from the most severe type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid draws a parallel between the bashi-bazouks and Anderson's group, arguing that they behaved similarly.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus is {{the first}} {{definite}} ceratosaur from eastern Asia to be discovered. It {{is also one of}} the earliest members of the group Ceratosauria, living during the Oxfordian stage of the Jurassic period (approximately 161-157 million years ago). Its discovery shows that the Asian dinosaurian fauna was less endemic during the Middle/Late Jurassic period than previously thought, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> a possible land connection between Asia and other continents during that period.|$|E

5|$|N. R. Malkani finds Aurobindo's {{theory of}} {{creation}} to be false, as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond normal human experiences. He says {{the theory is}} an intellectual response to a difficult problem and that Aurobindo uses the trait of unpredictability in theorising and discussing things not based upon truth of existence. Malkani says that awareness is already a reality <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> {{there would be no}} need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} {{differs from}} country to country, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> that all the victims are both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> that most victims do not survive {{for more than seven}} years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of Charisma wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.|$|E
5|$|One day, Yochay's mother {{approaches}} Shira's mother, Rivka, {{about the}} possibility of Yochay remarrying, believing it to be best for Mordechai. She plans to suggest an offer from a widow in Belgium. Rivka is distraught by the idea of Mordechai being taken out of the country <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> that Yochay marry Shira instead. He and Shira both initially oppose the prospect, though he eventually warms to it and she agrees to take it into consideration on learning that her previous engagement has been called off due to her father's delays.|$|E

5|$|The 8 {{compartment}} Bühlmann - based UWATEC ZH-L8 ADT MB PMG decompression {{model in}} the Scubapro Galileo dive computer processes the dive profile <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> an intermediate 2-minute stop that {{is a function of}} the tissue nitrogen loading at that time, taking into account the accumulated nitrogen from previous dives. Within the Haldanian logic of the model, at least three compartments are offgassing at the prescribed depth - the 5 and 10 minute half time compartments under a relatively high pressure gradient. Therefore, for decompression dives, the existing obligation is not increased during the stop.|$|E
5|$|The adipose fin, {{which is}} present in over 6,000 teleost species, is often thought to have evolved once in the lineage and to have been lost {{multiple}} times due to its limited function. A 2014 study challenges this idea <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> that the adipose fin {{is an example of}} convergent evolution. In Characiformes, the adipose fin develops from an outgrowth after the reduction of the larval fin fold, while in Salmoniformes, the fin appears to be a remnant of the fold.|$|E

5|$|The {{first ten}} {{chapters}} {{are not entirely}} a direct translation of the Vangelo; Leland offers his own commentary and notes {{on a number of}} passages, and Chapter VII is Leland's incorporation of other Italian folklore material. Medievalist Robert Mathiesen contends that the Vangelo manuscript actually represents even less of Aradia, arguing that only Chapters I, II, and the first half of Chapter IV match Leland's description of the manuscript's contents, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> that the other material came from different texts collected by Leland through Maddalena.|$|E

5|$|The time is unclear. Allan Cunningham {{states it}} is half past eleven, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> that Hogarth uses the early hour to {{highlight}} the debauchery occurring opposite the church, yet the print shows the hands {{at a time that}} could equally be half past twelve, and the painting shows a thin golden hand pointing to ten past twelve.|$|E

5|$|The village {{name has}} been spelt in {{different}} ways, including: Bentewurda or Bintewurda (12th century) and Bynteworth (c. 15th century). The original meaning of the name Bent-worth {{may have been a}} place of cultivated land, or a way through land such as woodland. The Swedish scholar Eilert Ekwall argues that a derivation from the Old English bent-grass is unlikely, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> a derivation from The tũn of Bynna's people.|$|E
5|$|The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on {{efficiency}} wages {{based on}} notions of fairness {{provides an example}} of a feminist model of economic actors. In their work, agents are not hyperrational or isolated, but instead act in concert and with fairness, are capable of experiencing jealousy, and are interested in personal relationships. This work is based on empirical sociology and psychology, <b>and</b> <b>suggests</b> that wages can be influenced by fairness considerations rather than purely market forces.|$|E
