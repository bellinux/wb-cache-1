25|$|The first {{dialogue}} between transhumanism and faith was a one-day conference {{held at the}} University of Toronto in 2004. Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor {{a relationship with the}} divine. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of postmodern cynicism and anomie. Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in optimistic, idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment. Following this dialogue, William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist of religion, conducted <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>study,</b> published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology, suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as being a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that approximately 68% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy experience disturbances in sensory perception such as dysgeusia. In <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>study</b> involving twelve lung cancer patients, chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment. The results indicated that, after two weeks, no taste disturbances were reported by the patients who received the zinc-supplemented treatment while most of the patients in the control group who did not receive the zinc reported taste alterations. A multi-institutional study involving a larger sample size of 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not {{have an effect on the}} development of taste disorders in cancer patients. An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the immune system, and physicians must use caution when administering zinc to immunocompromised cancer patients. Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient's quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.|$|E

25|$|A {{large body}} of {{international}} research has shown the efficacy of methadone maintenance treatment programmes {{for the treatment of}} drug addiction and subsequent reduction in HIV risk behaviors. In acknowledgment of this evidence, in 2004 the Chinese government called for the use of such practices to mitigate HIV transmission. Immediately, under the governance of the Ministries of Health and Public Security and the State Food and Drug Administration, <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>study</b> of eight clinics in five provinces was done. Inclusion in the programme required: (1) several failed attempts to quit the use of heroin, (2) at least two terms in a detoxification centre, (3) age at least 20 years, (4) being a registered local resident of the area in which the clinic is located, and (5) being of good civil character. Those testing HIV positive need only fulfill criteria 4 and 5. To monitor the progress of the clinics, a database was established to gather data on demographics, medical issues, drug use, and other information about the patients. These data were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and indicated reductions in heroin use, drug-related crime, and unemployment in those who received methadone maintenance treatment.|$|E
25|$|Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) {{is a rare}} genetic {{disorder}} {{of the brain that}} occurs only in males. The fatal condition destroys the nervous system, often leaving the victim unable to walk, and talk normally. For many years ALD took the lives of many and continues to do so today. In 1987, Augusto and Michaela Odone, parents of a child affected by ALD, invented Lorenzo’s oil as a treatment for the disease. Their story was in the 1992 Universal Studios motion picture, Lorenzo's Oil, starring Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon. Dr. Hugo Moser, a renowned scientist at Kennedy Krieger Institute, joined forces with the Odone's, ultimately proving that their treatment, Lorenzo's oil, can prevent the onset of ALD if begun before neurological symptoms appear. Moser and colleagues also created the first diagnostic test for ALD, as well as a newborn screening test that can detect the disease from birth. On January 20, 2007 Dr. Hugo Moser died of complications from surgery to treat pancreatic cancer. Today, Dr. Moser's wife Ann B. Moser, continues this important work at Kennedy Krieger. In 2008, she helped to launch <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>study</b> to screen for ALD in 5000 newborns born in local Baltimore hospitals, the results of which will be used to advocate for nationwide newborn screening for this devastating disorder.|$|E
