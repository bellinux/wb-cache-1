This is followed by its application to the phenomenon of <b>a</b> <b>screen.</b> In our phenomenology of the screen, we aim to give an essential account of <b>a</b> <b>screen,</b> as <b>a</b> <b>screen,</b> in its very screen-ness. We follow Heidegger’s argument that the screen will only show itself as <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> in its functioning as <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> in the world where screens are what they are. We claim, and aim to show, that our analysis provides many insights about the screen-ness of screens that we can not gain through any other method of investigation. We also show that although our method is not empirical its results have many important implications for the empirical world...|$|R

5|$|Other {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire.

The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is <b>a</b> <b>screening</b> tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), <b>a</b> <b>screening</b> questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E
