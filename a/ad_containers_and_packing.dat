It is believed that such a process would be much more suitable for a recycling-oriented society. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.

40|$|The Army’s current {{chemical}} weapons (CW) disposal program involves robotic, machine disassembly {{of the chemical}} weapon as appropriate for each specific munition. The various waste materials from disassembly are incinerated separately. These include the chemical agent, explosives and propellants, empty munitions <b>and</b> nonexplosive (storage) <b>containers,</b> <b>and</b> shipping <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> materials (dunnage). Preliminary separation produces individual waste streams that are relatively homogeneous, which makes it feasible to optimize conditions for the incineration of each. To handle the various waste streams produced by disassembly, four different furnace systems are required: Incinerator for the liquid chemical agent and process liquid waste; Rotary kiln furnace {{for the destruction of}} explosives and propellants, with an accompanying heated discharge conveyer to remove leftover materials; Metal parts furnace to decontaminate by incineration the empty bulk <b>containers,</b> shells, <b>and</b> bombs; and Dunnage incinerator for the combustion of waste packaging. The resulting gases and other products of incineration are treated with a variety of modern pollution abatement equipment, including a quench tower, venturi scrubber, scrubber tower, demister, and for the dunnage furnace, a baghouse for removal of particulate. Brine produced by the scrubbers is evaporated, and the resulting salts are packed in drums for eventual landfill. The final products that will require disposal such as landfill are scrap metal, drums of salt, and ash (l). The time required to dispose of the stockpiles at the eight continental U.

Objectives: To evaluate drug advertisements in Nigerian and other African medical journals for their adequacy of pharmacological information. Methods: Twenty four issues from each of West African Journal of Medicine (WAJM), East African Medical Journal (EAMJ), South African Medical Journal (SAMJ), Nigerian Medical Practitioner (NMP), Nigerian Quarterly Journal of Hospital Medicine (NQJHM) and Nigerian Postgraduate Medical Journal (NPMJ) were reviewed. While EAMJ, SAMJ and NMP are published monthly, the WAJM, NQJHM and NPMJ are published quarterly. The monthly journals were reviewed between January 2005 and December 2006, and the quarterly journals between January 2001 and December 2006. The drug information with regards to brand/non-proprietary name, pharmacological data, clinical information, pharmaceutical information and legal aspects was evaluated as per World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria. Counts in all categories were collated for each advertiser. Results: Forty one pharmaceutical companies made 192 advertisements. 112 (58. 3 %) of these advertisements were made in the African medical journals. Pfizer (20. 3 %) and Swipha (12. 5 %) topped the list of the advertising companies. Four (2. 1 %) adverts mentioned generic names only, 157 (81. 8 %) mentioned clinical indications. Adults and children dosage (39. 6 %), use in special situations such as pregnancy and renal or liver problems (36. 5 %), adverse effects (30. 2 %), average duration of treatment (26. 0 %), and potential for interaction with other drugs (18. 7 %) were less discussed. Pharmaceutical information such as available dosage forms and product and package information {summary of the generic and proprietary names, the formulation strength, active ingredient, route of administration, batch number, manufactured and expiry dates, and the manufacturer on both the <b>container</b> <b>and</b> <b>pack</b> of the drug} were mentioned in 65. 6 % and 50 % adverts, respectively. The product and package descriptions were provided in 57 (72. 2 %) Nigerian medical journals, which was significantly higher than in other African medical journals 39 (37. 9 %) (P< 0. 001). Conclusions: None of the drug advertisements in the journals adequately provided the basic information required by the WHO for appropriate prescribing.

Smaller containers were less easy to open than comparable ones of a larger size. Only 54 % patients were able to remove a suppository from its wrapping.

The entire text {{is included in the}} research. pdf file; the abstract appears in the short. pdf file; a non-technical general description appears in the public. pdf file. With the increasing competition in global trade, buying and transporting items effectively in the international network are critical and challenging problems for many companies. The objective {{of this study is to}} design a cost-effective consolidation and distribution method to transport shipments in a global network. In the dissertation, we investigate an integrated consolidation problem in the international supply chain, where a US manufacturing company buys multiple items from China. A proactive order consolidation strategy is proposed. Different from current practices, our approach consolidates items in China considering inland transportation in US. This strategy is modeled to minimize the total costs by effectively loading items into an ocean container considering subsequent inland transportation cost and handling cost given <b>container</b> capacity <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> constraints. Two difficult combinatorial optimization problems, such as a mode selection problem and a three-dimensional bin packing problem, are combined into the model. Due to the problem complexity, approximation algorithms are proposed to solve the model. The basic model is extended to consider the inland multi-stop delivery and multi-period planning horizon. Several solution methodologies are developed and evaluated to solve large-scale problems. Based on the numerical results, it is observed that our proposed methods could achieve up to 30 % cost savings compared with the current shipping practices. The algorithms we developed could obtain the good implementable solution in a reasonable time for real-world problems...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{experimental}} observation of novel vortex patterns in vertically vibrated granular rods. Above a critical packing fraction, moving ordered domains of nearly vertical rods spontaneously form and coexist with horizontal rods. The domains of vertical rods coarsen {{in time to}} form large vortices. We investigate {{the conditions under which}} the vortices occur by varying the number of rods, vibration amplitude and frequency. The size of the vortices increases with the number of rods. We characterize the growth of the ordered domains by measuring the area fraction of the ordered regions as a function of time. A void filling model is presented to describe the nucleation and growth of the vertical domains. We track the ends of the vertical rods and obtain the velocity fields of the vortices. The rotation speed of the rods is observed to depend on the vibration velocity of the <b>container</b> <b>and</b> on the <b>packing.</b> To investigate the impact of the direction of driving on the observed phenomena, we performed experiments with the container vibrated horizontally. Although vertical domains form, vortices are not observed. We therefore argue that the motion is generated due to the interaction of the inclination of the rods with the bottom of a vertically vibrated container. We also perform simple experiments with a single row of rods in an annulus. These experiments directly demonstrate that the rod motion is generated when the rods are inclined from the vertical, and is always {{in the direction of the}} inclination.
