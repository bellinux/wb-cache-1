30|$|An {{analysis}} of Pc 1 – 2 events indicates a seasonal variation, {{consistent with a}} similar variation in power. In contrast, examining the MLT dependence, {{in addition to a}} main peak of occurrence around noon, also observed in the power analysis, there is a minor peak near midnight. While <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> represent {{only a small fraction of}} the events observed around noon, midnight events are generally <b>polarized</b> <b>waves.</b> Both noon and midnight <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> exhibit a similar frequency distribution. The ellipticity values indicate primarily linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves,</b> with the major axis directed at ~  50 ° with respect to the H component. Our results suggest that the power peak at noon is due primarily to unpolarized waves, with a minor contribution represented by linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves.</b> This observation is interpreted as waves propagated far from the injection region up to the TNB latitude, in the high-latitude ionospheric waveguide along the meridional direction (Kim et al. 2011). The midnight events are very few with respect to the noon events, but are generally consistent with linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves.</b>|$|R

An elliptically <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> may be resolved into two linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> in phase quadrature, with their polarization planes at right angles to each other. Since the electric field can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise as it propagates, elliptically <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> exhibit chirality.|$|R

40|$|Theoretical and {{computational}} {{study for}} a polarization change of localized and finite amplitude Alfven waves propagating parallel to an {{applied magnetic field}} is presented using both reductive perturbation theory and numerical simulations. In the magnetohydrodynamic limit, where right-hand and left-hand circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> are degenerate, one of the transverse components of the circularly <b>polarized</b> Alfven <b>wave</b> is stable as it propagates, but the other component is unstable to either self-focusing or diffraction effects. Consequently, the wave changes its polarization from circular to linear. In the high frequency regime, where two circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> (right-hand and left-hand circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves)</b> are not degenerate, two transverse components of the circularly <b>polarized</b> Alfven <b>wave</b> are strongly coupled to each other, and {{there is almost no}} polarization change...|$|R

40|$|New {{steady-state}} {{solutions are}} derived which describe electromagnetic waves {{strong enough to}} make plasma ions and electrons relativistic. A two-fluid model is used throughout. The following solutions are studied: (1) linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> with phase velocity much greater than c; (2) arbitrarily <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> with phase velocity near c, in a cold uniform plasma; (3) circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> in a uniform plasma characterized by a scalar pressure tensor. All of these waves are capable of propagating in normally overdense plasmas, due to nonlinearities introduced by relativistic effects. The propagation of relativistically strong waves in a density gradient is examined, for {{the example of a}} circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> strong enough to make electrons but not ions relativistic.

40|$|A new {{spectral}} matrix {{method for}} detecting the arrivals of linearly or elliptically <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> {{was developed and}} applied to reflection imaging of the earth’s crust and upper mantle. In this method, parameter values representing the confidence levels of the detection of the arrivals of linearly or elliptically <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> are used to image the reflectors. This paper describes the theory {{for the detection of}} <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> and discusses their detectability in relation to a synthetic three-component signal. The dependence of detectability on time-window length and on the center frequency of the analysis was quantitatively evaluated for this signal. Next, earthquake data for events around Sendai, Japan with magnitudes ranging from 2. 0 to 5. 6 were analyzed and the reflectors imaged by a migration technique based on the confidence levels of <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> arrival detection. By assuming P-P and S-S reflections, reflectors due to characteristic changes in the mantle were identified at depths of 350 – 500 km, demonstrating the feasibility of using a spectral matrix to detect <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> and to image the earth’s crust and upper mantle...|$|R
50|$|The {{study of}} planar chiral {{metamaterials}} {{has revealed that}} planar chirality is associated with an optical effect: the directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection and absorption) of circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves.</b> Planar chiral metamaterials, which are also anisotropic and lossy exhibit different total transmission (reflection and absorption) levels for the same circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> incident on their front and back.The asymmetric transmission phenomenon arises from different, e.g. left-to-right, circular polarization conversion efficiencies for opposite propagation directions of the incident wave and therefore the effect {{is referred to as}} circular conversion dichroism.Like the twist of a planar chiral pattern appears reversed for opposite directions of observation, planar chiral metamaterials have interchanged properties for left-handed and right-handed circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> that are incident on their front and back. In particular left-handed and right-handed circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> experience opposite directional transmission (reflection and absorption) asymmetries.|$|R

We theoretically study two possible implementations of such hybrid materials: (1) the case of metal-dielectric stacks; and (2) rectangular waveguide near its cut-off frequency.
