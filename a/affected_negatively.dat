5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be <b>affected</b> <b>negatively,</b> positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E
5|$|When {{the power}} company's voltage becomes {{distorted}} due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition {{may lead to}} overheating and shorter operating life. Also, substation transformers and compensation capacitors are <b>affected</b> <b>negatively.</b> In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load {{may be required to}} install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.|$|E

500|$|Long-toed {{salamander}} {{populations are}} threatened by fragmentation, introduced species, and UV radiation. Forestry, roads, and other land developments have altered the environments that amphibians migrate to, and have increased mortality. Places such as Waterton Lakes National Park have installed a road tunnel underpass to allow safe passage and to sustain the migration ecology of the species. The distribution of the long-toed salamander overlaps extensively with the forestry industry, a dominant resource supporting the economy of British Columbia and the western United States. Long-toed salamanders will alter [...] behaviour and are <b>affected</b> <b>negatively</b> by forestry practices not offering sizable management buffers and protections for the smaller wetlands where salamanders breed. Populations near the Peace River Valley, Alberta, have been lost to the clearing and draining of wetlands for agriculture. Trout introduced for the sport fisheries into once fishless lakes are also destroying long-toed salamander populations. Introduced goldfish prey on the eggs and larvae of long-toed salamanders. Increased exposure to UVB radiation is another factor being implicated in the global decline of amphibians and the long-toed salamander is also susceptible to this threat, which increases the incidence of deformities and reduces their survival and growth rates.|$|E

40|$|Three organic materials, a {{municipal}} solid waste compost (MWC), a paper sludge (PS) and an agroforest compost (AC), were tested to relate their stability to the corresponding soil enzyme activity resulting from their application. PS and AC were stable materials, free of phytotoxic substances, although AC presented direct toxicity due to its high salinity and inhibited seed germination. The presence of heavy metal does not seem playing {{an important role in}} the phytotoxicity of the tested materials since, the highest values of germination index were obtained with PS material despite its high heavy metals concentration. However, MWC presented a low level of maturity <b>affecting</b> <b>negatively</b> seed germination, and indicating an inaccurate composting process. The application of the three organic materials to a sandy soil (at a rate equivalent to about 50, 000 kg ha- 1) increased soil enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, urease and benzoylargininamide hydrolyzing (BAA)) with respect to the control (soil without organic matter application) during one month of incubation. The positive effect of the organic materials on enzyme activities was more pronounced in the case of the MWC, a fresh organic residue having low organic matter stability. It suggested that the presence of phytotoxic substances did not <b>affect</b> <b>negatively</b> soil enzyme activities.
