40|$|The discovery, in the monkey, of “mirror” neurons, which fire in {{response}} {{both to the}} performance and to the observation of specific actions, has prompted extensive research into their properties, and into the possible functions of a putative mirror neuron system in humans. Little is known, however, about how such neurons acquire their matching properties. This thesis addresses this question {{using a variety of}} techniques. Imitation {{is one of the key}} processes thought to be subserved by the mirror neuron system; Chapter 3 shows that <b>automatic</b> imitation <b>effects</b> are separable from spatial compatibility <b>effects.</b> This establishes <b>automatic</b> imitation <b>effects</b> as suitable targets for experimental manipulations of mirror neuron system function. Strengthening this conclusion, Chapter 4 indicates that <b>automatic</b> imitation <b>effects</b> can be delayed by repetitive theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the inferior frontal gyrus, an area homologous with the premotor F 5 mirror neuron area in the macaque. In Chapter 5, single-pulse TMS is used to produce motor evoked potentials (MEPs). In an action observation experiment, an <b>automatic</b> muscle-specific “mirror” <b>effect</b> is shown: the size of the MEP in a given muscle is sensitive to the identity of the muscle that would be used to perform the observed movement. It is then demonstrated that this effect can be reversed following a period of incompatible sensorimotor training. This result is built upon in Chapter 6 : it is shown behaviourally that incompatible sensorimotor training can reduce <b>automatic</b> imitation <b>effects,</b> and, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, that it can reverse neural responses to observed actions in the human mirror neuron system. It is concluded that sensorimotor learning can reconfigure the human mirror neuron system, and that it is, therefore, a mechanism through which the mirror neuron system can acquire its ability to match observed with performed actions. ...|$|R

5000|$|Fortunately, {{definitions}} of the SI units are quite different from their practical realizations. For instance, the metre {{is defined as the}} distance light travels in a vacuum during a time interval of [...] of a second.

5000|$|As {{discussed}} above, one primary {{distinction between}} the two methods of challenging legislation in court is that a facial challenge to a statute seeks to invalidate it in its entirety because every application is unconstitutional, whereas an as-applied challenge seeks to invalidate a particular application of a statute. A second {{distinction between the}} two is that a facial challenge may be brought soon after a statute's passage in a legislature; however, an as-applied challenge, as the name suggests, can only be brought once it has been enforced. In this sense, a facial challenge is prospective, or forward looking, because it seeks to prevent a law from being enforced and thus violating someone's constitutional rights, and an as-applied challenge is retrospective, or backward looking, because it seeks to redress a constitutional violation that has already occurred. Since facial challenges have the potential to invalidate a statute in its entirety, they are said to be disfavored. Professor Richard Fallon of Harvard Law School has recently argued that both terms are ambiguous and not as easily distinguishable from one another. Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently acknowledged this fact. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, it stated, [...] "the distinction between facial and as-applied challenges is not so well defined that it has some <b>automatic</b> <b>effect</b> or that it must always control the pleadings and disposition in every case involving a constitutional challenge".|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that stimulus-response mappings that have been instructed but never applied overtly before can lead to automatic response biases when they are irrelevant. In the present study, we investigated whether the same applies to no-go instructions, which relate a stimulus to a no-go response.

In addition, the <b>automatic</b> <b>effect</b> of a no-go instruction was similar in size to the <b>automatic</b> <b>effect</b> of a go instruction.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{looks at}} two areas where electromyographic {{data from the}} cricothyroid muscle (CT) {{can be used to}} improve our {{understanding}} of the nature of the articulatory representations underlying control of F 0. The first area concerns consonant voicing: Robust differences in CT activity between voiced and voiceless consonants were found. A possible scenario accounting for higher F 0 on the vowel following voiceless consonants is put forward. Voicing-related F 0 differences on the vowel are thus seen as emerging automatically, contingent on consonant articulation. However, evidence was also found that some speakers may actively enhance such <b>automatic</b> <b>effects,</b> with CT differences persisting through the vowel. The second area involves two variations on the theme of vowel intrinsic pitch. Firstly, in the special case of the German tense-lax vowel contrast, a tendency was found for higher CT activity on the lax cognates. Lax vowels have sometimes been considered a problem for mechanical accounts of intrinsic pitch, since their F 0 is higher than would be expected from their tongue position. This result indicates that tongue-pull effects are indeed present, but may be overlaid by active articulatory adjustments. Analysis of vowel height then led to similar conclusions to vowel tenseness. The relationship between F 0 and CT activity revealed even more clearly that an <b>automatic</b> tongue-pull-style <b>effect</b> must be present. However, as for the consonant voicing results, it appeared that some speakers may enhance mechanically given effects, in this case showing higher CT activity for high vs. low vowels. The general conclusion is thus that articulatory control often latches onto mechanical effects, and tries to push them a little bit further. 1. Consonant Voicin...|$|R

To assess these claims, we used a version of the map task [1, 11] and tested 24 normal adult subjects in a baseline untimed monologue condition against conditions adding either feedback in the form of an indication of a supposed listener’s gaze, or time-pressure, or both. Both feedback and timepressure affected the nature of the speaker’s performance overall. Disfluency rate increased when feedback was available, as the strategic view predicts, but only deletion disfluencies showed a significant effect of this manipulation. Both the nature of the deletion disfluencies in the current task and of the information which the speaker would need to acquire in order to use them appropriately suggest ways of refining the strategic view of disfluency. 1...|$|E
