5|$|From 1932 to 1977, the Paramount Theater, {{originally}} {{built for}} $250,000, flourished in Amarillo. It had plush red carpet, murals and <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> organ, 1,433 seats, {{and was considered}} the finest theater north of Fort Worth. The building is now an office and parking garage.|$|E
50|$|The {{diameter}} of <b>a</b> flue <b>pipe</b> directly affects its tone. When comparing pipes of otherwise identical shape and size, <b>a</b> wide <b>pipe</b> {{will tend to}} produce a flute tone, <b>a</b> medium <b>pipe</b> <b>a</b> diapason tone, and <b>a</b> narrow <b>pipe</b> <b>a</b> string tone. These relationships {{are referred to as}} the scale of the pipe: i.e., wide-scaled, normal-scaled, or narrow-scaled. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>pipe's</b> scale increases, more fundamental will be present, and fewer partials will be present in the tone. Thus, the tone becomes richer and fuller as the pipe's diameter widens from string scale to principal scale to flute scale.|$|R
50|$|The end of {{the pipe}} {{opposite}} the mouth may be either open or closed (also known as Gedackt or stopped). <b>A</b> closed <b>pipe</b> sounds <b>an</b> octave lower than <b>an</b> open <b>pipe</b> of the same length. Also, <b>an</b> open <b>pipe</b> produces <b>a</b> tone in which both the even-numbered and the odd-numbered partials are present, while <b>a</b> stopped <b>pipe</b> produces <b>a</b> tone with odd-numbered partials. The tone of <b>a</b> stopped <b>pipe</b> tends to be gentler and sweeter than that of <b>an</b> open <b>pipe,</b> though this is largely {{at the discretion of}} the voicer.|$|R

5|$|The goal of tuning <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> organ is {{to adjust}} the pitch of each pipe so that they all sound in tune with each other. How the pitch of each pipe is {{adjusted}} depends on the type and construction of that pipe.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>pipe</b> organ {{contains}} {{one or more}} sets of pipes, a wind system, and one or more keyboards. The pipes produce {{sound when}} pressurized air produced by the wind system passes through them. An action connects the keyboards to the pipes. Stops allow the organist to control which ranks of pipes sound at a given time. The organist operates the stops and the keyboards from the console.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Charles Bennett {{appears as}} the {{entertainer}} {{at the head}} of the chorus line in the Inquirer party sequence, and cinematographer Gregg Toland makes a cameo appearance as an interviewer depicted in part of the News on the March newsreel. Actor Alan Ladd makes a cameo appearance as a reporter smoking <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> at the end of the film.|$|E
25|$|Access to an {{improved}} water source in El Salvador {{was estimated at}} 76% in 2006. Urban access was 90%, including about 13% lacking <b>a</b> <b>piped</b> connection to the house. Access in rural areas in 2006 was 50%, however only 38% of this total had <b>a</b> <b>piped</b> connection to the house. Most water in rural areas is drawn from groundwater wells.|$|R

50|$|The end of {{the pipe}} {{opposite}} the reed or mouth may be either open or closed (also known as stopped). <b>A</b> closed flue <b>pipe</b> with <b>a</b> uniform cross-section sounds an octave lower than <b>a</b> similar open <b>pipe</b> of the same length. Also, such <b>an</b> open <b>pipe</b> produces <b>a</b> tone in which both the even-numbered and the odd-numbered partials are present, while <b>a</b> stopped <b>pipe,</b> such as <b>a</b> gedackt, produces a tone with odd-numbered partials. The tone of <b>a</b> stopped <b>pipe</b> tends to be gentler and sweeter than that of <b>an</b> open <b>pipe,</b> though this is largely {{at the discretion of}} the voicer.|$|R

5|$|From 1893 Dunhill ran {{a company}} selling {{motoring}} accessories, and in 1902 opened a shop in Mayfair. He developed <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> designed for motorists in 1904. He opened a tobacconist's shop in St James's in 1907, offering tailored tobacco blends. Shops were opened in New York and Paris in the 1920s. With his international ambitions, Dunhill {{helped to create}} the modern luxury goods market. He retired from business in 1929, and married his mistress in 1945, {{following the death of}} his wife.|$|E

5|$|From 1931 to 1937, {{the church}} was reconstructed to a design by {{architect}} Francisco Porrata Doria. The current facade bears a French neoclassical style. Among these improvements were the addition of two new chapels, a new roof, the remodelling of the upper storey of the facade {{and the construction of}} two new, richly-decorated square towers. <b>A</b> <b>pipe</b> organ was installed in 1934 and re-inaugurated in 1989 after a nine-year restoration. The building was dedicated by Bishop James E. McManus on April 11, 1950.|$|E
5|$|In the basement, <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> blows {{and water}} leaks rapidly from it. Sasha rescues Hawk and Moth, but Tadpole doesn't {{make it out}} of the {{flooding}} basement. That night, a devastated Sasha dreams of Tigerstar and asks if Tadpole is with him. Tigerstar says no, but confides that he is safe. Sasha later meets with Pine, a loner she had previously met, and he takes her and the kits to a barn where another she-cat lives.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century several duck decoys were {{built on the}} moor. These {{consisted}} of {{a pool of water}} leading from which are from one to eight curving, tapering ditches. Over each ditch is a series of hoops, initially made from wood, later from iron, which diminish in size as the ditch tapers. The hoops are covered in netting. The combination of ditch and net-covered hoops is known as <b>a</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E
50|$|Snowboard {{facilities}} include <b>a</b> half <b>pipe,</b> <b>a</b> snow {{park and}} two border-crosses.|$|R
50|$|For a given length, <b>a</b> smaller-bore <b>pipe</b> holds <b>a</b> smaller {{volume of}} water than <b>a</b> larger-bore <b>pipe,</b> and {{therefore}} water in <b>a</b> smaller-bore <b>pipe</b> will freeze more easily (and more quickly) than water in <b>a</b> larger-bore <b>pipe</b> (presuming equivalent environments). Since smaller-bore <b>pipes</b> present <b>a</b> {{greater risk of}} freezing, insulation is typically used in combination with alternative methods of freeze prevention (e.g., modulating trace heating cable, or ensuring a consistent flow of water through the pipe).|$|R

5|$|Michael {{notes that}} he had gotten high at an Alicia Keys concert. During Michael's anti-drug meeting, he misidentifies hookah as an illegal drug; Toby points {{out the fact that}} it is merely <b>a</b> <b>pipe.</b> Dwight {{notes that he}}'ll have to bring in his b≈ç staff, a long staff weapon used in Okinawa and feudal Japan, to protect the office. Jim later notes that Dwight was dressed like a member of the disco group the Village People.|$|E
5|$|Related to {{this use}} of resonance, Messiaen also {{composed}} music in which the lowest, or fundamental, note is combined with higher notes or chords played much more quietly. These higher notes, far from being perceived as conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the timbre of the fundamental note like mixture stops on <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> organ. An example is {{the song of the}} golden oriole in Le loriot of the Catalogue d'oiseaux for solo piano (Example 4).|$|E
5|$|Several {{fires and}} {{industrial}} incidents {{occurred in the}} 1980s.

50|$|<b>A</b> flue <b>pipe</b> (also {{referred}} to as <b>a</b> labial <b>pipe)</b> is <b>an</b> organ <b>pipe</b> that produces sound through the vibration of air molecules, {{in the same manner}} as a recorder or a whistle. Air under pressure (called wind) is driven down a flue and against a sharp lip called a Labium, causing the column of air in the pipe to resonate at a frequency determined by the pipe length (see wind instrument). Thus, there are no moving parts in <b>a</b> flue <b>pipe.</b> This is in contrast to reed pipes, whose sound is driven by beating reeds, as in <b>a</b> clarinet. Flue <b>pipes</b> are common components of pipe organs.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>piped</b> water supply {{the service is}} not always {{reliable}} and residents occasionally have to obtain water via trucks or use rainwater when available.|$|R
5|$|Special unpitched stops {{also appear}} in some organs. Among {{these are the}} Zimbelstern (a wheel of {{rotating}} bells), the nightingale (<b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> submerged in a small pool of water, creating {{the sound of a}} bird warbling when wind is admitted), and the effet d'orage ("thunder effect", a device that sounds the lowest bass pipes simultaneously). Standard orchestral percussion instruments such as the drum, chimes, celesta, and harp have also been imitated in organ building.|$|E
5|$|Terrified, the {{engineer}} {{jumps into the}} chemical plant's waste pound lock to escape Batman and is swept through <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> leading to the outside. Once outside, he discovers to his horror that the chemicals have permanently bleached his skin chalk-white, stained his lips ruby-red and dyed his hair bright green. The engineer's disfigurement, compounded {{with the loss of}} his family, drives him completely insane and marks the birth of the Joker.|$|E
