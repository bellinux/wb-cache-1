5|$|The blow dealt to the community's {{industrial}} {{economy in the}} 1970s was slightly mitigated {{by the presence of}} auto production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the Avanti, an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by Studebaker to compete with the Corvette, was manufactured in an industrial complex on Youngstown's Albert Street. This company moved away <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years. A mainstay of Youngstown's {{industrial economy}} has long been the GM Lordstown plant. The General Motors' Lordstown Assembly plant is the largest industrial employer in the area. One of the nation's largest auto plants in terms of square feet, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and Cavalier. It was recently expanded and retooled with a new paint facility.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 UTC on 14 November 1963, {{the cook}} of Ísleifur II, a trawler sailing these same waters spotted a rising column of dark smoke {{southwest}} of the boat. The captain thought {{it might have been}} a boat on fire, and ordered the vessel to investigate. Instead, they encountered explosive eruptions giving off black columns of ash, indicating that a volcanic eruption had begun to penetrate the surface of the sea. By 11:00 the same day, the eruption column had reached several kilometres in height. At first the eruptions took place at three separate vents along a northeast by southwest trending fissure, but by the afternoon the separate eruption columns had merged into one along the erupting fissure. Over the next week, explosions were continuous, and <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days the new island, formed mainly of scoria, measured over 500metres (1640ft) in length and had reached a height of 45metres (147ft).|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Exclusion Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the {{continuing}} Plot trials, which seemed to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, {{for a second time}} that year, in mid-1679. Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.|$|E

5|$|On {{his way to}} the {{starting}} grid, Carlos Sainz Jr. stopped on track and had to be pushed back to pit lane, where he eventually started, only to retire <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred metres. At the start, both Mercedes drivers got away well and Hamilton tried to overtake Rosberg for the lead around the outside of the first corner, but were unable to do so. Jenson Button made a good start, moving from 16th to 13th, while Marcus Ericsson fell from 13th to 18th. Behind the leaders, the Ferrari drivers retained third and fourth place respectively. Bottas moved into fifth after moving around the outside. Hamilton was able to follow Rosberg closely in the opening laps, while Daniel Ricciardo was the first driver to pit for new tyres on lap four. One lap later, Grosjean was able to use drag reduction system (DRS) to overtake Felipe Nasr for eleventh. With his back row start and an early pit stop, Ricciardo overtook the two Manor Marussia cars around lap nine.|$|E

25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument.

25|$|The {{most common}} imaging {{modality}} {{to be used}} in hybrid ORs is a C-Arm.

25|$|The Wildcats {{started the}} season off strong with a 4–1 record, but things went south quickly after that. The Wildcats slumped to last spot in December with a 7–9 record as the club's injury toll started to bite—long-term {{injuries}} to Martin, Jarrod Kenny and Matt Knight hurt the Wildcats. Their recruiting was also put under the spotlight when they axed import Jaron Johnson in December {{for a second}} time—Johnson was first axed just three games into the season {{in order to bring}} in three-point specialist Andre Ingram. But when Ingram returned home <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days, citing mental issues, Johnson was reinstated.

He left the CBA in January 1989 and took a job with a Wall Street investment banking firm. Donovan was [...] "miserable" [...] during his brief stint as a stock broker, and he especially hated the required cold-call stock sales. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks at the firm, he called Rick Pitino to seek advice about becoming a basketball coach.

25|$|The car's first {{competitive}} outing was, as planned, at the 1978 24 Hours of Le Mans race, {{driven by}} Ian Grob and Guy Edwards, with Bracey himself acting as reserve driver. Edwards's {{presence in the}} team had an additional benefit as his skills at sponsorship negotiation landed the small Ibec team with backing from the giant Chrysler corporation, despite the 308LM being Ford-powered. Edwards also qualified the Ibec in 13th position, at an average speed of 133mph. However, in the race itself the car suffered from mechanical troubles which dropped it to 42nd position <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours. Despite recovering well from this early setback, in the 19th hour the DFV engine failed completely and the Ibec's race was over.|$|E

There an attempt was made to seat an international tribunal, but the Turks bungled the investigations and mishandled the documentary evidence so that nothing of their work could be used by the international court.|$|E
