50|$|One {{taste that}} Cramer does share with Wolfe {{is that he}} appears to enjoy <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>beer.</b> Wolfe often offers him one, except when the visit is {{particularly}} contentious.

50|$|The Royal Castle Hotel {{was built}} in 1639 on the then new quay. The {{building}} was re-fronted in the 19th century, and as the new frontage is itself listed, {{it is not possible}} to see the original which lies beneath. A claimant for the oldest building is a former merchant's house in Higher Street, now <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Beer</b> Guide listed public house called the Cherub, built circa 1380. Agincourt House (next to the Lower Ferry) is also 14th century.|$|E
5000|$|At the time, brewing was {{dominated}} by the [...] "big six" [...] breweries: Whitbread, Scottish and Newcastle, Bass Charrington, Allied Breweries, Courage Imperial and Watneys.There were also dozens of regional breweries, although the number was dwindling {{as a result of}} takeovers, and the microbrewery sector consisted of just four longstanding brewpubs. Most pubs were owned by breweries, and only allowed to offer the owning brewery's beers ("the tie"). Camra also campaigned against the tendency of smaller brewers to be bought up by larger ones, against short measures, for the preservation of historically significant pubs, and for increased choice and longer opening hours for pubs. Camra also produced <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Beer</b> Guide and campaigned for the preservation of mild ale, which was now seen as an endangered style.|$|E

60|$|I {{always have}} said wot <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing <b>beer</b> is, and it done Bill more good than doctor's medicine. When {{he came in}} he could 'ardly crawl, and at nine o'clock 'e {{was out of the}} easy-chair and dancing on the table as well as possible. He smashed three mugs and upset about two pints o' beer, but he just put his 'and in his pocket and paid for 'em without a word.|$|R

5000|$|In 1933, {{one year}} after Alfred and Amédée {{inherited}} their parents' brewery, they decided {{to compete with the}} English who occupied a good position on the market of strong beers, with an alcohol content ranging from 6 or 7 to 8%. That is how the brothers created the Bush beer, with its 12% alcohol content. To compete with the English, he gave an English name to his beer and translated it into English. Dubuisson bière would be translated into English as Bush beer. However, in the United States, the beer is sold under the name [...] "Scaldis" [...] (the Latin name of the river Scheldt). [...] In 1998, the name Bush beer changed to become the Amber Bush, which is the characteristic colour of this beer. [...] The brewery is totally independent; Hugues Dubuisson takes decisions alone. In terms of raw materials, the brewery is semi-independent, since the brewery has its own laboratory yeast culture and uses water drawn from its sub-soil. The brewery has its own well, the water used is drawn between 37 and 45 metres deep, very pure water, essential for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>beer.</b> The raw materials must be purchased. The hops and barley come from the Czech Republic.|$|E
50|$|The Kinga were {{primarily}} agriculturists with millet, beans, some bananas, cultivating bamboo for <b>a</b> strong <b>good</b> <b>beer,</b> and finally in 1905, growing wheat and potatoes. They inhabited the Livingstone Mountains to {{a height of}} 10,000 feet and maintained a moderate amount of cattle but mostly sheep and goats. Even though related, the Nyakyusa neighbors considered the Kinga to be distinct and different. According to them the Kinga were dirty, fawning, and submissive in their habits and manners, (not a marriage prospect but good enough to fight with in the Konde Revolt against the Germans), but were eager to acquire Kinga implements in exchange for food.|$|R

60|$|The {{behavior}} of Miss Evans {{was so much}} better next day that it really seemed as though her father's diagnosis was correct. At dinner, when the men came home from work, she piled Mr. Carter's plate up so generously that her father and brother had ample time at their disposal to watch him eat. And when {{he put his hand}} over his glass she poured half <b>a</b> pint of <b>good</b> <b>beer,</b> that other men would have been thankful for, up his sleeve.|$|R
50|$|The beer was {{originally}} produced by brewers {{in the town}} of Grodzisk Wielkopolski in the 14th or 15th century. Strict regulations regarding the quality of the beer were established by the local brewers' guild, and helped it develop <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reputation in the surrounding cities and neighboring countries. At the peak of its fame, it was exported to 37 countries and was regarded as <b>an</b> exceptionally <b>good</b> <b>beer.</b> The brewing industry in the town flourished. After the Second World War, beer production was nationalized, and the beer entered a period of decline under the Communist government of Poland. By 1993, the last brewery that was producing the style was shut down. After a period of years when the style was not available from any commercial brewers, several breweries began producing seasonal or year-round recreations of the historic style, spurred by interest in the style from the homebrewing community around the world.|$|R
50|$|The village pub {{is located}} in Church Street and is called the Foundry Arms. It is named after a once-famous foundry in the village. It has a bar, dining room and games room.

It is said to be founded by King William Rufus, but was not endowed or appointed till later times by Cardinal Beaufort. Every traveller that knocks at the door of this house in his way, and asks for it, claims the relief of a piece of white bread and a cup of beer, and this donation is still continued. <b>A</b> quantity of <b>good</b> <b>beer</b> is set apart every day to be given away, and what is left is distributed to other poor, but none of it kept to the next day.|$|R

40|$|To {{appraise}} {{the incidence}} of oxygen: in bottled beer, the stable nonradioactive oxygen isotope 18 O(2) was injected into the headspace just before ageing and subsequently analysed by proton bombardment and isotopic mass spectroscopy of all the most interesting beer fractions. Although oxygen did cause considerable oxidation of sulphites, polyphenols, and isohumulones, it was not incorporated into the carbonyl fraction, indicating that the cardboard flavour in beer is not due to lipid oxidation but to wort preparation. Nonenal potential measurement {{was found to be}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> indicator of <b>beer</b> flavour staling. The impact of beer stabilisation treatments (addition of polyvinyl pyrolidone powder, potassium metabisulphite, ascorbic acid) was also investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to estimate demand for wine in Australia, based on both the systems approach and the single equation approach. Both approaches consider demand for three categories of alcoholic drinks (beer, wine and spirits) in a seemingly unrelated regression framework to take account of cross-equation correlations. Time series data on retail price indexes and apparent per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages for Australia for the period 1975 / 76 to 1998 / 99 are used for econometric estimation. The results show that over the short run, beer and wine are necessities; however, over the long run, wine becomes <b>a</b> luxury <b>good.</b> <b>Beer</b> and wine are complements. Demand for all three beverages is price inelastic. The study also found that the behaviour of wine consumers reflect past consumption patterns, indicating that wine is more addictive than either beer or spirits. A structural change in consumer preferences away from cheaper cask wines to more expensive bottled table wines has {{a significant impact on the}} volume of wine consumption. Finally, wine consumption has increased over time. The study re-confirms the importance of developing a model that considers the impacts of both economic and non-economic variables on wine consumption. wine demand, demand analysis, almst ideal demand system, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R

50|$|The hotelier {{was persuaded}} {{to build a}} court by two brothers, Jose Marie and Felix Jayo, who ran a baker's shop across from the hotel at the time, and Albert Urberuaga. They had seen the {{potential}} for a proper court in the grounds of the hotel. For many months Sartoresi remained sceptical. The cost was an issue and he had never seen the game played. One afternoon, Sartoresi visited the Mendiolea farm, where he not only saw the vigorous and noisy game in progress, but noted how many people were gathered, and that <b>a</b> <b>good</b> amount of <b>beer</b> was being consumed as the afternoon passed. He came away with a change of heart. He could see that the initial cost of the court would be compensated by the increased clientele and the business they would generate.|$|R
