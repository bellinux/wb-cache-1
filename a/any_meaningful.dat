5|$|The U.S. had granted full de jure {{recognition}} to all three Baltic states by July 1922. The recognitions were granted during the shift from the Democratic administration of Woodrow Wilson to the Republican administration of Warren Harding. While the U.S. did not sponsor <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> political or economic initiatives in the region during the interwar period, and its administrations did not consider the states strategically important, it maintained normal diplomatic relations with the states.|$|E
5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> values of their own.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E

5|$|However, over time, the {{cumulative}} {{probability of a}} chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the Big Crunch or Big Rip scenarios {{for the end of}} the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1quadrillion (1015) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> sense, will cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|Suu's {{signature}} {{was required}} to pass the ruling, but he referred the matter to the HNC to get their opinion. The HNC turned down the request. There was speculation the HNC did this {{as many of them}} were old, and therefore did not appreciate the generals' negativity towards seniors—some South Vietnamese mockingly called the HNC the High National Museum. On December 19, a Saturday, the generals moved to dissolve the HNC by arresting some of its members. The HNC had already ceased to function in <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> way, as only 9 of the 17 members were still occasionally attending its meetings, and few on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|The first {{armoured}} cruisers {{had been}} built in the 1870s, as an attempt to give armour protection to ships fulfilling the typical cruiser roles of patrol, trade protection and power projection. However, the results were rarely satisfactory, as the weight of armour required for <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> protection usually meant that the ship became almost as slow as a battleship. As a result, navies preferred to build protected cruisers with an armoured deck protecting their engines, or simply no armour at all.|$|E
50|$|Scott Anderson's {{conclusion}} {{at the end}} of {{the article}} was that UN and NATO not only exhibited precious little interest in actually finding Karadžić, but they also actively sabotaged <b>any</b> such <b>meaningful</b> attempt from within their own ranks.|$|R
5000|$|In {{programming}} language theory, the qualification principle states that <b>any</b> semantically <b>meaningful</b> syntactic class may admit local definitions.

50|$|Many {{different}} ways to segment a market have been identified. Business-to-business (B2B) sellers might segment the market into different types of businesses or countries. While business to consumer (B2C) sellers might segment the market into demographic segments, lifestyle segments, behavioral segments or <b>any</b> other <b>meaningful</b> segment.|$|R
5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E
5|$|After subduing {{the cities}} around the capital, Thomas {{resolved}} to attack Constantinople from three sides, perhaps hoping his assault would impress its inhabitants or lead to defections. His deputies Anastasius and Gregory Pterotos would attack the Theodosian land and sea walls, respectively, while he would lead the main attack against the less formidable defenses protecting Blachernae. All of Thomas's forces were amply supplied with siege engines and catapults, and his fleet fielded quantities of Greek fire in addition to large shipborne catapults. Each of Thomas's attacks failed: the defenders' artillery proved superior and kept Thomas's engines away from the land walls, while adverse winds hindered the fleet from taking <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> action. Deciding that operations {{in the midst of}} winter were hazardous and unlikely to succeed, Thomas suspended all further attacks until spring and withdrew his army to winter quarters.|$|E
5|$|Because Florida State had {{received}} the game's opening kickoff, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. As in the first half, however, the Virginia Tech offense failed to advance the ball in <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> fashion. Marcus Vick threw two incompletions and running back Cedric Humes managed a short three-yard dash. Forced to punt the ball away yet again, Virginia Tech set up the game's critical play. From his 34-yard line, punter Nic Schmitt kicked the ball 49yards to the Seminoles' Willie Reid, who broke through the Virginia Tech special teams punt coverage for an 89-yard punt-return touchdown. Reid's return was the first touchdown {{of the game and}} the first touchdown in ACC Championship Game history. With 13:46 remaining in the third quarter, Florida State had taken a 103 lead.|$|E

[...] It also serves as a guide and constraint in deriving equations that may describe a physical system {{in the absence of a}} more rigorous derivation.|$|R
5|$|Famitsu {{enjoyed the}} higher speed of battle {{compared}} to Episode I. Parkin echoed these sentiments while also noted how mechanics such as Boost {{and the addition}} of side quest content made the game better than its predecessor. GamePro positively noted that the first game's mechanics had been made more approachable for series newcomers, while Massimilla felt that the simplified nature of the character growth system brought down the experience in addition to being shorter than other RPGs available at the time. Nutt felt that the alterations made battles far more enjoyable despite the character growth system lacking <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> customization options. Dunham echoed other reviewers' opinions on both the upgrades to battle and the reworked character progression system, in addition to the lack of in-game currency to buy items.|$|E
5|$|In 849, Calakmul was {{mentioned}} at Seibal where a ruler named as Chan Pet attended the K'atun-ending ceremony; his name {{may also be}} recorded on a broken ceramic at Calakmul itself. However, {{it is unlikely that}} Calakmul still existed as a state in <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> way at this late date. A final flurry of activity took place {{at the end of the}} 9th century or the beginning of the 10th. A new stela was erected, although the date records only the day, not the full date. The recorded day may fall either in 899 or 909 with the latter date the most likely. A few monuments appear to be even later although their style is crude, representing the efforts of a remnant population to maintain the Classic Maya tradition. Even the inscriptions on these late monuments are meaningless imitations of writing.|$|E
5|$|On 29 March 1944, Duke of York and {{the bulk}} of the Home Fleet left Scapa Flow to provide a support force for Convoy JW 58. The ship {{operated}} in the Arctic and as cover for carriers conducting the Goodwood series of air strikes on Tirpitz in mid to late August. In September, when she was overhauled and partially modernized at Liverpool, radar equipment and additional anti-aircraft guns were added. She was then ordered to join the British Pacific Fleet and sailed in company with her sister-ship Anson on 25 April 1945. A problem with the ship's electrical circuitry delayed her while she was at Malta and, as a result, she did not reach Sydney until 29 July, by which time it too late for her to take <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> part in hostilities against the Japanese.|$|E
50|$|The club {{played as}} an {{anonymous}} side the East German fourth division Berzirksliga Potsdam {{through most of}} the 50s and 60s. In the mid-70s Neuruppin began a climb that took them to a first-place finish in Group 1 of the division in 1980, but despite being unable to advance from there, they continued to finish strongly until the mid-80s. They did not enjoy <b>any</b> other <b>meaningful</b> on-field success until the turn of the millennium.|$|R

5|$|Since {{they lacked}} the forces to take Nikolaev {{in a single}} campaign, the seizure of Kinburn proved to have limited {{strategic}} effect. Nevertheless, the attack on Kinburn was significant in that it demonstrated that the French and British fleets had developed effective amphibious capabilities and had technological advantages that gave them a decisive edge over their Russian opponents. The destruction of Kinburn's coastal fortifications completed the Anglo-French naval campaign in the Black Sea; the Russians no longer had <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> forces left to oppose them at sea. The British and French navies planned to transfer forces to the Baltic Sea the following year to strengthen operations there. Diplomatic pressure from still-neutral Austria convinced Czar Nicholas I of Russia to sue for peace, which was concluded the following February with the Treaty of Paris.|$|E
5|$|The {{next few}} years were {{similarly}} unsuccessful with regards to his plans. Eventually, he tried to bypass the opposition in the Sejm with secret alliances, dealings, and intrigues, but did not prove successful. Those plans included schemes such as supporting the Holy Roman Emperor's raid on Inflanty in 1639, which he hoped {{would lead to a}} war; an attempted alliance with Spain against France in 1640–1641, and in 1641–1643, with Denmark against Sweden. On the international scene, he attempted to mediate between various religious factions of Christianity, using the tolerant image of the Commonwealth to portray himself as the neutral mediator. He organized a conference in Toruń (Thorn) that begun on 28 January 1645, but it failed to reach <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> conclusions.|$|E
5|$|Catesby {{waited for}} Percy's {{return from the}} north, before making his decision. He thought the letter too vague to {{constitute}} <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> threat to the plan, and decided to forge ahead. As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder, other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands. Salisbury, already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, did not yet know {{the exact nature of}} the plot or who exactly was involved. He elected to wait, to see how events unfolded. On 3November, Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London. Although the nature of their discussion is unknown, Fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred, as later accounts told how Percy had been seen at the Duke of York's lodgings, enquiring as to the movements of the king's daughter. Nicholls mentions that a week earlier—on the same day that Monteagle received his letter—Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes, to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth.|$|E
50|$|HAMSAT VO-52 {{failed in}} Space on 11 July 2014, while on its 49,675th orbit, {{due to the}} failure of {{on-board}} lithium ion batteries that have met their end of life. Although the satellite's systems and sub-systems are working normal as per the latest telemetry received, the on-board computer recurring to ‘Reset’ mode due {{to the failure of}} batteries is hindering operation. Hence, it was decided not to expect <b>any</b> more <b>meaningful</b> and reliable services from HAMSAT VO-52. On 21 July 2014, ISRO has decommissioned ‘HAMSAT-VO52′ officially.|$|R
50|$|In 663, {{near the}} end of the Korean Three Kingdoms period, the Battle of Baekgang (白村江) took place. The Nihon shoki records that Yamato sent 32,000 troops and 1,000 ships to support Baekje against the Silla-Tang force. However, these ships were intercepted and {{defeated}} by a Silla-Tang fleet. Baekje, without aid and surrounded by Silla and Tang forces on land, collapsed. Silla, now viewing Wa Japan as a hostile rival, prevented Japan from having <b>any</b> further <b>meaningful</b> contact with the Korean Peninsula until a far later time. The Japanese then turned directly to China.|$|R
25|$|Rain {{destroyed}} <b>any</b> {{chance of}} <b>meaningful</b> play on this day.

5|$|In 1933, the devoutly Catholic Diệm was {{appointed}} Interior Minister of Vietnam, serving under Emperor Bảo Đại. However, {{a few months}} thereafter he resigned and became a private citizen because the French colonialists would not give Vietnam <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> autonomy. During World War II, Imperial Japan attacked Indochina and wrested control from France, but when they were defeated by the Allies in 1945, a power vacuum was created. The communist-dominated Viet Minh of Ho Chi Minh fought for Vietnamese independence, while the French attempted {{to regain control of}} their colony by creating the French Union-allied State of Vietnam under Bảo Đại. A staunch anti-communist nationalist, Diệm opposed both and attempted to create his own movement, with little success. With both the French and the communists hostile to him, Diệm felt unsafe and went into self-imposed exile in 1950. He spent the next four years in the United States and Europe enlisting support, particularly among Vatican officials and fellow Catholic politicians in America. The success of the effort was helped by the fact that his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was the leading Catholic cleric in Vietnam and had studied with high-ranking Vatican officials in Rome a few decades earlier.|$|E

The communist-dominated Viet Minh of Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and fought for independence, while the French attempted to regain control of their colony, and created the State of Vietnam under Bảo Đại, which was an associated free state within the French Union. A staunch anti-communist nationalist, Diệm opposed both and attempted to create his own movement, with little success. With both the French and the communists hostile to him, Diệm felt unsafe and went into self-imposed exile in 1950, leaving Vietnam {{for the first time in}} his life. He did so as the communists had sentenced him to death in absentia, while the French refused to give him protection, claiming that they had no resources. Diệm spent most of the next four years in the United States and Europe enlisting support, particularly among fellow Catholic politicians in America and Vatican officials. Diệm's success with the latter group was helped by the fact that his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was the leading Catholic cleric in Vietnam and had studied with high-ranking priests in Rome.|$|E
5|$|In mid-February 1944, the 37th Battalion, {{as part of}} 14th Brigade, was {{involved}} in the Battle of the Green Islands, codenamed Operation Squarepeg. The aim was to secure an airfield for use in further advances in the Solomon Islands. On 15 February, the battalion was landed on the western side of Nissan Island, largely a coral reef, along with 35th Battalion. The 30th Battalion was landed on {{the eastern side of the}} island; collectively, the landings were the largest amphibious operation mounted by New Zealand forces in the war. Although the Japanese were present on the island, the landing was unopposed. Initially positioned to the north of the island's airstrip, it later moved to the village of Sior. Although the Japanese were reported to be in the south of the island, the battalion still carried out patrols to ensure none were still in their sector. Later in the month, soldiers from the battalion carried out landings on Sau, a small island to the northeast of Nissan Island, to deal with Japanese there. Four were wounded in exchanges of gunfire but this operation effectively ended <b>any</b> <b>meaningful</b> Japanese resistance in the area. With Nissan Island secure by 28 February, the battalion switched to a defensive mode of operations, monitoring for Japanese counterattacks and assisting in the building of the facilities necessary to allow the island to be used for air and sea operations.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{legislation}} in North Korea has tightened in recent years, {{although it is}} still relatively lax and has not had <b>any</b> really <b>meaningful</b> effect on curtailing smoking rates. The rules on where people can or cannot smoke are complex, with smoking prohibited on sidewalks, ferries, airplanes and at stations, in health-care and educational facilities, kindergartens and nurseries, shops, theaters, cinemas, culture halls and conference rooms, historic and battle sites, and hotel lobbies. However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.|$|R
40|$|Economists {{should pay}} more {{attention}} to value formation in economic analysis. First, preferences are not stable in <b>any</b> operationally <b>meaningful</b> sense. <b>Any</b> estimated micro behavior that does not take account of the consequences of the behavior on underlying preferences is incapable of serving as a guide to future action. Second, the economist's model of human psychology is inaccurate and misleading. Third, most analyses of complex social behavior start from models incapable of producing empirical results adequate for useful structural analyses. The paper suggests avenues for making progress on each of these issues, beginning with a different approach to utility maximization. ...|$|R
40|$|There exist two equally prominent, though {{seemingly}} divergent metaphilosophical viewpoints. One takes {{philosophy to}} be an essentially revolutionary process.
