5|$|Iyo Railway {{bus service}} runs up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> peninsula, {{to and from}} Yawatahama, and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama. However, {{commuter}} buses run infrequently and, due {{to the length of}} the peninsula and the scattered nature of the town's neighborhoods, bus travel remains more expensive and less convenient than in denser areas. Some tour buses also come across the strait from Kyūshū by ferry.|$|E

5|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} duck has a {{very large}} range extending across four continents.

5|$|After King Francis I {{commissioned}} Jacques Cartier {{to search}} out an eastern route to Asia, the city of Port Royal was founded on 27 July 1605 in what is today Nova Scotia. From there, the French Crown's empire in the Americas grew to include areas of land surrounding the Great Lakes <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River, as well as islands in the Caribbean, and the north eastern shore of South America; the Viceroyalty of New France was eventually made into a royal province of France in 1663 by King Louis XIV. Some regions were lost to the Spanish or British Crowns through conflict and treaties, and those that were still possessions of the French king on 21 December 1792 came under republican rule when the French monarchy was abolished on that day.|$|E
5|$|After being commissioned, both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the US Atlantic Fleet. The two operated up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> American east coast from July until November. On 2 November, as part of the Second Battleship Division, the ships left the Boston Navy Yard for a training voyage to Europe, where they visited the Isle of Portland in the United Kingdom and Cherbourg in France. In January 1911, they returned to the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba before continuing to another base in Norfolk. After further maneuvers, the two ships split up; Michigan remained on the east coast, while South Carolina embarked on another trip to Europe. The ship visited Copenhagen (Denmark), Stockholm (Sweden), Kronstadt (Russia), and Kiel (Germany)—the last during Kieler Woche, a large sailing event—before returning in July 1911.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} home, Hinton {{initially was}} indecisive {{about what to}} do with his life. Like many of his fellow soldiers who had returned home, he struggled to adapt to civilian life. He was also extremely uncomfortable with the public attention he received because of his status as a VC recipient. He eventually found work managing hotels on behalf of Dominion Breweries. He was initially based at the Thistle Hotel, a notorious drinking establishment in Auckland, for three years, during which he received a belated mention in despatches for his escape attempts while a POW. In December 1949 he moved to Hamilton to manage the Hamilton East Hotel. This was the first of many moves up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> country to manage hotels.|$|E
5|$|After {{their return}} to the U.S., the {{brothers}} and Katharine were invited to the White House where President Taft bestowed awards upon them. Dayton followed up with a lavish two-day homecoming celebration. In July 1909 Orville, with Wilbur assisting, completed the proving flights for the U.S. Army, meeting the requirements of a two-seater able to fly with a passenger for an hour {{at an average of}} speed of 40 miles an hour (64km/h) and land undamaged. They sold the airplane to the Army's Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps for $30,000 (which included a $5,000 bonus for exceeding the speed specification). Wilbur climaxed an extraordinary year in early October when he flew at New York City's Hudson-Fulton celebrations, circling the Statue of Liberty and making a 33-minute flight up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Hudson River alongside Manhattan in view of up to one million New Yorkers. These flights solidly established the fame of the Wright brothers in America.|$|E
5|$|At {{a public}} meeting in Alresford on 14 May, Onslow {{reported}} that subscriptions to the defence fund were already pouring in, and that invitations {{to visit and}} speak had been received from many towns. As the Claimant addressed meetings up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> country, journalists following the campaign often commented on his pronounced cockney accent, suggestive of East London origins. The campaign drew in some high-level supporters, among whom was George Hammond Whalley, a controversial anti-Catholic who was MP for Peterborough. He and Onslow were sometimes incautious in their speeches; after a meeting in St James's Hall, London, on 11 December 1872, each made specific charges against the Attorney General and the Government of trying to pervert the course of justice. They were both fined £100 for contempt of court.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of her seventh and final journey for American Export, Siboney was handed over on 28May 1941 to the U.S.Army for transport duty. After a hasty outfitting, the redesignated USAT Siboney was put to work transporting troops. Based in New York, she made trips up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic and into the Caribbean, and, {{by the end of}} 1941, had called at Bermuda, San Juan, Trinidad, St. John's, Charleston, Newport News, Cristóbal, Jamaica, and Panama.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it was a}} {{self-contained}} section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and the branch line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes set on the Tube even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate signage, as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are maintained in operational condition, and a train of ex-Northern line 1972 tube stock is permanently stabled on the branch. This train can be driven up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> branch for filming. The physical connection with the Piccadilly line northbound tracks remains, but requires manual operation.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{pipeline}} caused a massive economic boom in towns up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pipeline route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported {{the pipeline}}. By 1976, after the town's residents had endured a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 {{by the summer of}} 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century, {{the street}} {{began to be}} popular with the bourgeoisie living around Mayfair. Shop owners let out their upper storeys for {{residential}} purposes, attracting lodgers such as Jonathan Swift, George Selwyn, William Pitt the Elder and Laurence Sterne. In 1784, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, an active socialite, demanded that people boycott Covent Garden as its residents had voted against Whig member of parliament Charles James Fox. This had caused him to lose his seat in parliament, leading to {{the dissolution of the}} Fox–North Coalition. She insisted people should look for nearer shopping streets, and encouraged people to go to Bond Street. Consequently, the street became a retail area for people living in Mayfair. By the end of the century, an upper-class social group known as the Bond Street Loungers had appeared, wearing expensive wigs and parading up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street in a pretentious manner.|$|E
5|$|Early {{vehicles}} were {{built by a}} number of independent companies, but in 1844 the railway started to build carriages at Swindon railway works, which eventually provided most of the railway's rolling stock. Special vehicles included sleeping cars, restaurant cars and slip coaches. Passengers were also carried in railmotors, autotrains, and diesel railcars. Passenger-rated vans carried parcels, horses, and milk at express speeds. Representative examples of these carriages survive in service today on various Heritage railways up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{authority}} {{would have}} {{rested on the}} control of cotton and edible plants and associated trade relationships, with power centered on the inland sites. Haas tentatively suggests that {{the scope of this}} economic power base may have extended widely: there are only two confirmed shore sites in the Norte Chico (Aspero and Bandurria) and possibly two more, but cotton fishing nets and domesticated plants have been found up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Peruvian coast. It is possible that the major inland centers of Norte Chico were {{at the center of a}} broad regional trade network centered on these resources.|$|E
