5|$|To {{help him}} out, Bart gets Buck {{a job on}} Krusty the Clown's show, but Buck gets drunk and makes <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> himself on air, {{crushing}} Bart. Seeing this, Marge and Homer decide to help Buck overcome his alcoholism, so they clean out Buck's house and enroll him in an Alcoholics Anonymous program. Despite making progress, Buck is not restored to hero-status for Bart.|$|E
5|$|After Bart and Lisa see Krusty the Clown do {{his show}} at the Mt. Splashmore water park on TV, they {{consistently}} irritate and supplicate Homer about going there. Homer gets annoyed, but reluctantly decides to take them there. The family goes to Mt. Splashmore, where Bart, Lisa and Homer ride an intense water slide named H2WHOA!. Due to his weight, Homer gets lodged in the water slide mid-course and the park's rescue crew are forced {{to shut down the}} ride and remove him {{with the help of a}} large crane. Homer is made <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> on the news for his massive size and admits that he needs to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E

25|$|David is {{a failed}} comedian and rocker who also fails {{to grasp the}} notion of {{political}} correctness. He tends to either make <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> {{himself in front of}} the office crew or make it intensely uncomfortable. The one who seems to enjoy him the most is Sam Bisaillon, former army cadet who worships David. He shares his desk with Louis Tremblay, who is secretly in love with the shy receptionist Anne Viens. The problem is that Anne is engaged to Luc, a macho warehouse employee.|$|E
25|$|After Superman IV in 1987, Reeve's {{relationship}} with Exton fell apart, and they separated. He moved to New York without his children. He became depressed {{and decided that}} doing a comedy might be good for him. He was given a lead in Switching Channels. Burt Reynolds and Kathleen Turner had a feud during filming, which made the time even more unbearable for Reeve. Reeve later stated that he made <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> himself in the film and {{that most of his}} time was spent refereeing between Reynolds and Turner. The film did poorly, and Reeve believed that it marked the end of his movie star career. He spent the next years mostly doing plays. He tried out for the Richard Gere role in Pretty Woman but walked out on the audition because they had a half-hearted casting director fill in for Julia Roberts.|$|E
25|$|The War Committee {{had only}} agreed (28 December 1915) with some {{reluctance}} to make {{preparations for the}} Western Front Offensive agreed at Chantilly, which Haig and Joffre agreed (14 February) {{should be on the}} Somme, although Robertson and the War Committee were not pleased at Joffre’s suggestion that the British engage in “wearing out” attacks prior to the main offensive. For three months, against a backdrop of Russia planning to attack earlier than agreed, Italy reluctant to attack at all and the scaling-down of the planned French commitment because of Battle of Verdun, Robertson continued to urge the politicians to agree to the offensive. He increasingly believed that France was becoming exhausted and that Britain would carry an ever greater burden. After Robertson promised that Haig “would not make <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> himself” (he told Repington that Haig was “a shrewd Scot who would not do anything rash”), the War Committee finally agreed (7 April).|$|E

500|$|By 1953, Waugh's {{popularity}} as {{a writer}} was declining. He was perceived as {{out of step with}} the Zeitgeist, and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available. His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy, Officers and Gentlemen, had stalled. Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating. Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: [...] "they tried to make <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> me, and I don't think they entirely succeeded", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford. Peter Fleming in The Spectator likened the interview to [...] "the goading of a bull by matadors".|$|E

500|$|A {{shortage}} of cash {{was the principal}} reason why, in 1953, Waugh agreed to be interviewed on radio by the BBC, first in the Overseas Service's Personal Call programme {{and then in the}} Frankly Speaking series. The second of these was broadcast on the BBC Home Service on 16 November 1953. Most of Waugh's friends thought that he had acquitted himself well, and he was mildly pleased with the result, writing to Nancy Mitford that [...] "they tried to make <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> me and I don't think they entirely succeeded". Nevertheless, the broadcasts preyed on Waugh's mind; he saw hostility in the attitudes of his interlocutors, a point noted by his 13-year-old son Auberon Waugh, who later wrote that the interviews [...] "drove my father mad". His friend, the poet John Betjeman, gave him William Burges's Narcissus washstand but Waugh became convinced that an ornamental tap was missing from the washstand, and was shaken when Betjeman denied the tap had ever existed.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{eventually}} supplant Christianity with a religion more amenable to National Socialist ideology, Himmler, together with Alfred Rosenberg, sought {{to replace it with}} Germanic paganism (the indigenous traditional religion or Volksreligion of the Germanic peoples), of which the Japanese Shinto was seen as an almost perfect East Asian counterpart. For this purpose they had ordered the construction of sites for the worship of Germanic cults in order to exchange Christian rituals for Germanic consecration ceremonies, which included different marriage and burial rites. In Heinrich Heims' Adolf Hitler, Monologe im FHQ 1941-1944 (several editions, here Orbis Verlag, 2000), Hitler is quoted as having said on 14 October 1941: [...] "It seems to be inexpressibly stupid to allow a revival of the cult of Odin/Wotan. Our old mythology of the gods was defunct, and incapable of revival, when Christianity came...the whole world of antiquity either followed philosophical systems on the one hand, or worshipped the gods. But in modern times it is undesirable that all humanity should make such <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Fridays article, Hearst sent Parsons {{an angry}} letter {{complaining}} {{that he had}} learned about Citizen Kane from Hopper and not her. The incident made <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> Parsons and compelled her to start attacking Welles and the film. Parsons demanded a private screening of the film and personally threatened Schaefer on Hearst's behalf, first with a lawsuit {{and then with a}} vague threat of consequences for everyone in Hollywood. On January 10 Parsons and two lawyers working for Hearst were given a private screening of the film. James G. Stewart was present at the screening and said that she walked out of the film. Soon after, Parsons called Schaefer and threatened RKO with a lawsuit if they released Kane. She also contacted the management of Radio City Music Hall and demanded that they not screen it. The next day, the front page headline in Daily Variety read, [...] "HEARST BANS RKO FROM PAPERS." [...] Hearst began this ban by suppressing promotion of RKO's Kitty Foyle, but in two weeks the ban was lifted for everything except Kane.|$|E

500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in something. You might make <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe in that, you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you." ...|$|E
500|$|Rhys becomes {{determined}} {{to join the}} hospital surgical program led {{by the head of}} surgery, Martin Chambers (John Wood). When Karl makes a potentially dangerous mistake on a prescription form, Rhys covers for him, but makes it clear he wants something in return. Knowing Karl plays golf with Martin, Rhys asks to join their game so he can try and impress the surgeon. Despite being warned that Martin does not like to talk shop during his golf games, Rhys reveals that he has been following his career and Martin is impressed. Barber explained to a writer for Inside Soap [...] "And Karl {{has no choice but to}} agree that Rhys is a good doctor. It's a bit awkward, because Karl doesn't like the way Rhys operates— so to speak!" [...] Martin grants Rhys an interview for a place on the surgical program; however he forgets everything he knows and makes <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> himself due to being hungover. Rhys misses out on a place on the program and Barber told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he is feeling [...] "devastated and desperate." [...] Barber described the position as the Holy Grail for Rhys and because of a stupid act, he has lost it.|$|E

Rex's tennis coach Tara (Michaela McManus) tries to stop the fight, but Rex had accidentally {{hit her in the}} face. Michael (Jason Isaacs), Rex's father, is called to the school, when Rex tells Michael and Tara that he quit. He is very emotional due to Hannah's (Laura Allen) death, according to Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones). Later in the [...] "red reality", Efrem Vega (Wilmer Valderrama), Michael's partner in the reality, and Michael are called on a new case at a hotel room, where a woman falls into a lake from the hotel. They speak to Cameron Fuller (Eddie Matos) and Darin Knox (Eric Lange) about the case. Fuller and Knox noted that they Fuller dumped the lady, and she was [...] "making <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> herself", because she was so drunk. Fuller thought that he [...] "shouldn't have left her alone". Soon after, as they walking away, Michael sees Rex's former babysitter Kate Porter (Brianna Brown). Michael doesn't introduce Vega to her. Later in his [...] "green reality", Bird (Steve Harris), Michael's partner in this reality, works on a case where a man named Charlie Simmons, who is known to party and take drugs, was murdered. They speak to Dora (Angela Elayne Gibbs) about the case, she leads them to Kate Porter's house in the [...] "green reality". Rather than a successful investment banker, she is a drug addict.

500|$|Identified by Ayn Bernos of Thought Catalog as [...] "the {{epitome of}} a ... control freak", Refinery29's Kelsey Miller {{summarized}} Monica's personality as funny, uptight, loving, and competitive. A very organized character with a signature Type A personality who enjoys being in charge, Monica {{is known for}} being a [...] "neat freak" [...] obsessed with cleanliness – {{especially when it comes}} to maintaining the impeccable condition of her apartment – neurotic, extremely obsessive-compulsive, and competitive in nature, personality traits that are exaggerated for humor and comic relief; the writers did not begin to take full comedic advantage of Monica's neuroses until the show's first Thanksgiving episode. The character is also the loudest of her friends. In her book Writing With Emotion, Tension, and Conflict: Techniques for Crafting an Expressive and Compelling Novel, author Cheryl St. John wrote that Monica exhibits qualities commonly associated with perfectionism and bossiness. James Tison of Bustle wrote that Monica's cleanliness and bossiness often relinquishes her to being [...] "the lame one" [...] among her friends, although [...] "she proved that sometimes rules and responsibility were important". However, the Los Angeles Timess Steve Weinstein observed that Monica's actions often tend to contradict her [...] "Miss Perfect" [...] image and reputation, explaining that the character frequently [...] "makes <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> herself" [...] in addition to being [...] "so compulsively neat that just her facial expressions of discomfort at one of her friends' messing things up in her apartment is enough to provoke genuine chuckles." [...] Although several of Monica's personality traits and mannerisms make the character a strong candidate for obsessive-compulsive disorder, they are treated as [...] "quirky and amusing" [...] as opposed to a disability or disease; her friends either ignore or find humor in her peculiarities.|$|E
500|$|According to Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] {{reference}} a state of romantic obsession. Beyoncé said that the song talks [...] "about how, when you are falling in love, you {{do things that are}} out of character and you do not really care because you are just open." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control." [...] The lyrics are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: [...] "Yes! So crazy right now. Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been inhaling the chain smokers, how you think I got the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees." [...] She then sings the chorus again and the song fades out with the horns.|$|E
