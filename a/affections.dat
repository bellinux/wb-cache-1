40|$|<b>Affection</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} needs of humans. The current study aimed at better understanding how affectionate communication positively influences others, specifically through prosociality. It was hypothesized that individuals who give or receive <b>affection</b> more frequently are more altruistic and tend to feel more empathy, love, and compassion towards others. Self-report responses about one’s capacity for positive emotions and prosocial traits were compared between those who give <b>affection</b> often and those who receive <b>affection</b> frequently. Results found positive associations between given and received <b>affection,</b> positive emotions, and prosocial traits. Notably, received <b>affection</b> was more associated with altruism than given <b>affection.</b> These findings illustrate how <b>affection</b> is an evolutionary advantage and benefits interactions with acquaintances and strangers...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The use of <b>affection</b> in {{relationships}} {{plays an important}} role in developing and maintaining relationships (Floyd, 2006). However, affectionate communication can also provide substantial risks to individual and relational health when it is misattributed (Floyd and Burgoon, 1999, Floyd and Voloudakis, 1999 a). The present dissertation assessed 526 participants to examine the process of deceptive <b>affection,</b> both intensified and deintensified, as a communicative tool used to satisfy goals, and how the use of deceptive <b>affection</b> relates to relational health within three relational contexts: friends with benefits, cross-sex friendships, and romantic relationships. The Deceptive <b>Affection</b> Scale (DAS) was created to assess individuals' use of deceptive <b>affection.</b> Results suggest FWBRs produce more deceptive <b>affection,</b> both intensifying and deintensifying, than cross-sex friendships and romantic relationships. Additionally, different goals predicted the use of intensified and deintensified deceptive <b>affection</b> across relational contexts. Finally, results would suggest that deintensifying <b>affection</b> has minimal influence on relational outcomes, however, intensifying <b>affection</b> is negatively associated with relational health. The current study contributes to the expanding literature on <b>affection,</b> particularly deceptive <b>affection,</b> <b>affection</b> exchange theory, and FWBR literature. Implications for findings, limitations, and areas of future research are addressed...|$|R
40|$|Despite its {{connection}} with relationship satisfaction, research on physical <b>affection</b> is scarce and fails to disentangle {{private and public}} displays of <b>affection.</b> It is important to examine both types if marginalized couples are less comfortable displaying <b>affection</b> publicly. The present study examined whether same-sex couples display less public (but not private) physical <b>affection</b> than different-sex couples due to stronger feelings of relationship marginalization. It also examined how public/private <b>affection</b> and marginalization relate to relationship satisfaction. Women in committed same-sex and different-sex relationships completed surveys of public <b>affection,</b> private <b>affection,</b> marginalization, and relationship satisfaction online. As predicted, women in same-sex relationships displayed less public <b>affection</b> than those in different-sex relationships, an effect mediated by general societal marginalization. Both private and public <b>affection</b> predicted higher relationship satisfaction, whereas feelings of marginalization by friends/family predicted lower relationship satisfaction. We discuss implications for relationship counseling and propose new {{ways of looking at}} marginalization...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Humans have {{a desire}} for a {{connection}} among others, and they also have {{a desire for}} both giving and receiving <b>affection,</b> regardless of class, age, gender, cultural or religious backgrounds. There is a plethora of research on the health benefits for both giving and receiving <b>affection</b> in romantic and family relationships. However, {{there is a lack of}} research about the benefits of receiving <b>affection</b> in the workplace. The general discourse surrounding workplace <b>affection</b> is negative because it is viewed as inappropriate in a workplace setting. However, <b>affection</b> is innate and humans are adept at giving and receiving <b>affection.</b> In fact, there are consequences on a person’s mental and physical health when this desire is not met. Therefore, the objective of this study was to understand if <b>affection</b> in the workplace could be beneficial on an employee’s perception of stress, depression, and job satisfaction. Also, to learn if the personality characteristics self-esteem, introversion and trait <b>affection</b> impact perceptions of <b>affection</b> in the workplace. The study found that personality characteristics do play a role in perceptions of received coworker <b>affection.</b> The study also found that <b>affection</b> does have an impact on stress, depression and job satisfaction...|$|R
50|$|Floyd {{had done}} much {{work in the}} area of <b>affection</b> {{involved}} in communication processes before introducing this theory. One of the areas that was so unique in the study of <b>affection</b> was the idea of the expectations involved in <b>affection</b> exchange. Canary et al. (2008) point out that the expectations involved in <b>affection</b> exchange as well as a curiosity about the evolutionary and biological bases for <b>affection</b> expectations are what led Floyd to develop this theory (p. 72). Canary et al. (2008) also note, “In AET, <b>affection</b> is thought of as an adaptive behavior that is helpful to long-term human survival by promoting bonding and increased access to resources. If this theory is correct, <b>affection</b> ought to increase as its ability to enhance survival increases” (p. 72).|$|R
40|$|<b>Affection</b> {{games are}} ludic {{experiences}} in which players {{are required to}} express culturally recognized expressions of liking as a primary goal in the game. Interestingly, while the physical world of analog play has many such activities, the digital world has been relatively limited in affording players the ability to express <b>affection</b> as the primary game goal. <b>Affection</b> games in digital play exist as somewhat esoteric clusters {{across a variety of}} cultures and super genres. This paper defragments the diverse set of <b>affection</b> games, collecting, cataloging and describing the games in detail. The paper provides a content analysis of <b>affection</b> games and an overview of their preponderance on the web. This paper organizes <b>affection</b> games into a simple classification based on their game verbs. These are flirting, hugging, kissing, and sexual <b>affection.</b> The content analysis provides the attributes through which the <b>affection</b> games are clustered. Notable patterns from the content analysis include indications that kissing and sexual <b>affection</b> are most common, while hugging games are the rarest. There is also a strong coupling of targeted gender identification and the types of <b>affection</b> made playable. These patterns are indicated both in the spaces in which they are distributed and in their content. As the game industry and the academic research community look for new ways to understand and engage wider demographics, the lessons learned from studying <b>affection</b> games may prove useful. <b>Affection</b> games reveal cultural values, taboo, and may potentially expand the space of pro-social play...|$|R

50|$|<b>Affection</b> can {{be communicated}} by words, gestures, or touches. Affectionate {{behavior}} may have evolved from parental nurturing behavior {{due to its}} associations with hormonal rewards. Such <b>affection</b> {{has been shown to}} influence brain development in infants. Expressions of <b>affection</b> can be unwelcome if they pose implied threats to one's well being. If welcomed, affectionate behavior may be associated with various health benefits. It has been proposed that positive sentiment increases the propensity of people to interact and that familiarity gained through <b>affection</b> increases positive sentiment among them. <b>Affection</b> can be displayed in different manners in different cultural societies. For example, in the Manchu ethnic group, mothers publicly kissing their infant is viewed as inappropriate, while publicly performing fellatio on their infant son is considered an appropriate act of <b>affection.</b> Some individuals such as alexithymics may have difficulty or even an inability to feel or express <b>affection.</b>|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to create and pilot a framework for examining affectionate behaviors in toddler group care environments using a focal child technique. Twelve toddlers (6 boys and 6 girls) were observed for the first three hours of the morning classroom session. The affectionate behaviors that were studied included: physical <b>affection,</b> non-physical <b>affection,</b> touch, smiling, physical contact, and hold. Teacherchild affectionate displays were observed during free play, group time, and mealtime. The following research questions were examined: (1) What is the frequency of <b>affection</b> between toddlers and teachers in high subsidy classrooms? (2) Does the frequency of affectionate behaviors displayed by teachers vary by the gender? (3) Does <b>affection</b> between toddlers and teachers vary by classroom context? Study findings show that teacher-child affectionate behaviors in observed toddler classrooms were extremely low and that the incidence of <b>affection</b> varied by classroom context. Physical contact occurred more often than any other form of <b>affection.</b> Boys received more <b>affection</b> from teachers than girls. The highest frequency of <b>affection</b> occurred during free play and less frequently during group time. Implications for future research are presented.
