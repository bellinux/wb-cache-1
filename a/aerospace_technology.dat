5|$|By 1976, a twinjet layout, {{similar to}} the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the {{baseline}} configuration. The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil <b>aerospace</b> <b>technology,</b> including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In June 1975, O'Neill led a ten-week {{study of}} {{permanent}} space habitats at NASA Ames. During the study {{he was called}} away to testify on July 23 to the House Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. On January 19, 1976, he also appeared before the Senate Subcommittee on <b>Aerospace</b> <b>Technology</b> and National Needs. In a presentation titled Solar Power from Satellites, he laid out his case for an Apollo-style program for building power plants in space. He returned to Ames in June 1976 and 1977 to lead studies on space manufacturing. In these studies, NASA developed detailed plans to establish bases on the Moon where space-suited workers would mine the mineral resources needed to build space colonies and solar power satellites.|$|E

25|$|In <b>aerospace</b> <b>technology,</b> Indonesia has a {{long history}} in {{developing}} military and small commuter aircraft as the only country in Southeast Asia to produce and develop its own aircraft, also producing aircraft components for Boeing and Airbus, with its state-owned aircraft company (founded in 1976), the Indonesian Aerospace (Indonesian: PT. Dirgantara Indonesia), which, with EADS CASA of Spain developed the CN-235 aircraft, which has been exported to multiple countries. B. J. Habibie, a former Indonesian president {{played an important role in}} this achievement. While active as a professor in Germany, Habibie conducted many research assignments, producing theories on thermodynamics, construction, and aerodynamics, known as the Habibie Factor, Habibie Theorem, and Habibie Method respectively.

25|$|Soon after Atal Bihari Vajpayee became Indian Prime Minister, he {{authorised}} {{nuclear weapons}} testing at Pokhran. The United States strongly condemned this testing, promised sanctions, and voted {{in favour of}} a United Nations Security Council Resolution condemning the tests. President Bill Clinton imposed economic sanctions on India, including cutting off all military and economic aid, freezing loans by American banks to state-owned Indian companies, prohibiting loans to the Indian government for all except food purchases, prohibiting American <b>aerospace</b> <b>technology</b> and uranium exports to India, and requiring the US to oppose all loan requests by India to international lending agencies. However, these sanctions proved ineffective - India was experiencing a strong economic rise, and its trade with the US only constituted {{a small portion of}} its GDP. Only Japan joined the US in imposing direct sanctions, while most other nations continued to trade with India. The sanctions were soon lifted. Afterward, the Clinton administration and Prime Minister Vajpayee exchanged representatives to help rebuild relations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s China had {{numerous}} specialized national corporations handling import and export transactions {{in such areas}} as arts and crafts, textiles, natural produce and animal byproducts, foodstuffs of various kinds, chemicals, light industrial products, metals and minerals technology, industrial machinery and equipment, petrochemical and petroleum products, scientific instruments, <b>aerospace</b> <b>technology</b> and services, ships, and weapons. Although nominally supervised by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade each of these corporations was responsible for its own profits and losses. Included among these enterprises, for example, was the Great Wall Industrial Corporation, which imported and exported transportation vehicles, satellites and other products associated with aerospace programs, mechanical equipment, electrical products, hardware and tools, medical apparatus, and chemicals. China Northern Industrial Corporation, subordinate to the Ministry of Ordnance Industry, used military production facilities to manufacture civilian products for export. The business activities of China Northern Industrial Corporation included the sale of heavy machinery, hardware and tools, and heavy-duty vehicles; light chemical industry products, such as plastic, paints, and coatings; and high-precision machinery and optical and optical-electronic equipment. Other corporations offered a variety of professional consulting services. One of these, the China International Economic Consultants Corporation, provided economic and legal expertise on investment and other economic activities.|$|E

500|$|In November 1960, John F. Kennedy {{was elected}} {{president}} after a campaign that promised American superiority over the Soviet Union {{in the fields of}} space exploration and missile defense. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the [...] "missile gap" [...] that he and many other senators felt had formed between the Soviets and themselves due to the inaction of President Eisenhower. Beyond military power, Kennedy used <b>aerospace</b> <b>technology</b> as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US not [...] "first but, first and, first if, but first period." [...] Despite Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president. He knew little about the technical details of the space program, and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing. When Kennedy's newly appointed NASA Administrator James E. Webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.|$|E
500|$|It {{took about}} six weeks to write the Blood Beast script. It was written under the working title Creature from Galaxy 27, which was {{conceived}} by Varno, but the Corman brothers later changed it to Night of the Blood Beast. Gene Corman received film credit for conceiving the film's story, but Varno claimed he wrote the film almost entirely himself and that Corman {{had little to do}} with the story: [...] "He had some rambling ideas but they didn't have very much to do with the movie that became Night of the Blood Beast." [...] Varno also said of him: [...] "Gene didn't open his mouth, really, until Roger told him he could." [...] Varno said he wrote the screenplay alone and showed parts of it to Roger and Gene Corman as he went along. Varno researched medical and <b>aerospace</b> <b>technology</b> at a library in Hollywood near Vine Street. The story, which fictionally portrays America's manned voyage into space, was heavily influenced by the real life Space Race ongoing between the United States and Soviet Union at the time. Gene Corman said another major inspiration was The Thing from Another World (1951), a Howard Hawks-directed science fiction film about a group of soldiers and scientists threatened by an alien creature in a remote Arctic research outpost. He said of the film, [...] "How could you not be ? We had to be, if only indirectly or subconsciously. That was a classic film then, a classic film today." [...] However, Varno said any influence from The Thing was only subconscious: [...] "I loved some of the scenes in The Thing and I'm sure that crept in one way or another, but not overtly." ...|$|E
