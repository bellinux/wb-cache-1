5|$|The {{war between}} France and the Emperor broke out {{once again in}} September 1551. In due course Northumberland {{rejected}} requests for English help from both sides, which {{in the case of}} the Empire consisted of a demand for full-scale war based on an Anglo-Imperial treaty of 1542. The Duke pursued a policy of neutrality, <b>a</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>act</b> that made peace between the two great powers attractive. In late 1552 he undertook to bring about a European peace by English mediation. These moves were taken seriously by the rival resident ambassadors, but were ended in June 1553 by the belligerents, the continuance of war being more advantageous to them.|$|E

To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

However, Redmond, a Parnellite, was chosen as a compromise due to the personal rivalries between the anti-Parnellite Home Rule leaders. Therefore, he never had as much control over the party as his predecessor, his authority and leadership <b>a</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>act</b> having to contend with such powerful colleagues as John Dillon, William O'Brien, Timothy Healy and Joseph Devlin.

25|$|Female mate {{guarding}} is {{the act of}} guarding {{a potential}} partner away from other competing females. It occurs when women mate with males that are seen as desirable due to their paternal value, see mate value, {{and are therefore more}} likely to attract other females. Over 50% of females asked in a survey admitted to poaching (see Mate poaching) another woman’s’ mate, as well as 50% of men admitting that they were unfaithful when presented with a poaching female. It is therefore <b>a</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>act</b> between having close female friendships that can help with childcare, and the sharing of resources, but not letting friends become too close that they have easy access to poach successfully. Females have therefore come up with tactics to ward of any potential threats.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the selling}} of Liberty Bonds, the {{government}} raised $ for the war effort. The majority of sales were not to individuals but to banks and financial groups that ignored the patriotic appeal and bought the bonds principally as an investment opportunity. The bond campaigns themselves proved relatively ineffective at gaining widespread public support. The majority of Americans were simply uncomfortable converting {{a significant portion of}} their savings into what was, for them, a new and uncertain form of investment. The forceful sales atmosphere associated with the Liberty Bond campaigns ultimately produced disappointing sales figures. As such, the bond campaigns are remembered more for their associated level of coercion and bullying than its patriotic and voluntary nature.

500|$|Response towards Weaves {{from music}} journalists upon release was {{generally}} favorable. Critics from publications like Exclaim! and Noisey praises included the record's combination of numerous musical styles {{to the point}} where the overall genre the EP could be labeled its own category or could be very hard to pin-point. Noisey said that the EP [...] "experiments and dips across genre lines in <b>a</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>act</b> between of laxity and concentration, without all of the pretension and exclusivity that normally accompanies a buzzing indie band". A more mixed review came from Liz Fox of Popmatters, finding most of the aspects of Weaves typical of indie music released in the previous fifteen years but praising Burke's [...] "sultry" [...] vocal performance that [...] "improve the elaborate backdrop, allowing for some simplicity among the chaos". Now called the EP an [...] "excellent introduction for new fans", writing that its only downfall was the track [...] "Do You See Past" [...] due to its [...] "more sophisticated, less interesting electro-pop sound". In a list by another Popmatters journalist of the best indie rock albums of 2014, Weaves ranked number eight.|$|E
500|$|Thi was {{a senior}} member in the ten-man ruling junta, which wanted to expand the {{military}} effort against the communists, something that was opposed by the Buddhist protestors. Thi performed <b>a</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>act</b> and accommodated the Buddhists, wanting them {{to see him as}} a friend. He allowed the students to publish a magazine that was highly critical of military rule. Thi also manoeuvred to have his trusted subordinate Colonel Pham Van Lieu installed {{as the head of the}} national police—a body controlled by the army and effectively a military unit—increasing his political power. Following his ascension, Lieu replaced most of the Saigon district police chiefs with Thi supporters, raising the ire of some other prominent officers. The Buddhist activist leader Thích Trí Quang said that [...] "Thi is nominally a Buddhist, but does not really care about religion". In June 1965, Quat and Sửu resigned because of persistent disputes with the military and one another; Thi had an opportunity to take power. Quat resigned and tried to directly hand over power to Thi, but this was not allowed by the generals. Nevertheless, Thi was offered the prime ministerial position by his colleagues. He was seen as having a similar level of political influence to Kỳ, and was voted in as prime minister by the ten-man junta. However, he declined the job offer on the private advice of Lieu, who told him that the political conditions were not ideal and that he should let a rival take control and fail before stepping in himself. According to Kahin, [...] "to his [...] own bitter disappointment, he was never given a second chance". Thi's blunder was a great relief to the Americans, who were aware of the fact that Thi—despite being anti-communist—had a hostility towards American advice. Kỳ and Thiệu, both pro-American and supportive of a drastic escalation in anti-communist military activity, became prime minister and head of state respectively, the latter post being largely ceremonial. Regardless of who held the top jobs, no officer had firm control over his peers, and the respective corps commanders were effectively allowed to independently rule their own regions in return for ongoing support of the junta.|$|E

[...] It doesn't [...] "deviate" [...] from Dion's mainstream audience, yet it [...] "dips its toe" [...] into modern music, particularly dance, while [...] "keeping hip" [...] ("Nature Boy"). Although Erlewine described [...] "Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)" [...] as [...] "bizarre", he wrote that [...] "there's really nothing to fault it on, actually," [...] the album is [...] "more ambitious than it needs to be, covers more stylistic territory than any other Dion record, while never abandoning the middle-of-the-road; it's <b>a</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>act</b> that nobody since Barbra Streisand has been able to pull off." [...] According to Erlewine, the songs aren't [...] "that particularly memorable", [...] "the mood shifts effortlessly, it never seems to stay in one place," [...] but it [...] "never catches hold, either." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave A New Day Has Come three out of five stars. According to him, Dion is great at what she does and [...] "if she ever tried anything too edgy she'd probably just sound foolish." [...] Cinquemani disliked [...] "Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)" [...] but praised [...] "Sorry for Love" [...] on which Dion [...] "gets the Cher treatment", an unexpected [...] "change of pace that actually works." [...] Among other highlights he mentioned two covers, a [...] "soulful" [...] rendition of [...] "At Last" [...] and a [...] "simple and moving" [...] arrangement of [...] "Nature Boy". He also noticed that the album is [...] "packed" [...] with the usual adult contemporary songs: [...] "I Surrender", a power ballad [...] "only a singer with Dion's voice could pull off," [...] "Ten Days", the guitar-driven [...] "catchy pop-rocker with a surprisingly edgy vocal," [...] "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)", a track featuring Shania Twain on backing vocals that [...] "will leave you nauseous or in tears", [...] "I'm Alive", the [...] "uplifting" [...] midtempo number and [...] "A New Day Has Come", the [...] "stirring" [...] title track.|$|E

These were {{on the first floor}} of the , built 1829 in Queen Street. The performance was in three parts. In Part I he demonstrated the Chest of Archimedes and the Column of Rosbach. These were entertaining pieces of mechanical apparatus previously shown at the Cabinet of curiosities in Paris. This was followed by numerous illusions, including A Game at Whist, Time Flies, The Wax Candles Enchanted, Elephant of Knowledge, Vulcan's Forge, Miraculous Printing, Flying Watch, Magic Bottle, Apples of Beelzebub, Magic Eggs and Loyal Metamorphose. Part II began with a ventriloquist act called Rogueries of Nicholas. He followed this by whistling various birdsong impressions. This popular party piece was developed via a [...] "variety of scenes and characters drawn from nature, introductory of His Surprising Powers of Imitation" [...] in which he contorted his face, told stories and performed tricks of ventriloquism. In Part III he performed [...] "feats of strength in the character of a Chinese buffo", suggesting that in Parts I and II he was most likely wearing the customary evening dress of the Victorian theatre magician, and that such a costume was less suitable for acrobatics than loose Chinese pyjamas. The strongman act was followed by [...] "gymnastic exercises" [...] or acrobatics involving bodily contortions with <b>a</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>act.</b> Last of all came the climax of the performance: the Aerial Suspension Illusion. In certain theatres he used to ban sale of tickets to the gallery, because the view from there might betray the secret of the illusion.|$|E
