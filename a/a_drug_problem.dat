After their split, Fagen worked on a song for the soundtrack of the film Heavy Metal, which got him back in the studio. He began working towards a solo album shortly thereafter.

Later, Michael, Dwight, Ryan and Ryan's colleague, Troy Underbridge (Noel Petok) (who Dwight is certain is a Hobbit due to his short stature) wait outside another club, but fail to get in because they do not have dates. Dwight comes to the rescue when he manages to pair each of them with members of a women's basketball team, who are also waiting in line.

500|$|Accordingly, one of {{the main}} events was the Intercontinental Championship match between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith, brothers-in-law in real life as Smith was married to Diana Hart, Bret's sister.

Bruce Hart publicly supported Smith, while Owen Hart sided with his brother Bret. Diana stated that she did not know who she wanted to win the match, as she had close ties to both men. She ultimately stated that she simply hoped that neither wrestler would get hurt. Prior to the match, Smith was hospitalized with a legitimate staph infection in his knee, which he suffered during a match with Mike Sharpe on July 20 in Worcester, Massachusetts (the fact was revealed by his wife Diana years later on the Hart & Soul documentary); despite the concerns about his health, he decided to wrestle the match as planned.

5000|$|The NDPS Act {{was criticized}} in The Times of India. The paper {{described}} {{the law as}} [...] "ill-conceived" [...] and [...] "poorly thought-out" [...] due to the law providing the same punishment for all drugs, which meant that dealers shifted their focus to harder drugs, where profits are far higher. The paper also argued that the Act had [...] "actually created <b>a</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>problem</b> where there was none."

[...] Similarly, Perry was astonished by how Carson [...] "can take the most absurd lines and deliver them in such grammatized form with his eyes and his deep rich speaking voice." [...] Jonathan Cherry, who recently emerged in the 2003 film House of the Dead, was appointed as Rory Peters. Cherry characterized Rory as [...] "a very opposite of me whose arc goes from, 'I don't really care at all', to 'Oh my God, this is really happening!'" [...] In the script, Bress said that Rory was his favorite character to write since [...] "he's great comic relief, he's got <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> <b>problem,</b> he's funny, and he's all that." [...] Bress bragged that [...] "Cherry is awesome, awesome casting cause he's just so funny and the way he delivers his lines. It's like 'Oh yeah. That's good! That's better!'" [...] "What I think was surprising on him was that from all of the humor he's involved and his sort of itchiness that he has with Kat, there is some moments where he reveals how vulnerable he really is and so the shield comes down and right in there you're really becoming sympathetic to Rory. You like him at first cause he's the funny guy, but then you care about him because you realize that there's a place that humor comes from that we all share," [...] Perry appended.|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{philosophy}} of the NA program, most addicts did not realize they had a problem with drugs until they had none left. Even if other people pointed out they may have <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> <b>problem</b> they were convinced otherwise. But once an addict on his or her own tries to stop and realizes they cannot, they finally see that drugs have been controlling them. Addicts lived to use and used to live. NA helps show them a different way of life and helps them fight their disease. NA describes [...] as a progressive disease with no known cure, which affects every area of an addict's life: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. NA suggests that the disease of addiction can be arrested, and recovery is possible through the NA twelve-step program. The steps never mention drugs or drug use, rather they refer only to addiction, to indicate that addicts have a disease of which drug use is one symptom. Other symptoms include obsession, compulsion, denial, and self-centeredness.|$|E
