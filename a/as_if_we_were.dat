25|$|The {{implications}} of people's preference for novelty for human relationships are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily {{from studies of}} people's reactions to art objects and the like. This is different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects {{are very different from}} people. If a piece of art becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating us <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> someone else, for such treatment would pose serious questions about the integrity of people's belief systems. Consequently, people probably balance competing desires for predictability and novelty by indulging the desire for novelty within contexts in which surprises are not threatening (e.g., leisure activities), while seeking coherence and predictability in contexts in which surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.|$|E

After the album was released, the Get Back/Let It Be project was re-examined, and work on it continued into 1970. Therefore, Let It Be became the last album to be finished by the Beatles, even though its recording had begun before Abbey Road.|$|E
500|$|However, not all reviews were favorable. Brian Lowry from Variety {{gave the}} series a mixed review, stating that {{he enjoyed the}} action {{sequences}} but that [...] "the soapier elements mostly fall flat", and called the series [...] "painfully old-fashioned". Mike Hale, from The New York Times, called the series [...] "average" [...] and [...] "good on the action, a little muddled on the ideas". He added that [...] "the tone is placid and slightly monotonous, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> watching the Walton family {{at the end of}} the world".|$|E

500|$|Born Robert Bard Kurrle in Port Hueneme, California on February 2, 1890, Kurrle had {{at least}} one sibling, Ernest W. Kurrle. [...] Prior to his entry into the film industry, Kurrle was already an {{innovative}} filmmaker. [...] In 1909, flying in a Curtiss open cockpit bi-plane, he photographed the Panama Canal from the air. In 1913, Kurrle would become the first photographer to take an aerial photograph of the city of Oakland, California. Describing the experience, Kurrle said [...] "... we went along just as smoothly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> riding on velvet".|$|E
500|$|We {{as readers}} or {{audience}} appreciate the characters {{by the force}} of our imagination's seeming to participate in the scene, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> present during such an event in real life. Commenting on the scene in Julius Caesar where Caesar confides to Marc Antony his apprehensions about Cassius, Hazlitt writes: [...] "We know hardly any passage more expressive of the genius of Shakespeare than this. It is {{as if he had been}} actually present, had known the different characters and what they thought of one another, and had taken down what he heard and saw, their looks, words, and gestures, just as they happened." [...] In [...] "Hamlet", he observes that [...] "the characters think and speak and act just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. [...] The whole play is an exact transcript of what might be supposed to have taken place at the court of Denmark [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|A {{paramedic}} {{also said}} police allowed the first ambulances that reached Pearl Roundabout to pass safely, while some security personnel captured videos, {{but when the}} ambulances moved out carrying casualties security forces had targeted the vehicles. He said: [...] "Later Bahrain T.V. showed only the scenes where they allowed us to pass in order to mislead the public opinion. I personally heard orders given to security forces via their communication devices to target, threat and delay paramedics {{as long as they}} can. Security forces dealt with us <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> defendants and partners to protesters who wanted to hide them, whereas what we were doing was a professional and humane duty {{that has nothing to do}} with our political position." [...] When the block was lifted in the late morning till noon, paramedics did not find any casualties to take back to the SMC at Pearl Roundabout, despite seeing handcuffed protesters being stomped on by police when they arrived.|$|E

500|$|For {{the final}} scene, several {{producers}} hired horse riders {{in order to}} lead a herd of horses to run through the corn field. After this scene was complete, Utada wore the same outfit designed by Kozue Hibino, which is a large coated–dress with a trail of puffy inserts, and sung {{it in the same}} location. The ending scene was co-directed by Emmanuel Previnarie, Sze Kwan Chong and Marc Asmode, where they used a flying camera on a small helicopter to accomplish an aerial shot of Utada on the corn field. Regarding the female animation at the start, Utada believed it was a representation of her and further exclaimed their inspiration of the video was from the 1997 film Princess Mononoke; [...] "The people who were doing the on-the-spot filming seemed to have my sort of make. Like, not very adult-like and not very feminine... much like <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all Princess Mononoke. Uggh, it looks like I'll be getting more female fans now!"

500|$|Holy Wood debuted and {{peaked at}} number 13 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 117,279—an initial {{commercial}} disappointment. It spent 13 consecutive {{weeks on the}} chart before dropping off – far short of the 52 and 33 weeks Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals spent on the chart, respectively – making it the shortest-charting full-length LP by the band until The High End of Low (2009). It took over two years to be certified gold by the RIAA (in March 2003), denoting shipments in excess of 500,000 units. As of 2010, the album has sold over 573,000 copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Manson attributed its lack of commercial appeal to the musical climate of the time, and argued that, {{at the height of the}} band's popularity, their US album sales peaked between one and two million units, so [...] "it's not such a disaster <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> coming down from seven or eight million records." [...] He also said that the drop in US sales was off-set by increasing international success.|$|E
500|$|Bicycling was {{the latest}} craze in the United States in 1896, and among those who came to salute McKinley was a brigade of bicyclists, who pulled images of McKinley and Hobart behind their vehicles, and {{performed}} tricks as they went to see their presidential candidate. The people of Canton joined in enthusiastically, and restaurants and souvenir venders expanded their operations. [...] A popular source of keepsakes was the wood of McKinley's front porch or fence, whittled as supporters listened, and the blades of his lawn, when not trampled underfoot, made later appearances in scrapbooks. In between delegations, McKinley entertained visitors; future Secretary of State John Hay, a major backer, came to Canton reluctantly, not relishing the crowds, but wrote [...] "he {{met me at the}} [...] station, gave me meat & took me upstairs and talked for two hours as calmly & serenely <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> summer boarders in Bethlehem, at a loss for means to kill time.

500|$|In his 1961 article [...] "The Abstract Sublime", {{originally}} published in ARTnews, the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and Turner with the Abstract Expressionist paintings of Mark Rothko. Rosenblum specifically describes Friedrich's 1809 painting The Monk by the Sea, Turner's The Evening Star and Rothko's 1954 Light, Earth and Blue as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, [...] "Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us {{on the threshold of}} those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detail—a bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscape—is no longer necessary; we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> looking at a sunset or a moonlit night." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilligan {{reasoned}} that, because Mulder and Scully {{would appear}} on a nationally syndicated television series, the episode's main monster could not be shown, only [...] "hinted at". Gilligan and the writing staff applied methods previously used in the 1999 psychological horror film The Blair Witch Project to show as little of the monster as possible while still making the episode scary. Michael Watkins, who directed the episode, had a good rapport with the Los Angeles police department. As such, he secured real Sheriff's deputies as extras. Casting director Rick Milikan later explained that the group needed [...] "actors who could pull off the believability in just normal off-the-cuff conversation of cops on the job." [...] During the crack house scene, real SWAT team members were hired {{to break down the}} doors. Actor Judson Mills later explained that, because there were few cameramen and owing to {{the manner in which the}} episode was filmed, [...] "people just behaved <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> [...] cops. I had other cops waving and giving their signals or heads-up the way they do amongst themselves. It was quite funny".|$|E
500|$|Boam and Cuse did {{not intend}} for the series to be {{historically}} accurate. Their aim was to create an action-adventure with a modern feel. Cuse told USA Today, [...] "We're not approaching this show <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing a period piece. We {{see it as a}} contemporary program. Our characters just happen to be living in the West with 1990s sensibilities. The Indiana Jones movies were period pieces too, but you never thought of them that way." [...] Anachronisms and pop culture references were intentionally inserted into the series. The show was intended to be family friendly, so violence was minimized in favor of having Brisco think his way out of dangerous situations. Boam said, [...] "In the two-hour pilot Brisco doesn't even once have to shoot his gun. Our violence is cartoonish. There is no pain and suffering." [...] Bruce Campbell was prominently featured in advertisements, billboards, and even a trailer shown in movie theaters. When the series was being promoted in the summer of 1993, Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushow said that if Campbell [...] "isn't the next big television star, I'll eat my desk".|$|E

500|$|Critics often {{praised the}} {{performances}} by Swank and Sevigny; Peter Travers said the pair [...] "give performances that burn in the memory", and The Film Stage termed Swank's performance [...] "one of the greatest" [...] Best Actress Oscar-winning performances. Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle lauded the lead acting performances of Swank, Sevigny, Saarsgard, and Sexton III, writing, [...] "It {{may be the}} best-acted film of the year". Online film reviewer James Berardinelli gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four; he highlighted the performances of Swank and Sevigny as the film's greatest success and likened the film's intensity to that of a train wreck. Berardinelli wrote that Swank [...] "gives the performance of her career" [...] and that [...] "Sevigny's performance is more conventional than Swank's, but no less effective. She provides the counterbalance to the tide of hatred that drowns the last act of the film." [...] Emanuel Levy of Variety called the acting [...] "flawless" [...] and concluded that the [...] "stunningly accomplished" [...] and [...] "candid" [...] film could be [...] "seen as a Rebel Without a Cause for these culturally diverse and complex times, with the two misfits enacting a version of the James Dean—Natalie Wood romance with utmost conviction, searching, like their '50s counterparts, for love, self-worth and a place to call home". Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post said the performances are of such [...] "luminous humanity that they break your heart". Premiere listed Swank's performance as one of the [...] "100 Greatest Performances of All Time". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called Swank a [...] "revelation" [...] and wrote, [...] "by the end, her Brandon/Teena is beyond male or female. It's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> simply glimpsing the character's soul, in all its yearning and conflicted beauty." ...|$|E
500|$|Co-director Johnson {{would go}} over each {{scene with the}} animators, {{sometimes}} acting out the scene, if necessary. The animators would create a [...] "dope sheet"—in which a shot was broken down, frame by frame—to account for key [...] "hits". The animators would then shoot tests of the scene, often shooting on [...] "2s" [...] or [...] "4s" [...] (meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation). Johnson explained: [...] "The next day, when they'd finish their test/rehearsal, we'd cut it in {{and see how it}} played in the reel and fine-tune from there. We might do some lighting tweaks, performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it. Then we'd close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot." [...] The animators would sometimes make use of the voice and/or video recordings of the actors, a practice also common in cel animation. Once photographed, the frames were manipulated by a team of [...] "data wranglers." [...] Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts, the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files, converted to Cineon files and processed through a [...] "color cube." [...] Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained: [...] "The color cube is a 3D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd. that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock—in this case, 5248, one of my favorites. With this film emulation, we could actually rate our cameras at ASA 100, then take our light meters and spot meters and, with great confidence, shoot <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> using 5248. Sure enough, the footage would come back and look just like it." [...] The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting, composition and color could be previewed.|$|E
