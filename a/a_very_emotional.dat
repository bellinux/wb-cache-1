During the game, the Rangers defeated the Oilers. His is the 4th number retired by the Rangers. His number was retired by the Edmonton Oilers on February 27, 2007, against the Phoenix Coyotes, then coached by former teammate Wayne Gretzky.|$|E
25|$|D.C.'s homestand {{continued}} with a match against the Eastern Conference leading Philadelphia Union. United {{took the lead}} when Kemp intercepted a pass in the defensive end, raced through the Union defense and beat the goalie to the far post. However, the Union tied the game on a free kick just before halftime. The visitors took the lead when Acosta was dispossessed {{as he tried to}} dribble out of the defensive end and former United star Chris Pontius continued a remarkable renaissance in his first season away from D.C. and put the Union ahead. United's coach, Ben Olsen was ejected late in the second half for protesting one of many uncalled fouls on Acosta. Despite missing their leader, United pushed hard for a tying goal. Despite having a couple of apparent goals waved off by the officials, the team finally found the tying goal in the fourth minute of stoppage time, when Birnbaum got his head {{on the end of a}} service into the box by Nyarko. Despite being only a draw, it was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>emotional</b> goal for the players and fans, but the home draw meant the team remained outside of playoff contention.|$|E
25|$|By the {{midpoint}} of the 2009 season, things had improved both on and off field for Melbourne. They had secured a record number of members, re-merged with the MCC, knocked-off more debt and were starting to show some fight on field. Players such as Liam Jurrah had begun to emerge as top young talents and were catching the eye of the footballing public. However, {{on the eve of the}} Round 14 clash against West Coast, influential president Jim Stynes announced that he had cancer, this evoked <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>emotional</b> response from the footballing public and the club lifted from three embarrassing defeats the weeks before to convincingly beat West Coast in front of a passionate MCG crowd. At the end of the season, Melbourne finished 16th on the ladder and for a second year in a row won no more than four games which granted them a Priority Pick in the National Draft. Melbourne therefore had picks 1 and 2 in the draft to build on their young talent. At the end of the season fan favourites Russell Robertson, Matthew Whelan and Paul Wheatley announced that they would no longer be playing for Melbourne in 2010 and beyond. During September 2009, midfielder Brock McLean asked to be a traded and a deal involving Carlton's pick 11 in the National Draft was agreed to.|$|E
30|$|The {{polarization}} {{of the academic}} world towards the cognitive aspects could be justified by arguing that students live <b>a</b> <b>very</b> intense <b>emotional</b> relationship with the technologies outside the classroom and that {{the objective of the}} education system is to counterbalance this by incorporating the rational, reflective dimension.|$|R

25|$|Friedkin went to some {{extraordinary}} lengths, {{reminiscent of}} some directors {{from the old}} Hollywood directing style, manipulating the actors, to get the genuine reactions he wanted. Yanked violently around in harnesses, both Blair and Burstyn suffered back injuries and their painful screams went right into the film. Burstyn injured her back after landing on her coccyx when a stuntman jerked her around using a special effects cable during the scene when Regan slaps her mother. According to the documentary Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist, however, the injury did not cause permanent damage, although Burstyn was upset the shot of her screaming in pain {{was used in the}} film. After asking Father William O'Malley if he trusted him and being told yes, Friedkin slapped him hard across the face before a take to generate a deeply solemn reaction that was used in the film as <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>emotional</b> Father Dyer read last rites to Father Karras; this offended the many Catholic crew members on the set. He also fired blanks without warning on the set to elicit shock from Jason Miller for one of the takes, and only told Miller that pea soup would hit him in the chest rather than the face concerning the projectile-vomiting scene, resulting in his disgusted reaction. Lastly, he had Regan's bedroom set built inside a freezer so that the actors' breath could be visible on camera, which required the crew to wear parkas and other cold-weather gear.|$|E
25|$|Lampard {{made his}} Manchester City debut on 13 September in a 2–2 away draw against Arsenal; he {{received}} a yellow card and was substituted at half-time for Samir Nasri. He scored his first goal for the club on 21 September with a volley from inside the box, after only being on the field for seven minutes as a substitute, to level the scoreline at 1–1 in a home draw against Chelsea. This ended Chelsea's perfect winning streak in the season, {{but it was a}} goal which he did not celebrate and described as <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>emotional</b> day. In Lampard's first League Cup match for City three days later, he scored the first and last goals as the side defeated Sheffield Wednesday 7–0 at home in the third round. On 27 September, Lampard came on in the 71st minute, only to score another goal to make it four goals in four matches and his fourth that week. He made his first Champions League appearance on 30 September in Machester City's 1–1 draw with Roma. On 1 January 2015, the day after extending his stay with the club, Lampard scored the winner for City in a Premier League encounter against Sunderland. On 14 March 2015, Lampard made his 600th Premier League appearance, becoming the second player to do so after Ryan Giggs, coming on as a substitute during City's 1–0 defeat to Burnley. On 24 May, Lampard captained Manchester City in their final match of the season and the last of his spell with the club. He scored his 177th Premier League goal to give City the lead in an eventual 2–0 win over Southampton at the City of Manchester Stadium and was substituted for Jesús Navas in the 77th minute.|$|E

We would use those same cards when figuring out stories for the series." [...] Later, Spotnitz noted that the cards were also in his handwriting [...] "because the prop guy couldn’t do it as well as we could because that’s really the way we did it. It’s <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>emotional</b> love story and it’s really about our love for these characters as writers".

50|$|An unusual form of {{motivated}} forgetting {{is called}} psychogenic amnesia in which <b>a</b> <b>very</b> severe <b>emotional</b> stressor causes one {{to lose a}} large amount of personal memories without an observable biological cause. Another reaction to <b>a</b> <b>very</b> severe stressor is called post traumatic stress disorder. People who have been subject to a traumatic event that has included death of others or a possibility of death or severe injury to oneself cannot forget these memories. This sometimes leads to flashbacks and nightmares that cause people to re-live these traumatic events for long periods afterwards.|$|R

The film also marked the return of Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan together on screen after a gap of 18 years. Of her character, she said that Nandini was an extension of her own self. She elaborated, [...] "My personal feelings towards Shah Rukh are similar to what I was supposed to portray in the film. There's something about him that makes me want to mother him."

Laura Fries of Variety perceived the series as [...] "a visual assault of nauseating camera angles, likely to upset even the most desensitized TV viewer". Hayley Butler of Jam! gave the final episode of the series a mixed review, saying it [...] "was full of tear-jerking moments" [...] and [...] "the only episode not full of stupid jokes, childish behaviour and Britney's thoughts on life", commenting that Spears and Federline wedding scenes [...] "looked to be <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>emotional</b> and touching event".

500|$|Crash was genetically {{engineered}} {{through the use}} of Cortex and Doctor Nitrus Brio's Evolvo-Ray. Before escaping from Doctor Neo Cortex's island fortress, Crash became romantically attached to a female bandicoot named Tawna, who was another one of Cortex's experiments. Crash's separation from Tawna at the hands of Cortex serves as the primary root of Crash's antagonisation of Cortex. Crash is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>emotional</b> character who is quick to laugh and quick to cry. While he has a danger-loving, fearless nature and loves a good fight, he prefers relaxing in the sun and rarely seeks out trouble deliberately. Crash has an extremely limited vocabulary, preferring to speak in unintelligible gibberish; the few English words he is capable of speaking include [...] "Whoa!" [...] (which he often exclaims upon being physically harmed), [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "pancakes". To the ire of his friend Crunch, but the amusement of his sister Coco, Crash is prone to impolite personal habits such as belching or scratching his posterior.|$|E

50|$|Possibly {{because the}} organic {{portions}} {{of his body}} are not his own, or possibly because the brain he inhabits was lobotomized, Siege is unable to feel anything physically and has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> limited <b>emotional</b> range. Michael Collins theorized {{the cause of this}} was that Siege was not actually John Kelly, but simply a rogue data packet that believed itself to be Kelly; regardless, he has acknowledged that Siege is alive. Siege has described the way he experiences his pseudo-life as being akin to playing a video game.|$|R
5000|$|Holopainen {{has said}} that the song {{is one of the major}} moments of their concerts, as it is so {{different}} from the rest, making it all <b>a</b> <b>very</b> special, <b>emotional</b> moment.

Entitled The Visitor and billed as [...] "episode one in the Chronicles of Aschlar", Broyles' script {{caught the attention of}} director Tim Burton, who was hired in February 2000. [...] "I wasn't interested in doing a remake or a sequel of the original Planet of the Apes film," [...] Burton said later. [...] "But I was intrigued by the idea of revisiting that world.

500|$|Another {{idea from}} which the episode was crafted was the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre: initially, the episode would have found the genre enjoyed by all {{citizens}} {{of the town of}} South Park, not just a younger audience. By Sunday, completed animated shots were being edited together and set to the song [...] "Landslide" [...] by Fleetwood Mac. The song's use in the episode was unsure until Tuesday night, when they eventually received clearance to use it. Parker noted later that they had backup songs to use if necessary, but none fit as well as [...] "Landslide". They were very satisfied with the ending, feeling it provided <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>emotional</b> conclusion to the show. In addition, the episodes contains what Parker describes in the commentary as [...] "our favorite thing of any South Park ever": the Duck President, who communicates by spraying feces from his mouth.

They had a scheduled session in Page's home in Malibu, California and finished the song the next day. Cowell secured a songwriting credit for coming up with the idea. In an interview with HitQuarters, Magnusson said they had thought the song would be a good idea for Irish boy band Westlife, but it was offered to British singer Leona Lewis instead. When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis, she agreed that it could be [...] "really quite interesting". Regarding the song, Lewis commented: [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational so we put it into a song.

5000|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{somewhat}} obscure and enigmatic lyrics, Tikaram has offered different views on their meaning, but said it's mostly about the particular {{relationship with the}} world one feels when entering adulthood. [...] "the song is really about not understanding - when you're 18, you've got <b>a</b> <b>very</b> particular <b>emotional</b> relationship with the world, you feel very isolated, and everybody else is so distant and cold. And I think I was singing about not feeling anything or not being moved by things around. I {{think this is a}} strong feeling when you're just after adolescence." ...|$|R

500|$|Forgoing {{the closure}} favored by its contemporaries, Changelings final {{sequence}} reflects Collins' renewed hope that Walter is alive. The shot is a {{two and a}} half minute sequence showing Collins' walking off to become lost in a crowd. The sequence is representative of the range of effects that feature throughout the film; Los Angeles is presented as major character, brought to life by unobtrusive peripheral imagery that allows the viewer to focus on the story and the emotional cues. The [...] "hustle and bustle" [...] of the sequence was required to convey that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a congested urban center. In the closing shot, the camera tilts up to reveal miles of city blocks, pedestrians on the streets, cars going by and streetcars running along their tracks. The version of the film that screened at Cannes did not include this sequence; the scene faded to black as Collins walked away. The new 4,000-frame shot was Owens' idea. He felt the abrupt cut to black pulled the viewer out of the film too quickly, and that it left no room for emotional reflection. Owens said, [...] "There is a legend at the end before the credits. The legend speaks to what happened after the fact, and I think you need to just swallow that for a few moments with the visual still with you." [...] Owens told Eastwood the film should end like Chinatown(1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: [...] "The camera booms up and she walks away from us from <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>emotional,</b> poignant scene at the end, walks away into this mass of people and traffic. It's very hopeful and sad at the same time." ...|$|E
