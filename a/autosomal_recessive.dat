5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (<b>autosomal</b> <b>recessive).</b> The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems {{to play a role in}} the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits.

5|$|Neuroacanthocytosis {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1950 as Bassen-Kornzweig disease, or Bassen-Kornzweig Syndrome, a rare, <b>autosomal</b> <b>recessive,</b> childhood-onset disorder {{in which the}} body fails to produce chylomicrons, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Symptoms include ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, retinitis pigmentosa {{and other forms of}} nerve dysfunction. It was first noted by the North American physician Frank Bassen, who later partnered with the ophthalmologist Abraham Kornzweig to identify and describe causes and symptoms of the disease. Affected children appear normal at birth but usually fail to thrive during their first year.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe <b>autosomal</b> <b>recessive</b> disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a disease progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Scottie cramp is an <b>autosomal</b> <b>recessive</b> {{hereditary}} disorder which inhibits the dog's {{ability to}} walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E

5|$|There are six known genetic {{disorders}} in Arabian horses. Two are inevitably fatal, two are not inherently fatal but are disabling and usually result in euthanasia {{of the affected}} animal; the remaining conditions can usually be treated. Three {{are thought to be}} <b>autosomal</b> <b>recessive</b> conditions, which means that the flawed gene is not sex-linked and has to come from both parents for an affected foal to be born; the others currently lack sufficient research data to determine the precise mode of inheritance. Arabians are not the only breed of horse to have problems with inherited diseases; fatal or disabling genetic conditions also exist in many other breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, American Saddlebred, Appaloosa, Miniature horse, and Belgian.|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also <b>autosomal</b> <b>recessive</b> disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The stomach has the {{characteristic}} pattern of sigmodontines (unilocular-hemiglandular); {{it is not}} split in two chambers by an incisura angularis and the front part (antrum) is covered by a glandular epithelium. The gall bladder is absent, a synapomorphy (shared-derived character) of Oryzomyini. The karyotype includes 56chromosomes and a fundamental number of 60chromosomal arms (2n=56, FN=60). The form of the sex chromosomes {{has been used to}} distinguish the marsh rice rat from Oryzomys couesi, but may be too variable among Oryzomys species to be useful in differentiating them. X chromosome inactivation occurs in the marsh rice rat, though the animal lacks LINE-1 retrotransposons, which have been suggested as components of the inactivation process. Mutants with fused or additional molars and with light fur have been recorded in laboratory colonies; the abnormal molars are apparently the result of a single <b>autosomal</b> <b>recessive</b> mutation. At about 50%, hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells in the blood) is high in the marsh rice rat compared to other rodents; this may be an adaptation that enables the rice rat to increase oxygen capacity while swimming under water.|$|E

Treatment for this condition is based on its symptoms.

25|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} a rare <b>autosomal</b> (chromosome 13) <b>recessive</b> genetic {{disorder}} of copper transport that causes an excess of copper to build up in the liver. This results in liver toxicity, among other symptoms. The disease is now treatable.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{some of the}} syndromes having {{different}} genetic {{causes the}} symptoms are sometimes very similar.

5|$|Copper toxicosis, {{also known}} as copper storage disease and copper {{overload}} syndrome, is an <b>autosomal</b> <b>recessive</b> disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It {{is closely related to}} Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed. Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the Asymptomatic Form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the Fulminating Form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the Chronic Form, which is characterized by {{an extended period of time}} in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not nearly to the extent that they accumulate copper.|$|E
