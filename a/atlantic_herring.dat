Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>herring,</b> hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting.

Their a life expectancy once mature is 12 to 16 years. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>herrings</b> spawn in summer in estuaries, coastal waters or in offshore banks. Like most fish fertilization is external, the female releases between 20,000 and 40,000 eggs and the males release masses of milt simultaneously so they mix freely in the sea. Once fertilised the egg, which 1 to 1.4 mm in diameter, sinks to the sea bed where its sticky surface adheres it to gravel or weed. It will only mature if its temperature stays below 66 F (18,9 C).

25|$|The {{species of}} Clupea {{belong to the}} larger family Clupeidae (herrings, shads, sardines, menhadens), which {{comprises}} some 200 species that share similar features. These silvery-coloured fish have a single dorsal fin, which is soft, without spines. They have no lateral line and have a protruding lower jaw. Their size varies between subspecies: the Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras) is small, 14 to 18cm; the proper <b>Atlantic</b> <b>herring</b> (C. h. harengus) can grow to about 46cm (18in) and weigh up 700 g (1.5lb); and Pacific herring grow to about 38cm (15in).|$|E
25|$|Herring often move {{in large}} schools around fishing banks {{and near the}} coast.

Three species of Clupea are recognised, and provide about 90% of all herrings captured in fisheries. Most abundant of all is the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>herring,</b> providing over half of all herring capture. Fishes called herring are also found in the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean, and Bay of Bengal.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{relationships}} between North Atlantic and North Pacific faunas through times have been {{controlled by the}} variation of hydrographic circumstances in the intervening Arctic Ocean and Bering Strait. We address the history of trans-Arctic connections in a clade of amphi-boreal pelagic fishes using genealogical information from mitochondrial DNA sequence data. The Pacific and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>herrings</b> (Clupea pallasii and C. harengus) have basically vicarious distributions in the two oceans since pre-Pleistocene times. However, remote populations of C. pallasii are also present in the border waters of the North-East Atlantic in Europe. These populations show considerable regional and life history differentiation and have been recognized in subspecies classification. The chronology of the inter-oceanic invasions and genetic basis of the phenotypic structuring however remain unclear. Results: The <b>Atlantic</b> and Pacific <b>herrings</b> both feature high mtDNA diversities (large long-term population sizes) in their native basins, but an ocean-wide homogeneity of C. harengus is contrasted by deep east-west Pacific subdivision within Pacific C. pallasii. The outpost populations of C. pallasii in NE Europe are identified {{as members of the}} western Pacific C. pallasii clade, with some retained inter-oceanic haplotype sharing.

25|$|The {{researchers}} imaged spawning <b>Atlantic</b> <b>herring</b> off Georges Bank. They {{found that}} the fish come together from deeper water in the evening, shoaling in a disordered way. A chain reaction triggers when the population density reaches a critical value, like an audience wave travelling around a sport stadium. A rapid transition then occurs, and the fish become highly polarised and synchronized {{in the manner of}} schooling fish. After the transition, the schools start migrating, extending up to 40 kilometres (25mi) across the ocean, to shallow parts of the bank. There they spawn during the night. In the morning, the fish school back to deeper water again and then disband. Small groups of leaders were also discovered that significantly influenced much larger groups.|$|E

The antioxidant activity and total phenolic content in hawthorn and agrimony extracts, and their effect on lipid deterioration expressed as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were measured. The results showed that the herbal extracts of hawthorn and agrimony are effective antioxidants and good sources of total phenols. Significant influence of herbal extracts added into glaze on the extent of lipid oxidation changes has been obvious within 4 months storage of herring fillets under freezing conditions. Finally, positive influence of glaze and herbal extracts on organoleptic characteristics of fish fillets was found...|$|R

40|$|The daily {{periodicity}} of micro-increments in the otoliths of <b>Atlantic</b> thread <b>herring</b> Opisthonema oglinum {{was demonstrated}} from juveniles injected with oxytetracycline and reared {{for up to}} 62 days. Micro-increments ranged from 26 to 358 in the overall sample. Von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) using micro-increment counts were: L-infinity = 337 mm fork length (L-F) (s. e. = 31 mm); K = 1. 2 (s. e. = 0. 2) and t(0) = 0. 04 years (s. e. = 0. 01 years). The otolith-based growth was corroborated using the L-F frequency analysis. Observed lengths of increments were considered unsuitable for VBGF derivation, as no increase in size was obtained from them. Furthermore, the high percentage of unreadable otoliths suggests that increment analysis is unreliable for age estimation. Most growth occurs within the first year, differing from previous longevity estimates of 4 - 8 years.

We offer a framework for assessing the economic ramifications of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management, using an input/output (I/O) optimization (IOLP) model, and apply the model to the <b>Atlantic</b> sea <b>herring</b> (Clupea harengus) fishery in New England. The I/O model is based on IMPLAN, an off the shelf software package for input/output modeling by county, state, region, or the United States. A linear programming problem is specified for the three digit NAICS sectors in which total output or production is maximized subject to the inputs used and purchased by each NAICS sector. In addition to the standard NAICS sectors, we specify a sector for the herring fishery and a sector for all other fisheries of the region (i. e., an aggregate or composite of all other fisheries). We then include consumption and constraints related to predators. As such, the model may be considered a limited general equilibrium model in which the limitations are imposed by various constraints and assumptions (e. g., constant prices, fixed proportions in input usage, and zero substitution possibilities) ...|$|R

40|$|Ocean {{acidification}} (OA), {{the process}} by which increasing atmospheric CO₂ is absorbed by the ocean, lowering the pH of surface waters, has been shown to affect many marine organisms negatively. It has been suggested that organisms from regions with naturally low pH waters, such as upwelling areas, could serve as models for future effects of OA and may be adapted to increased pCO₂ levels. In this study, we examined the effects of OA on yellowfin tuna, a highly pelagic species that spawns in the eastern tropical Pacific, an area that includes regions of strong upwelling events. Larvae reared at decreasing pH levels (pH 8. 1, 7. 6, 7. 3 and 6. 9) showed increasing organ damage in the kidney, liver, pancreas, eye and muscle, which correlated with decreased growth and survival.
