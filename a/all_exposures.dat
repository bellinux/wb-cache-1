Acute toxicity tests were conducted to measure the impact of toxicity on the fishes within a short period at the various concentrations of HgCl 2 (0. 1, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5 and 3 mg/L).

6000|$|I am {{more deeply}} moved than I can say by {{the receipt of}} your so admirably vivid and {{interesting}} letter.... I envy you intensely your opportunity to apply that [spirit of observation] in these immense historic conditions and thus {{to have had a}} hand of your own in the most prodigious affirmation of the energy and ingenuity of man ("however misplaced"!) that surely can ever have been in the world. For God's sake go on taking as many notes of it as you possibly can, and believe with what grateful piety I shall want to go over your treasure with you when you finally bring it home. Such impressions as you must get, such incalculable things as you must see, such unutterable ones as you must feel! Well, keep it all up, and above all keep up that same blest confidence in my fond appreciation. Wonderful your account of that night visit to the trenches and giving me more of the sense and the smell and the fantastic grimness, the general ordered and methodised horror, than anything else whatever that has pretended to enlighten us. With infinite interest do I take in what you say of the rapidity with which the inside-out-ness of your conditions becomes the matter of course and the platitudinous--which I take partly to result from the tremendous collectivity of the case, doesn't it? the fact of the wholeness of the stress and strain or intimate fusion, as in a common pot, of <b>all</b> <b>exposures,</b> all resistances, all the queerness and all the muchness! But I mustn't seem to put too interrogatively my poor groping speculations. Only wait to correct my mistakes in some better future, and I shall understand you down to the ground. We add day to day here as consciously, or labouringly, as you are doing, no doubt, on your side--it's in fact like lifting every 24 hours, just now, a very dismally dead weight and setting it on top of a pile of such others, already stacked, which promises endlessly to grow--so that the mere reaching up adds all the while to the beastly effort. London is grey--in moral tone; and even the Zeppelin bombs of last night at Yarmouth do little to make it flush. What a pitiful horror indeed must that Ypres desolation and desecration be--a baseness of demonism. I find, thank God, that under your image of that I at least can flush. It so happens that I dine to-morrow (23d) with John Sargent, or rather I mean lunch, and I shall take for granted your leave to read him your letter.

5000|$|Film {{for cameras}} {{that use the}} 35 mm still format is sold as a long strip of emulsion-coated and {{perforated}} plastic spooled in a light-tight cassette. Before each exposure, a mechanism inside the camera is used to pull an unexposed area of the strip out of the cassette and into position behind the camera lens. When <b>all</b> <b>exposures</b> have been made the strip is rewound into the cassette. After the film is chemically developed, the strip shows {{a series of small}} negative images. It is usually then cut into sections for easier handling. Medium format cameras use 120 film, which yields a strip of negatives 60 mm wide, and large format cameras capture each image on a single sheet of film which may be as large as 20 x 25 cm (8 x 10 inches) or even larger. Each of these photographed images may be referred to as a negative and an entire strip or set of images may be collectively referred to as [...] "the negatives". They are the master images, from which all positive prints will derive, so they are handled and stored with special care.|$|E
5000|$|Issues entirely {{separate}} from {{the question of the}} sustainability of nuclear fuel, relate to the use of nuclear fuel and the high-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates that if not properly contained, is highly hazardous to people and wildlife.

[...] natural uranium in some inefficient reactor nuclear fuel cycles, becomes part of the nuclear waste [...] "once through" [...] stream, and in a similar manner to the scenario were this uranium remained naturally in the ground, this uranium emits various forms of radiation in a decay chain that has a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, the storage of this unused uranium and the accompanying fission reaction products have raised public concerns about risks of leaks and containment, however the knowledge gained from studying the Natural nuclear fission reactor in Oklo Gabon, has informed geologists on the proven processes that kept the waste from this 2 billion year old natural nuclear reactor that operated {{for hundreds of thousands of}} years, from negatively impacting the surrounding plant and animal life.|$|E
