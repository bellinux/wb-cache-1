500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'.
