David Stannard, an early reviewer of Ariès’ work, penned The Puritan Way of Death a few short years after Ariès’ publication. He maintained that American religious practices strongly influenced their attitudes toward death. While he hoped to clarify some of the comments Ariès made about changes in American attitudes, he applauded Ariès seminal work as both “profound and insightful.” Although Philipe Ariès’ Western Attitudes Toward Death has been heavily critiqued, historians of death have venerated it as a classic and foundational work on the subject.|$|R

The horizontal evolution was followed at first on the entire course of the river and then in three separate case studies.

On February 24, Matt Cross agreed to join Aries' new stable, which led to the first official match in the rivalry, where the two defeated Strong and Richards. Over the next weeks, the No Remorse Corps added a third member, Rocky Romero, who had just returned to ROH from an extended stay in Japan, while Aries' stable, now named [...] "The Resilience", added Erick Stevens, Strong's former protégé. The two stables feuded for the rest of 2007 with N.R.C. dominating their rivals, partly due to Aries spending several months away from ROH due to a contract dispute with the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion. While Aries was away, Cross and Stevens were aided by Delirious and Bryan Danielson, the latter of whom had turned down an earlier offer to join the N.R.C.
