40|$|The {{public sector}} plays {{a central role}} in price-setting in some markets for goods and services. Consequently, Eurostat began to publish a new series of {{inflation}} indices referred to as the HIPC-AP in early 2010 that summarizes the development of publicly <b>administered</b> <b>prices.</b> This study presents a detailed account of the concept underlying the new series and provides a cross-country analysis for the euro area. <b>Administered</b> <b>prices</b> are a key component of the HICP basket, currently accounting for 11. 0 % of the HICP (euro area average). This share has declined in the past decade in line with the liberalization of goods and service markets. The inflation rates of <b>administered</b> <b>prices</b> and those of flexible prices (i. e. the HICP excluding <b>administered</b> <b>prices)</b> differ with respect to both their levels and their development over time. In many euro area countries, the average HICP-AP rate of inflation has surpassed the all-items HICP inflation rate over the past ten years. In Austria, as in other euro area countries, flexible prices are found to be a leading indicator for the HICP rather than vice-versa. As public sector pricing takes place within a macroeconomic context, this study also represents a first effort to shed light on the main economic determinants of the development of the HICP-AP. The key findings are that cost-push shocks exercise a significant influence on the inflation of flexible prices, whereas their influence on <b>administered</b> <b>prices</b> is smaller or statistically not significantly different from zero. price level, inflaton, deflation...|$|R

The inflation was, however, quickly brought under control by the stabilization measures adopted {{as a part of the}} reform package 2. By August the rate of price increase declined to a 1. 8 per cent monthly rate. Yet the goal of complete price stability by year-end proved to be elusive.

A clear distinction seems to emerge. On the one side, systems that rely on market based competition (particularly the US) promote a clear distinction between firms that act as innovators and firms that act as imitators after patent expiry. Original products enjoy premium prices under patent protection, and face fierce price competition after patent expiry. On the contrary, systems that rely on <b>administered</b> <b>prices</b> (particularly France and Italy) nurture strategies of pre-emptive brand proliferation and horizontal differentiation by imitative brand name products, well before patent expiry.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{monetary}} policy in most economies {{of the world is}} to achieve and maintain price stability. This paper evaluates price developments and consumer price indices in south-eastern European countries, i. e. countries that have either recently joined the EU or are candidate or potential candidate countries. It is motivated by the fact that, in transition countries, inflation has generally been higher and more volatile than in advanced economies. The analysis reveals that the subindex housing/energy appears to be the main driving force behind overall inflation in the region. In most of the countries under review, <b>administered</b> <b>prices</b> prove to be an important factor in consumer price developments, with their weights increasing over time. Inflation volatility in south-eastern Europe is significantly higher than in the euro area. While this is partly due to a higher level of inflation, it also reflects a more pronounced share for the most volatile sub-indices as well as the marked impact of <b>administered</b> <b>prices</b> on the overall price index, a phenomenon which has also been seen in the central and eastern European countries. While in most south-eastern European countries no HICP has been calculated yet, there is little evidence suggesting that the future use of the HICP will result in a systematic change in inflation patterns in the respective countries. However, as deviations have been observed in a few countries for certain periods, without further information on the structure of the respective national CPI and the HICP such differences cannot be fully excluded.

He uses a theoretical model that predicts {{a positive relationship}} between variance and skewness in the distribution of relative price changes and the general inflation rate. Regressions controlling for various shocks revealed that significant relative price changes [...] especially the large <b>administered</b> <b>price</b> increases associated with adjustment [...] produced substantial upward inflationary pressures. Growth in money and wages were shown to fuel inflation. Appreciation of the real exchange rate lowered it. <b>Administered</b> <b>price</b> increases [...] in utilities and other sectors controlled by the government [...] dominated inflation from 1989 - 97. And the adjustment of many controlled prices is not yet complete. Ideally, future administered increases should be frequent and moderate to prevent the large price shifts that increase inflation. But because frequent price increases are likely to be politically unpopular, sizable increases may be in order so that the current underevaluation of numerous services will diminish more quickly.

The analysis provides estimates of the marginal impacts on quota values of two variables postulated to proxy the rent that arises from the highly regulated market for this product.
