5|$|Although American Graffiti {{is set in}} 1962 Modesto, California, Lucas {{believed}} the city had changed too much in 10 years and initially chose San Rafael as the primary shooting location. Filming began on June 26, 1972. However, Lucas soon became frustrated {{at the time it}} was taking to fix camera mounts to the cars. A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing marijuana, and, in addition to <b>already</b> <b>running</b> behind the shooting schedule, the San Rafael City Council immediately became concerned about the disruption that filming caused for local businesses and therefore withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.|$|E

However, the Hindi film Sangam was <b>already</b> <b>running</b> there successfully, so Ganesan instead released in the now non-existent theatre Paragon at Wallajah Road, which had to be refurbished before the film's screening. It was Sangams lead actor, Raj Kapoor, who requested Ganesan to allow his film to continue running at Shanti, to which Ganesan obliged. The film was later dubbed in Telugu as Singapore CID.|$|E

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI starting on 8 September, its last first-class match for the tour. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit and had defeated Australia, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team; the only difference from the Fifth Test team was Johnson's inclusion {{at the expense of}} Ring. His bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Morris and Barnes put on an opening stand of 102 before Morris was out for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and they put on 225 runs for the second wicket. Bradman top-scored with 153 as Australia declared at 8/469 late on the final day. Upon reaching 153, he threw away his wicket with a lofted cover drive, having decided to attempt sixes to give Alec Bedser his wicket. He was <b>already</b> <b>running</b> towards the pavilion before the catch was taken, ending his last first-class innings in England. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. When it became obvious that Australia would not lose, Bradman bowled his only over of the tour, conceding two runs.|$|E

25|$|When Baldwin died childless in 1162, a {{year after}} his mother Melisende, the kingdom passed to his brother Amalric, who renewed the {{alliance}} negotiated by Baldwin. In 1163 the chaotic situation in Egypt led to a refusal {{to pay tribute to}} Jerusalem, and requests were sent to Nur ad-Din for assistance; in response, Amalric invaded, but was turned back when the Egyptians flooded the Nile at Bilbeis. The Egyptian vizier Shawar again requested help from Nur ad-Din, who sent his general Shirkuh, but Shawar quickly turned against him and allied with Amalric. Amalric and Shirkuh both besieged Bilbeis in 1164, but both withdrew due to Nur ad-Din's campaigns against Antioch, where Bohemond III of Antioch and Raymond III of Tripoli were defeated at the Battle of Harim. It seemed likely that Antioch itself would fall to Nur ad-Din, but he withdrew when Emperor Manuel sent a large Byzantine force to the area. Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt in 1166, and Shawar again allied with Amalric, who was defeated at the Battle of al-Babein. Despite the defeat, both sides withdrew, but Shawar remained in control with a crusader garrison in Cairo. Amalric cemented his alliance with Manuel by marrying Manuel's niece Maria Komnene in 1167, and an embassy led by William of Tyre was sent to Constantinople to negotiate a military expedition, but in 1168 Amalric pillaged Bilbeis without waiting for the naval support promised by Manuel. Amalric accomplished nothing else, but his actions prompted Shawar to switch sides again and seek help from Shirkuh. Shawar was promptly assassinated, and when Shirkuh died in 1169, he was succeeded by his nephew Yusuf, better known as Saladin. That year, Manuel sent a large Byzantine fleet of some 300 ships to assist Amalric, and the town of Damietta was placed under siege. However, the Byzantine fleet sailed with enough provisions for only three months. By the time that the crusaders were ready supplies were <b>already</b> <b>running</b> out and the fleet retired. Each side sought to blame the other for the failure, but both knew that they could not take Egypt without the other's assistance: the alliance was maintained, and plans for another campaign in Egypt were made, which ultimately were to come to naught.|$|E

We steered clear, too, of the backstage story of a company putting on a new show, with all the anxieties of the actors and producers... It seemed right to focus on a show which is <b>already</b> <b>running</b> because we wanted to tell a story about a community, the backstage community, and this community becomes settled and established after a show opens." ...|$|E
500|$|The erasure of DeVine {{from the}} {{narrative}} places the white female bodies {{as the only}} true victims of crime; and the film's inability to show DeVine as violated rather than violator perpetuates {{the myth of the}} black man as always already a perpetrator of crime." [...] Regarding DeVine, Halberstam wrote, [...] "Peirce perhaps thought that her film, <b>already</b> <b>running</b> close to two hours, could not handle another subplot, but the story of Philip DeVine is important and it is a crucial part of the drama of gender, race, sexuality, and class that was enacted in the heartland. Race is not incidental to this narrative of mostly white, Midwestern small towns and by omitting DeVine's story from Boys Don't Cry, Peirce contributes to the detachment of transgender narratives from narratives about race, consigning the memory of DeVine to oblivion." ...|$|E

500|$|VR {{announced}} its 2 billion Finnish Mark Pendolino order on 7 February 1992, {{consisting of two}} firm orders and twenty-three options. ABB's X 2000 was considered {{in addition to the}} Italian train; the latter was chosen due to its lower price (70 million FIM per unit) and because it was <b>already</b> <b>running.</b> Only these two tilting trains were considered due to the twisting nature Finland's railway network. Thanks to its tilting mechanism, the Pendolino [...] unlike such other European high-speed trains like the TGV, Thalys, and AVE [...] does not need to run on specialised high-speed lines, which was important to VR; instead, it runs on existing lines, and was expected to surpass the speed attained by traditional trains by 35%. This has both beneficial and negative consequences. The trains cannot run at as high a speed as, for example, the TGV, due to the lines. However, the Pendolino can also run alongside normal non-tilting trains, allowing for greater use of the railway. Building trains that could ensure passenger comfort at high speed on these routes by tilting through the curves was seen as a much cheaper solution than reconstructing the railway network itself due to Finland's low population and long distances. The train was originally called the Sm200, but in May 1995 it was officially named Sm3 according to VR's nomenclature for multiple units.|$|E
