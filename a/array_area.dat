This paper presents a newclass of area I/O systolic architecture {{to exploit the}} physical data locality of planar data streams by processing data where it falls. A synthesis technique using dependence graphs, data partitioning, and computation mapping is developed to handle planar data streams and to systematically design <b>arrays</b> with <b>area</b> I/O. Simulation {{results show that the}} use of area I/O provides a 16 times speedup over systems with perimeter I/O. Performance comparisons for a set of signal processing algorithms show that systolic arrays that consider planar data streams in the design process are up to three times faster than traditional arrays.

50|$|The DRAM {{cells that}} are on the edges of the array do not have {{adjacent}} segments. Since the differential sense amplifiers require identical capacitance and bitline lengths from both segments, dummy bitline segments are provided. The advantage of the open bitline array is a smaller <b>array</b> <b>area,</b> although this advantage is slightly diminished by the dummy bitline segments. The disadvantage that caused the near disappearance of this architecture is the inherent vulnerability to noise, which affects the effectiveness of the differential sense amplifiers. Since each bitline segment does not have any spatial relationship to the other, it is likely that noise would affect only one of the two bitline segments.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} ongoing {{efforts in the}} Aeronautics Systems Analysis Branch at NASA Langley Research Center to develop a suite of {{integrated}} physics-based computational utilities suitable for modeling and analyzing extended-duration missions carried out using solar powered aircraft. From these efforts, SolFlyte {{has emerged as a}} state-of-the-art vehicle analysis and mission simulation tool capable of modeling both heavier-than-air (HTA) and lighter-than-air (LTA) vehicle concepts. This study compares solar powered airplane and airship station-keeping capability during a variety of high altitude missions, using SolFlyte as the primary analysis component. Three Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) concepts were designed for this study: an airplane (Operating Empty Weight (OEW) = 3285 kilograms, span = 127 meters, <b>array</b> <b>area</b> = 450 square meters), a small airship (OEW = 3790 kilograms, length = 115 meters, <b>array</b> <b>area</b> = 570 square meters), and a large airship (OEW = 6250 kilograms, length = 135 meters, <b>array</b> <b>area</b> = 1080 square meters). All the vehicles were sized for payload weight and power requirements of 454 kilograms and 5 kilowatts, respectively. Seven mission sites distributed throughout the United States were selected to provide a basis for assessing the vehicle energy budgets and site-persistent operational availability. Seasonal, 30 -day duration missions were simulated at each of the sites during March, June, September, and December; one-year duration missions were simulated at three of the sites. Atmospheric conditions during the simulated missions were correlated to National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) historical data measurements at each mission site, at four flight levels. Unique features of the SolFlyte model are described, including methods for calculating recoverable and energy-optimal flight trajectories and the effects of shadows on solar energy collection. Results of this study indicate that: 1) the airplane concept attained longer periods of on-site capability than either airship concept, and 2) the airship concepts can attain higher levels of energy collection and storage than the airplane concept; however, attaining these energy benefits requires adverse design trades of reduced performance (small airship) or excessive solar <b>array</b> <b>area</b> (large airship) ...|$|E
