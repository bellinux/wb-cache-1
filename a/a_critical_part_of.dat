Polonium and beryllium were the key ingredients of the 'urchin' detonator {{at the center of the}} bomb's spherical plutonium pit.

5|$|In November 1942, Koppelman {{was drafted}} into the United States Army and in 1943 he married painter Dorothy Myers. He worked as a radio {{weatherman}} during World War II, guiding ships through the rough waters of the English Channel, which was <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Invasion of Normandy. He manned an anti-aircraft machine gun in the D-Day landing on Omaha Beach, and later, as staff sergeant, was awarded a Bronze Star. Before the invasion, {{he had been able}} to study at the Art College of Western England in Bristol, and later at the École des Beaux-Arts in Reims. While on leave, he visited Picasso's studio in Paris, and it was Picasso and Louis Aragon who told Koppelman that the war in Europe was over. Letters describing his wartime experience are in the Chaim and Dorothy Koppelman papers at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.|$|E

30|$|In {{the past}} two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have {{attracted}} extensive attention due to their low cost, convenient fabrication, and less pollution to the environment [1, 2]. <b>As</b> one <b>critical</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> DSSC, photoanode is usually made of nanocrystalline TiO 2 screen printed onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. A photoanode with high performance should have excellent light absorption ability and effective electron transmission ability. However, these two features usually negate each other for single-layer nanocrystalline photoanode films. So, two or more layers of TiO 2 nanostructures are used to prepare complex nanocrystalline photoanodes, {{which is expected to}} having superior photovoltaic performance [3].|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Monitoring of {{environmental}} phenomena with embedded networked sensing confronts {{the challenges of}} both unpredictable variability in the spatial distribution of phenomena, coupled with demands for a high spatial sampling rate in three dimensions. For example, low distortion mapping of critical solar radiation properties in forest environments may require two-dimensional spatial sampling rates of greater than 10 samples/m 2 over transects exceeding 1000 m 2. Clearly, adequate sampling coverage of such a transect requires an impractically large number of sensing nodes. A new approach, Networked Infomechanical System (NIMS), has been introduced to combine autonomous-articulated and static sensor nodes enabling sufficient spatiotemporal sampling density over large transects to meet a general set {{of environmental}} mapping demands. This paper describes our work on <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> NIMS, the Task Allocation module. We present our methodologies and the two basic greedy Task Allocation policies- based on time of the task arrival (Time policy) and distance from the robot to the task (Distance policy). We present results from NIMS deployed in a forest reserve and from a lab testbed. The results show that both policies are adequate for the task of spatiotemporal sampling, but also complement each other. Finally, we suggest the future direction of research that would both help us better quantify the performance of our system and create more complex policies combining time, distance, information gain, etc. I...|$|R
