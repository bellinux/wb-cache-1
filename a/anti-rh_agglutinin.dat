40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (1), data were presented regarding the heredity of the Rh blood types and their {{distribution in the}} general population, confirming {{the accuracy of the}} theory of six allelic genes (2). In the present paper, we propose to report the results of investigations of the relationship of factor Hr (Levine and Javert (3)) or St (Race and Taylor (4)) to the Rh blood types. Nomenclature and Genetic Theory Advances in the knowledge of the Rh blood types have made possible certain improvements in the nomenclature (5), as a result of which the designations of Rh types correspond more closely with the antisera with which they react. The standard <b>anti-Rh</b> <b>agglutinin,</b> which clumps the blood of about 85 per cent of white individuals, is now designated anti-Rho. The agglutinin reacting with approximately 70 per cent of bloods from white individuals is now designated anti-Rh ' instead of anti-Rhl, and the agglutinin giving 30 per cent positive reactions is called anti-Rh " instead of anti-Rh 2. With regard to the Rh types, bloods reacting with agglutinin anti-Rho but not anti-Rh r or anti-Rh " are designated type Rho instead of type Rh. The names o...|$|E
40|$|With the aid {{of three}} {{varieties}} of <b>anti-Rh</b> <b>agglutinins,</b> five sorts of Rh agglutinogens can be demonstrated, which in combination determine eight types of human blood (1, 2). To account {{for the existence of}} these variants of the Rh agglutinogen, one of us (3) has proposed a theory of six allelic genes. The purpose of the present paper is to report the results of investigations carried out in order to test the validity of the theory. Nomenclature According to the nomenclature proposed by one of us (3) the three varieties of Rh agglutinins are designated as anti-Rh, anti-Rha, and anti-Rh~, respectively. The anti-Rh or standard Rh agglutinin corresponds in specificity with the original anti-Rh sera obtained by Landsteiner and Wiener (4, 5) by immunizing guinea pigs and rabbits with the blood of rhesus monkeys. Such sera agglutinate the bloods of about 85 per cent of white individuals in New York City. Human sera giving parallel reactions with the animal immune anti-rhesus sera have been obtained from patients who have had hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions (6) and mothers of erythroblastoti...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} two years methods for the {{separation}} and concentration of the anti-Rh iso-agglutinins have been developed {{as a part of the}} study of the fractionation of human plasma (1). The solubility characteristics on which the separa-tion has been based resemble those of the anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinins, and have been summar-ized in a previous communication (2). The final products have been prepared as protein powders, stable and readily soluble, which may be packaged in convenient quantities and reconstituted to yield potent reagents useful for Rh typing or for A or B grouping, respectively. In contrast to the anti-A and anti-B isoagglu-tinins, which may be obtained readily from grouped plasma pools from normal donors (3), the avail-able supply of anti-Rh material is limited. The incidence of <b>anti-Rh</b> <b>agglutinins</b> in the general population is very low, and bleedings suitable as a source of original plasma for processing "'must be obtained from sensitized Rh negative donors, specially selected (2). Moreover, the phenome-non, termed "blocking, " 8 whereby the antibodies in certain anti-Rh serums fail to agglutinate homologous Rh positive cells in sodium chloride solutions, but appear to combine with them and to inhibit the action of Rh agglutinins (4, 7, 8), has made these serums and the anti-Rh globuli...|$|R
