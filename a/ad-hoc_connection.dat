40|$|Graduation date: 2015 As screen {{resolution}} and video decoding capability have increased, high-definition (HD) video in resolutions {{as high as}} 1920 x 1080 is rapidly becoming the standard. Ad-hoc streaming of HD video over 802. 11 wireless networks, e. g., streaming from a mobile device to a television, is convenient for users, but is hampered by bandwidth restrictions of 802. 11 g and 802. 11 n. In particular, performance suffers if the 802. 11 channel is crowded with many transmitting nodes or contains a hidden terminal. In this paper, we present a method for dynamically selecting an 802. 11 channel frequency for transmitting HD video between a transmitting and receiving node in an <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>connection.</b> We consider both {{the selection of the}} initial 802. 11 channel and the need to change the channel if video quality begins to suffer, while keeping the overhead of channel changes to a minimum.

30|$|In a {{conventional}} cellular network end users connect {{directly to a}} Base Station (BS). Mobile relaying allows establishing an indirect two-hop link between the end user, called Mobile Node (MN), and the BS through a Mobile Relay (MR). This spreads out the cell coverage and increases the cell-edge throughput hence improving fairness among nodes. This article is focused on a Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) cellular network where MNs and MRs are connected through a Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>connection.</b> It is proposed the use of Media Independent Handover (MIH) signaling to define an efficient dynamic routing mechanism for MR in this framework. The proposed mechanism, called MIH-Driven Relay Selection Mechanism (MIDRES), detects {{which is the best}} direct or indirect link with the BS based on information collected using MIH messages. The MNs or MRs send MIH messages when experiencing bad channel conditions, that is detected thanks to predefined thresholds. Then, the BS starts a polling process, again supported by MIH signaling, and performs optimal route selection either through the LTE-A radio interface or through a WiFi ad-hoc interface. This article examines the implementation of this mechanism and obtains the optimal thresholds that maximize operational performance. Moreover, the potential benefit of this LTE-compliant mobile relaying solution is evaluated using a calibrated simulation tool. The results show significant savings in cost of network deployment.|$|E

Co-location {{of devices}} {{is a useful}} basis for access control {{policies}} for <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>connections,</b> as physical security, visibility and social norms provide reassurances to the device owners and participants. There are various possible techniques for demonstrating co-location through physical interactions, which others have started to explore.

In all cases these techniques are dependant upon hardware capabilities, offer varying physical scope and levels of attack resistance, and require different levels of user attention and visible public action. Different trade-offs amongst these considerations are desired in different situations. In this paper we present a framework for negotiating such pairings. This facilitates device identification, matching of pairing techniques to requirements, chains of communication to bridge between devices of different capability and improved security by combining techniques where possible...|$|R

Establishing secure {{communication}} channels between devices that share no a priori context, {{also known as}} the device-pairing problem, is the first step towards the realization of mobile, interoperable applications interacting across several devices. One approach that promises to be both secure and usable relies on so-called auxiliary or out-of-band channels for authentication. Although many such solutions have been independently suggested, open, easily usable implementations are unfortunately missing so far. In this demonstration, we present OpenUAT, an open source toolkit for establishing secure <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>connections.</b> Open-UAT implements many of the auxiliary channels proposed {{in the past few years}} on top of a unified, common cryptographic protocol for key exchange and runs on a variety of mobile phones and desktop/laptop computers.

Each of these methods has their own disadvantages. Some are expensive to implement, while others are not very accurate.

40|$|Abstract — Nowadays {{heterogeneity}} of communication technologies would allow nodes to be optimally connected nearly anytime and anywhere. Unfortunately, the different technologies are {{not designed for}} seamless interworking. The heterogeneity is often perceived as a hurdle instead of an enabler for being always best connected. The dynamic selection and configuration of the most appropriate technology is by far too complex for the end user, especially when considering <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>connections.</b> The concept of Cellular Assisted Heterogeneous Networking (CAHN) provides a framework to offer convenient and secure management of heterogeneous end-to-end sessions between nodes. Furthermore, the proposed out-of-band signaling enables the seamless integration of ad-hoc links to offer best performance whenever nodes are within vicinity. The introduced separation of the signaling and the data plane allows to switch on power demanding broadband interfaces like GPRS, UMTS, or even WLAN only if actually required, i. e., data has to be sent or received). In this paper we present the potential benefits resulting from these two features enabled by CAHN. Extensive simulations show that both, the integration of ad-hoc links and the selective activation of high power broadband interfaces, can significantly increase the efficiency of heterogeneous sessions in terms of throughput and energy consumption.

In this paper we propose an approach for a completely decentralized, self-maintaining, light-weight, and sufficiently secure peer identification service that allows us to consistently map unique peer identifications onto dynamic IP addresses in environments with low online probability of the peers constituting the service. For security we apply a combination of PGP-like public key distribution and a quorum-based query scheme. We describe the algorithm as implemented in our P-Grid P 2 P lookup system and give a detailed analytical performance analysis demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of our approach. Our approach also can easily be adapted to other application domains, i. e., be used for other name services, because we do not impose any constraints on the type of mappings...|$|R

As they roam through networks, the users {{may choose to}} employ privacy-enhancing technologies to address their privacy needs and benefit from the computational power of the grid {{for a variety of}} tasks, including sharing content. The high rate of mobility of the users on the wireless grid, when combined with privacy enhancing mechanisms and <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>connections,</b> makes it difficult to conclusively link devices and/or individuals with network activities and to hold them liable for particular downloads. Protecting intellectual property in this scenario requires a solution that can work in absence of knowledge about behavior of particular individuals.

40|$|Mobile video {{broadcasting}} service, or mobile TV, {{is expected}} to become a popular application for 3 G wireless network operators. Most existing solutions for video Broadcast Multicast Services (BCMCS) in 3 G networks employ a single transmission rate to cover all viewers. The system-wide video quality of the cell is therefore throttled by a few viewers close to the boundary, and is far from reaching the social-optimum allowed by the radio resources available at the base station. In this paper, we propose a novel scalable video broadcast/multicast solution, SV-BCMCS, that efficiently integrates scalable video coding, 3 G broadcast and ad-hoc forwarding to balance the system-wide and worst-case video quality of all viewers at 3 G cell. In our solution, video is encoded into multiple layers. The base station broadcasts different layers at different rates to cover viewers at different ranges. All viewers are guaranteed to receive the base layer, and viewers closer to the base station can receive more enhancement layers. Using <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>connections,</b> viewers {{far away from the}} base station can obtain from their neighbors closer to the base station the enhancement layers that they cannot receive directly from the base station.

The IEEE's 802. 11 task group has developed a series of radio based replacements for the familiar wired ethernet LAN. At the same time another IEEE standards task group, 802. 15, together with a number of industry consortia, has introduced a new level of wireless networking based upon short range, <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>connections.</b> Currently, the most significant of these new Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) standards is Bluetooth, one of the first of the enabling technologies of Ami to be commercially available.

It is also used by: WiFi (IEEE 802. 11); a new WPAN standard called Zig- Bee; many types of simple devices such as garage door openers; and is polluted by unintentional radiators.
