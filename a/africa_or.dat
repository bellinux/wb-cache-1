5|$|The Mascarene martin or Mascarene swallow (Phedina borbonica) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} swallow {{family that}} breeds in Madagascar and in the Mascarene Islands. The nominate subspecies occurs on Mauritius and Réunion {{and has never been}} found away from the Mascarene Islands, but the smaller Madagascan subspecies, P.b.madagascariensis, is migratory and has been recorded wintering in East <b>Africa</b> <b>or</b> wandering to other Indian Ocean islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of lions kept in zoos are hybrids of different subspecies. Approximately 77% of the captive lions registered by the International Species Information System are of unknown origin. Nonetheless, they might carry genes that are extinct in the wild, {{and might be}} therefore important to maintain overall genetic variability of the lion. It is thought that those lions, imported to Europe before {{the middle of the}} 19th century, were mainly either Barbary lions from North <b>Africa</b> <b>or</b> lions from the Cape.|$|E
5|$|Breeding is {{normally}} from late May to August, {{but may be}} significantly earlier in northwest <b>Africa</b> <b>or</b> western Pakistan. Returning males arrive about {{two weeks before the}} females and establish territories which they patrol with wings held in a V-shape and tail fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Fights may take place in flight or on the ground. The male's display flight involves a similar wing and tail position with frequent wing clapping as he follows the female in a rising spiral. If she lands, he continues to display with bobbing and fluttering until the female spreads her wings and tail for copulation. Mating occasionally takes place on a raised perch instead of the ground. In good habitat, there may be 20pairs per square kilometre (50per square mile).|$|E

5|$|Sea {{levels were}} lower during the Pleistocene, {{so it was}} {{possible}} for species to colonise the Mascarene Islands from other areas. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Réunion is 3 million years old, which is enough time for new genera to evolve, but many endemics would have been wiped out by the eruption of the volcano Piton des Neiges between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. Most recent and extant species would therefore probably be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from <b>Africa</b> <b>or</b> Madagascar after this event. If the Mascarene parrot had in fact evolved into a distinct genus on Réunion prior to the volcanic eruption, it would {{have been one of the}} few survivors of this extinction event.|$|E
5|$|The exarchs of Africa were {{effectively}} Governor-Generals {{with both}} {{civilian and military}} powers. Their seat of power was Carthage. Historians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries ascribed much significance to this appointment, even suggesting it would require prominent ties of Heraclius the Elder to <b>Africa</b> <b>or</b> the wider Western Roman Empire. Later historians pointed, however, that this appointment {{was part of a}} wider pattern. In the 6th century, several prominent Byzantine military commanders had started their careers in the eastern regions of the Empire, often in the vicinity of Upper Mesopotamia. Then they were transferred to North Africa {{at some point in their}} respective careers. There is therefore no indication that this rotation from the eastern to the western provinces was unusual.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the sundew genus {{stretches}} from Alaska in the north to New Zealand in the south. The centers of diversity are Australia, with roughly 50% of all known species, and South America and southern Africa, each with more than 20 species. A few species are also found in large parts of Eurasia and North America. These areas, however, can be considered to form {{the outskirts of the}} generic range, as the ranges of sundews do not typically approach temperate or Arctic areas. Contrary to previous supposition, the evolutionary speciation of this genus is no longer thought to have occurred with the breakup of Gondwana through continental drift. Rather, speciation is now thought to have occurred {{as a result of a}} subsequent wide dispersal of its range. The origins of the genus are thought to have been in <b>Africa</b> <b>or</b> Australia.|$|E

5|$|The Axis command {{structure}} in the Mediterranean was centralised {{at the top and}} fragmented at the lower levels. Mussolini had monopolised authority over Italian armed forces in 1933, by taking the offices of Minister of War, Minister of the Navy and Minister of the Air Force. Feldmarschall Albert Kesselring of the Luftwaffe commanded the German ground forces in the theatre as Oberbefehlshaber Süd (OB Süd) but had no authority over Axis operations in North <b>Africa</b> <b>or</b> the organisation of convoys to Libya. Fliegerkorps II and Fliegerkorps X were subordinate to the normal chain of command of the Luftwaffe. Since November 1941, Kesselring had some influence over the conduct of the German naval operations in the Mediterranean, as nominal commander of Naval Command Italy (Marinekommando Italien) but this was subordinate to the Kriegsmarine chain of command. German service rivalries obstructed co-operation and there was little unity of effort between German and the Italian forces in the Mediterranean. Kesselring had the authority only to co-ordinate plans for combined operations by German and Italian forces and some influence {{on the use of the}} Regia Aeronautica for the protection of convoys to North Africa. The Italian Navy resisted all German attempts to integrate its operations, ships in different squadrons never trained together and Supermarina constantly over-ruled lower-level commanders.|$|E
5|$|These are {{species of}} craggy mountainous habitats, {{although}} all three will also frequent human habitation. The African rock martin {{and the south}} Asian dusky crag martin are resident, but the Eurasian crag martin is a partial migrant; birds breeding in southern Europe are largely resident, but some northern breeders and most Asian birds are migratory, wintering in north <b>Africa</b> <b>or</b> India. They do not normally form large breeding colonies, but are more gregarious outside the breeding season. These martins build neat mud nests under cliff overhangs or in crevices in their mountain homes, and have readily adapted to the artificial cliffs provided by buildings and motorway bridges. Up to five eggs, white with dark blotches at the wider end, may be laid, and a second clutch is common. Ptyonoprogne martins feed mainly on insects caught in flight, and patrol cliffs near the breeding site with a slow hunting flight as they seek their prey. They may be hunted by falcons and infected with mites and fleas, but their large ranges and populations mean {{that none of the}} crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
