5|$|Titanium is used {{in steel}} as an {{alloying}} element (ferro-titanium) to reduce grain size and as <b>a</b> <b>deoxidizer,</b> and in stainless steel to reduce carbon content. Titanium is often alloyed with aluminium (to refine grain size), vanadium, copper (to harden), iron, manganese, molybdenum, and other metals. Titanium mill products (sheet, plate, bar, wire, forgings, castings) find application in industrial, aerospace, recreational, and emerging markets. Powdered titanium {{is used in}} pyrotechnics {{as a source of}} bright-burning particles.|$|E
25|$|Ferrouranium {{is used as}} <b>a</b> <b>deoxidizer</b> (more {{powerful}} than ferrovanadium), for denitrogenizing steel, for forming carbides, and as an alloying element. In ferrous alloys, uranium increases the elastic limit and the tensile strength. In high speed steels, {{it has been used}} to increase toughness and strength in amounts between 0.05â€“5%. Uranium-alloyed steels can be used at very low temperatures; nickel-uranium alloys are resistant to even very aggressive chemicals, including aqua regia.|$|E
5000|$|Calcium - used as <b>a</b> <b>deoxidizer,</b> desulfurizer, or decarbonizer for ferrous and {{nonferrous}} alloys ...|$|E
50|$|Copper {{phosphide}} {{has a role}} in copper alloys, namely in phosphor bronze. It is <b>a</b> {{very good}} <b>deoxidizer</b> of copper.|$|R
40|$|Samples of {{aluminium}} alloys AA 2024 -T 3 and AA 7075 -T 6 were treated with <b>a</b> chromate-based <b>deoxidizer,</b> then conversion coated with a commercial cobalt-based solution and finally sealed with a commercial vanadate-based product. The alloy specimens were examined using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. The thickness of the cobalt-based conversion coating increased rapidly up to 5 min of immersion but more slowly for longer times. Sealing resulted in penetration of vanadium through the oxide and a small increase in thickness due to the deposition of a thin sealing coating within the pores and on the external surface of the cobalt-containing coating...|$|R
50|$|Nickel {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{alloying}} elements because it refines the pearlite and graphite structure, improves toughness, and evens out hardness differences between section thicknesses. Chromium is added in small amounts to reduce free graphite, produce chill, and because it is a powerful carbide stabilizer; nickel is often added in conjunction. A small amount of tin can be added as a substitute for 0.5% chromium. Copper is added in the ladle or in the furnace, on the order of 0.5-2.5%, to decrease chill, refine graphite, and increase fluidity. Molybdenum is added on the order of 0.3-1% to increase chill and refine the graphite and pearlite structure; it is often added in conjunction with nickel, copper, and chromium to form high strength irons. Titanium is added as <b>a</b> degasser and <b>deoxidizer,</b> but it also increases fluidity. 0.15-0.5% vanadium is added to cast iron to stabilize cementite, increase hardness, and increase resistance to wear and heat. 0.1-0.3% zirconium helps to form graphite, deoxidize, and increase fluidity.|$|R
50|$|Calcium {{silicide}} is {{used for}} manufacture of special metal alloys, e.g. for removing phosphorus and as <b>a</b> <b>deoxidizer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ferromanganese, a {{ferroalloy}} {{with high}} content of manganese, {{is made by}} heating a mixture of the oxides MnO2 and Fe2O3, with carbon, usually as coal and coke, in either a blast furnace or an electric arc furnace-type system, called a submerged arc furnace. The oxides undergo carbothermal reduction in the furnaces, producing the ferromanganese. Ferromanganese is used as <b>a</b> <b>deoxidizer</b> for steel.|$|E
