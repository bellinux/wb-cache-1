25|$|Hill ran {{the best}} times of her career in 1996. These {{included}} times of 6.69 seconds for the 55m, 7.21 seconds for the 60m indoors, and 22.49 seconds for the 200m outdoors. The 1996 United States Olympic Trials saw her improve her 100m best four times consecutively, recording 11.00 seconds in the first round, 10.99 seconds in the next round, 10.97 seconds in the semi-final, before crossing the line in 10.92 seconds to place third in the final. Working with LSU coach Dennis Shaver, she placed her improvements down to her being in a competitive training group, which included hurdler Kim Carson, and sprinters Sheila Echols and Zundra Feagin. Her place at the trials earned her selection for the United States at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Despite her {{being one of the}} three individual 100m runners (alongside Gail Devers <b>and</b> <b>Gwen</b> Torrence), she was not picked for the relay team on the basis of her being a straight-away specialist (positions occupied by the more favoured Devers and Torrence). At the 1996 Atlanta Games she reached the semi-finals of the 100m, but failed to improve in that round and was eliminated in sixth position.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} the show {{occurred}} to actor James Corden during a wedding reception, and he then developed the idea with co-writer Ruth Jones, whom he had met during the filming of ITV drama Fat Friends. Corden claims to {{have been inspired by}} the story of his own real life best friend Gavin, who met his wife over the phone at work, and arranged to meet. They presented it to the BBC as a one-off play, but the BBC instead asked for a full series. The roles of Gavin and Stacey were cast through an auditioning process, but were almost immediately given to Mathew Horne and Joanna Page on the strength of their chemistry together. The roles of Nessa and Smithy were written by Corden and Jones for themselves. Some roles were written with certain actors in mind; Uncle Bryn was written specifically for Rob Brydon, who had been to school with Jones, whilst Pam was written specifically for Alison Steadman, who had also worked on Fat Friends. Jones had worked with Julia Davis in her sitcom Nighty Night, and the role of Dawn was written with her in mind. Additionally, Corden had appeared with Adrian Scarborough in the Alan Bennett-penned play and film, The History Boys, which led to him being cast in the role of Pete. An audition process was used to cast the roles of Mick <b>and</b> <b>Gwen,</b> whilst the roles of Gavin's friends were given to Corden's co-stars in The History Boys.|$|E
