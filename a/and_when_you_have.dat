500|$|Journalists and pundits {{reviewing}} the final praised Liverpool's tenacity; radio commentator Alan Green {{wrote in his}} News Letter column of 14 May 2001: [...] "Simply, they never give up <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a player like Michael Owen within your ranks you believe that any situation can be rescued, {{as it was in}} the magnificent Millennium Stadium." [...] The Guardian correspondent David Lacey declared [...] "The Owen of France '98 was reborn in Cardiff," [...] while Hugh McIlvanney of The Sunday Times called Owen [...] "the master executioner of English football." [...] McIlvanney felt over the 90 minutes the Arsenal team were [...] "unlucky to lose," [...] lauding Vieira's show in midfield. James Lawton's match report in The Independent was not as empathetic; although in praise of Henry's performance his indecision compared to Owen, demonstrated how [...] "effect, not style, is everything" [...] in football. Clive White of The Herald criticised Henry's lack of end product, using the final and Arsenal's European failure against Valencia to demonstrate how he would never be considered a [...] "natural goalscorer". Ron Atkinson, writing in his tactics column for The Guardian noted Liverpool's winning goal only came about because of Arsenal's eagerness to attack, which left gaps in defence.|$|E
500|$|USA Today praised Laurie's {{performance}} and the repercussions of the season-four finale, stating [...] "a carry-over from last season's brilliant finale, House is firmly in the forefront. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an actor of Hugh Laurie's range, depth and charisma, putting him center-stage makes perfect sense, particularly when you've written a story that explores the character and his primary relationships {{in a way that}} seems". The New York Daily News noted that [...] "The show pays more attention to relationships we care about, hints at a sensible number of new ones that show some promise, and thus doesn't rely on obscure medical mysteries to carry the whole dramatic burden", and noted that [...] "the prognosis for this season could be better than last season seemed to foreshadow". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times highlighted the performances of the cast, especially Michael Weston as detective Lucas Douglas, calling him a [...] "delightful addition". She concluded, [...] "So different is the premiere that the savvy House (and Fox) viewer may expect the revelation that it was all a fever dream. That {{does not seem to be}} the case, and one assumes that Laurie and the writers will be bringing a different version of their now-iconic character back to Princeton. Not too different, of course, but different enough." [...] Conversely, The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan disliked Weston's character, calling him [...] "An unwelcome distraction... an irritating pipsqueak". She continued saying [...] "House used to be one of the best shows on TV, but it's gone seriously off the rails". The Sunday Times felt that the show had [...] "lost its sense of humour". The focus on Thirteen and her eventual involvement with Foreman also came under particular criticism.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Richard Abels sees Alfred's {{educational}} and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion {{and learning in}} Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as {{the building of the}} burhs. As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people. The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: [...] "Study Wisdom, then, <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it".|$|E

2500|$|Many of Zinzendorf's {{beliefs and}} acts were based upon his father's words: “I live no more; {{he lives in}} me. I speak no more; he speaks in me. When you speak with me, you speak with him. When you have love for me, so too you have love for him, and when you hate me, so too you hate him, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a word from me, so too you have it from him.” [...] Seeing Christ in Christian's eyes is a theme from the period in poetry, {{painting}} and engraving. An engraving complete with his portrait states that {{one can see the}} departed Christ by looking at Christel's forehead, meaning his eyes. A portrait of him now in the Moravian Archives in Herrnhut, Germany, includes the words Gebrochne Augen(broken eyes), again referring to seeing Christ at the moment of death in Christian's eyes, or at the moment of his completed sacrifice.|$|E
2500|$|Hardenbergh died on 30 October 1790 of {{tuberculosis}} in New Brunswick, New Jersey. [...] He was interred in the churchyard of the First Reformed Church in New Brunswick. The inscription on his grave {{was written by}} the Reverend John Henry Livingston and exhorts mourners to [...] "go walk in his virtuous footsteps; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> finished the work assigned you, you shall rest with him in eternal peace." [...] It eulogises Hardenbergh as [...] "a zealous preacher of the Gospel, and his life and conversation afforded, from his earliest days, to all who knew him, a bright example of real piety...a steady patriot, and in his public and private conduct he manifested himself to be the enemy of tyranny and oppression, the lover of freedom, and the friend of his country." [...] At {{the time of his}} death, Hardenbergh was a wealthy man—largely due to monies and property inherited from his father and grandfather—and was the owner of 40,000 acres of land in Ulster County that was once part of his grandfather's patent.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the release}} of their debut album, the band {{recorded}} two demos in 1999 and 2000. In mid-2001, {{it was reported that}} Meacham had attempted suicide by drinking excessive amounts of cough syrup. The attempt affected the band's Take Action Tour. During his hospitalization he remained in poor condition and was replaced by Dameon Ash. In an interview, lead singer M. Shadows said of Meacham that [...] "he perma-fried his brain and was in a mental institution for a long time, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> someone in your band who does that, it ruins everything that's going on all around you, and it makes {{you want to do something}} to prevent it from happening to other people." [...] Avenged Sevenfold's debut album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, was recorded when the band members were in their late teens and still in high school. It was originally released on their first label, Good Life Recordings in 2001. When lead guitarist Synyster Gates joined the band after the album was released, the introductory track [...] "To End the Rapture" [...] was re-recorded featuring a full band element. The album was subsequently re-released on Hopeless Records in 2002. The band started to receive recognition, performing with bands such as Mushroomhead and Shadows Fall and playing on the Take Action Tour.|$|E

2500|$|No, we do {{not love}} humanity; {{but on the other}} hand we are not nearly [...] "German" [...] enough, in the sense in which the word [...] "German" [...] is {{constantly}} being used nowadays, to advocate nationalism and race hatred and to be able to take pleasure in the national scabies of the heart and blood poisoning that now leads the nations of Europe to delimit and barricade themselves against each other as if it were a matter of quarantine.

[...] We are, in one word—and let this be our word of honor!— good Europeans, the heirs of Europe, the rich, oversupplied, but also overly obligated heirs of thousands of years of European spirit: as such, we have also outgrown Christianity and are averse to it, and precisely because we have grown out of it, because our ancestors were Christians who in their Christianity were uncompromisingly upright; for their faith they willingly sacrificed possessions and position, blood and fatherland. We—do the same. For what? For our unbelief? For every kind of unbelief? No, you know better than that, my friends!

2500|$|Philo saw in [...] {{accusations against}} [...] "the self-loving man." [...] Philo cited Cain {{as an example}} of one who (in [...] ) showed his {{gratitude}} to God too slowly. Philo taught that we should hurry to please God without delay. Thus [...] enjoins, [...] "If you vow a vow, you shall not delay to perform it." [...] Philo explained that a vow is a request to God for good things, and [...] thus enjoins that when one has received them, one must offer gratitude to God as soon as possible.

[...] Philo taught that one does not forget God when one remembers one's own nothingness and God's exceeding greatness. Philo interpreted [...] to reprove those who look upon themselves as the cause of what they have received, telling them: [...] "Say not my own might, or the strength of my right hand has acquired me all this power, but remember always the Lord your God, who gives you the might to acquire power." [...] And Philo read [...] to address those who think that they deserve what they have received, saying, [...] "You do not enter into this land to possess it because of your righteousness, or because of the holiness of your heart; but, in the first place, because of the iniquity of these nations, since God has brought on them the destruction of wickedness; and in the second place, that He may establish the covenant that He swore to our Fathers." [...] Philo interpreted the term [...] "covenant" [...] figuratively to mean God's graces.
