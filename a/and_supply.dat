5|$|Battering Aitutaki {{with wind}} gusts {{in excess of}} 185km/h (115mph), Cyclone Pat devastated the island. Approximately 78percent of homes were damaged, with 72structures destroyed. The {{electrical}} grid was left completely offline <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> of water was largely lost. Agriculture also experienced tremendous impact, with most crops completely lost. Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US$13.7million; however, casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported. Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm, with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government. A reconstruction plan was enacted by the Cook Islands within a month and subsequently funded by New Zealand. Owing to its destructive effects, the name Pat was later retired and replaced with Pili.|$|E
5|$|British General John Burgoyne moved {{south from}} the {{province}} of Quebec in June 1777 {{to gain control of}} the upper Hudson River valley. His campaign had become bogged down in difficulties following a victory at Fort Ticonderoga.

One attempt to alleviate these difficulties failed when nearly 1,000 men were killed or captured at the August 16 Battle of Bennington. Furthermore, news reached Burgoyne on August 28 that St. Leger's expedition down the Mohawk River valley had turned back after the failed Siege of Fort Stanwix.|$|E

To prevent prolonged resistance, the Allies, now aware of the German supply timetables through the use of British Ultra, launched an aerial offensive to destroy this link. It was due to begin in the last week of March 1943, but bad weather over Tunisia meant that it could not begin until 5 April.|$|E

Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but this is still a substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy.
