5000|$|By 1968, {{the only}} vehicle {{produced}} by AMC {{to carry the}} Rambler marque, was the compact Rambler American. Although designed as a no-nonsense economy car, the American spawned the audacious SC/Rambler developed with Hurst Performance. While AMC planned to produce only 500 for the 1969 model year, the [...] "Scrambler" [...] proved so popular two more groups of about 500 each were built. All featured the same 390 cid L V8, four-barrel carburetor, and close-ratio four-speed transmission of the AMX, plus Hurst shifter, Twin-Grip (limited slip) differential, and cold <b>air</b> <b>hood.</b> For the final year in 1969 the models were simply called Rambler. The 1969 Rambler (and Chevrolet Corvair and Dodge Dart) were the only U.S. compact cars available that year in a two-door hardtop body style; Ford compacts were only available as sedans.|$|E
50|$|The 1972 Hurst/Olds was {{actually}} developed by Hurst Performance, and not Oldsmobile. Due to a tragic accident involving the 1971 Indy Pace car, a Dodge Challenger, the major auto manufacturers {{were reluctant to}} provide the pace car for the 1972 Indy race. Hurst Performance stepped up and volunteered to sponsor the 1972 Pace car. Oldsmobile provided the Cutlass Supreme coupe and convertible. It {{was the only time}} an Indy Pace car was sponsored by a manufacturer other than an automobile manufacturer, and first time to include a major supplier's name in the title. The 1972 edition of the Hurst/Olds had some of the lowest production numbers of any produced with a total of 629 made; 130 Convertibles, 220 hardtop with sunroof, 6 Station Wagons for Press and Ambulance use, and 279 hardtop cars. The only color available was Cameo White with reflective 3M gold stripes that were stickers, not paint. All of the cars had the W-25 Ram <b>Air</b> <b>Hood</b> and gold SS III Rally Wheels with a chrome bolt-on center cap and chrome beauty ring. The tires were Goodyear Polysteel Radials. The standard Hurst/Olds engine was a 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 rated at 270 net horsepower. Optional at extra cost was the W-30 option with the L77 455, a blueprinted engine rated at 300 net horsepower. Both engines were mated to a Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission with console-mounted Hurst Dual-Gate shifter. All of the 1972 Hurst/Olds had the black Strato bucket interior with a center console. Special Hurst/Olds Pace Car badging adourned the glove box door and all 1972 Hurst/Olds' were identified with a W-45 Code on the cowl tag.|$|E
5000|$|Available in {{late spring}} 1998, the basic design of the {{fifth-generation}} Grand Am was shared with the Oldsmobile Alero (also new for 1999) and Chevrolet Malibu (introduced in 1997). The length was shortened slightly, but the wheelbase grew by more than three inches (76 mm). The suspension was now fully independent, with a revised MacPherson-Strut design up front. The rear suspension is a more refined Multi-link design. The new Grand Am was offered in five trim levels: SE, SE1, SE2, GT, and GT1. The 2.4 L Twin Cam engine was carried over, with [...] and [...] of torque. GM's 3400 V6, previously exclusive to their Minivans, became available as an option on the SE and SE1, and was standard on all other trim levels. For 1999, all the Grand Ams featured a four-speed automatic transmission. The GT and GT1 also included 4-wheel disc brakes, and all Grand Ams until 2003 included standard ABS and Traction Control (made optional on SE from 2003). The GTs also had a Ram Air induction system, providing an extra five horsepower and 5 lb/ft of torque over the 3.4 L V6 when installed {{in any of the}} SE-level trims. The 2000 models added a Getrag five-speed manual transmission as standard equipment with the four-cylinder. On GT models, the badge on the front fenders now read [...] "RamAir V6", instead of [...] "V6H.O." [...] on 1999 GT's. ASC Creative Services designed the Grand Am SC/T for the SEMA show circuit, which was the concept design for the Ram <b>Air</b> <b>hood</b> and body package. The SC/T later became an appearance package, beginning in 2003. A road test by Car and Driver showed a 0-60 mph time of 7.7 seconds in a GT sedan with an automatic.|$|E

50|$|Reduced <b>air</b> volume <b>hoods</b> (a {{variation}} of low-flow/high performance hoods) incorporate a bypass block to partially close off the bypass, reducing the air volume and thus conserving energy. Usually, the block {{is combined with}} a sash stop to limit {{the height of the}} sash opening, ensuring a safe face velocity during normal operation while lowering the <b>hood’s</b> <b>air</b> volume. By reducing the air volume, the RAV hood can operate with a smaller blower, which is another cost-saving advantage.|$|R
40|$|A supply <b>air</b> <b>hood</b> is {{described}} {{that provides a}} curtain of clean air just outside of the hood surface for protection of the operator. The design consists of an overhead plenum which extends out from the hood with tapered sides extending from the plenum to the bench, a slotted baffle plate and two perforated plates with offset holes, dust filters, and a special deflector plate. The latter introduces less than 4 cubic feet flow per minute through the special perforated area so that a sweeping effort is almost always maintained at bench level. Performance tests indicate that even under adverse exhaust conditions some of the supply air may be lost to the room, {{but none of the}} air within the hood that represents contaminated flow is entrained or displayed so that it enters the work area. This hood operates with an efficiency of about 90 % exhaust for supplied air...|$|E

40|$|Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, {{prepared}} by incubating autologous lymphocytes in cell culture medium with interleukin- 2, selectively lyse tumor cells and are effective immunotherapy of some cancers. During a 3 -month period, two patients at our center were infused with LAK cells subsequently {{found to have}} been contaminated by Aspergillus fumigatus. Each case was investigated by obtaining environmental cultures and assessing aseptic practices during LAK cell preparation. Investigation of the first case demonstrated a malfunction of the laminar <b>air</b> flow <b>hood,</b> under which interleukin- 2 and the patient's lymphocytes had been added to cell culture medium, and showed heavy A. fumigatus contamination of the hood, adjacent countertop, and cell culture incubator. Despite repair of the laminar <b>air</b> flow <b>hood</b> and cleaning of the laboratory, a second case occurred, and cultures at that time implicated the humidified cell culture incubators {{as the source of}} A. fumigatus. Following incubator sterilization and removal of the humidffication apparatus from the incubators, weekly environmental cultures in the LAK cell laboratory were negative, and none of the LAK cell cultures from the 20 patients treated during the ensuing 15 months grew A. fumigatus. Our findings show that growth of fungi in humidified incubators, which previously has caused contamination problems in tissue culture and clinical microbiology laboratories, can result in patient infections when humidified incubators are used to prepare cells for reinfusion...|$|R

50|$|A ducted {{system allows}} for removal {{of all forms}} of {{airborne}} contamination, while a ductless one recirculates heat and moisture into the kitchen. In addition, a ducted application eliminates the need for regular replacement of the filters, and avoids the airflow restriction (and resultant loss of power) caused by them. However, ducted application can be impractical, due to lack of space or ability to install a duct system, make-up air requirements, or the additional cost of heating/cooling the make-up <b>air.</b> Some range <b>hood</b> designs allow for both types of applications.|$|R
50|$|Since RAV hoods have {{restricted}} sash {{movement and}} reduced <b>air</b> volume, these <b>hoods</b> are less flexible {{in what they}} can be used for and can only be used for certain tasks. Another drawback to RAV hoods is that users can in theory override or disengage the sash stop. If this occurs, the face velocity could drop to an unsafe level. To counter this condition, operators must be trained never to override the sash stop while in use, and only to do so when loading or cleaning the hood.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to Isolators, {{there are also}} extensive barriers that provide sub-isolation protection, but {{have a very good}} track record of reducing hazards to sterile drugs during processing when they are designed and operated properly. This extensive barrier is known as a restricted access barrier system, or RABS. A barrier cabinet using RABS design and control, is below the isolator in its ability to assure sterility assurance and containment, but far better than the traditional laminar <b>air</b> flow <b>hood</b> or [...] "open process" [...] designs that are progressively being phased-out by the industries. In particular, a RABS that operates only in closed-door mode after the equipment setup and sporadic disinfection is performed, is commonly used now and provides substantial risk mitigation. These [...] "closed RABS" [...] require all processing interventions to be done using gauntlet gloves attached to the RABS walls. In contrast, RABS designs that require door openings during processing would lead to more microbial contamination hazards than a RABS that is kept closed.|$|R

40|$|Automated {{systems can}} be used to {{facilitate}} continual collection of biological information from a large number of samples over long periods of time. The use of an automated system and image analysis would allow semi-continual monitoring and non– invasive quantification of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression and would therefore provide a better assessment of the levels of gfp gene expression than monitoring GFP at large time intervals. The main aim of this research was to monitor and quantify the expression of the gfp gene from the jellyfish (Aequorea victoria) and in vitro plant growth over time using an automated image acquisition system in combination with image analysis. The system, developed over the course of this work, consisted of a computer controlled two–dimensional positioning table and a charged-coupled device (CCD) camera mounted on a stereomicroscope equipped with a GFP fluorescence detection system.
