Results from this monitoring network are presented and the spatial aspect throughout Flanders is included, linking POP levels to the industrial characteristics of the different sampling locations. The following PBDE congeners were measured using GC/MS: 28, 47, 49, 66, 85, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183 and 209. Concentrations of ? PBDE ranged between 10 and 5811 ng/g lipid weight (lw) with a median value of 81 ng/g lw. BDE 47 dominated the PBDE profile in the majority of the eel samples, except for six samples, in which BDE 209 was the dominating congener. These latter samples are probably associated with recent exposure to the Deca-BDE mixture. Three HBCD diastereoisomers (a-, ß- and ?-HBCD) were measured using LC/MS-MS. ? HBCDs ranged between 16 and 4397 ng/g lw, with a median value of 73 ng/g lw. a-HBCD was the dominant isomer in all eel samples. Sediment concentrations of PBDEs were available from four locations and were used to compare the PBDE profile with those in eel. An important shift in the profile was observed, especially for BDE 209. While BDE 209 was only found in 12 eel samples, it was the dominant congener in all sediment samples. This could be due to its metabolisation or degradation in biota combined with the poor uptake of BDE 209 from sediments and its very low water solubility. No HBCDs were detected in any of the sediment samples. No significant correlation could be found between concentrations of PBDEs in eel and sediment from the same location. Comparison with previous studies shows that PBDE and HBCD levels in Flemish eels have decreased rapidly between 2000 and 2006 at particular sites, but <b>alarming</b> <b>concentrations</b> can still be found at industrialized hot spots. This finding is reflected in the human exposure to PBDEs and HBCDs through eel consumption. For average consumers (2. 9 g eel/day), intakes ranged between 3 and 2295 ng/day for ? PBDEs (with a median value of 16 ng/day) and between 3 and 1110 ng/day for ? HBCDs (with a median value of 18 ng/day), respectively.

40|$|Hypoxanthine- 3 -N-oxide (H 3 NO) {{has been}} {{identified}} as the putative alarm pheromone of ostariophysan fishes. Previously we demonstrated a population-specific minimum behavioural-response threshold in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to a H 3 NO concentration of approximately 0. 4 nM. Minnows may, however, perceive low concentrations of H 3 NO as a predation threat, even though they do not exhibit an overt behavioural response. We conducted a series of laboratory trials to test the hypothesis that minnows can detect the <b>alarm</b> pheromone at <b>concentrations</b> below the minimum behavioural-response threshold. We exposed predator-naïve fathead minnows to H 3 NO at concentrations ranging from 0. 4 to 0. 05 nM paired with the odour of a novel predator (yellow perch, Perca flavescens) or distilled water paired with perch odour. We observed significant increases in antipredator behaviour (increased shoal cohesion, movement towards the substrate, a reduction in feeding, and an increase in the occurrence of dashing and freezing behaviour) in shoals of minnows exposed to a combined cue of 0. 4 nM H 3 NO and perch odour (compared with a distilled-water control), but not by shoals exposed to lower concentrations of H 3 NO paired with perch odour or those exposed to distilled water paired with perch odour. When exposed to perch odour alone 4 days later, minnows initially conditioned to H 3 NO at concentrations of 0. 4 – 0. 1 nM exhibited significant increases in antipredator behaviour. These data demonstrate that minnows attend to the <b>alarm</b> pheromone at <b>concentrations</b> below the minimum behavioural-response threshold and are able to acquire the ability to recognize a novel predator even though they do not exhibit an overt behavioural response. ...|$|R
40|$|The antipredator {{behaviour}} of prey organisms {{is shaped}} {{by a series of}} threat-sensitive trade-offs between the benefits associated with successful predator avoidance and a suite of other fitness-related behaviours such as foraging, mating and territorial defence. Recent research has shown that the overall intensity of antipredator response and the pattern of threat-sensitive trade-offs are influenced by current conditions, including variability in predation risk over a period of days to weeks. Here, we tested the hypothesis that long-term predation pressure will likewise have shaped the nature of the threat-sensitive antipredator behaviour of wild-caught Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Female guppies were collected two populations that have evolved under high- and low-predation pressure, respectively, in the Aripo River, Northern Mountain Range, Trinidad. Under laboratory conditions, we exposed shoals of three guppies to varying concentrations of conspecific damage-released chemical alarm cues. Lower Aripo (high-predation) guppies exhibited the strongest antipredator response when exposed to the highest <b>alarm</b> cue <b>concentration</b> and a graded decline in response intensity with decreasing <b>concentrations</b> of <b>alarm</b> cue. Upper Aripo (low-predation) guppies, however, exhibited a nongraded (hypersensitive) response pattern. Our results suggest that long-term predation pressure shapes not only the overall intensity of antipredator responses of Trinidadian guppies, but also their threat-sensitive behavioural response patterns. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} assess local predation risk {{is critical to}} prey individuals, as {{it allows them to}} maximize threat-sensitive trade-offs between predator avoidance and other fitness related activities. A wide range of taxonomically diverse prey (including many freshwater fishes) relies on chemical alarm cues (alarm pheromones) as their primary information source for local risk assessment. However, the value of chemical alarm cues has been questioned due to the availability of additional sensory inputs (i. e., visual cues) and the lack of an overt antipredator response under conditions of low perceived risk. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that chemical <b>alarm</b> cues at <b>concentrations</b> below the point at which they elicit an overt behavioral response function to increase vigilance towards other sensory modalities (i. e., visual alarm cues). Shoals of glowlight tetras (Hemigrammus erythrozonus) exposed to the subthreshold concentration of hypoxanthine- 3 -N-oxide (the putative Ostariophysan alarm pheromone) did not exhibit an overt antipredator response in the absence of secondary visual cues (not different than the distilled water control). However, when exposed to the sight of a visually alarmed conspecific, they significantly increased the intensity of their antipredator response (not different from shoals exposed to the suprathreshold alarm cue). This study demonstrates that prey may benefit from responding to low <b>concentration</b> <b>alarm</b> cues by increasing vigilance towards secondary cues during local risk assessment, {{even in the absence of}} an overt behavioral response. By increasing vigilance towards secondary risk assessment cues in the presence of a low risk chemical cue, individuals are likely able to maximize the threat-sensitive trade-offs between predator avoidance and other fitness related activities.

40|$|Prey that {{respond to}} {{inappropriate}} cues in their assessment of predation risk {{spend more time}} performing defensive behaviours and less time undertaking behaviours that promote fitness. Hence, prey should respond to cues that are the best predictors of predation risk relevant to the prey individual. Many fish undergo ontogenetic shifts in habitat and resource use during their lifetime; consequently, prey fish are exposed {{to a variety of}} predators at different stages of their development. Also, as relative <b>concentration</b> of the <b>alarm</b> cue represents both spatial and temporal information about a predation event, prey should adjust the intensity of their antipredator response in a threat-sensitive manner. We found that the ambon damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, exhibited a threat-sensitive response to damage-released cues of conspecifics, with the magnitude of the response dependent on the cue concentration. Higher cue concentrations (suggesting a greater threat) elicited a stronger avoidance response, while low cue concentrations (weak threats) elicited a weak antipredator response. Moreover, the nature of the response depended on the ontogenetic stage of the cue donor. Reef-naïve recruit individuals exhibited consistent antipredator behaviours when exposed to <b>alarm</b> cue <b>concentrations</b> from individuals of the same ontogenetic stage, modest antipredator responses to juvenile skin extracts, and no antipredator behaviours when exposed to cues from adult fish. Individuals that alter their avoidance response in a manner that reflects the magnitude of risk successfully balance the trade-off between defensive and risky or fitness-promoting behaviours, and natural selection would presumably favour these individuals...|$|R
40|$|Eels (Anguilla {{anguilla}} L.) {{live in the}} brackish waters vallis of the Mediterranean, {{where the}} elvers enter the lagoons and estuaries and grow in the sheltered areas, feeding on natural food available in the bottom sediments. Eels are therefore exposed to persistent pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides. These lipophilic xenobiotics tend to accumulate in high concentrations in this species because of its considerable fat amount. <b>Alarming</b> <b>concentrations</b> form heavily polluted areas {{have been reported in}} eels; for example, 91 % of this species of fish from the lower Elbe River contained levels exceeding the regulatory limits. Moreover, studies from the river Rhine have suggested that the high levels of organochlorine residues found in eels, are due to biomagnification through the food chain. PCBs and chlorinated pesticides have also been detected in different species of fish in the final stretch of the River Po, which is considered a land based source of pollution in the Adriatic Sea. In order to find out whether contamination by PCBs and organochlorine pesticides in the Po Delta poses a risk to human and animal health, studies on the content of the above pollutants in eels were carried out. Twenty eels of 548 +- 126 g weight and 43 +- cm length, were caught twice a year, in March and October 1994. Fish muscles were homogenized in a mixer and freeze-dried. A 30 g sample of the above mixture was dissolved in 20 ml of acetonitrile and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 5 minutes. After sedimentation the supernatant was centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 10 minutes, following which the volume was reduced by means of a rotavapor to about 5 ml and the resulting extract passed through a liquid chromatography LC- 18 (octadecyl) column in order to remove lipids and hydrocarbons. Subsequently, this extract was passed through a LC-NH 2 (aminopropil) column to remove polar substances such as amines and organic acids and then it was further concentrated under a gentle stream of N 2 at room temperature. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Hewlett Packard 5890 GC with a 5989 mass selective detector) equipped with a fused silica capillary column (Alltech SE 30 m x 0. 25 mm) was used for the quantification of the pesticides. The operating conditions were as follows: injection port temperature 260 °C, column initial temperature 100 °C, rate of temperature increase 10 °C/min. With a final temperature of 300 °C, helium was used as the carrier gas (25 cm/sec at 200 °C). The mass spectrometer was used in SIM mode (Selected Ion Monitoring) under the following conditions: electron energy 70 eV, source temperature 200 °C, quadrupole temperature 100 °C, electron multiplier voltage 2200 V. The SIM programmes used for the analysis of chlorinated pesticides and PCBs were selected to enable the simultaneous determination of more than fifty compounds. Confirmation and quantification of the various pesticides and PCBs, were carried out by comparison with standard of 99 - 100 % purity (Cambridge Isotope Lab., Woburn, MA, USA). The levels of pollutants found in fish muscle demonstrate the continuing presence of p,p’-DDT (4. 16 +- 0. 76 µg/kg dry weight) and some metabolites (p,p’-DDE and p,p’-DDD) although it has been banned in Italy since 1978. Contamination with other organochlorinated pesticides was significant, whereas for PCBs high values were found (23. 80 +- 8. 15 µg/kg dry weight). However, this levels do not present risk for the survival and normal development of fish living in this area.

40|$|Fishes in the {{superorder}} Ostariophysi, including fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), possess specialized epidermal club {{cells that}} contain an alarm substance. Damage to these cells, as would occur during a predator attack, causes {{the release of}} the alarm substance and can indicate the presence of actively foraging predators to nearby conspecifics. For nearly 70 years, research involving epidermal club cells has focused on the alarm substance and the role it plays in predator/prey interactions.

Fish increase investment in epidermal club cells upon exposure to skin penetrating pathogens and parasites. In this study I tested for differences in epidermal club cell investment by fathead minnows exposed to the immunosuppressive effects of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol. In experiment 1, fathead minnows were exposed to either a single intraperitoneal injection of corn oil or no injection at all. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether corn oil, the vehicle for cortisol injections in later experiments, had an effect on epidermal club cell density. The treatments had no effect on epidermal club cell size, cell area, or epidermal thickness. In experiment 2, skin extract was prepared from the skin of corn oil injected and non injected fathead minnows as in experiment 1 to determine whether corn oil had an effect on the epidermal club cell <b>alarm</b> substance <b>concentration.</b> The treatments showed no significant differences in observed anti-predator behaviour, including change in shelter use, dashing and freezing. In experiment 3, fathead minnows were exposed to either a single intraperitoneal injection of cortisol or corn oil. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether cortisol, a known immunosuppressant, had an effect on epidermal club cell investment. Fathead minnows exposed to a single cortisol injection had significantly reduced respiratory burst activity of kidney phagocytes indicating that there was suppression of the innate immune system. Furthermore, cortisol treated fathead minnows showed significantly lower numbers of epidermal club cells. The treatments had no effect on individual epidermal club cell area, epidermal thickness and serum cortisol levels after 12 days. The results from this experiment suggest that pharmacological cortisol injections in fathead minnows have a suppressive effect on the fish innate immune system. Furthermore, the findings that cortisol induced immunosuppression also influences epidermal club cell investment provides support for the hypothesis that epidermal club cells may function as part of the fish immune system...|$|R

The statistical analysis of ANOVA shows significant differences among the concentrations of the metals in the stations, tipificated for the presence of different averages. The averages levels for the superficial sediments of the area are the following ones: Fe (3365. 44 ± 261. 61), Mn (132. 17 ± 25. 46), Zn (253. 04 ± 86. 48), Pb (17. 02 ± 2. 21) y Co (4. 65 ± 0. 76) μg/g. In similarly way, in the muscular tissue of the fish the following concentrations were quantified: Fe between (31. 26 ± 0. 06) and (68. 36 ± 0. 05); Mn between (2. 02 ± 0. 05) and (4. 16 ± 0. 03); Zn between (19. 09 ± 0. 01) and (28. 89 ± 0. 01); Pb between (0. 38 ± 0. 01) and (0. 47 ± 0. 03) μg/g. The analysis reflects a remarkable association between the high securities of concentrations of metals and the sediments type, with a growing gradient toward the sediments type mud. These are <b>alarming</b> values in <b>concentration</b> of Pb and Zn, attributed to the stress that produces the anthropogenic activities surrounding the Lagoon of Castillero. It can be concluded that based on the diagnosis that the ecosystem of the lagoon is in evident state of deterioration with implications that could affect the species inhabit, and the economic activities of the population that exploit the resources biotiques of that body of water...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic is {{considered}} as being synonymous with toxicity. <b>Alarming</b> As <b>concentrations</b> in natural waters is a worldwide problem. With greater public concern of As poisoning on human health, the developing regulatory guidelines and remediation technologies for mitigating As-contaminated ecosystems {{is an important}} issue. Urgent steps {{must be taken to}} reduce these impacts by providing access to safe water as a basic human right. Delaying mitigation is increasing death and disease. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) show excellent capacity to sorb and exchange anions. Although arsenic (As) has a high affinity for sorbents containing Fe, only few studies have been carried out on the sorption of arsenite [As(III) ] onto a Fe-based LDH. In this work we studied the sorption of As(III) onto a LDH containing Mg and Fe (Mg–Fe-LDH), as affected by: (i) pH; (ii) the presence of increasing concentrations of organic [citrate (CIT) and oxalate (OX) ] and inorganic [phosphate (PO 4), selenite (SeO 3) and sulphate (SO 4) ] ligands, (iii) the effect of residence time on the desorption of As(III) by these ligands, and; (iv) the kinetics of desorption of As(III) by PO 4. The As(III) sorption isotherms, carried out at different pHs, indicated a good affinity of the harmful oxyanion for the sorption sites of the Mg–Fe-LDH. This material was able to remove efficiently As(III) from contaminated solutions over a wide range of pH, but more in acidic than in alkaline systems. Competing ligands differently prevented the As(III) sorption on Mg–Fe-LDH, according to the following order: SO 4 < OX << SeO 3 < CIT < PO 4. The desorption of As(III) by these anions decreased with increasing As(III) residence time on LDH surfaces. A comparison between the sorption/desorption of As(III) and As(V) on/from Mg–Fe-LDH in {{the presence or absence of}} anions highlights that less As(III) than As(V) is sorbed, whereas more As(III) than As(V) is desorbed by all the selected organic and inorganic ligands, but PO 4. In recent decades, Fe-(hydr) oxides (e. g., Ferrihydrite and Goethite) have attracted substantial attention for their potential use as As sorbents. The aim of the work was to study the As(III) removal from contaminated waters by Fe-based minerals, by using Ferrihydrite [non-crystalline Fe-(hydr) oxide) ] and Goethite [crystalline Fe-(hydr) oxide] as sorbent media in batch experiments. In particular, it was studied: i) the Langmuir isotherms of As(III) at pH 6. 0; ii) arsenite sorption at different pHs; iii) arsenite sorption in presence of selected competing ligands, such as citrate (CIT), molybdate (MoO 4), oxalate (OX), phosphate (PO 4), selenite (SeO 3), selenate (SeO 4), and sulphate (SO 4). Both Ferrihydrite and Goethite samples show a high affinity for As(III). However, the Ferrihydrite samples, characterized by a higher surface area (104. 9 m 2 g- 1), were able to sorb much greater amounts of As(III) than the Goethite, with a lower surface area (42. 3 m 2 g- 1). However, Ferrihydrite (Sm = 1245. 1 mmol kg- 1) adsorbed much more As(III) than Goethite (Sm = 327. 9 mmol kg- 1), essentially because of its greater surface area (178. 2 vs. 42. 3 m 2 g- 1) and, hence, lower degree of crystallinity, as well as to the greater affinity of As(III) for its surfaces. Probably, in our tests, Ferrihydrite adsorbed As(III) on their own external surfaces by forming a greater amounts of inner-sphere complexes vs. those formed by Goethite. The sorption of As(III) was lightly pH dependent. In fact, in the pH range of 4. 0 - 9. 0 the quantities of As(III) adsorbed resulted to be practically constant. The organic and inorganic ligands showed different capacities to compete with As(III) for the sorption sites of the Ferrihydrite and Goethite, according to the following increasing sequence: selenate< sulphate < oxalate < citrate < selenite ≈ molybdate< phosphate on Ferrihydrite, and sulphate ≈ selenate< oxalate < citrate <molybdate< selenite ≈ phosphate on Goethite. Carrot (Daucus carota L.) is widely consumed vegetable by humans. However, the study about influence of organic amendment (i. e. humic acid) and inorganic fertilizers (i. e. N, P, K) on As uptake, translocation, and its toxicity in carrot is limited. In this study carrot irrigated with different solutions containing As(III) and grown in a As-uncontaminated soil amended with increasing amounts of stabilized humic acid (half and full doses) and fertilized (half and full doses) with inorganic fertilizer. The aims of this experiment were to study: i) the influence of the humic acid application and inorganic fertilizer on the mobility and phyto-availability of As in soil; ii) the influence of the humic acids and inorganic fertilizer on the growth of the carrot plants and their uptake of As from contaminated systems. The carrot plants exposed to As showed typical phytotoxicity symptoms. Carrot plants growth was significantly affected by As and soil amended with humic acid and fertilization with inorganic fertilizer treatments. Carrot plants fertilized with inorganic fertilizer grew slightly more than those amended with commercial humic acids. Higher concentrations of As were found in carrot tissues when plants were irrigated with increasing levels of As. Most of the As taken up by edibleroots, while a lesser allocation of toxicant occurring in leaf biomass. In comparison to unfertilized control, plants amended with organic fertilizer exhibited a lower concentration of As in their own tissues, while the opposite was happened in fertilized with inorganic fertilizer. Here we observed the concentration of free-fraction As in soil samples after the amendment by humic acid and fertilization by inorganic fertilizer treatment. In soil, amended with humic acids and irrigated with As-contaminated water, there was a significant decrease of the nonspecifically sorbed As fraction and a contemporary increase of the specifically sorbed As fraction. This trend was due to partial immobilization of the As by the organic functional groups, either directly or through cation bridging. On the other hand, the fertilization with inorganic fertilizer determined a slight increase of the nonspecifically sorbed As and a consequent decrease of the specifically sorbed As. Hence, the addition of humic acid to soils could be used as an effective means to limit As accumulation in crops from As-contaminated waters...|$|R
40|$|Mercurial, {{the metaphor}} for {{volatile}} unpredictable behavior, aptly reflects {{the complexities of}} one of the most insidiously interesting and scientifically challenging biogeochemical cycles at the Earth’s surface. At the base of this toxic metal cycle there is the conversion between the different Hg chemical species, in which the balance between the reduced and oxidized forms depends primary on redox system conditions. The potential risks of human exposure to Hg, especially in the form of monomethylmercury (MMHg), particularly prenatally, and the potential deleterious ecological consequences from localized to global scale Hg pollution, have given much impetus to mercury studies and regulatory activities at international level. Much of this advancement has come since the early 1970 s, and the growth in mercury research continues at breakneck pace. The menace of this item for environment and human health deserves further information concerning the geochemistry of mercury, especially in coastal marine system. The Augusta Bay is a semi-enclosed marine area, located in the SE of Sicily (southern Italy), well-known because of the high Hg pollution. The area indeed has experienced, since the early 60 s, a significant industrialization phase that put in several chemical and petrochemical plants and oil refineries resulting in a severe pollution of the surrounding environment. In particular, the petrochemical district of Augusta Bay hosted one of the most important chlor-alkali plant in Italy, that produced chlorine and caustic soda by electrolysis of sodium chloride aqueous solution in electrolytic cells with a graphite anode and metallic mercury cathode. Uncontrolled chemical discharge of Hg occurred in the Augusta Bay until 1978, when restrictions were imposed by the Italian legislation. For this reason, in the last decade, several studies have provided detailed information on the pollution levels and risks for human health of resident populations of Augusta Bay. The effects of this indiscriminate Hg discharge include the <b>alarming</b> high <b>concentrations</b> of the element recently measured in sediments of the basin, prompting the Italian government to include the Augusta basin in the National Remediation Plan. The “Augusta case“ menaces to not remain confined to a “local problem”, but to became a large-scale threat. Indeed, the effects of meso-scale circulation of the Ionian Sea create a higher potential risk for HgT contamination of the basin, being affected by the transit and transformation of the major water masses, which regulate the general thermohaline circulation in the upper, intermediate and deep layers, respectively. Owing to the geographical location of the Augusta basin, its outflowing shelf waters are immediately intercepted by the surface Atlantic Ionian Stream (AIS) and mixed with the main gyres of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, thus representing a risk for the large-scale marine system. This complex water circulation system, together with the closeness with the steep continental slope (part of the Malta escarpment), make the area a potential point sources of mercury for the entire Mediterranean sea, as previously speculated by Sprovieri et al. (2011). All this features make the Augusta Bay an ideal natural laboratory for deeper insights on the biogeochemical cycle of mercury in a coastal marine environment and the need to investigate the large-scale effect of Augusta Bay pollution has become imperative! With the aim to fill this requirement, an integrated model on the biogeochemical cycle of Hg has been created. Hg cycle is a very articulated topic. Once introduced in the aquatic system environment the fate of Hg in the marine system is affected by sorption/ desorption processes onto suspended particulate matter and, based on associated kinetics, it may be partially transferred from surface waters to bottom sediments. Microorganisms, at the water/sediments interface such as sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), mediate the transformation of inorganic Hg to MMHg with high rates of methylation favored by the presence of high content of organic matter under reducing environmental conditions. Therefore, sediments are considered key contributors of MMHg to the marine ecosystem. Clearly, this analysis stresses the necessity for better knowledge of the specificity of the mercury biogeochemical cycle in this particular environment through the gathering of more data on the distribution and fluxes among the various compartments including the water column, sediment, atmosphere and biota. This multidisciplinary approach offers a nice opportunity to explore the biogeochemical dynamic of mercury in highly complex coastal areas under important anthropic impact and the potential on larger scale diffusion. Multiple oceanographic cruises, realized during 2011 - 2012 period, permitted to collect samples of sediments, seawaters and fishes inside and outside the Augusta Bay. Furthermore in order to trace the entire chain, from sources (polluted sediments) to sink (man), analysis of Hg in fishes (the main route of Hg uptake for humans), and toxicological aspects have been addressed. Analysis of THg in muscles and liver of some pelagic, demersal and benthic species captured inside and outside the semi-enclosed area, has been analysed in order to explore the effects of HgT pollution on fish compartment and to assess the potential health risks associated with the consumption of contaminated fish. THg content of fishes shows a wide range of concentration (range: 0. 02 - 2. 71 μg g- 1 and 0. 03 - 9. 72 μg g- 1 in muscles and in livers respectively), with highest values measured in benthic species and the lowest in pelagic ones. This increasing trend along the habitat depth suggests an active release mechanism of mercury from polluted sediments to the water column, with consequent effects of bioaccumulation in the trophic web. Anomalous THg content measured in pelagic species captured in the external zone of the bay confirms the role of the Augusta marine environment as pollutant source of Hg for the surrounding area and underscores the crucial risk associated with contaminant transfer from the basin to the open sea. Finally, values of hazard target quotient (THQ) and estimated weekly intake (EWI) demonstrate that consumption of fishes caught inside the bay represents a serious risk for human health and suggests caution in consuming demersal and benthic fishes from outside the Augusta Bay, definitively demanding for appropriate social actions. Hg distribution in sediments (range: 1. 77 - 55. 34 mgKg- 1; mean: 13. 78 ± 10. 72 mgKg- 1) clearly divides the area into three parts, with the lowest values recorded in the northern Augusta Bay, intermediate value in the center and the highest HgT concentrations recorded in the southern part of the Augusta basin (from the Pontile Cementeria down to the dam) with decreasing values from the coastline. Despite sequential extraction procedure (SEP) documented that the most part of HgT in sediments consists of strong complexes (80...|$|R
