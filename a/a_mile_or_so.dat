5|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 July the Japanese {{attacked}} the main position Kokoda. There were only 80 men from 'B' Company left at that time, and armed only with small arms and a few Bren light machine guns, they were {{no match for the}} assaulting Japanese. Casualties on both sides were high as the Australians resorted to hand-to-hand combat, and the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel William Owen, who had flown in to take over the battalion following Templeton's death, was killed while organising the withdrawal. It became clear that Kokoda was lost and the following morning, under the cover of a dense mist, with the PIB's commanding officer, Major William Watson, assuming temporary command, the survivors abandoned the position and fell back towards the village of Deniki, <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> back along the Kokoda Track towards Isurava.|$|E
5|$|More serious {{retaliation}} {{against the}} Natchez began late in December and in January 1730, with expeditions led by Jean-Paul Le Sueur and Henri de Louboëy. The two commanders besieged the Natchez in forts built {{near the site}} of the Grand Village of the Natchez, <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> east of Fort Rosalie, which had been rebuilt. They killed about 80 men and captured 18 women, and released some French women who had been captured during the massacre of Fort Rosalie. The French relied on allied support from Tunica and Choctaw warriors. The Choctaw attacked the Natchez without the French, killing 100 and capturing women and children. This ruined the element of surprise for the French as the Natchez had already scattered. At first, the Natchez were well prepared for French retaliatory strikes, having stocked up several cannons as well as the firearms that they had used in the massacre two months earlier. The Natchez captured by the Choctaw and Tunica allies of the French were given over to the governor and sold into slavery, and some were publicly tortured to death in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|The AI sets {{added to}} Beaufighters {{were the first}} to be mass-produced. The {{operating}} frequency was 190 to 195 MHz with a wavelength of 1.5 metres. The equipment consisted of a receiver, transmitter, control panel, modulator, indicator unit and a system of fixed dipole aerials. On the nose the aerial was a double arrowhead shape with a pair of azimuth aerials protruding above and below the leading edge of each wing between the cannon and the wingtip. A pair of elevation aerials were located above and below the wing surfaces near the RAF roundel on the starboard side. The indicator display consisted of two cathode ray tubes. They displayed elevation and azimuth bearing. The set had a range-limitation of four miles (circa 20,000 feet). The minimum range of detection was usually around 400 feet. At closer ranges the target merged with the transmission pulse and was obscured. At altitudes below 1,000 feet, the returns from ground objects would swamp the tubes. Operators like Rawnsley were left to do a fair amount of guesswork. No scales or calibration markings were put on early sets. The position and heading of the enemy in the azimuth plane, its height, and its range had to be guessed. At least the GCI could bring the Beaufighter well within range of the target, usually <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> behind the bomber.|$|E

5|$|Where battle {{could not}} be avoided, the late army broadly {{followed}} traditional practice as regards array. Heavy infantry would be drawn up in a main line, normally straight and several ranks deep. Mounted archers were stationed, together with light-armed slingers, {{in front of the}} main infantry line. Cavalry would be posted on the wings (light cavalry on the outside). Foot archers would form the rear rank(s) of the main infantry line. There would be a reserve line of infantry and cavalry of variable strength, {{to the rear of the}} main line, in order to deal with breaches in the main line and to exploit opportunities. At a distance of <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to the rear of the army, its fortified camp of the previous night would contain its assistants and baggage, guarded by a small garrison. The camp could act as a refuge if the army was put to flight. Roman armies in the field never camped overnight without constructing defences. A ditch would be dug around the perimeter of the camp, and the spoil used to erect a rampart, which would then be topped with a palisade of sharpened wooden stakes arranged cross-hatched to form an impenetrable screen. Such defences, systematically patrolled, effectively precluded surprise attacks and enabled the troops to get a good night's sleep.|$|E
25|$|Virtually {{no trace}} of the old {{gasworks}} now exists. Bisected by many roads, including the A1020 Royal Docks Road, a small area of the waste tip and some gas holders remain, separated by <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of redevelopment. Parts of the site are occupied by an industrial estate, the Beckton Retail Park and Gallions Reach Shopping Park.|$|E

At the Indian Head Park interchange with I-294 (Tri-State Tollway), I-55 separates from US66 to follow a more southerly route as the Stevenson Expressway while Historic US66 continues eastward on Joliet Road, passing by the historic Lyonsville Congregational Church at Wolf Road and traversing Countryside, Hodgkins and McCook.|$|E

It passes the west boundary of Stewart State Forest, goes over a little-used rail spur, once part of the Wallkill Valley Railroad (WVRR) and then enters Maybrook, which it serves as the main street. A feature of this town is the large Yellow Freight terminal in its north end, continuing a tradition of importance in transportation {{that began with the}} village's origins as a major regional rail hub.|$|E

From Bishop Auckland the River Wear meanders in a general northeasterly direction, demonstrating many fluvial features of a mature river, including wide valley walls, fertile flood plains and ox-bow lakes. Bridges over the river become more substantial, such as those at Sunderland Bridge (near Croxdale), and Shincliffe. At Sunderland Bridge the River Browney joins the River Wear.|$|E
25|$|The Esopus was one {{of three}} valleys that trees {{followed}} into the Catskills, as revegetation of the mountain slopes took place in the glaciers' wake. First to come were the boreal species, such as balsam fir, that today persist only on the summits of the range's higher peaks. Next were the northern hardwoods, primarily beech, birch and maple species, that dominate much of the Catskill forests today. Last were southern hardwood species, mostly oak, hickory and American chestnut, probably following the Indians as they migrated north. Most of the chestnuts died in the chestnut blight of the early 20th century. Catskill forest historian Michael Kudish found that other southern hardwood species {{can be found in the}} Esopus valley all the way to Oliverea, <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> below the creek's source.|$|E

25|$|Thomas {{planned a}} huge {{wheeling}} movement that would ultimately {{come down on}} the Confederates' exposed left flank. Wilson's Cavalry Corps moved west on Charlotte Pike once an early morning fog dissipated, driving off the Confederate cavalry patrolling the area between the Confederate left and the Cumberland River. Smith's XVI Corps detachment followed, turning south after <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> towards the Confederate flank. The cavalrymen formed on Smith's right flank. Schofield's XXIII followed in reserve, and as the assault moved south a gap opened between Smith and Wilson which Schofield was directed to fill. At about 2:30 pm the Federals attacked the five redoubts guarding the Confederate left. Four brigades, two of cavalry and two of infantry, overran Redoubt No. 4 and then Redoubt No. 5, notwithstanding the spirited resistance of the defenders of Redoubt No. 4. Another of Smith's brigades captured Redoubt No. 3; however, its commander, Col. Sylvester G. Hill, was killed by Confederate artillery firing from Redoubt No. 2. He was the highest ranking Federal officer killed in the battle. Smith's troops proceeded to Redoubt No. 2, which was quickly captured.|$|E

[...] Aberystwyth means [...] "mouth of the Ystwyth", a river <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away from the town centre, and was {{apparently}} so named {{as a result of}} confusion by the English over the different castles in the area.|$|E
