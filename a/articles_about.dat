5|$|Ifs origins can {{be traced}} to 1948 and 1949, when Raymond Palmer founded two {{magazines}} while working at Ziff-Davis in Chicago: Fate and Other Worlds. Fate published <b>articles</b> <b>about</b> occult and supernatural events, while Other Worlds was a science-fiction magazine. The two were sufficiently successful to attract the notice of James L. Quinn, a New York publisher. When Ziff-Davis moved to New York City in late 1950, Paul W. Fairman, a prolific writer, went with them, and was soon in touch with Quinn, who decided to found a pair of magazines modelled after Palmer's. One was a nonfiction magazine entitled Strange; the other was If.|$|E
