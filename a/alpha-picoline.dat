40|$|We present quasi-elastic light {{scattering}} (LS) and dielectric (DS) spectra {{of the glass}} former <b>alpha-picoline</b> (13 K T > T_g the excess wing of the alpha-process identified in the DS spectra and characterized by a power-law exponent c is rediscovered in the LS spectra. Introducing a universal evolution for c = c[lg(tau_{alpha}) ] as suggested by DS data of several glass formers, the fast dynamics spectrum is singled out, allowing to determine the non-ergodicity parameter f(T). The latter shows the predicted cusp-like anomaly identifying T_c as well. Another discontinuous change of f(T) is observed at T_g. The fast dynamics spectra exhibit a crossover to ``white noise'' (T < T_c). Concerning the fast dynamics, we conclude that idealized MCT predictions hold even below T_c.

40|$|The {{existence}} and {{the mode of}} operation of certain enzyme aggregates may be established from the concentrations of intermediates measured {{in the presence of}} specific inhibitors. beta-Carotene, the most abundant carotenoid pigment in the fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus, arises from ring formation at both ends of lycopene. The inhibitors nicotine, imidazole, <b>alpha-picoline,</b> and 2 -(4 -chlorophenylthio) triethylamine lead to the simultaneous accumulation of lycopene, beta-carotene, and the one-ring intermediate gamma-carotene. The quantitative analytical values obey precise mathematical relationships: those expected from the operation of an enzyme aggregate with two cyclases equally sensitive to the inhibitors. The intermediates lycopene and gamma-carotene rejected by chemically inhibited enzymes may be readmitted to other cyclases in the wild type but not in heterokaryons containing a carA mutation. We have calculated the fraction of inhibited cyclase under each condition, the affinity constant of each inhibitor for the cyclase, and the probability that a rejected intermediate molecule will be readmitted and further metabolized. The probabilities for lycopene and gamma-carotene are identical and independent of the inhibitor responsible for the rejection. Our calculations suggest that each rejected intermediate molecule is readmitted to the enzyme aggregates two or three times on the average...|$|E
40|$|The {{lamellar}} compound titanium phenylarsonate was synthesized and intercalated with alkylmonoamines (methyl to heptyl), diaminoethane, diaminobutane, lutidine and <b>alpha-picoline.</b> The host {{was characterized}} through elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction, surface analysis, porosity, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and electronic scanning microscopy. The intercalated compounds {{did not show}} significant increases in the interlamellar distances through X-ray diffractometry. The intercalation was confirmed by the thermogravimetric technique, indicating mass losses that correspond to the amines. The ideal intercalation was established by adding increments of 30. 0 x 10 - 6 dm³ of 0. 50 mol dm- 3 of each amine into a suspension of about 10 x 10 - 3 g of matrix. The number of moles intercalated with alkylmonoamines followed an aleatory order {{in relation to the}} increase of the aliphatic chain and the enthalpic values gave - 9. 18 ± 0. 07; - 12. 10 ± 0. 20; - 7. 61 ± 0. 02; - 6. 88 ± 0. 01; - 9. 47 ± 0. 03; - 12. 84 ± 0. 10 and - 14. 78 ± 0. 10 kJ mol- 1 for the sequence of alkylmonoamines and varied from - 3. 66 ± 0. 30 to - 10. 92 ± 1. 50 kJ mol- 1 for the alkyldiamines. The aromatic amines presented small thermal effects and the unfavorable intercalation is attributed to the large volume of the phenyl group inside the lamella, which hinders insertion of these bases inside the lamellar cavity...|$|E
