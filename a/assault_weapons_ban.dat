5|$|Hastert {{criticized the}} Clinton administration's plans {{to conduct the}} 2000 Census using {{sampling}} techniques. Hastert was {{a supporter of the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and in 1993 voted to approve the trade pact. He was a gun rights supporter who voted against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and Federal <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban.</b>|$|E
5|$|Moran {{voted against}} the Defense of Marriage Act, the Federal Marriage Amendment, and {{was in favor of}} {{repealing}} the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. He also supported gun control, voting for the Brady Bill and supporting a reinstatement of the Federal <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban.</b> At different times he voted to ban flag-burning and partial-birth abortions, though he reversed his positions on both issues. On education, he expressed support for the public education system, universal pre-kindergarten, and full funding for the No Child Left Behind program. Moran was given a 100% rating by the NARAL and 0% by the National Right to Life Committee, indicating a pro-choice voting record.

25|$|While {{serving in}} the House of Representatives, Schumer, along with California senator Dianne Feinstein, {{authored}} the 1994 <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban</b> which expired in 2004. The National Rifle Association and other gun groups (see gun politics) have criticized him for allegedly not knowing much about guns, alluding to various errors regarding the subject. Supporters of gun control legislation, however, give him {{much of the credit}} for passage of both the <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban</b> and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. The <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban,</b> which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with certain features, expired in September 2004 despite attempts by Schumer to extend it. He was one of 16 senators to vote against the Vitter Amendment, which prohibited the confiscation of legally owned firearms during a disaster.|$|E

The <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban</b> was concerned solely with semi-automatic firearms, not fully automatic ones, which had already been restricted by the National Firearms Act of 1934, and the subsequent 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act.|$|E

50|$|In the U.S., {{since the}} 1980s, {{magazine}} capacity {{has been a}} subject of debate regarding civilian firearms. Many <b>assault</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>bans</b> since then have included or been accompanied by large-capacity or high-capacity magazine bans. Magazine capacity is also debated among military users, who have to balance the greater firepower of high-capacity magazines with their greater weight and size.|$|R
25|$|In 2004 DeWine co-sponsored an {{amendment}} to renew the Federal <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban.</b> He {{was one of only}} two Republican senators to vote against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which banned lawsuits against gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers for criminal misuse of their products.|$|E
25|$|An M4 Type Post-Ban Carbine was {{developed}} for the 1994 United States Federal <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban</b> requirements.

25|$|In February 2004, Castle {{sponsored}} H.R. 3831 to reauthorize the <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>ban</b> of 1994. The {{bill was}} co-sponsored by 11 Republican colleagues and 129 Democrats.

2500|$|The {{ruling was}} upheld in June 2008 by the Supreme Court of the United States in District of Columbia v. Heller. Both courts {{held that the}} city's handgun ban {{violated}} {{the right to keep}} and bear arms as protected under the Second Amendment. However, the ruling does not strike down all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's <b>assault</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>ban.</b>|$|R
25|$|Clinton {{continued}} to push further regulations of firearms {{in his second}} term, especially after the Columbine High School massacre. Little success {{came out of his}} efforts as Republicans controlled congress during this time, and a majority opposed any further gun control. The House voted to overturn the <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>ban</b> in 1996, but the Senate failed to take up the issue.|$|E
25|$|The story hinges {{upon the}} {{enactment}} and subsequent unintended consequences of several important pieces of U.S. gun control legislation and regulation: the National Firearms Act of 1934, the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, the Assault Weapons Importation Ban enacted by Presidential executive order in 1989 and the Federal <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban</b> of 1994.|$|E
25|$|New York had an <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>ban</b> {{prior to}} 2013, but on January 16 {{of that year}} it passed the SAFE Act, which created a stricter {{definition}} of assault weapons and banned them immediately. The NY SAFE Act defines assault weapons as semi-automatic pistols and rifles with detachable magazines and one military-style feature, and semi-automatic shotguns with one military-style feature.|$|E
50|$|Research by John Lott {{found no}} {{impact of these}} bans on violent crime rates, but {{provided}} evidence that the bans may have {{reduced the number of}} gun shows by over 20 percent. Koper, Woods, and Roth studies focus on gun murders, while Lott's look at murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assaults. Unlike their work, Lott's research accounted for state <b>assault</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>bans</b> and 12 other different types of gun control laws.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} {{unforeseen}} events that negated this scenario. Some Tennessee voters were discontented {{with the first}} two years of the Clinton administration, especially the proposal for a national health-care system largely put together and advocated by Clinton's wife, Hillary Clinton, as well as the passage of the <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapon</b> <b>ban.</b> The other was the somewhat unexpected nomination of Nashville heart transplant surgeon Bill Frist for the seat by the Republicans.|$|R

25|$|One {{year after}} signing the Brady Law, White House {{lobbying}} {{also played a}} role in the passage of the 1994 Crime Bill, which included the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, commonly known as the Federal <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban.</b> The law banned certain semi-automatic firearms with two or more specific design features, and also prohibited the manufacture of ammunition magazines that held over ten rounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{models for}} the U.S. market {{initially}} came with a 10-round magazine, {{to comply with the}} U.S. <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban.</b> The ban has now expired, and the civilian Mark 23 comes with the same 12-round magazine as the government variants, except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than 10 rounds. In Canada, the Mark 23 pistol is still supplied only with 10-round magazines, as per the 1995 Firearms Act.|$|E
25|$|Warner {{was quite}} moderate, {{especially}} {{in comparison to}} most Republican Senators from the South. He was among the minority of Republicans to support gun control laws. He voted for the Brady Bill and, in 1999, {{was one of only}} five Republicans to vote to close the so-called gun show loophole. In 2004 Warner was one of three Republicans to sponsor an amendment by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that sought to provide for a 10-year extension of the Federal <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>Ban.</b>|$|E

50|$|Efforts to {{roll back}} the city's gun laws were curtailed {{following}} the June 26, 2008, Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller.

However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control, and pro-gun rights members of Congress are still attempting to repeal remaining gun regulations such as the District's <b>assault</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>ban.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "grenade {{launcher}}" [...] or [...] "grenade launcher mount" [...] {{is usually}} {{included in the}} list of features defining an [...] "assault weapon", though this is a legal definition which primarily affects firearms with flash hiders compatible with rifle grenades, since firearms that are designed specifically for launching explosive grenade rounds and their ammunition are already Federally restricted as destructive devices. Several state <b>assault</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>bans</b> extend this to include underbarrel 37mm flare launchers on the list of banned features.|$|R
