25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Talk to <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, statements like Keep in the background and Know how to captivate people are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a literal sense.|$|E

Afterwards, {{he made his first}} appearance for Middlesex against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1886.

Consequently, from 1887 to 1890 he virtually retired, blaming {{his time at}} the Navy which allegedly had prevented him from practising more. However, in 1891, he took cricket up again and played some first class matches for the MCC as well as the Gentlemen Players. Later that year, he participated in a trip of English cricketers to North America led by Lord Hawke in winter 1891/92. There, Hillyard played both first-class matches at Philadelphia. In 1894, Lord Hawke arranged another trip to North America, and Hillyard was again member of the party. At Philadelphia, he played {{in front of an audience}} of 10,000.|$|E

While <b>a</b> <b>lot’s</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> approaches have been proposed in order to describe events, none is sufficiently generic and computationally efficient to be applied to event-based retrieval of video sequences within large databases. In this paper, we propose a novel index of video sequences which aims at describing their dynamic content. This index relies on the local feature trajectories estimated from the spatiotemporal volume of the video sequences. The computation of this index is efficient, makes no assumption neither about the represented events nor about the video sequences. We show through a batch of experimentations on standard video sequence databases that this index permits to classify complex human activities as efficiently as state of the art methods and that it performs far more efficiently to retrieve generic classes of events...|$|R
