The system, based on a gated microchannel plate (MCP) with four 6 -mm-wide stripline cathodes is capable of capturing multiframe soft X-ray images at time resolution of 60 - 100 ps and spatial resolution of 15 lp/mm.

The module exploits Red- Enhanced SPAD technology to attain a Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) as high as 37 % at 800 nm (peak of 58 % at 600 nm) while maintaining a temporal resolution of about 100 ps FWHM, even with light diffused across the whole active area.

A more modern approach is to use the common analog circuit simulator SPICE together with an advanced transistor model supporting avalanche breakdown simulations, which the basic SPICE transistor model does not. Examples of such models are described in the paper [...] and in the paper : the latter is a description of the Mextram model, currently used by some semiconductor industries to characterize their bipolar junction transistors.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the design and {{characterization}} of a multipurpose 64 √ó 32 CMOS single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array. The chip is fabricated in a high-voltage 0. 35 -Œºm CMOS technology and consists of 2048 pixels, each combining a very low noise (100 cps at 5 -V excess bias) 30 -Œºm SPAD, a prompt <b>avalanche</b> sensing <b>circuit,</b> and digital processing electronics. The array not only delivers two-dimensional intensity information through photon counting in either free-running (down to 10 -Œºs integration time) or time-gated mode, but can also perform smart light demodulation with in-pixel background suppression. The latter feature enables phase-resolved imaging for extracting either three-dimensional depth-resolved images or decay lifetime maps, bymeasuring the phase shift between amodulated excitation light and the reflected photons. Pixel-level memories enable fully parallel processing and global-shutter readout, preventing motion artifacts (e. g., skew, wobble, motion blur) and partial exposure effects. The array is able to acquire very fast optical events at high frame-rate (up to 100 000 fps) and at single-photon level. Lownoise SPADs ensure high dynamic range (up to 110 dB at 100 fps) with peak photon detection efficiency of almost 50 % at 410 nm.

2500|$|When the {{collector}} current {{rises above the}} data sheet limit [...] a new breakdown mechanism become important: the second breakdown. This phenomenon is caused by excessive heating of some points (hot spots) in the base-emitter region of the bipolar junction transistor, which give rise to an exponentially increasing current through these points: this exponential rise of current in turn gives rise to even more overheating, originating a positive thermal feedback mechanism. While analyzing the [...] static characteristic, {{the presence of this}} phenomenon is seen as a sharp collector voltage drop and a corresponding almost vertical rise of {{the collector}} current. At the present, {{it is not possible to}} produce a transistor without hot spots and thus without second breakdown, since their presence is related to the technology of refinement of silicon. During this process, very small but finite quantities of metals remain in localized portions of the wafer: these particles of metals became deep centers of recombination, i.e. centers where current exists in a preferred way. While this phenomenon is destructive for Bipolar junction transistors working in the usual way, it can be used to push-up further the current and voltage limits of a device working in avalanche mode by limiting its time duration: also, the switching speed of the device is not negatively affected.

40|$|A {{laser power}} supply system is {{described}} in which separate pulses are utilized to avalanche ionize the gas within the laser and then produce a sustained discharge to cause the gas to emit light energy.

A saturable inductor switch is coupled in the transmission line for containing the energy within the storage device until the voltage level across the storage device reaches a predetermined level, which level is less than that required to avalanche ionize the gas. An avalanche ionization pulse generating circuit is coupled to the laser for generating a high voltage pulse of sufficient amplitude to avalanche ionize the laser gas.

Chapter IV describes the preparation of p-sources. An improved technique using the electrospraying method has been applied in the preparation of Th B and Ce sources. The coincidence measurements of 144 Ce using the two spectrometers have been described in Chapter VI. But the most important and original contribution of this thesis is the e y coincidence measurements of 144 Ce using the large spectrometer and a Go(Li) K-ray detector in con-junction. The e - y coincidence measurements have been described in Chapter VI. Very possibly a magnetic spectrometer and a Ge(Li) x-ray detector have been used for the first time time in these e - y coincidence measurements on 144 Ce. The single y-ray spectra of 144 Ce neasured with the 5 cc Ge(Li) detector and with X-ray detector are also described in this chapter.

40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{preliminary}} characterization of the first detection module based on Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) tailored for single-photon timing applications. The aim of this work is to demonstrate, thanks {{to the design of}} a suitable module, the possibility to easily exploit SiPM in many applications as an interesting detector featuring large active area, similarly to photomultipliers tubes, but keeping the advantages of solid state detectors (high quantum efficiency, low cost, compactness, robustness, low bias voltage, and insensitiveness to magnetic field). The module integrates a cooled SiPM with a total photosensitive area of 1 mm 2 together with the suitable <b>avalanche</b> signal read-out <b>circuit,</b> the signal conditioning, the biasing electronics, and a Peltier cooler driver for thermal stabilization. It is able to extract the single-photon timing information with resolution better than 100 ps full-width at half maximum. We verified the effective stabilization in response to external thermal perturbations, thus proving the complete insensitivity of the module to environment temperature variations, which represents a fundamental parameter to profitably use the instrument for real-field applications. We also characterized the single-photon timing resolution, the background noise due to both primary dark count generation and afterpulsing, the single-photon detection efficiency, and the instrument response function shape. The proposed module can become a reliable and cost-effective building block for time-correlated single-photon counting instruments in applications requiring high collection capability of isotropic light and detection efficiency (e. g., fluorescence decay measurements or time-domain diffuse optics systems) ...|$|R
40|$|Emerged as a {{solid state}} {{alternative}} to photo multiplier tubes (PMTs), single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are nowadays {{widely used in}} the field of single-photon timing applications. Custom technology SPADs assure remarkable performance, in particular a 10 counts/s dark count rate (DCR) at low temperature, a high photon detection efficiency (PDE) with a 50 % peak at 550 nm and a 30 ps (full width at half maximum, FWHM) temporal resolution, even with large area devices, have been obtained. Over the past few years, the birth of novel techniques of analysis has led to the parallelization of the measurement systems and to a consequent increasing demand for the development of monolithic arrays of detectors. Unfortunately, the implementation of a multidimensional system is a challenging task from the electrical point of view; in particular, the <b>avalanche</b> current pick-up <b>circuit,</b> used to obtain the previously reported performance, has to be modified in order to enable high parallel temporal resolution, while minimizing the electrical crosstalk probability between channels. In the past, the problem has been solved by integrating the front-end electronics next to the photodetector, {{in order to reduce the}} parasitic capacitances and consequently the filtering action on the current signal of the SPAD, leading to an improvement of the timing jitter at higher threshold. This solution has been implemented by using standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies, which, however, do not allow a complete control on the SPAD structure; for this reason the intrinsic performance of CMOS SPADs, such as DCR, PDE, and afterpulsing probability, are worse than those attainable with custom detectors. In this paper, we propose a pixel architecture, which enables the development of custom SPAD arrays in which every channel maintains the performance of the best single photodetector. The system relies on the integration of the timing signal pick-up circuit next to the photodiode, achieved by modifying the technological process flow used for the fabrication of the custom SPAD. The pixel is completed by an external standard CMOS active quenching circuit, which assures stable timing performance at quite high count rate (> 1 MHz) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{brain is}} a complex system par excellence. Its {{intricate}} structure has become clearer recently, {{and it has been}} reported that it shares some properties common to complex networks, such as the small-world property, the presence of hubs, and assortative mixing, among others. These properties provide the brain with a robust architecture appropriate for efficient information transmission across different brain regions. Nevertheless, how these topological properties emerge in neural networks is still an open question. Moreover, in the last decade the observation of neuronal <b>avalanches</b> in neocortical <b>circuits</b> suggested the presence of self-organised criticality in neural systems. The occurrence of this kind of dynamics implies several benefits to neural computation. However, the mechanisms that give rise to critical behaviour in these systems, and how they interact with other neuronal processes such as synaptic plasticity are not fully understood. In this thesis, we study self-organised criticality and neural systems in the context of complex networks. Our work differs from other similar approaches by stressing the importance of analysing the influence of hubs, high clustering coefficients, and synaptic plasticity into the collective dynamics of the system. Additionally, we introduce a metric that we call node success to assess the effectiveness of a spike in terms of its capacity to trigger cascading behaviour. We present a synaptic plasticity rule based on this metric, which enables the system to reach the critical state of its collective dynamics without the need to fine-tune any control parameter. Our results suggest that retro-synaptic signals could be responsible for the emergence of self-organised criticality in brain networks. Furthermore, based on the measure of node success, we find what kind of topology allows nodes to be more successful at triggering cascades of activity. Our study comprises four different scenarios: i) static synapses, ii) dynamic synapses under spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), iii) dynamic synapses under node-success-driven plasticity (NSDP), and iv) dynamic synapses under both NSDP and STDP mechanisms. We observe that small-world structures emerge when critical dynamics are combined with STDP mechanisms in a particular type of topology. Moreover, we go beyond simple spike pairs of STDP, and implement spike triplets to assess their influence on the dynamics of the system. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that implements this version of STDP in the context of critical dynamics in complex networks...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the large}} amount of shared input between nearby neurons in {{cortical}} circuits, massively parallel spiking recordings of various in vivo networks exhibit pairwise covariances in ensembles of neuronal spike trains that are on average close to zero [1]. The low average has been well understood in terms of active decorrelation by inhibitory feedback [2, 3] in networks that operate far away from the critical point, which marks the onset of avalanche-like activity [4]. Experiments, however, also show large variability of covariances across pairs of neurons. An explanation for their wide distribution in relation to the static (quenched) disorder of the connectivity in recurrent networks is so far elusive. Here we combine ideas from spin-glass theory [5] with a generating function representation for the joint probability distribution of the network activity [6] to derive a finite-size mean-field theory that reduces a disordered to a highly symmetric network with fluctuating auxiliary fields (Fig. 1). The theory relates the statistics of covariances to the statistics of connections, in particular the largest eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix, and explains the experimentally observed covariance distributions [7]. The analytical expressions expose that both, average and dispersion of the latter, diverge at a critical point which has been studied in terms of a transition from regular to chaotic dynamics [8, 9, 10]. This critical point does not arise from net excitation, but rather from disorder in networks with balanced excitation and inhibition. Applying these results to recordings from motor cortex suggests its operation close to this breakdown of linear stability. References: 1.
