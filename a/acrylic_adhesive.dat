40|$|Most {{products}} in our surroundings contain <b>adhesives,</b> including <b>acrylic</b> <b>adhesives</b> {{which are used}} in many industry sectors. Some of these adhesives contain solvents that produce strong odors, but even adhesives which are produced without solvents can emit intensive or pungent odors. In the latter case, the odor may arise from monomers in the adhesive product, from manufacturing by-products or from degradation products. Here we analyzed several acrylic, methacrylic and benzyl <b>acrylic</b> <b>adhesives</b> to identify representative odorous contaminants. The volatile fraction of the products was extracted and isolated by solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE), then analyzed via high-resolution gas chromatography olfactometry (HRGC-O), HRGC-mass spectrometry (HRGC-MS/O) and two-dimensional HRGC-MS/O. Aroma extract dilution analysis was carried out to determine the most prominent odorants. Using this targeted odorant-analytical approach, we identified 27 odorous substances representing diverse classes of molecules, including phenols with leather-like, horse stable-like or medicinal odors, acrylates eliciting glue-like, moldy and fruity impressions, and different esters with honey-like or effervescent tablet-like smells. These {{results show that the}} odor of <b>acrylic</b> <b>adhesives</b> results from a mixture of different odorants that cannot generally {{be traced back to the}} main constituents of the product but are rather likely to stem from impurities and trace side products and other contaminants...|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a clean room mat is to keep sterile the areas that require {{ultimate}} protection from dirt, bacteria and any contamination brought from outside. Clean room mats are tacky, sticky, non slip mats that possess multiple layers of clean film that effectively capture dirt and dust from foot traffic and wheels. Peel-off mats {{are made up of}} multiple sheets of polyethylene film coated with <b>acrylic</b> <b>adhesive</b> that traps particles. Each layer peels off to reveal a new clean surface. The adhesive backing prevents microbial growth and contamination. Mats used outside clean rooms and laboratories are designed to withhold foreign pollution elements. This goal is achieved by a sticky surface that serves as a barrier for debris, dirt and dust adhered to shoe soles. Clean room sticky mats can contain two defensive barriers: the first part is a carpet itself, while the second part is sticky surface mat. Another mat type to be used to protect rooms from pollution is sanitizing foot bath floor mats. The mat itself is a small bath that contains sanitizing liquid. The foot bath bottom is covered with pliable rubber scrapers for effective cleaning of footwear soles while the liquid disinfects them.|$|E

40|$|Interest in {{polyethylene}} and polypropylene bonding {{has increased}} in the last years. However, adhesive joints with adherends which are of low surface energy and which are chemically inert present several difficulties. Generally, their high degree of chemical resistance to solvents and dissimilar solubility parameters limit the usefulness of solvent bonding as a viable assembly technique. One successful approach to adhesive bonding of these materials involves proper selection of surface pre-treatment prior to bonding. With the correct pre-treatment {{it is possible to}} glue these materials with one or more of several adhesives required by the applications involved. A second approach is the use of adhesives without surface pre-treatment, such as hot melts, high tack pressure-sensitive adhesives, solvent-based specialty adhesives and, more recently, structural <b>acrylic</b> <b>adhesives</b> as such 3 M DP- 8005 ® and Loctite 3030 ®. In this paper, the shear strengths of two <b>acrylic</b> <b>adhesives</b> were evaluated using the lap shear test method ASTM D 3163 and the block shear test method ASTM D 4501. Two different industrial polyolefins (polyethylene and polypropylene) were used for adherends.

40|$|ABSTRACT − Sibutramine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake {{inhibitor}} indicated for {{the management}} of obesity in conjunction with a reduced calorie diet. The oral administration of sibutramine is followed by its dose-related side effects. In this study, sibutramine was formulated into drug in adhesive (DIA) patches in an attempt to overcome these problems. The effects of different formulation variables including pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA), loading amount of drug, thickness of matrix and enhancer on the skin permeation of the drug were evaluated using excised hairless mouse skin. In the <b>acrylic</b> <b>adhesive</b> with carboxyl functional group, low release of sibutramine was observed due to the strong interaction between car-boxyl group of adhesive and amine group of sibutramine.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of adhesively bonded MDPE joints were studied. The lap-shear joints were prepared using PE 80 polyethylene gas pipe and four adhesive types; two acrylic and two epoxy resins. The key {{mechanical properties}} of {{lap shear strength}} and impact resistance were investigated {{as a function of}} adhesive type and surface preparation technique. Mechanical abrasion of the PE 80 surface increased the strength of the bonds from 40 to 460 % for the four adhesives, with the best performing <b>acrylic</b> <b>adhesive</b> having a lap-shear strength of 1. 76 MPa and impact strength of 2. 5 kJ/m 2. When used to bond PE 80 tapping tees to PE 80 gas pipe, the <b>acrylic</b> <b>adhesive</b> produced a gas tight seal at both the standard test pressure of 0. 4 MPa and at an increased pressure of 0. 8 MPa, and outperformed the PE 80 tapping tee during shear testing and withstood a maximum of 10 cycles of 175 J during impact testing. These results highlight the potential of adhesive bonding as a method of joining PE 80 tapping tees to PE 80 gas pipe...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the relationship between the peel force required to remove the medical adhesive tapes and the angle of peel. Method : Three kinds of adhesive tapes to fix gauze, 25 mm in width and 125 mm in length (Tape A, B and C) were stuck on a bakelite board for 30 minutes, and then removed while the peel forces were recorded. Peel force measurements were obtained at 30 °, 60 °, 90 °, 120 °, 150 °, and 170 °. Tape A was rayon non-woven fabric coated with an <b>acrylic</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Tape B was poly vinyl chloride tape coated with a rubber adhesive. Tape C was polyethylene film coated with an <b>acrylic</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Results: For all tapes used, the maximal peel force occurred at peel angle 30 °.

Conclusion : These findings suggest that a peel angle near 120 ° might be commonly good for less irritation...|$|E
