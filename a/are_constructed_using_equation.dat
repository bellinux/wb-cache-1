The EOSs at higher densities correspond to the quark matter in the colour superconducting phase and are computed within the NJL-like model for different values of the scalar diquark and vector current couplings strengths. The phase transition to the quark matter is computed by a Maxwell construction. We find that {{the stability of the}} hybrid stars are mainly governed by the behaviour of the EOSs for the colour superconducting quark matter. However the compositions of hybrid star are sensitive to the EOS of the nuclear matter. The value of the critical rotation frequency for the hybrid star depends strongly on the EOS of the nuclear matter as well as that for the colour superconducting quark matter. Our results indicate that the EOS for the colour superconducting quark matter can be obtained, by adjusting the parameters of the NJL model, to yield the stable {{configurations of}} the hybrid star having the maximum mass ∼ 1. 5 M_ in the non-rotating limit and the critical rotation frequency ∼ 1 kHz.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{simulate}} fluid flows in aquifers used for natural gas storage. An introduction is given to aquifer flow modelling, and two models are developed that describe two-phase flow in porous media. The first model <b>is</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>using</b> the standard <b>equations</b> for Darcy flow and conservation of mass. The second model is then developed by integrating these equations in the vertical direction, and using the assumption of a sharp-interface and vertical equilibrium to evaluate the integrals. These two models were tested by running simulations on the aquifer model of Stenlille, a major gas storage facility in Denmark. The specifics of the aquifer model, such as the grid, fluid properties and so on, were based upon an existing ECLIPSE model. The goal was to improve the capability the simulations had in predicting pressures and water production rates for the wells in the aquifer. To this end, the ECLIPSE model of the aquifer was transferred into the MRST framework, where {{it was easier to}} experiment with the models themselves. The simulations run in MRST, using both the black-oil model and the VE model, were found to give successful predictions of the well pressures.
