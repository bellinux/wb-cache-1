5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, quantum theory was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories of relativity. By the end of the century, a coherent system of units was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), the definition of the second relied on quantum theory, the definition of the metre relied on the theory of relativity, and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{hoped to}} build on the success of the 2008–09 season and began the new year with five {{straight}} victories. Soon, however, a string of setbacks hit the team, including the loss of two players, one due to injury <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> suspension. Duquesne lost its final non-conference game and slipped into a five-game losing streak. The team did manage to break the streak, but had trouble gaining any momentum. In mid-February the Dukes finally seemed to break free with a solid 21point victory over La Salle, followed by a crucial road upset of the University of Charlotte, which was ranked first in the Atlantic 10 Conference at the time, and finally another upset of the University of Dayton Flyers in front of a sellout Pittsburgh crowd. However, Duquesne then lost its final two road games of the season.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} long-abandoned gardens were replanted {{in a style}} {{sympathetic}} to the Tudor period. The knot garden was planted in 1972, to a design taken from Leonard Meager's Complete English Gardener, published in 1670. The intricate design of the knot {{can be seen from}} one of the two original viewing mounds, common in 16th-century formal gardening, one inside the moat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> the southwest. Other features of the grounds include a yew tunnel and an orchard growing fruits that would have been familiar to the house's Tudor occupants– apples, pears, quinces and medlars.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry I, in 1100, his wife Queen Matilda (or Maud), {{directed}} that the road should be routed further south, and paid for two bridges, one to cross the Lee <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> cross the Channelsea River, from her own funds. She also paid for the road to be built between them, {{and the location of}} the bridge became known as Stratford-atte-Boghe, later Stratford-le-Bow, and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge. John Leland, writing in the 1500s, gives a more fanciful account, in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action. The addition of le-Bow probably had less to do with the shape of the bridge than the fact that arch was derived from arcus, meaning bow. This was the style of French bridges rather than the Anglo Saxon straight construction, and its design gave it its name.|$|E
5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain {{heroes of the}} battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', and it probably fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors eat and drink beer after the fighting. Still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E

5|$|On 3 October 1940—two {{weeks after}} his wedding—Crombie {{embarked}} a ship at Sydney, bound for Canada. He arrived three weeks later, where he completed an additional two months of advanced flight training. Crombie was commissioned as a pilot officer on 17 January 1941, and set sail for the United Kingdom nine days later. In May, he {{was attached to the}} Royal Air Force's No.25 Squadron, piloting Bristol Beaufighters. While with the unit, he flew his first operational sortie on 13 June; he was promoted to flying officer the next month.

Ra places Jackson's body in a sarcophagus-like device that regenerates him. Ra then explains to Jackson that he has found the nuclear bomb <b>the</b> humans brought <b>and</b> has used his alien technology to increase its explosive power a hundred-fold, and threatens to send it back through the Stargate. Ra orders the human tribe to watch as he prepares <b>to</b> execute Jackson <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate his power, but Skaara and his friends create a diversion that allows Jackson, O'Neil, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> escape.

5|$|The {{biography}} of Galawdewos' brother and successor Menas of Ethiopia (r. 1559–1563) {{is divided into}} two parts, one dedicated to his life before taking the throne <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> his troubled reign fighting against rebels. His chronicle was completed by the biographers of his successor Sarsa Dengel (r. 1563–1597). The latter's chronicle can be considered an epic cycle for its preface describing events in previous eras mixed with biblical allusions. It also describes conflicts against rebel nobility allied with the Ottomans as well as a military campaign against Ethiopian Jews.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{success of}} the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which {{would be far more}} costly than any Earth-based telescope. The U.S. Congress questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, public spending cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.|$|E
500|$|A 2017 {{molecular}} {{analysis by}} Alison J. McLean <b>and</b> colleagues of <b>the</b> various subspecies across Australia largely supported Schodde's hypothesis.

McLean proposed resurrecting the separate species status of the purple-backed fairywren as M. assimilis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> subspecies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north <b>and</b> west as reallocated to this species. A genetic split was also found across the Eyrean barrier, suggesting splitting those east and west (as [...] M. assimilis mastersi Mathews) into separate subspecies would reflect the divergence.|$|R

5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|The {{first play}} of the drive was an {{incomplete}} pass by Taylor, but the Hokies earned the initial first down of the game two plays later when Taylor completed a 14-yard throw to Roberts, advancing {{the ball to the}} 41-yard line of Boston College in the process. After a five-yard penalty against the Hokies, Taylor completed two consecutive passes: one to Evans for a 12-yard gain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> Roberts for a 10-yard gain. Now at the 24-yard line of Boston College, Virginia Tech's offense began running the ball instead of passing it. Evans rushed for five yards, then second-string running back Josh Oglesby ran for seven more on the next two plays. The first of Oglesby's rushes resulted in a first down inside the Eagles' red zone, and Tech continued to advance the ball on the ground as Evans ran another five yards. Facing third down at the Boston College five-yard line, Virginia Tech called a timeout to formulate its next offensive play. That play was a five-yard rush by Taylor, who crossed the goal line for the game's first score, a Virginia Tech touchdown. The subsequent extra point kick was successful, and the Hokies took a 7–0 lead with 6:27 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|The flame fougasse has {{remained}} in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient {{to the present}} day. Such weapons are improvised from available fuel containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades and are triggered electrically or by lengths of detonating cord. In some designs, detonating cord is used to rupture the container immediately before triggering the propelling charge. In order to guarantee ignition, the improvised devices frequently feature two explosive charges, one to throw <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> ignite the fuel. Weapons of this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars {{as well as other}} conflicts.|$|E
