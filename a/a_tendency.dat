A weaker effect should {{be found in}} the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> to like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet. This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the annual and {{seasonal}} status of rainfall anomalies at the Mediterranean coast of Turkey during the period between 1950 and 2010. The rainfall anomalies at the Mediterranean coast of Turkey have shown significant annual and seasonal changes during the examined period. There are significant relations determined between the rainfall anomalies and the annual NAO and NCP; the NAO, NCP and the weather temperature during winter, the weather temperature during spring and the NAO during autumn. The rainfall anomaly values have presented a symmetric distribution in Fethiye and Anamur stations and an asymmetric distribution at the other stations in terms average deviation; and an asymmetric distribution in Fethiye, Alanya and Anamur stations and a symmetric distribution at the other stations in terms standard deviation. The rainfall anomalies have shown <b>an</b> increase <b>tendency</b> between Fethiye and Alanya and <b>a</b> decrease <b>tendency</b> between Alanya and Iskenderun during spring, <b>a</b> decrease <b>tendency</b> in Fethiye, Antalya and Anamur and <b>an</b> increase <b>tendency</b> at the other stations during summer whilst they have shown <b>a</b> decrease <b>tendency</b> at all stations during winter and <b>an</b> increase <b>tendency</b> at all stations during autumn...|$|R

25|$|One dispute {{which has}} never been finally {{resolved}} is whether the TRPF should be interpreted as <b>a</b> cyclical <b>tendency,</b> or as <b>a</b> secular long run trend. Geert Reuten from the University of Amsterdam has argued that {{there is evidence that}} Marx originally believed in a long run secular tendency, but that, later on, he changed his position to <b>a</b> cyclical <b>tendency.</b> In contrast to this view, Anwar Shaikh from the New School in New York City has argued that Marx meant the TRPF as a secular long run trend. <b>A</b> cyclical <b>tendency</b> and <b>a</b> long-run <b>tendency</b> could also be combined in one theory, where a series of cycles shows a gradual fall in the average rate of profit, despite an upturn in each cycle.|$|R

5|$|No {{subspecies}} are recognised, and {{the only}} geographic variation recorded in plumage is <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for females from more arid regions to have paler plumage.

5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses is <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> to trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, {{and appears to be}} heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links had <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> to strike and damage {{the underside of the}} fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings.|$|E
5|$|As {{printing}} became available, it {{was promptly}} used to publish herbals, the first printed matter being known as incunabula. In Europe, the first printed herbal with woodcut (xylograph) illustrations, the Puch der Natur of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580. As woodcuts and metal engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large {{increase in the}} number of illustrations together with an improvement in quality and detail but <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for repetition.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its high}} {{resistance}} to P.cinnamomi dieback, the feasibility of using B.integrifolia as a rootstock for susceptible Banksia species in the cut flower trade is under investigation.

5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
