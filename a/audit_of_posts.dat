We conducted this work in support <b>of</b> the <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> the U. S. Postal Service’s financial statements. Appendix A presents additional information about this audit. Conclusion Based on the items we reviewed, financial transactions were reasonably and fairly presented in the accounting records, and, generally, the internal controls we examined were in place and effective. In Appendix B, we identify one location where controls, overall, were not effective, and eight additional locations where major segments <b>of</b> <b>post</b> office internal controls were not effective. Appendix C lists each issue reported during FY 2008 and the number of units where the issue was also reported in FYs 2006 and 2007. Appendix D presents statistical projections of the number of units with the 10 most frequently reported internal control deficiencies. In our FY 2007 capping report, 3 we disclosed similar internal control deficiencies and recommended the Postal Service develop and implement an action plan to measurably reduce or eliminate the reported deficiencies. In FY 2008, the Postal Service developed an action plan to address the control deficiencies and is currently implementing their plan; therefore, we are not making a similar recommendation in this report. We made recommendations to district management addressing internal control and compliance issues at each installation.

40|$|The new Code of Practice (DfE, 2014) {{requires}} Educational Psychologists (EPs) to {{work with}} young people up {{to the age of}} 25. Therefore they would need to work in colleges with young people that have additional needs. This research asks what issues do young people (YP) with additional needs face in college and what support do they need? A systematic literature review showed that very little research has been done in this area, and most of it has come from the US. From the UK, there was some research around transition from school to college and also transition into adulthood, particularly in terms of medical and health services. Mixed methods exploratory research was conducted starting with an <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> <b>post</b> 16 YP. Further research was then conducted within a local authority (LA) college, firstly with seventeen adults working and living with YP with additional needs and then with eight YP. Data collection involved questionnaires to parents and staff members asking them about the support they would like from EPs and any issues they believed YP faced in college. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with young people aged 16 to 25 asking them about the issues they experience in college, the support they are given and the support they would like. The findings presented three main issues in college. These were personal issues, social issues and issues with the college itself. The YP also identified two other issues, future transition and changes in the past and future. They identified a number of support networks already in place, such as families, tutors, friends and themselves. Adults identified support they could be given by EPs such as training and individual work with young people. iv From these findings, support that college staff and EPs could provide was identified. This included training for staff, individual work with students, helping link with families, linking schools and colleges, enabling peer networks of support and educating young people and colleges {{about the role of the}} EP...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In Australia, stroke is {{the leading}} cause of adult disability. For most stroke survivors, the {{recovery}} process is challenging, and in the first few weeks their recovery is supported with stroke rehabilitation services. Stroke clinicians are expected to apply an evidence-based approach to stroke rehabilitation and, in turn, use standardised and validated assessments to monitor stroke recovery. In 2008, the National Stroke Foundation conducted the first national <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> Australia’s <b>post</b> acute stroke rehabilitation services and findings identified a vast array of assessments being used by clinicians. This study undertook a sub-analysis <b>of</b> the <b>audit’s</b> assessment tools data with the aim of making clinically relevant recommendations concerning the validity of the most frequently selected assessments. Method: Data reduction ranked the most frequently selected assessments across a series of sub-categories. A serial systematic review of relevant literature using Medline and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature identified post-stroke validity ranking. Results: The study found that standardised and non-standardised assessments are currently in use in stroke rehabilitation. It recommends further research in the sub-categories of strength, visual acuity, dysphagia, continence and nutrition and found strengths in the sub-categories of balance and mobility, upper limb function and mood. Conclusions: This is the first study to map national usage of post-stroke assessments and review that usage against the evidence. It generates new knowledge concerning what assessments we currently use post stroke, what we should be using and makes some practical post stroke clinical recommendation...|$|R
