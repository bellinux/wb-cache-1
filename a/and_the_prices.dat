5|$|At its root, {{the peasant}} war of 1653 {{was caused by}} the rapidly {{changing}} economic circumstances {{after the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action; the Swiss peasants generally had profited from the wartime economy as they had been able to export their agrarian products at higher prices than before. After the Peace of Westphalia, the southern German economy recovered quickly, the Swiss exports dwindled, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> for agrarian products dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised mortgages during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.|$|E

40|$|The time {{evolution}} of <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of resources sold to <b>the</b> market <b>and</b> of <b>the</b> <b>price</b> difference, between sold and extracted resources, is investigated {{in case of}} no accumulation of the resources; i. e. when the resources are extracted <b>and</b> sold to <b>the</b> market at the same mass flow rate. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> {{evolution of}} sold resources varies with time according to the relation between <b>the</b> <b>price</b> increase factor, PIF, of sold <b>and</b> extracted resources. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> evolutions of sold resources and price difference are investigated according to the relation between extraction rate and interest rate of extracted <b>and</b> sold resources. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> of sold resources <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> difference increase with time if the PIF of sold resources {{is greater than the}} PIF of extracted resources <b>and</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>price</b> is greater than <b>the</b> critical <b>price</b> of sold resources, which depends on <b>the</b> initial <b>price</b> of extracted resources <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interest rate of non-extracted <b>and</b> extracted resources. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> of sold resources <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> difference decrease with time if the PIF of sold resources is greater than the PIF of extracted resources <b>and</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>price</b> is smaller than <b>the</b> critical <b>price</b> of sold resources.

In 2010, the European Commission announced its intention to sell out of its cereal stocks to stabilise the situation after a Russian grain export ban had stung world markets, sending wheat prices to two-year highs and sparked worries of a crisis in global food supplies that could spark widespread strains and protests.|$|E

The well-off millionaire and billionaire oligarchs likened themselves to 19th century robber barons.

25|$|The eleven {{states had}} {{produced}} $155 million in manufactured goods in 1860, chiefly from local grist-mills, and lumber, processed tobacco, cotton goods and naval {{stores such as}} turpentine. The main industrial areas were border cities such as Baltimore, Wheeling, Louisville and St. Louis, that were never under Confederate control. The government did set up munitions factories in the Deep South. Combined with captured munitions and those coming via blockade runners, the armies were kept minimally supplied with weapons. The soldiers suffered from reduced rations, lack of medicines, and the growing shortages of uniforms, shoes and boots.

25|$|The {{decline in}} {{advertising}} revenues affected both the print and online media {{as well as}} all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> of online advertising are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the web) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by crowdsourcing both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, journalism (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of news aggregators, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of web traffic. Increasing paywalling of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the Ordinari Post Tijdender, which was established in Stockholm in 1645.|$|E

25|$|By 1917 {{the company}} share capital reached 6,000,000 marks. Due to the {{favourable}} workload, Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works could pay high dividend to its owners. The good order backlog also created problems and risks. After 1915 raw material availability became worse <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> increased {{due to the}} war. The situation worsened in 1917, when strikes, rioting and general disorder increased in many Finnish cities. The workers in Finland demanded working day {{to be limited to}} eight hours; when unruly and armed Russian soldiers joined to support the Finnish workers in April, the employers' association agreed the demands. This calmed down the environment for the summer, but new troubles followed in the autumn. The atmosphere became restless and the company managers were threatened. The Russian Provisional Government was overthrown in the October Revolution and in middle of November a general strike emerged in Finland. Although the strike lasted only for some days, workload was reduced because the Russian military did not place new orders in the chaotic situation and also getting the payment for the ongoing repairs became uncertain. Also the high inflation of the Russian ruble ate the viability.|$|E
25|$|After {{gaining the}} right to collect revenue in Bengal in 1765, the Company largely ceased {{importing}} gold and silver, which it had hitherto {{used to pay for}} goods shipped back to Britain. In addition, as under Mughal Empire rule, land revenue collected in the Bengal Presidency helped finance the Company's wars in other parts of India. Consequently, in the period 1760–1800, Bengal's money supply was greatly diminished; furthermore, the closing of some local mints and close supervision of the rest, the fixing of exchange rates, and the standardisation of coinage, paradoxically, added to the economic downturn. During the period, 1780–1860, India changed from being an exporter of processed goods for which it received payment in bullion, to being an exporter of raw materials and a buyer of manufactured goods. More specifically, in the 1750s, mostly fine cotton and silk was exported from India to markets in Europe, Asia, and Africa; by the second quarter of the 19th century, raw materials, which chiefly consisted of raw cotton, opium, and indigo, accounted for most of India's exports. Also, from the late 18th century British cotton mill industry began to lobby the government to both tax Indian imports and allow them access to markets in India. Starting in the 1830s, British textiles began to appear in—and soon to inundate—the Indian markets, with the value of the textile imports growing from £5.2 million 1850 to £18.4 million in 1896. The American Civil War too would {{have a major impact on}} India's cotton economy: with the outbreak of the war, American cotton was no longer available to British manufacturers; consequently, demand for Indian cotton soared, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> soon quadrupled. This led many farmers in India to switch to cultivating cotton as a quick cash crop; however, with the end of the war in 1865, the demand plummeted again, creating another downturn in the agricultural economy.|$|E

The suit was filed in the Southern District of New York and alleges the defendants conspired to restrain retail price competition {{in the sale of}} e-books because they viewed Amazon's price discounting as a substantial challenge to their traditional business model. Regarding Apple in particular, the federal complaint alleged that [...] "Apple facilitated the Publisher Defendants' collective effort to end retail price competition by coordinating their transition to an agency model across all retailers. Apple clearly understood that its participation in this scheme would result in higher prices to consumers." [...] In such an agency-model, publishers set prices rather than sellers. Fifteen states and Puerto Rico also filed a companion federal case in Austin, Texas, against Apple, Penguin, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan. In the same month, HarperCollins, Hachette and Simon & Schuster settled with both the DOJ and the state attorneys general, with HarperCollins and Hachette agreeing to pay Texas and Connecticut $52 million in consumer restitution, leaving Apple, Penguin, and Macmillan as remaining defendants. As of July 2012, the case was still in the discovery stage of litigation. On July 10, 2013, District Court Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan found Apple Inc. guilty of the violation of federal antitrust law, citing [...] "compelling evidence" [...] that Apple played a [...] "central role" [...] in a conspiracy with publishers to eliminate retail competition <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> of e-books.|$|E
