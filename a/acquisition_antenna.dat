We considered three different designs: the time reference beamformer (TRB), which relies on a priori knowledge of a reference waveform; the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR), which relies on a priori knowledge of the spatial signature of the signal using direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation; and the blind null-steering, which is also known as power minimization beamformer in the GNSS literature.|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of multistatic microwave imaging is {{highly dependent on}} the number of antennas used for data <b>acquisition.</b> The <b>antenna</b> size, available space for antennas, mutual coupling between antennas and acceptable hardware complexity (switching and processing) limit the usable number of antennas. To address this issue, the concept of virtual array is utilized. In this regard, a spatial interpolator is designed to predict the received signals at the location of the virtual elements using the recorded signals by a limited number of real antennas. Consequently, a frequency-based imaging algorithm is used to process the virtual-array signals and produce clear images that enable accurate detection. The presented method is tested via simulations and experiments using a multistatic-radar-based head imaging system operating using the band 1. 1 - 3. 2 GHz. The data recorded by eight antennas around the head is used to form equivalent data from an extended virtual array of 12, 16, and 32 elements.

It is also shown that a virtual array that has twice the number of elements of the real array, which meet the minimum limit of degree-of-freedom of the problem, is enough to generate an accurate image with optimized computational resources.

Inversions of the radar data using the Green's functions were performed in the time domain, focusing on a time window containing the surface reflection.

In the case of landslides, for example, space-borne SAR interferometry has a good potential to get an overview on the slope stability. The role of a space-borne INSAR as an element in a landslide or rock fall warning system is constrained by the specific space-borne SAR imaging geometry, the typical multiple-week repeat-interval, and uncertainties in the data availability. Most of these limitations can be overcome with an in situ radar imaging system. GAMMA has developed a portable radar interferometer that utilizes real-aperture antennas to obtain high azimuth resolution. Images are acquired line by line while rotating the transmitting and receiving antennas about a vertical axis. Phase differences between successive images acquired from the same location are used to determine line-of-sight displacements.

40|$|International audienceInterpretation of {{push-pull}} data {{is limited}} by the absence of a clearly defined length scale, information on subsurface heterogeneity, and the assumption that ambient flow is negligible. We address these issues through a series of push-pull experiments with saline and deionized tracers at a granitic experimental research site in Ploemeur, France. The experiments involve different injection fractures, chaser volumes and resting times. Monitoring is performed in a neighboring borehole (~ 6 m away) by single-hole ground penetrating radar (GPR), in both moving and fixed antenna settings. The GPR borehole is isolated from the tracer using a flexible-liner. We clearly image the dominant fractures in which tracer transport takes place and the spatial extent of the tracer plume at different times, which varies from a few meters to more than 10 meters away from the injection point. The differences between time-lapse images are subtle and consistent and in good agreement with the concentration data. We identify fractures in which the tracer is trapped for longer time periods and postulate that these fractures are partly responsible for the observed tailing behavior. By increasing the chasing volume, we see the tracer moving further away from the injection point and occupying different fractures, but our ability to image the tracer retrieval is decreased. By varying the resting time of a given experiment we identify regions of density-driven flow, heterogeneous advection, and ambient flow. Deionized water minimizes density effects, but the response is more quickly attenuated compared with saline tracers.

40|$|Abstract The present {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} initial synchronization in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks. In {{the first part}} of this thesis an extensive and up-to-date review of the literature is presented. The basic theory of code acquisition as well as different techniques and structures used to achieve the initial synchronization are discussed. A survey of the most common theoretical approaches allowing performance characterization of the acquisition process is included. The effect of noise, interference, carrier Doppler, multipath propagation, fading and data modulation on system performance are reviewed. Advanced code acquisition approaches exploiting interference suppression techniques and multiple antennas are also described. A summary of the results obtained within the area of code acquisition in CDMA networks is also embraced by this thesis. The distinctive assumption is to consider the actual variable effect of multiple access interference on the delay-domain search process, instead of the usual constant approximation. Three directions of research are followed. Models for code acquisition in quasi-synchronous and asynchronous CDMA networks are first developed and analysed. Closed-form expressions for the main performance figures of the acquisition process are derived and analysed. Results show a strong dependence of the mean acquisition time with the nature of the multiple access interference. In the second area of research the previous results are extended to consider code acquisition with a multi-branch (Rake) receiver in a multipath channel. A generic model for Rake receiver code acquisition is considered and developed, in which the synchronization takes place in two phases. The first detected path is allocated to the first finger during the initial synchronization phase, whereas the remaining fingers are successively allocated to other available paths in the postinitial synchronization phase. Performance measures for this acquisition process are also derived and analysed. Finally, based on the use of an antenna array and beamforming techniques, conventional delay-domain code acquisition is extended to the angular domain, resulting in a two-dimensional (delay-angle) search. This technique is found to be feasible, outperforming the synchronization approach exploiting a single-antenna. It is found that there exists an optimal number of antennas that minimises the mean acquisition time. Two-dimensional code acquisition is studied in a variety of scenarios, including single and multipath channels, fixed and fading channels, and with uniform and nonuniform spatial distributions of interference. Different two-dimensional search strategies are studied. A clear dependence of acquisition performance with the search strategy and the particular distribution of interference is pointed out. The performance of two-dimensional code acquisition is found to be seriously deteriorated by the presence of spatially nonuniform interference. Schemes based on search strategy and adaptive detector structures are considered and analysed to combat the performance degradation in the mentioned case. A comparative study of code <b>acquisition</b> exploiting multiple <b>antennas</b> is also presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{non-destructive}} evaluation {{with the aim}} of characterizing objects before or after treatment has taken place, and the monitoring of long-term performance is analyzed in this thesis. Generally, these test methods measure material properties or changes in these properties that decision makers are interested in. There is a variety of non-destructive testing (NDT) methods to choose from, depending on the aim of the analysis. Generally speaking, different non-destructive testing methods can be used for investigating the inner structure of materials. It is worth noticing that there is not one single analytical method able to provide all the necessary information. Therefore, a combined test series capable of providing complementary information is usually adopted. Most of the methods used in NDT generate pictures of the object interior that can help locate structural flaws. Even though not common, these methods can give quantitative results. The use of electromagnetic waves within the radio frequency bandwidth, in particular, can be valuable in detecting defects, for assessing the deterioration and the success of refurbishment activities. A particular radar technology was used in this study as a tool for assessing the ability to characterize materials in specific built environments. Numerical and laboratory studies were carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed methodology for the mentioned applications. A secondary objective was to provide a contribution to the road safety, preventing the risk of severe damage of pavement, induced by clay content in sub-asphalt layers, and to improve the operations of rehabilitation and maintenance through an effective inspection. In Chapter 2 the electric properties of multiphase aggregate mixtures were evaluated for a given mineralogic composition at frequencies between 300 kHz and 3 GHz. Two measurement techniques were employed: a coaxial transmission line and a monostatic stepped-frequency ground-penetrating radar. The propagation matrices analytical method was used to retrieve the electrical permittivity and conductivity of the mixtures from the measured scattering parameters in the coaxial transmission line. The effect of increasing water content was analyzed in several sand-clay mixtures. For the end-member case of maximum clay (25 % by weight) and increasing water content, investigations were compared between the two measurement techniques. The electrical properties of materials are influenced by the amount of water, but clay affects the frequency dependency of soils showing distinctive features regardless of the mineralogy. The microwave attenuation, expressed by the quality factor Q, is partly dependent on frequency and on water content. The performance of one empirical and one volumetric mixing model was evaluated to assess the capability of indirectly retrieving the volumetric water content for a known mixture. The results obtained were encouraging for applications in the field of pavement engineering {{with the aim of}} clay detection. The models used show similar behaviors, but measured data were better modeled using third order polynomial equations. High-frequency, ultra-wideband penetrating radar {{has the potential to be}} used as a non-invasive inspection technique for buildings, providing high-resolution images of structures and possible fractures affecting constructions. To test this possibility, in Chapter 3 numerical and laboratory experiments were conducted using a proximal, stepped-frequency continuous-wave radar system operating in zero-offset mode, spanning the 3 - 8 GHz frequency range. The reconstruction of material electrical properties is achieved by resorting to full-waveform inverse modeling. Numerical experiments showed that for typical electric permittivity and electrical conductivity values of concrete and plaster, it is possible to retrieve the physical properties of the material and to detect fractures less than 1 mm thick. Laboratory experiments were conducted on non-reinforced concrete and plaster test slabs in different configurations. The results showed the good potential of this method: (1) to provide a thorough fracture response model in buildings or artworks and (2) to non-invasively characterize the samples in terms of their electromagnetic properties. The characterization of the subsurface can be performed by full-waveform inversion of electromagnetic data relating to a particular model. The modeling process relies on the ability of retrieving the scattered field Green’s function from the measured data. This is achieved using sets of antenna characteristic global reflection and transmission coefficients to describe the media in terms of their scattered field impulse response. As described in Chapter 4, crucial for a successful implementation of this technique is the understanding of uncertainties involved in the <b>acquisition</b> of the <b>antenna</b> calibration and survey measurements, and how these propagate in the parameter estimation results. It was found that averaging a number of possible Green’s functions obtained from one measurement with several antenna characteristic coefficients sets works remarkably well in reducing the uncertainties. The accuracy of the inversions improved using characteristic coefficients acquired as close as possible to the measurement conditions. Moreover, a clear relation between dynamic range and system resolution was highlighted, based on the number of effective bits contained in the data. The presence of cohesive soils as bearing courses of road pavement frequently causes damages and defects (e. g., transversal and longitudinal cracks, deformations and ruts). In Appendix A, different ground-penetrating radar (GPR) methods and techniques were used to non-destructively investigate the clay content in sub-asphalt compacted soils. The experimental layout provided the use of typical road materials, employed for road bearing courses construction. Three types of soils classified as A 1, A 2, A 3 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) were used and adequately compacted in electrically and hydraulically isolated test boxes. Analyses were carried out for each clay content using two different GPR instruments. A pulse radar with ground-coupled antennae at 500 MHz center frequency and a vector network analyzer (VNA) with a 1 – 3 GHz bandwidth were used. Signals were processed in both time and frequency domains, and the consistency of results was validated by the Rayleigh scattering method, the full-waveform inversion and the signal picking techniques. Promising results were obtained for the detection of clay content or cohesive soils affecting the bearing capacity of sub-asphalt layers.

40|$|This Dissertation {{addresses}} the signal <b>acquisition</b> problem using <b>antenna</b> arrays {{in the general}} framework of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers. The term GNSS classi es those navigation systems based on a constellation of satellites, which emit ranging signals useful for positioning. Although the American GPS is already available, which coexists with the renewed Russian Glonass, the forthcoming European contribution (Galileo) along with the Chinese Compass will be operative soon. Therefore, a variety of satellite constellations and signals {{will be available in}} the next years. GNSSs provide the necessary infrastructures for a myriad of applications and services that demand a robust and accurate positioning service. The positioning availability must be guaranteed all the time, specially in safety-critical and mission-critical services. Examining the threats against the service availability, it is important to take into account that all the present and the forthcoming GNSSs make use of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) techniques. The ranging signals are received with very low precorrelation signal-to-noise ratio (in the order of ��� 22 dB for a receiver operating at the Earth surface). Despite that the GNSS CDMA processing gain o ers limited protection against Radio Frequency interferences (RFI), an interference with a interference-to-signal power ratio that exceeds the processing gain can easily degrade receivers' performance or even deny completely the GNSS service, specially conventional receivers equipped with minimal or basic level of protection towards RFIs. As a consequence, RFIs (either intentional or unintentional) remain as the most important cause of performance degradation. A growing concern of this problem has appeared in recent times. Focusing our attention on the GNSS receiver, it is known that signal acquisition has the lowest sensitivity of the whole receiver operation, and, consequently, it becomes the performance bottleneck in the presence of interfering signals. A single-antenna receiver can make use of time and frequency diversity to mitigate interferences, even though the performance of these techniques is compromised in low SNR scenarios or in the presence of wideband interferences. On the other hand, antenna arrays receivers can bene t from spatial-domain processing, and thus mitigate the e ects of interfering signals. Spatial diversity has been traditionally applied to the signal tracking operation of GNSS receivers. However, initial tracking conditions depend on signal acquisition, {{and there are a number}} of scenarios in which the acquisition process can fail as stated before. Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge, the application of antenna arrays to GNSS signal acquisition has not received much attention. This Thesis pursues a twofold objective: on the one hand, it proposes novel arraybased acquisition algorithms using a well-established statistical detection theory framework, and on the other hand demonstrates both their real-time implementation feasibility and their performance in realistic scenarios. The Dissertation starts with a brief introduction to GNSS receivers fundamentals, providing some details about the navigation signals structure and the receiver's architecture of both GPS and Galileo systems. It follows with an analysis of GNSS signal acquisition as a detection problem, using the Neyman-Pearson (NP) detection theory framework and the single-antenna acquisition signal model. The NP approach is used here to derive both the optimum detector (known as clairvoyant detector) and the sov called Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) detector, which is the basis of almost all of the current state-of-the-art acquisition algorithms. Going further, a novel detector test statistic intended to jointly acquire a set of GNSS satellites is obtained, thus reducing both the acquisition time and the required computational resources. The eff ects of the front-end bandwidth in the acquisition are also taken into account. Then, the GLRT is extended to the array signal model to obtain an original detector which is able to mitigate temporally uncorrelated interferences even if the array is unstructured and moderately uncalibrated, thus becoming one of the main contributions of this Dissertation. The key statistical feature is the assumption of an arbitrary and unknown covariance noise matrix, which attempts to capture the statistical behavior of the interferences and other non-desirable signals, while exploiting the spatial dimension provided by antenna arrays. Closed form expressions for the detection and false alarm probabilities are provided. Performance and interference rejection capability are modeled and compared both to their theoretical bound. The proposed array-based acquisition algorithm is also compared to conventional acquisition techniques performed after blind null-steering beamformer approaches, such as the power minimization algorithm. Furthermore, the detector is analyzed under realistic conditions, accounting for the presence of errors in the covariance matrix estimation, residual Doppler and delay errors, and signal quantization e ects. Theoretical results are supported by Monte Carlo simulations. As another main contribution of this Dissertation, the second part of the work deals with the design and the implementation of a novel Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) -based GNSS real-time antenna-array receiver platform. The platform is intended to be used as a research tool tightly coupled with software de ned GNSS receivers. A complete signal reception chain including the antenna array and the multichannel phase-coherent RF front-end for the GPS L 1 / Galileo E 1 was designed, implemented and tested. The details of the digital processing section of the platform, such as the array signal statistics extraction modules, are also provided. The design trade-o s and the implementation complexities were carefully analyzed and taken into account. As a proof-of-concept, the problem of GNSS vulnerability to interferences was addressed using the presented platform. The array-based acquisition algorithms introduced in this Dissertation were implemented and tested under realistic conditions. The performance of the algorithms were compared to single <b>antenna</b> <b>acquisition</b> techniques, measured under strong in-band interference scenarios, including narrow/wide band interferers and communication signals. The platform was designed to demonstrate the implementation feasibility of novel array-based acquisition algorithms, leaving the rest of the receiver operations (mainly, tracking, navigation message decoding, code and phase observables, and basic Position, Velocity and Time (PVT) solution) to a Software De ned Radio (SDR) receiver running in a personal computer, processing in real-time the spatially- ltered signal sample stream coming from the platform using a Gigabit Ethernet bus data link. In the last part of this Dissertation, we close the loop by designing and implementing such software receiver. The proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of e ciency, modularity, interoperability, and exibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as intermediate signals or data extraction and algorithms interchangeability. In this context, we introduce an open-source, real-time GNSS software de ned receiver (so-named GNSS-SDR) that contributes with several novel features such as the use of software design patterns and shared memory techniques to manage e ciently the data ow between receiver blocks, the use of hardware-accelerated instructions for time-consuming vector operations like carrier wipe-o and code correlation, and the availability to compile and run on multiple software platforms and hardware architectures. At this time of writing (April 2012), the receiver enjoys of a 2 -dimensional Distance Root Mean Square (DRMS) error lower than 2 meters for a GPS L 1 C/A scenario with 8 satellites in lock and a Horizontal Dilution Of Precision (HDOP) of 1. 2. Esta tesis aborda el problema de la adquisición de la señal usando arrays de antenas en el marco general de los receptores de Sistemas Globales de Navegación por Satélite (GNSS). El término GNSS engloba aquellos sistemas de navegación basados en una constelación de satélites que emiten señales útiles para el posicionamiento. Aunque el GPS americano ya está disponible, coexistiendo con el renovado sistema ruso GLONASS, actualmente se está realizando un gran esfuerzo para que la contribución europea (Galileo), junto con el nuevo sistema chino Compass, estén operativos en breve. Por lo tanto, una gran variedad de constelaciones de satélites y señales estarán disponibles en los próximos años. Estos sistemas proporcionan las infraestructuras necesarias para una multitud de aplicaciones y servicios que demandan un servicio de posicionamiento confiable y preciso. La disponibilidad de posicionamiento se debe garantizar en todo momento, especialmente en los servicios críticos para la seguridad de las personas y los bienes. Cuando examinamos las amenazas de la disponibilidad del servicio que ofrecen los GNSSs, es importante tener en cuenta que todos los sistemas presentes y los sistemas futuros ya planificados hacen uso de técnicas de multiplexación por división de código (CDMA). Las señales transmitidas por los satélites son recibidas con una relación señal-ruido (SNR) muy baja, medida antes de la correlación (del orden de - 22 dB para un receptor ubicado en la superficie de la tierra). A pesar de que la ganancia de procesado CDMA ofrece una protección inherente contra las interferencias de radiofrecuencia (RFI), esta protección es limitada. Una interferencia con una relación de potencia de interferencia a potencia de la señal que excede la ganancia de procesado puede degradar el rendimiento de los receptores o incluso negar por completo|$|R
