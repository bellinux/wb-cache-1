Each bogie and wheelset thus experiences a different traction coefficient. Locomotive manufacturers introduce {{traction control system}} strategies for achieving optimal adhesion allowing for axle weight transfers. Determination of <b>adhesion</b> <b>coefficients</b> to input into traction control systems is a complex and difficult issue. Optimising this taskrequires solving {{the problem of how}} to estimate rail friction condition. This paper describes the algorithm which allows estimation of friction parameters for hauling locomotives, and uses a low computational cost solution based on existing approaches and input signals from sensors. The verification of the algorithm is performed using a co-simulation process between the multibody software and Matlab/Simulink package. Simulation results obtained confirm that the proposed approach is an efficient andpractical tool that can be recommended for implementation for locomotive traction control systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research of tires {{was to determine the}} dynamic rolling radius and to apply it to wheel slip calculations with special respect to vertical wheel load and to tire inflation pressure. It is typical of mechanical four-wheel drive tractors that there is a definite additional power in the tractor power chain. This additional power is dependent on the difference between the front wheel and rear wheel peripheral speeds. Further-more, the purpose was to determine the effect of additional slip on four-wheel drive tractors operated without drawbar pull. Experiments were performed on asphalt surfaces and fields. A new measurement method was developed, and a device was constructed for the implementation of three tractor wheel drive operational modes (four-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive and front-wheel drive). As the result of the experiments, a relationship was found to describe the dynamic rolling radius for low-profile radial tires tested on rigid road surfaces. On this basis, the classical slip calculation method was modified.

This paper describes an experimental investigation on the effect of water temperature on the <b>adhesion</b> <b>coefficient</b> to verify the significant effect of the water temperature on the <b>adhesion</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The experimental results indicated that a rise in water temperature causes an increase in the <b>adhesion</b> <b>coefficient,</b> which was qualitatively consistent to the numerically calculated results in the previous paper [1]...|$|E

Based on the basic theory of vehicle dynamics, vehicle safety driving model is established. Also, the minimum radius is calculated with the consideration of uneven <b>adhesion</b> <b>coefficient</b> and crosswind. The results show that the effects of uneven <b>adhesion</b> <b>coefficient</b> and crosswind on the truck's lateral stability increase with the increasing of the truck's speed. Truck's lateral slide instability begins to appear when crosswind grade grows up to 9 or above. According to sensitive analysis, speed, rainfall, crosswind, and the interaction of the speed and rainfall have significant influences on the truck's lateral stability. The results quantify the effects of uneven <b>adhesion</b> <b>coefficient</b> and crosswind on truck's lateral stability. The advised index for horizontal curve design control is proposed, which provides a good reference for road safety design and safety protective measures. It can also provide theoretical basis and guidelines for highway safe operation in the windy and rainy areas...|$|E
40|$|Friction {{management}} and control of adhesion at the wheel/rail interface is vital for an efficient and cost effective railway network. The {{understanding of how the}} friction management products (grease and friction modifiers) work and effectively test these products is necessary to improve the performance of a railway network. The papers presented concern the effective benchmarking of wayside curve lubricants (grease) in a twin disc test rig. They compare the effectiveness of several greases in respect to adhesion, wear protection and retentivity (number of cycles of adequate lubrication). A new method for assessment of grease carry down has been trialled in the field. The modified pendulum was able to detect the difference between a dry and lubricated rail gauge face. Top of rail friction modifiers (TOR-FMs) have been tested at two different laboratory test scales. The results showed the difference in operational behaviour of the chosen TOR-FM when used in a laboratory versus the field. The ‘wet-rail’ phenomena, where low adhesion as a result of water on the rail head, has been investigated at two scales of laboratory test and results have been used to generate a model to predict <b>adhesion</b> <b>coefficients</b> for a range of water and iron oxide mixtures. The results presented show how the addition of small amounts of water to a wheel/rail contact can cause reduced adhesion to ‘low/ultra-low’ levels when combined with third body materials (iron oxides, wear debris etc.). A novel treatment method to protect the rail head using hydrophobic solutions was investigated using twin disc and pendulum testing. Tests showed that these products, when sufficiently diluted, do not reduce friction to dangerous levels or isolate the vehicle from the track circuit. However, the benefits of use in the field are questioned. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{how to improve}} the prediction method of the <b>adhesion</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{by means of the}} experimentally estimated boundary friction coefficient obtained by two kinds of twin-disc rolling contact machines and the ratio of real contact area to nominal contact area (RCA/NCA) obtained by ultrasonic measurement. The previous prediction method that the authors had already proposed in the last paper was based on Greenwood-Tripp's rough surface contact model; however, in this study, the authors adopted Lee & Ren's rough surfaces contact model and focused on the RCA/NCA measured by ultrasonic wave in order to predict the <b>adhesion</b> <b>coefficient</b> under wet conditions with the actual surface contact conditions. As a result, regarding the tendency of <b>adhesion</b> <b>coefficient</b> decreasing with an increase of running speed, a good agreement has been obtained between the results obtained by the prediction method proposed in this study and the measured results obtained by the field-test of Japanese Shinkansen vehicle (series 200) ...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} investigate the dependency of particle size on the deposition rate. Polystyrene latex particles of two radii (0. 23 and 0. 38 mum) were deposited onto a glass surface covered with indium-tin oxide. Reduced deposition efficiency was observed for the larger particles, although {{an increase in the}} deposition efficiency was seen as that the diffusion boundary layer became thicker. A critical degree of surface coverage, Brit, was defined as the fraction of surface coverage at which the linear variation of flux with time ended. When the two particle sizes were compared, {{it was found that the}} value of Brit depended only on the wall shear stress. This result indicates that surface shielding is an important factor in the decline in particle flux. The deposition process was divided into two separate processes, described by a mass-transfer <b>coefficient</b> and an <b>adhesion</b> rate <b>coefficient.</b> It was found that the process was governed by mass-transfer during the initial period, but for higher degrees of surface coverage adhesion became the rate-determining factor.

However, good interfacial adhesion between the fibers and the matrix {{is difficult to}} control. Wetting of the fiber reinforcement with the matrix strongly determines the interfacial strength.

In this work, dynamic contact angle measurements were conducted on individual CNT fibers by using a modified tensiometric method based on the Wilhelmy method combined with a synchronized optical observation. The CNT fiber-liquid interactions were monitored in-situ, and accurate measurements of the contact angles were achieved. Contact angles on CNTs were estimated through a modified Cassie-Baxter model on the basis of the experimental contact angle values of CNT fibers. Subsequently, the non-polar and polar surface energy components of the CNTs were obtained.

The study concentrated on cathodic arc physical vapor deposition (CAPVD), a technique used for the deposition of hard coatings for tooling applications, and which has many advantages. The main drawback of this technique, however, is the formation of macrodroplets (MDs) during deposition, resulting in films with rougher morphology.

Surface morphology revealed that the MDs produced during the etching stage, protruded through the TiN film, resulting in film with deteriorated surface features.
