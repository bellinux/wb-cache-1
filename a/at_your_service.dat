25|$|Many Hollywood {{cartoons}} {{from the}} 1930s {{are based on}} feature films. Therefore, it was only natural for Leon Schlesinger's cartoon studio to parody the 1936 Warner Bros. musical film The Green Pastures, itself an adaptation of a play by Marc Connelly which won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1930. The Green Pastures features an all-black cast and proved a success for Warner Bros., despite generating controversy. Animator Friz Freleng had directed the short Sunday Go to Meetin' Time in 1936. The cartoon lampoons African American religious beliefs to the backdrop of jazz music and {{tells the story of}} a rural black man who shirks church on Sunday in favor of worldly pastimes and finds himself in Hell as a result. Clean Pastures was thus keeping with his past work. Freleng even reuses animation of a jitterbugging couple from the Sunday Go to Meetin' Time in Clean Pastures. The short's use of caricatures of famous performers was in the same vein as such Freleng films as <b>At</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Service,</b> Madam and Coo-Coo Nut Grove.|$|E

This drew the attention of Rudyard Kipling, who produced [...] "The Absent-Minded Beggar" [...] on 16 October 1899 and sent the verses to Harmsworth on 22 October with a note that [...] "they are <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>service.</b> ... turn [...] over {{to any one of}} the regularly ordained relief-funds, as a portion of your contribution. I don't want my name mixed up in the business except as it will help to get money. It's catchpenny verse and I want it to catch just as many pennies as it can. ... It isn't a thing I shall care to reprint; so there is no need of copyrighting it in America. If any one wants to sing it take care that the proceeds go to our men." [...] It was first published in the Daily Mail on 31 October 1899 and was an immediate success. Maud Tree, the wife of actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, recited it at the Palace Theatre, every night before the show, for fourteen months, and other performers recited it at music halls and elsewhere, giving part of the profits to the fund. The manuscript itself was auctioned for £500, and a Special Edition de Luxe was issued.|$|E

5000|$|In her {{earliest}} works, such as Always <b>at</b> <b>Your</b> Excellency's <b>Service,</b> {{painted in}} 1961, Rego was {{strongly influenced by}} Surrealism, and particularly the work of Joan Miró. [...] This shows itself {{not only in the}} type of imagery that appears in these works, but in the method employed, which is based on the Surrealist idea of automatic drawing, in which the artist attempts to disengage the conscious mind from the making process in order to allow the unconscious mind to direct the making of an image. At times these paintings almost verge on abstraction; however, as exemplified by Salazar Vomiting the Homeland, painted in 1960, when Portugal's right-wing dictator Salazar was in power, even when her work veered toward abstraction, a strong narrative element remains in place.|$|R

Auden, the composer Benjamin Britten, {{and the man who}} would one day write their biographies (though none of them yet knows this), Henry Carpenter. 1 Towards the end of their meeting, Carpenter asks the two artists – who have been discussing Britten’s work on his new opera Death in Venice –: «Would it not surprise you to learn that there is a growing number of your devotees who would in the nicest possible way be happy to see you dead?» 2. Auden and Britten are incredulous; Britten protests: «I’ve still got so much to do», but Carpenter defends his ground: There’s no malice in it. It’s just an entirely human desire for completion [...] . the mild satisfaction of drawing a line under you. Death shapes a life. Dead, you see, you belong to your admirers in your entirety.
