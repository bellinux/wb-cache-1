I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E

500|$|The {{penetration}} of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at <b>all</b> (<b>in</b> <b>my</b> study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some {{who are unable to}} penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place.... Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, {{with the help of the}} [...] "little knife". This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis.|$|E

500|$|Questlove was the [...] "musical powerhouse" [...] behind {{several of}} the Soulquarians' {{projects}} during the late 1990s and early 2000s, including Voodoo and Things Fall Apart. In a 2002 interview, he told critic Jim DeRogatis {{about his role in}} recording Voodoo and being a part of the Soulquarians, stating [...] "I tried to do <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> power that I could to bring people together – to bring Common to Electric Lady, have him record here whenever so that he could record with some of these other artists. You'd just come into [...] A Room, you don't even know who has a session, but you call me: 'Who's down there?' 'Common's in there today'. So you come down, you order some food, sit down and bulls—, watch a movie, and then it's, 'Let's play something'. And I say, 'Who wants this ?' And it would be, 'I want it!' 'No, I want it!'". Questlove has referred to the recording experience at the studio as a [...] "left-of-center black music renaissance".|$|E
500|$|Many {{fans and}} the press {{interpret}} the song as referring to a psychedelic experience due to lines such as [...] "purple haze <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> brain" [...] and [...] "'scuse me while I kiss the sky". [...] However, Hendrix and those closest to him never discussed any connection between psychedelic drugs and the song, although Shapiro admits that, at the time, {{to do so would}} have been [...] "professional suicide". Chandler, who claimed he was present when Hendrix wrote it, later denied suggestions that Hendrix did so while under the influence of psychedelics. [...] Commenting on the lyrics, Shadwick concludes [...] "the music [...] to tell the larger story. [...] Poised effectively between the twin intoxicants of drugs and desire, they could be interpreted to the listener's taste". [...] In concert, Hendrix sometimes substituted lyrics for comic effect; [...] "'scuse me while I kiss the sky" [...] was rendered [...] "'scuse me while I kiss this guy" [...] (while gesturing towards Mitchell), [...] "'scuse me while I kiss that policeman" [...] (at a near riot in Los Angeles), or [...] "'scuse me while I fuck the sky" [...] (during a downpour in Seattle).|$|E
500|$|A 2005 study led by Margo Lillie, a {{zoologist}} at the University of British Columbia, and her student Tracy Boechler, {{concluded that}} tipping a cow {{would require a}} force of nearly [...] and is therefore impossible to accomplish by a single person. Her calculations found that it would require more than four people to apply enough force to push over a cow, based on an estimate that a single person could exert [...] of force. However, since a cow can brace itself, Lillie and Boechler suggested that five or six people would, most likely, be needed. Further, cattle {{are well aware of}} their surroundings and are very difficult to surprise, due to excellent senses of both smell and hearing. Lillie and Boechler's analysis found that if a cow did not move, the principles of static physics suggest that two people might be able to tip a cow if its centre of mass were pushed over its hooves before the cow could react. However, cows are not rigid or unresponsive, and the faster humans have to move, the less force they can exert. Thus Lillie and Boechler concluded that it is unlikely that cows can actually be tipped over in this way. Lillie stated, [...] "It just makes the physics of it <b>all,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, impossible." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Clark hit a rich vein for his {{flamboyant}} clothing range. The fashion press dubbed Ossie the [...] "King of King's Road". Clark pronounced himself a [...] "master cutter. It's <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> brain and fingers and there's no-one {{in the world}} to touch me. I can do everything myself." [...] Clark's great idol was the famous dancer Nijinsky and his love of dance inspired his clothes to be free moving and not to restrict the female form. This style of dressing became quite popular in the 1970s {{thanks in large part to}} the popularity of Clark's clothing. Ossie Clark is well known for his use of muted colours and moss crepe fabric. He also designed shoes, paper dresses, and snakeskin jackets.|$|E

Ethel became involved with another man and the exchange of letters ceased but on Beatty's return she sent him a telegram and letter inviting him to resume their friendship. Beatty did not respond until after surgery on his arm in September 1900 when he wrote, [...] "I landed from China with my heart full of rage, and swore I did not care if I ever saw you again, or if I were killed or not.

2500|$|Spencer {{influenced}} literature {{inasmuch as}} many novelists and short story authors came to address his ideas in their work. George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Hardy, George Bernard Shaw, Bolesław Prus, Abraham Cahan, D. H. Lawrence, Machado de Assis, Richard Austin Freeman, and Jorge Luis Borges all referenced Spencer. Arnold Bennett greatly praised First Principles, {{and the influence}} it had on Bennett {{may be seen in}} his many novels. Jack London {{went so far as to}} create a character, Martin Eden, a staunch Spencerian. It has also been suggested that the character of Vershinin in Anton Chekhov's play The Three Sisters is a dedicated Spencerian. H.G. Wells used Spencer's ideas as a theme in his novella, The Time Machine, employing them to explain the evolution of man into two species. It is perhaps the best testimony to the influence of Spencer's beliefs and writings that his reach was so diverse. He influenced not only the administrators who shaped their societies' inner workings, but also the artists who helped shape those societies' ideals and beliefs. In Rudyard Kipling's novel Kim, the Anglophile Bengali spy Hurree Babu admires of Herbert Spencer and quotes him to comic effect: [...] "They are, of course, dematerialised phenomena. [...] Spencer says." [...] "I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust, to meet little thing like death, which is <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> fate, you know." [...] "He thanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that there remained some valuables to steal." ...|$|E
