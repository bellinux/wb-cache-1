5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> know is an alcoholic.|$|E
5|$|In late 1971 the FBI {{distributed}} {{lists of}} the ransom serial numbers to financial institutions, casinos, race tracks, and other businesses that routinely conducted significant cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15% of the recovered money, {{to a maximum of}} $25,000. In early 1972 U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell released the serial numbers to the general public. In 1972 two men used counterfeit 20-dollar bills printed with Cooper serial numbers to swindle $30,000 from a Newsweek reporter named Karl Fleming in exchange for an interview with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> falsely claimed was the hijacker.|$|E

Jenny later decides to end their relationship. She then writes a story about all her friends for The New Yorker.|$|E

Kinghorn told them he had seen Braithwaite, whom he said he knew only by sight, stab Blakelock with a kitchen knife.

25|$|From the 1990s, African-American {{activists in}} Charleston {{proposed}} erecting {{a memorial to}} Denmark Vesey, to honor his effort to overturn slavery in the city. The proposal was controversial, as some people {{did not want to}} memorialize <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> considered a terrorist; others believed a memorial would not only acknowledge his leadership but would express the slaves' desire for freedom. In 2014, a statue representing Vesey as a carpenter, holding a Bible, was erected in Hampton Park, at some distance from the main tourist areas.|$|E

In one raid, special forces stormed a villa belonging to <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> {{claimed to have}} orchestrated the previous police station attack. They were supported by police armoured vehicles that smashed down the compound's gates before breaking in, but the man wasn't there. Waves of arrests were carried out and in total, between 65 and 85 people, including three main suspects in August's attack, were detained in response to 150 arrest warrants made for involved suspects in the earlier killings. In addition, the Interior Ministry stated that dozens of weapons, including three rocket-propelled grenades and several automatic firearms.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of April 20, {{the day after the}} Orthodox Easter was celebrated in the tent colony, three Guardsmen {{appeared}} at the camp ordering the release of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> claimed was being held against his will. This request prompted the camp leader, Louis Tikas, to meet with a local militia commander at the train station in Ludlow village, a half mile (0.8km) from the colony. While this meeting was progressing, two companies of militia installed a machine gun on a ridge near the camp and took a position along a rail route about half a mile south of Ludlow. Anticipating trouble, Tikas ran back to the camp. The miners set out to flank the militia positions and a gunfight soon broke out.|$|E

25|$|The players {{often said}} {{in later years}} that they played so well as a team because almost to <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>they</b> hated Finley with a passion. For instance, Finley {{threatened}} to pack Jackson off to the minors in 1969 after Jackson hit 47 homers; Commissioner Bowie Kuhn had to intervene in their contract dispute. Kuhn intervened again after Blue won the A.L. Cy Young Award in 1971 and Finley threatened {{to send him to}} the minors. Finley's tendency for micromanaging his team actually dated to the team's stay in Kansas City. Among the more notable incidents during this time was a near-mutiny in 1967; Finley responded by releasing the A's best hitter, Ken Harrelson, who promptly signed with the Red Sox and helped lead them to the pennant.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as {{citizens}} {{and the degree to}} which they could become emancipated, women in ancient Rome could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business. Some acquired and disposed of sizable fortunes, and are recorded in inscriptions as benefactors in funding major public works. Roman women could appear in court and argue cases, though it was customary for them to be represented by <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> <b>They</b> were simultaneously disparaged as too ignorant and weak-minded to practice law, and as too active and influential in legal mattersâ€”resulting in an edict that limited women to conducting cases on their own behalf instead of others'. But even after this restriction was put in place, there are numerous examples of women taking informed actions in legal matters, including dictating legal strategy to their male advocates.|$|E
25|$|A German {{exchange}} student {{said he was}} beaten randomly by riot police in the Exarheia district, his only reason for being there that he had accompanied other students to eat. The student gives a horrifying description of the violence he endured, he cowered in a corner when he saw police because {{a few weeks before}} he had witnessed police beating <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> had arrested. He claims that upon spotting him, about six police officers started beating him with their batons, and when they left they were replaced by another group of police. The student was unarmed and posed no threat but the police were ruthlessly brutal in their actions. It has been indicated that riot police left beaten and gravely individuals without any medical assistance. Amnesty International urges Greece to effectively and promptly investigate these crimes against civilians, which clearly violate human rights, and hold perpetrators accountable.|$|E

And I wasn't even regarded as a woman, I was a girl." [...] Writing about her in The Independent in 2002, film critic David Thomson expressed Phillips' attitude as: [...] "you [...] guys don't take women seriously; you like us around... we aren't allowed to be players". Those same few men, like [...] "Valley viper" [...] Mike Ovitz who headed the Creative Artists Agency were, in her eyes, responsible for a qualitative decline in standards and the increasing banality of movies since the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|The writers based {{the whole}} theme of some episodes on the plots of feature films.

For series IX, [...] "" [...] was partially inspired by Blade Runner (1982). The series' themes {{are not limited}} to films or television, having also incorporated historical events and figures. Religion also plays a part in the series, as a significant factor in the ultimate fate of the Cat race, and the perception of Lister as their 'God', both within the episode [...] "Waiting for God" [...] (whose title makes a literary reference to the Samuel Beckett play Waiting for Godot), as well as the crew meeting <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>they</b> believe to be Jesus Christ in series X episode [...] "Lemons".
