Although destitute, Bacon found that by avoiding rent and engaging in petty theft, he could survive. To supplement his income, he briefly tried his hand at domestic service, but although he enjoyed cooking, he became bored and resigned. He was sacked from a telephone <b>answering</b> <b>position</b> at a shop selling women's clothes in Poland Street, Soho, after writing a poison pen letter to the owner. Bacon found himself drifting through London's homosexual underworld, aware {{that he was able to}} attract a certain type of rich man, something he was quick to take advantage of, having developed a taste for good food and wine. One was a relative of Winnie, another a breeder of racehorses, Harcourt-Smith, who was renowned for his manliness. Bacon claimed his father had asked this [...] "uncle" [...] to take him 'in-hand' and 'make a man of him'. Francis had a difficult relationship with his father, once admitting to being sexually attracted to him.|$|E

Traditional methods mainly use rigid heuristic rules to transform a sentence into related questions. In this work, we propose to apply the neural encoder-decoder model to generate meaningful and diverse questions from natural language sentences. The encoder reads the input text and the <b>answer</b> <b>position,</b> to produce an answer-aware input representation, which is fed to the decoder to generate an answer focused question. We conduct a preliminary study on neural question generation from text with the SQuAD dataset, and the experiment results show that our method can produce fluent and diverse questions.

SACRY uses a database (DB) contain-ing previously solved CPs {{in order to}} generate the list of candidate answers. Additionally, it uses innovative features, such as the <b>answer</b> <b>position</b> in the rank and aggregated information such as the min, max and average clue reranking scores. Our system is based on WebCrow, {{one of the most}} advanced systems for automatic crossword puzzle resolution. Our extensive experiments over our two million clue dataset show that our ap-proach highly improves the quality of the answer list, enabling the achievement of unprecedented results on the complete CP resolution tasks, i. e., accuracy of 99. 17 %. ...|$|R

Geometric uncertainty is often stud-ied with simple ad-hoc models that assume indepen-dent, isocentric, and isotropic geometric errors. These models are often inadequate {{and can lead to}} erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we introduce the Linear Parametric Geometric Uncertainty Model, and derive the worst-case first-order approximation of the uncer-tainty zones of points and lines in the plane. The model is general and expressive, and allows parame-ter dependencies. We present the properties of point and line uncertainty zones, and algorithms to compute them and to <b>answer</b> relative <b>positioning</b> queries. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{matters in}} the fight against crime through a prism of foreign {{countries}} are in the centre of attention of a domestic and foreign criminal law science and lawenforcement practice. The modern science of criminal law has a theoretically reasonable doctrine <b>answering</b> <b>positions</b> and principles about a lawful state, the complete concept of punishment; however, there is an inevitable practice of wide application punishment of custodial sanction which against a steady tendency of growth of registered criminality becomes a sharp social and legal problem. In this sense experience of mediation’s application in criminal cases in court practice of Federal Republic of Germany is interesting as comparable alternative form of conflicts solution which is enough effective. Mediation means development of an extrajudicial decision for victims, a conciliation procedure for all participants of the conflict with assistance of one or several intermediaries who are independent, neutral and external persons carrying out exchange and communications function between the parties, with the purpose of conflict settlement by participants. Mediation gives the opportunity of constructive handling with criminal cases and is a good addition to traditional court practice as it means the co-operative and constructive decision of problems existing between the direct parties and contributes to internal security provision, so a share of relapses after processes of reconciliation of the criminal and a victim is much more low than in comparable cases in traditional criminal procedures. Authors describe short chronology of contemporary history of mediation, legal and organizational bases in realization of reconciliation process between a victim and the criminal being the offer of conflict settlement by means of the third participating parties...|$|R

In this paper, issues of item order (position within a set of items that comprise a test) and <b>answer</b> order (<b>position</b> of correct <b>answer</b> relative to incorrect distractors) are discussed. Answer order is identified as potentially important, particularly for conceptually based items. When the correct answer appears earlier among the answer choices, there is some greater propensity for student performance to be better. Item-order effects are also possible, particularly when students encounter several challenging items consecutively. Performance on the next item may be lower than expected, possibly because of cognitive-load effects...|$|R

It is stated that different viewpoints are possible to interrelate the services; an environmental starting point focusing on the linkage to ecological processes and functions on the one side, and the relations with human well-being criteria and management obligations on the other. Finally, the actual needs for further research and application are outlined from an indicator-based aspect and the broad field of potential contributions for the new journal is summarized...|$|R

3000|$|More {{recently}} I {{have rejected}} my previous ontological approach {{to understanding the}} nature of research, in favour of an explicitly socio-cultural approach (Biggs and Büchler [2011]). In a socio-cultural approach one does not look for fundamental definitions or criteria as one does in the ontological approach, and one looks instead for community endorsement and authorisation of certain practices. If one looks at research conducted in creative areas one will find that making a building or a design {{or a piece of}} music is regarded by some of the community as a legitimate research activity (JAR [2013]). In terms of the activity-theoretic model above, Position 2 is legitimized by the interpretative community who find the questions in Position 1 worth asking, and the <b>answers</b> in <b>Position</b> 3 satisfying. As a result, we need to ask what kind of research methods are legitimised by the community and lead to valid and significant research outputs such as buildings, designs and music? [...]...|$|R

30|$|With in-car speech {{applications}} like hands-free car kits {{and speech}} recognition systems, speech {{is corrupted by}} engine noise and other noise sources like airflow from electric fans or car windows. For safety and comfort reasons, hands-free telephone systems should provide the same quality of speech as conventional fixed telephones. In practice however, the speech quality of a hands-free car kit heavily depends on the particular position of the microphone. Speech has {{to be picked up}} as directly as possible to reduce reverberation and to provide a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The important question, where to place the microphone inside the car, is, however, difficult to <b>answer.</b> The <b>position</b> is apparently a compromise for different speaker sizes, because the distance between microphone and speaker depends significantly on the position of the driver and therefore {{on the size of the}} driver. Furthermore, noise sources like airflow from electric fans or car windows have to be considered. Placing two or more microphones in different positions enables a better compromise with respect to different speaker sizes and yields more noise robustness.|$|R
40|$|There is no {{consensus}} about appropriate philosophical method that can be relied on to settle philosophical questions and instead of established findings, there are multiple conflicting arguments and positions, and widespread disagreement and debate. Given this feature of philosophy, it might seem that philosophy {{has proven to be}} a worthless endeavour, with no possibility of philosophical progress. The challenge then is to develop a conception of philosophy that reconciles the lack of general or lasting agreement with the possibility of philosophical progress. I present such a conception in this paper. I argue that the aim of philosophy is to resolve philosophical problems, which is different from establishing settled and final <b>answers</b> or <b>positions.</b> Philosophical problems involve inadequate or incongruous conceptions that cannot be settled once and for all but can be resolved by transforming our conceptions so they are now congruous and adequate. There is philosophical progress every time a warranted, defensible position is developed that resolves a philosophical problem, even if there are competing resolutions and further problems to resolve, as there always are in philosophy...|$|R
