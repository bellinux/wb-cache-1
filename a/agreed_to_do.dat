5|$|Bayard Rustin's open homosexuality, {{support of}} {{democratic}} socialism, {{and his former}} ties to the Communist Party USA caused many white and African-American leaders to demand King distance himself from Rustin, which King <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> However, King agreed that Rustin {{should be one of}} the main organizers of the 1963 March on Washington.|$|E
5|$|Deane Malott, {{who became}} {{president}} of Cornell in 1951, was much less sympathetic, and instructed Morrison to curtail all activities beyond his academic field. Morrison <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in 1954. Nonetheless, {{he was one of}} the few ex-communists to remain employed and academically active throughout the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Summer 1949 {{brought an}} {{unwanted}} distraction for Robinson. In July, {{he was called}} {{to testify before the}} United States House of Representatives' Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) concerning statements made that April by black athlete and actor Paul Robeson. Robinson was reluctant to testify, but he eventually <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, fearing it might negatively affect his career if he declined.|$|E
5|$|When Slayton {{submitted}} the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, George Mueller turned {{them down on}} the grounds that the crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, who had been the backup commander for Apollo 11, and was slated to command Apollo 14, if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead. He <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, and Shepard's inexperienced crew was assigned to Apollo 14.|$|E
5|$|Although Murphy was {{initially}} reluctant {{to appear as}} himself in To Hell and Back, {{the film version of}} his book, he eventually <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Terry Murphy portrayed his brother Joseph Preston Murphy at age four. The film was directed by Jesse Hibbs with an on-screen introduction by General Walter Bedell Smith. Susan Kohner, daughter of Murphy's agent Paul Kohner, made her acting debut in the film. The finale shows Murphy being awarded the Medal of Honor while images of his unit's casualties pass across the screen. It became the biggest hit in the history of Universal Studios at the time.|$|E

5|$|For the {{supporting}} roles, Zarina Wahab was cast as Suhasini Chauhan, Vijay's mother; a role originally played by Rohini Hattangadi. Wahab <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the film, {{due to her}} close association with producer, Johar. For the role of Shiksha Chauhan, newcomer Kanika Tiwri was auditioned and cast among 6500 girls. In order to feature an item number in the film, producer Johar wanted to sign Kareena Kapoor, who refused the offer and Katrina Kaif was eventually contracted. Filming for the song was demanding on Kaif, as she ended up with cuts and blisters on her feet, due to the long, stretched-out schedules.|$|E
5|$|Ganesan {{originally}} {{offered the}} role of Vellaiyathevan to S. S. Rajendran, who declined it due to {{his commitment to the}} film Sivagangai Seemai (1959). He later requested actress Savitri to ask her husband Gemini Ganesan to play the role, which she <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> despite being pregnant at that time. Gemini Ganesan was initially reluctant to accept the role, but eventually agreed. Padmini, O. A. K. Thevar, and V. K. Ramasamy were chosen to play Vellaiyammal, Oomaithurai and Ettappan respectively. S. Varalakshmi played Kattabomman's wife, Jakkamma, and also worked as a playback singer.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Speer {{surrendered}} {{his position}} as Tessenow's assistant and moved to Mannheim. His father gave him a job as manager of the elder Speer's properties. In July1932, the Speers visited Berlin to help out the Party prior to the Reichstag elections. While they were there, his friend, Nazi Party official Karl Hanke, recommended the young architect to Joseph Goebbels to help renovate the Party's Berlin headquarters. Speer <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the work. When the commission was completed, Speer returned to Mannheim and remained there as Hitler took office in January1933.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, Turner {{appeared}} {{in her first}} Technicolor film, as Lady de Winter in The Three Musketeers, opposite Gene Kelly, Van Heflin, and June Allyson. In November 1947, she <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the film, thereby giving up an unfinished film project called Bedeviled. However, in January 1948, {{it was reported that}} she had withdrawn from the film. Initially, Louis B. Mayer gave her permission for doing so because of her schedule, but she was later that month put on suspension. Eventually, Turner agreed to make the film, but did not start production until March due to having to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} {{political}} career, he became known for wearing {{a bright red}} vest and tie. He adopted this dress during his term as vice-president when he and James Reeside, a mail contractor known for his drab dress, passed a tailor's shop that displayed a bright red cloth in the window. Johnson suggested that Reeside should wear a red vest because the mail coaches he owned and operated were red. Reeside <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so if Johnson would also. Both men ordered red vests and neckties, and were known for donning this attire {{for the rest of}} their lives.|$|E
5|$|Malick {{was upset}} that the studio {{screened}} his unfinished version for critics and Penn ended up helping {{him in the}} editing room, shaping the final version. Malick spent three more months and cut 45 additional minutes from the film. The director refused to subject his film to test screenings before delivering his final cut. After Geisler and Roberdeau told their story to Vanity Fair magazine, Medavoy's attorneys declared them in breach of contract and threatened to remove their names from the film unless they <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> no future interviews until after the Academy Awards.|$|E

After much soul-searching, the Executive Committee <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in January 1957. The slow renovation and conservation {{of the village}} began, much of it undertaken by summer volunteer work parties. In addition, scientific research began on the feral Soay sheep population {{and other aspects of}} the natural environment. In 1957 the area was designated a national nature reserve.|$|E
5|$|Purnell, Parsons, Tibbets, Spaatz and Curtis LeMay met on Guam on 7 August, the {{day after}} the Hiroshima attack, to discuss what should be done next. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have a Fat Man bomb ready by 11 August, as {{originally}} planned, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if it could be readied by 9 August. Parsons <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
5|$|The BP Pedestrian Bridge, {{or simply}} BP Bridge, is a girder {{footbridge}} in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois, United States. It spans Columbus Drive to connect Maggie Daley Park (formerly, Daley Bicentennial Plaza) with Millennium Park, both {{parts of the}} larger Grant Park. Designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Frank Gehry, it opened {{along with the rest}} of Millennium Park on July 16, 2004. Gehry had been courted by the city to design the bridge and the neighboring Jay Pritzker Pavilion, and eventually <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so after the Pritzker family funded the Pavilion.|$|E

5|$|Although Susan Hayward was {{reported}} to be in the running for one of the two female leads, Julie Harris was chosen for the role of Eleanor Lance. Wise had seen Harris on stage, and felt she was right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor. Harris <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the film in part because the role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor's mind was interesting. But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in parapsychology. English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast Bloom and Johnson was because of Eady Levy requirements that the cast be partly British. To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, beatnik clothing designer Mary Quant was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Joint Research and Development Committee with Spaatz, Devers took an {{interest}} in the development of helicopters, taking rides in different machines. He met with Larry Bell, the founder of Bell Aircraft. Bell's company was in a poor financial situation, and he was hoping that the Army would buy fifty of his new Bell 47 helicopters. Devers was impressed with the aircraft, and <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, although for $25,000 each rather than the $35,000 Bell was asking for, and found the money from Army Ground Forces funds. The Bell H-13 Sioux would go on {{to become one of the}} world's most recognizable helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Chester {{had planned}} to retire in June 2009, and the {{congregation}} embarked on {{a search for a}} new senior rabbi in 2008. Twenty-three candidates were narrowed down to one finalist, but in early December that individual informed the search committee that he was withdrawing his name from consideration. While the search was progressing, Chester had realized that, due to the 2008 financial crisis, he would have to keep working. After the main candidate withdrew, the synagogue's president approached Chester, asking if he would stay on for another term, which Chester <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Chester retired in June 2011, becoming (along with Broude) Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E
