40|$|The {{polymeric}} membranes {{technology is}} a dynamic growing field, exploited in several areas of application like gas separation,[1] sensors, and vacuum technology. [2]It is based on well-known selective permeation process of gas through a polymer, whose selectivity for two different gas is the ratio of their permeability coefficients P. In the last years have been developed methods to fabricate ultra-thin membrane,[3] but there’s no estimation of P. Moreover, even if for thick membrane there is some results, the dependence of P from the thickness is generally poorly investigated. Here we present a novel method to fabricate stable and resistant ultra thin PDMS membranes, and we show their gas permeation characteristics as function of the membrane thickness {{and the type of}} gas: CO 2 and He. The membranes have been fabricated by spin coating with thickness in the range between few micron and 500 nm. Afterwards, in order to guarantee the necessary mechanical stability, they have been transferred on SiN membrane previously drilled by focused ion beam with a number of apertures such that to have an appropriate permeation area (Fig. 1). Permeability measurements have been performed in high vacuum chamber, where the membranes have been exposed to 105 Pa of pressure differential without rupturing or stretching, proving their high strenght. The results confirm the higher permeability of the carbon dioxide respect to those of helium, whereas the value of P decreases unexpectedly with the membrane thickness, on the contrary of the CO 2 /He selectivity that remains constant. Studies on thickness-dependence of the gas permeability are scarce, but our data (Fig. 2) are in good agreement with a model that considers non-equilibrium reactions at gas-membrane interface. This make it possible the evalutation of the adsorption and desorption rates, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjuction</b> with mechanical properties of the membranes, suggests new technological solutions in the devices miniaturization...|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of study}} was the {{surveillance}} of antimicrobial susceptibility trends in Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains isolated in Greece during a five-year period, from 1998 through 2002. Results were evaluated in comparison to those obtained by analyzing the gonococcal sample of the previous period (1993 - 1997) <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjuction</b> to other microbiological and epidemiological features of gonorrhea. A total of 526 gonococcal strains {{were included in the}} study and ensued from two major Greek Venereal hospitals, located in Athens and Thessaloniki. Findings of the study showed that the incidence of gonorrhea remained unchanged during the study period, at levels comparable to those recorded in Greece since the 1990 ’s (1 - 2 ‰). Whereas, remarkable increases in the rates of MSM and economical refugees among the patients were observed, indicating changes in the synthesis of the affected polulation. By antimicrobial suscebtibility testing, only cefotaxime and spectinomycin were found active against all N. gonorrhoeae isolated during the study period. For all other antibiotics tested (penicillin G, tetracycline, erythromycin, chloramfenicol and fluoroquinolones) high rates of resistance and intermediate susceptibility were recorded. Comparatively to previous years, the total resistance of the Greek gonococcal sample has not been significantly altered. Nevertheless, a qualitative differentiation was ascertained, with increasing isolation frequencies of strains with mechanisms conferring higher levels of resistance (PPNG, TRNG, QRNG and combinations) and a decreasing trend of chromosomally encoded low-level resistance, which is usally attributed to non-specific mechanisms. Typing of the isolates showed increased serovar homogeneity, while further characterization, using molecular typing methodology, revealed that the observed changes in antimicrobial suscebtibility of the total gonococcal sample were due, at least in part, to the spread or outgoing of clusters of clonally related strains with similar susceptibility profiles. In most cases, outbreak clones were associated with high-risk groups in the polulation, mainly the groups of MSM and economic refugees. In conclusion, the findings of the study show that gonorrhea infection in Greece follows the global trends of a low-incidence era. Accordingly, changes in the features of the affected polulation indicate a trend of a disease acquiring core-group characteristics, with increasing numbers of cases in subgroups of the polulation exhibiting high-risk behaviour. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Reverse link {{feedback}} {{power control}} in {{subject to a}} feedback delay <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjuction</b> with diversity is considered over a frequency-nonselective slow Rayleigh fading channel. The transmission power of a mobile station is adjusted {{as a function of}} fed back estimated channel state information, so that the average error probability is minimized when the average transmission power is fixed. The channel state is estimated by using known, constant-power pilot symbols. In each frame, a time multiplexed pilot symbol is transmitted in addition to the antipodal data symbols. In the literature, feedback MMSE (minimum mean-square error) power control has been analyzed {{in the case of a}} random time-invariant channel. Therein the frame size was two, i. e. one data and one pilot symbol were transmitted in each frame. Also, the fading gain was estimated by a one-shot MMSE estimator. This author's main contribution is that the aforementioned analysis has been extended to a more general system model in which the frame size is arbitrary, and in which the time-variant fading gain is estimated by an optimal MMSE estimator. For power control purposes, the estimator has to be a predictor since feedback requires causality. First, in order to avoid a delay in detection, the predictor is used in both power control and detection. In the case of a frame size of two, the performance of feedback MMSE power control employing the predictor is compared to that of a system using the one-shot estimator. Then, the performance of feedback MMSE power control with an optimal frame size is evaluated. Finally, the system performance is derived when a smoother is employed in detection, and the additional effects of a feedback delay and diversity on the performance are investigated. The performance difference between optimal (channel states are assumed to be known) and MMSE power control using a one-shot estimator is found to be significant at large signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's). This is in contradiction with the result presented earlier in the literature. The reason for the large performance difference is that the SNR of the channel estimate is small, since each estimate is computed using only one pilot symbol. The performance difference between optimal and MMSE power control with the predictor is smaller than said difference in the case of the one-shot estimator because the estimate is averaged over many pilot symbols. It is also observed that the lag error of the estimator considerably reduces the benefit of MMSE power control, even when the channel changes very slowly. To diminish the lag error, and to achieve good performance, a large number of estimator coefficients is required. It is well known that fixed-step adjustment closed loop power control attempts to compensate for all changes caused by the channel. In contrast, according to Monte Carlo simulations, MMSE power control did not attempt to compensate for the deepest fades. At other time instants, it strives to set the received SNR to an approximately constant level, which depends on the bit-error rate (BER) target. Increasing the frame size from the value of two not only improves the spectrum utilization, but was also shown to yield better performance for the pilot symbol system with MMSE power control over a slowly fading channel. Also, a clear performance improvement was achieved by using the smoother in detection. The performance loss resulting from a feedback delay of 10 - 20 % from the channel coherence time was shown to be small with reasonable BER values. Estimation errors were shown to diminish the benefit of power control when the diversity order was two, compared to the case of no diversity...|$|E

Our analysis extends previous predictions to capture important effects associated with losses, self- and cross-phase modulation, and imperfect frequency matching (detuning) of the cavity frequencies.

40|$|The inflationary {{scenario}} {{has become}} the paradigm of early universe cosmology, <b>and</b> - <b>in</b> <b>conjuction</b> with ideas from superstring theory - has led to speculations about an "inflationary multiverse". From {{a point of view}} of phenomenology, the inflationary universe scenario has been very successful. However, the scenario suffers from some conceptual problems, and thus it does not (yet) have the status of a solid theory. There are alternative ideas for the evolution of the very early universe which do not involve inflation but which agree with most current cosmological observations as well as inflation does. In this lecture I will outline the conceptual problems of inflation and introduce two alternative pictures - the "matter bounce" and "string gas cosmology", the latter being a realization of the "emergent universe" scenario based on some key principles of superstring theory. I will demonstrate that these two alternative pictures lead to the same predictions for the power spectrum of the observed large-scale structure and for the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies as the inflationary scenario, and I will mention predictions for future observations with which the three scenarios can be observationally teased apart.
