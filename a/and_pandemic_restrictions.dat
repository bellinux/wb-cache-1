40|$|Influenza viruses {{are unique}} {{in their ability}} to cause {{recurrent}} epidemics <b>and</b> truly global <b>pandemics</b> during which acute febrile respiratory disease occurs explosively in all age groups. Epidemics of varying severity occur almost annually in temperate climates and are punctuated by the much less frequent but more dramatic occurrence of pandemic influenza. Increases in hospitalization and death often accompany widespread morbidity during influenza epidemics <b>and</b> <b>pandemics.</b> Influenza pandemics also threaten to disrupt other essential and nonessential services through high absenteeism, with high economic losses resulting. The medical impact and disruptive effects of epidemics <b>and</b> <b>pandemics</b> clearly justify careful global monitoring of influenza and strenuous efforts to prevent this emerging and reemerging disease.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Assessment of {{the effect}} of {{influenza}} on populations, including risk of infection, illness if infected, illness severity, and consultation rates, is essential to inform future control and prevention. We aimed to compare the community burden and severity of seasonal <b>and</b> <b>pandemic</b> influenza across different age groups and study years and gain insight into the extent to which traditional surveillance underestimates this burden. METHODS: Using preseason and postseason serology, weekly illness reporting, and RT-PCR identification of influenza from nasal swabs, we tracked the course of seasonal <b>and</b> <b>pandemic</b> influenza over five successive cohorts (England 2006 - 11; 5448 person-seasons' follow-up). We compared burden and severity of seasonal <b>and</b> <b>pandemic</b> strains. We weighted analyses to the age and regional structure of England to give nationally representative estimates. We compared symptom profiles over the first week of illness for different strains of PCR-confirmed influenza and non-influenza viruses using ordinal logistic regression with symptom severity grade as the outcome variable. FINDINGS: Based on four-fold titre rises in strain-specific serology, on average influenza infected 18...|$|R
40|$|The natural {{reservoirs}} {{of influenza}} viruses are aquatic birds. After adaptation, avian viruses can acquire {{the ability to}} infect humans and cause severe disease. Because domestic poultry serves as a key link between the natural reservoir of influenza viruses <b>and</b> epidemics <b>and</b> <b>pandemics</b> in human populations, an effective measure to control influenza would be to eliminate or reduce influenza virus infection in domestic poultry. The development and distribution of influenza-resistant poultry represents a proactive strategy for controlling the origin of influenza epidemics <b>and</b> <b>pandemics</b> in both poultry and human populations. Recent developments in RNA interference and transgenesis in birds should facilitate the development of influenza-resistant poultry. The influenza A virus is an enveloped, segmented RNA virus and the etiological agent of influenza epidemics <b>and</b> <b>pandemics</b> in both poultry and human populations [1]. In a typical year, influenza viruses infect as many as 500 million people worldwide and cause 1500, 000 deaths. During a pandemic, {{the loss of life}} is even more staggering: the devastating 1918 – 1919 pandemic killed ∼ 40 – 50 million people, causing global political, social...|$|R
