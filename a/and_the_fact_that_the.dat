5|$|A third species, L. consors, was {{established}} by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882, which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part {{of at least one}} other individual. The skull was only partially preserved, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vertebrae were represented only by centra suggests a partially grown individual. Galton (1983) notes that much of the current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster, or had paint applied.|$|E

5|$|After the {{surrender}} of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Colonel Barton S. Alexander, then-chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Due to its rear-area nature <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fort was unimportant to the overall defenses of Washington, Fort Runyon fell into the third-class category.|$|E
5|$|At kickoff, a {{light breeze}} was blowing from the {{northeast}} at , the air temperature was , and the weather was foggy with a light rain. Rain had been falling for several hours, turning the field into a muddy mess that would hinder play throughout the game. 62,850 tickets were sold for the game, and that number was given as the official attendance.

5|$|By 1908, Piemonte {{had been}} {{assigned}} as the flagship of the torpedo flotilla of the main fleet, which consisted of seventeen destroyers and fifty first and second class torpedo boats. In August that year, Piemonte participated in the annual summer maneuvers of the Italian fleet. She was assigned to a squadron and was tasked with defending against an opponent fleet that attempted to force an amphibious landing. The maneuvers were modeled on a potential war with Italy's nominal ally Austria-Hungary, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relative strengths of the two squadrons mirrored the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies {{was not lost on}} analysts in Vienna. The Maneuvers concluded with a fleet review on 18 October. Piemonte then spent 1909 deployed again to the Far East.|$|E
5|$|By {{relying on}} the written works of both Christian and Muslim authors, oral traditions, and modern methods of anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics, Mohammed Hassen, Associate Professor of History at Georgia State University, asserts that the largely non-Christian Oromo people have interacted and lived among the Semitic-speaking Christian Amhara people {{since at least the}} 14th century, not the 16th century as is {{commonly}} accepted in both traditional and recent Ethiopian historiography. His work also stresses Ethiopia's need to properly integrate its Oromo population <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Cushitic-speaking Oromo, despite their traditional reputation as invaders, were significantly involved in maintaining the cultural, political, and military institutions of the Christian state.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} Rome's entire {{position}} on the Rhine and even in Gaul was imperiled. Their civil war over, the Romans mustered a huge task force of eight legions (five dispatched from Italy, two from Spain and one from Britain) to deal with Civilis. Its commander Petillius Cerialis had to fight two difficult battles, at Trier and Xanten, before he could overrun the Batavi's homeland. Tacitus' surviving narrative breaks off as he describes a meeting on {{an island in the}} Rhine delta between Civilis and Cerialis to discuss peace terms. We do not know the outcome of this meeting or Civilis' ultimate fate. But in view of his former friendship with Vespasian, who had already offered him a pardon, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Romans still needed the Batavi levies, {{it is likely that the}} terms were lenient by Roman standards.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{presence}} of valence 5f electrons, neptunium and its alloys exhibit very interesting magnetic behavior, like many other actinides. These can range from the itinerant band-like character characteristic of the transition metals to the local moment behavior typical of scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides. This stems from 5f-orbital hybridization with the orbitals of the metal ligands, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 5f orbital is relativistically destabilized and extends outwards. For example, pure neptunium is paramagnetic, NpAl3 is ferromagnetic, NpGe3 has no magnetic ordering, and NpSn3 behaves fermionically. Investigations are underway regarding alloys of neptunium with uranium, americium, plutonium, zirconium, and iron, so as to recycle long-lived waste isotopes such as neptunium-237 into shorter-lived isotopes more useful as nuclear fuel.|$|E
5|$|General praise went to {{the variety}} of choice in its {{narrative}} and gameplay, despite the former being seen as lacking in places and the latter being held back by other {{factors such as the}} limitations of the Biomod upgrade system and its limited environment sizes. Poor AI behavior was also a recurring criticism. The Xbox version was praised for its performance and graphics despite several reviewers noting distracting drops in frame rate and other technical issues. The PC version was frequently criticized as having similar frame rate issues in addition to problems with the controls, the necessity for a powerful computer to run the game properly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game was scaled down to run on the Xbox.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the American embassy {{believed}} the Ngô family's {{claims that the}} regular army {{was responsible for the}} raids. The Voice of America, which was widely listened to in South Vietnam as the only non-Diệmist news source, initially aired Nhu's version of events, much to the dismay of the generals. The American media thought otherwise and began to debunk this theory, pointing out that the Ngô family constantly sought to undermine the army, and that Madame Nhu's joy over the events suggested the family had neither ceded power nor had their hands forced by the military. Furthermore, they identified Nhu's aides at the site, his idiosyncratic style in the announcements supposedly made by the ARVN, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> army had little motive to attack the Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius funalis {{differs from}} its closest relative, M.liquidambari, {{due to the}} {{presence}} of cheilocystidia, the lack of clamp connections <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> caulocystidia of M.liquidambari do not form bristles; instead, they are club shaped to cylindrical. The species is known from Mexico and Papua New Guinea. M.hudonii, known from Europe, is similar in appearance to M.funalis. However, the former has a cap covered in hairs or bristles, and differs microscopically; for instance, the hyphae feature clamp connections. The Malagasy species Setulipes funaliformis was named after M.funalis due to the morphological similarities between the two. The species can be differentiated {{by the fact that the}} basidiospores of S.funalformis are slightly larger and narrower, measuring from 7 to 10 by 3.5 to 4.5μm, and the caulocystidia of M.funalis are significantly longer.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s the authorities in Eilat have considered relocating the airport, approximately 20km north of Eilat, to the Ora Well area near Be'er Ora. There were numerous reasons behind this idea. Primarily, the fact that safety would be improved as in its current location, there is the chance of aircraft crashing into buildings in the city. Other reasons were the pure value of the land which the airport occupies, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> airport is dividing the city of Eilat into two parts with the hotels and tourist areas on one side, and the residential buildings on the other.|$|E

5|$|The Mint {{had trouble}} {{striking}} the new design. This {{was due to}} the hard copper-nickel alloy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eagle {{on one side of the}} piece was directly opposite parts of the reverse design; efforts to bring out the design more fully led to increased die breakage. Many Flying Eagle cents show weaknesses, especially at the eagle's head and tail, which are opposite the wreath. In 1857, Snowden suggested the replacement of the eagle with a head of Christopher Columbus. Longacre replied that as there had been objections to proposals to place George Washington on the coinage, there would also be opposition to a Columbus design. Despite the difficulties, the 17,450,000 Flying Eagle cents struck at Philadelphia in 1857 constituted the greatest production of a single coin in a year at a U.S. mint to that time.|$|E
