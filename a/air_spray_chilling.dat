40|$|Rabbit meat {{has high}} {{nutritional}} value. It contains {{only a small}} amount of fat and cholesterol and is an important source of vitamins and minerals. Rabbit meat consumption continues to decline. This decrease is mainly due to the higher price of rabbit meat. Broiler rabbits that have a higher slaughter yield are most often used for meat production. Quality of rabbit meat is influenced by several factors. These factors include age, gender, nutrition, environment, breeding technology, genetics and the method of slaughter processing. Rabbit slaughter processing takes place in specialized processing plants. The rabbits are stunned, either mechanically, by electric shock or gas and then they are hung by the hind leg on a special hook. Bleeding, skinning and gutting follows after that. The body organs are removed and a veterinary inspection is performed. The carcasses are usually cooled down by air or <b>air</b> with <b>spray.</b> The <b>chilled</b> carcasses are weighted and packaged. They can also be applied to portions or used for production of meat products...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{computer}} controlled and operated <b>spray</b> <b>chill</b> unit {{which can be}} used in future research studies for both <b>spray</b> <b>chilling</b> and decontamination of red meat carcasses is described. The unit consists of two parts: (1) an electromechanical system, and (2) a data acquisition/control system. Design concepts for the <b>spray</b> <b>chill</b> system are (1) versatility, (2) rapid change of spray parameters, and (3) computer control of the electromechanical system. An added feature is the computer data collection system for recording information related to each carcass (pH of muscle, surface and internal tissue temperatures, and weights of each half carcass during the cooling cycle; velocity, temperature, and humidity of the chill cooler air) and environmental data related to spraying conditions (time and duration of spray period and temperature of sprayed solution). Keywords. Decontamination, Dehydration, Meat, Quality control, Sanitation. Normally, red meat carcasses are exposed to dehydration from the environment and deterioration from bacterial growth during the <b>chilling</b> process. Recently, <b>spray</b> <b>chilling</b> of carcasses in the cooler to reduce shrinkage has become an accepted practice in the red meat industry. Application of a chlorine solution sprayed intermittently on carcasses was an attempt to address both the dehydration and deterioration problems (Heitter, 1975). This proces...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} and physicochemical characterisation of <b>spray</b> <b>chilled</b> Gelucire 50 / 13 microspheres is described {{with a view}} to improving the dissolution of a poorly water-soluble drug, piroxicam, and understanding the fundamental mechanisms associated with the improved drug release. Thermorheological testing was developed as a fast screening method for predicting the processability of dispersions for <b>spray</b> <b>chilling</b> preparation. <b>Spray</b> <b>chilled</b> piroxicam loaded microspheres were spherical in shape with a median diameter of circa 150 ?µm. DSC indicated no interaction between piroxicam and lipid matrix, while HSM studies performed in polarized light mode indicated that the spheres contained distinct drug crystals. Polarising light microscopy and small-angle XRD investigations on the hydration behaviour of the lipid and the <b>spray</b> <b>chilled</b> microspheres revealed the formation of liquid crystalline phases depending on the degree of hydration. The dissolution behaviour of the piroxicam loaded microspheres showed significant improvements compared to drug alone. The particle size, drug loading and aging of the microspheres were all found to have an influence on the release behaviour. It was proposed that Gelucire 50 / 13 microspheres release the entrapped piroxicam via formation of a lyotropic liquid crystalline phase, which allows dissolution of the drug particles in a finely divided, high surface area and well-wetted state...|$|R
40|$|Piroxicam, an {{anti-inflammatory}} drug, exhibits poor {{water solubility}} and flow properties, poor dissolution and poor wetting. Consequently, {{the aim of}} this study was to improve the dissolution of piroxicam. Microparticles containing piroxicam were produced by spray drying, using isopropyl alcohol and water in the ratio of 40 : 60 v/v as solvent system, and <b>spray</b> <b>chilling</b> technology by melting the drug and chilling it with a pneumatic nozzle to enhance dissolution rate. The prepared formulations were evaluated for in vitro dissolution and solubility. The prepared drug particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimeter, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Dissolution profile of the spray dried microparticles was compared with spray-chilled microparticles, pure and recrystallized samples. Spray dried microparticles and <b>spray</b> <b>chilled</b> microparticles exhibited decreased crystallinity and improved micromeritic properties. The dissolution of the spray dried microparticle and <b>spray</b> <b>chilled</b> particles were improved compared with recrystallized and pure sample of piroxicam. Consequently, it was believed that spray drying of piroxicam is a useful tool to improve dissolution but not in case of <b>spray</b> <b>chilling.</b> This may be due to the degradation of drug or variations in the resonance structure or could be due to minor distortion of bond angles. Hence, this spray drying technique can be used for formulation of tablets of piroxicam by direct compression with directly compressible tablet excipients...|$|R

40|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>chilling</b> {{technology}} (also {{known as}} spray cooling and spray congealing technology) {{has been widely}} studied and used in the pharmaceutical field. In the food industry, this technique is gaining interest and can become useful because functional food formulations can be developed. <b>Spray</b> <b>chilling</b> is a fat-based system, which involves {{the addition of the}} component of interest to a molten lipid carrier, and the resulting mixture is fed through an atomiser nozzle. When the nebulised material is put into contact with the environment, which is cooled below the melting point of the matrix material, the vehicle solidifies (due to heat exchange between the molten material and cold air), and solid lipid microparticles are formed at the same time. This technology is fat based, and lipid carriers, such as wax and oil (e. g. palm oil, beeswax, cocoa butter, and kernel oil) can be used. This encapsulation technique can potentially change the functionality, reduce the hygroscopicity, mask taste or odour, change solubility, and provide physical protection in addition to allowing the controlled release of these ingredients. This low-cost technology is relatively simple to apply and scale up, and it does not require the use of organic solvents and the application of high temperatures in the process. Therefore, <b>spray</b> <b>chilling</b> encapsulation may facilitate the development and production of functional and enriched foods as it may solve some technological problems {{associated with the use of}} certain ingredients, such as those that have high reactivity and low stability...|$|R
