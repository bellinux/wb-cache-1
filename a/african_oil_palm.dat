Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a mortar, and boiled by women.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an effort}} to promote {{ecological}} sustainability, payment for various environmental services are given to landowners in order to motivate reforestation on their land. A major issue with these programs is that most small landholders do not have titles to the land. These small landholders were given plots to cultivate when they worked on larger farms or many were displaced migrants who settled in unclaimed lands. Since they have no legal documentation of land ownership they can’t apply {{for many of the}} correct land use incentives, thus little consideration of long-term effects on the land is given. Another issue is that the programs don’t differentiate between small-scale and large-scale landowners. In {{an effort to}} reduce Carbon emissions the MBC offers incentives for carbon sinks. Large-scale landowners have taken advantage of these systems by planting <b>African</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>Palms</b> on their lands.

40|$|This study {{developed}} biomass {{models to}} calculate carbon stock {{levels of the}} West <b>African</b> <b>oil</b> <b>palms</b> (Elaeis guineensis) using multi-date wet and dry season IKONOS images. Two benchmark areas of the derived savanna ecoregions of Africa were selected for analysis. Allometric equations related aboveground palm biomass to their stem heights. Empirical regression models based on field plot data were established to determine wet and dry biomass (kgm 22) of <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> plantations in IKONOS images. The best models were exponential, involving bands 3, 3 and 1, or 3 and 4, and explaining between 63 and 72 % of the variability in the data. Model evaluations with independent datasets showed there is 28 – 36 % uncertainty in dry biomass predictions. At the landscape level, multi-date IKONOS data mapped <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> plantations with an overall accuracy of 88 – 92 %. However, the ability of IKONOS data to differentiate various age groups of <b>oil</b> <b>palms</b> was limited {{with a high degree}} of intermixing of classes. The best results were obtained when delineating agro-palm (palms mixed with agriculture and fallows), palm of 1 – 3 years, and palm of 4 – 5 years at an overall accuracy of 74. 5 % using all four IKONOS bands. The results indicate the need for additional spectral bands in the IKONOS sensor. The total carbon per unit area of <b>oil</b> <b>palms</b> was calculated across age groups for the two benchmark areas of West Africa and were 14. 75 and 14. 94 tonnes ha 21 (or Mgha 21), respectively. The corresponding dry biomass (kgm 22) were 29. 5 and 29. 88 tonnes ha 21 (or Mgha 21). The age of the <b>oil</b> <b>palms</b> were between 1 and 5 years across benchmark areas.

40|$|The <b>African</b> <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> {{industry}} in Colombia has burgeoned {{in the last}} decade, with state-sanctioned promotions and new developmental productions {{for the expansion of}} these plantations seeking to provide economic stability for the country. In addition, with the passing of the Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Colombia in 2011, as well as deals with several European countries for the exportation of the product, comes an even greater demand than previously known for the industry. However, the continuation of this endeavor will lead to the devastation of the bio-diverse lands being used for economic gains. Furthermore, <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> production on the Pacific coast of Colombia comes at the cost {{of tens of thousands of}} Afro-Colombians being forcibly displaced from their homes, forcing them to be part of one of the largest groups of internalized refugees in the world. When modernity comes with such grave consequences, what is to be done? In this project, I investigate the forced displacement of Afro-Colombians on the Pacific coast of Colombia due to the encroachment of paramilitaries, who are operating in cooperation with the Colombian government, army, and multinationals in order to expand the production of <b>African</b> <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> plantations. While conducting ethnographic fieldwork in Bogotá during the summer of 2013, I focused on the following research question: In what ways does the history of racialized discourses against Afro-Colombian communities contribute to human rights violations in Colombia?

In fact, total FAs analysis showed significant differences between {{these two types of}} <b>oil,</b> with hybrid <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> having a higher percentage of oleic acid (54. 6 ± 1. 0 vs 41. 4 ± 0. 3), together with a lower saturated fatty acid content (33. 5 ± 0. 5 vs 47. 3 ± 0. 1), while the percentage of essential fatty acid, linoleic acid, does not undergo significant changes. Furthermore, 34 TAG types were identified, with no qualitative differences between African and E. guineensis × E. oleifera hybrid <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> samples. Short and medium chain FAs (8 : 0, 10 : 0, 12 : 0, 14 : 0) were utilised, together, to build a restricted number of TAG molecular species. Oil samples from the E. guineensis × E. oleifera hybrid showed higher contents of monosaturated TAGs (47. 5 - 51. 0 % vs 36. 7 - 37. 1 %) and triunsaturated TAGs (15. 5 - 15. 6 % vs 5. 2 - 5. 4 %). The sn- 2 position of TAGs in hybrid <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> was shown to be predominantly esterified with oleic acid (64. 7 - 66. 0 mol% vs 55. 1 - 58. 2 mol% in <b>African</b> <b>palm</b> <b>oil)</b> with only 10 - 15 % of total palmitic acid and 6 - 20 % of stearic acid acylated in the secondary position.

40|$|The {{extent of}} genetic {{diversity}} among 494 <b>oil</b> <b>palms</b> from 49 populations (representing ten African countries, three breeding materials, and one semi-wild material) were assessed using 16 SSR markers. The genetic diversity was high {{with a total}} of 209 alleles detected accounting for an average of 13. 1 alleles per locus and a mean expected heterozygosity of 0. 644. The average genetic distance among accessions was 0. 769, varying from 0. 000 to 1. 000. Both principal coordinates analysis and neighbor joining tree, confirmed by structure analysis, clustered the entire collections into three groups: the Extreme West Africa (EWA) group (collections from Senegal, Guinea, and Sierra Leone), the West, Central, and East Africa (WCEA) group (collections from Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Zaire, Angola, Tanzania, Bahia, the semi-wild material and the two Deli breeding materials) and the Madagascar group (collections uniquely from Madagascar). Madagascar populations were found to be genetically distinct from all other African populations. The influence of human and environmental factors might have {{played a major role in}} grouping the <b>African</b> natural <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> into three different groups as well as in the formation of a transition zone (formed by Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire). Further analysis of genetic structure revealed Deli materials as a distinct population within the WCEA group. Given the fact that accessions were exchanged between the EWA and WCEA groups, intra- and inter-group combinations for breeding should be based mainly on the genetic distance between accessions to increase yield and heterosis.
