Although some scientists considered this evidence for Lamarckian inheritance, the experiments were not Lamarckian, as they {{did not address the}} use and disuse of characteristics in response to the environment. The results from the experiment were not duplicated by other scientists.

50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century Brown-Séquard {{gave rise to}} much {{controversy}} {{in the case of}} supposed modification-inheritance by his experiments on guinea pigs. In a series of experiments extending over many years (1869 to 1891), he showed that a partial section of the spinal cord, or a section of the sciatic nerve, was followed after a few weeks by a peculiar morbid state resembling epilepsy. The offspring of the animals operated on were frequently decrepit, and a certain number showed a tendency to the so-called epilepsy. Although some scientists considered the experiments as evidence for Lamarckian inheritance, the experiments were not Lamarckian as Lamarck had rejected that this sort of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristic</b> was inherited as such experiments did not involve the use and disuse of characters in response to the environment.

40|$|AbstractShionone is {{the major}} triterpenoid {{component}} of Aster tataricus possessing a unique all six-membered tetracyclic skeleton and 3 -oxo- 4 -monomethyl structure. To clarify its biosynthetic process, an oxidosqualene cyclase cDNA was isolated from A. tataricus, and {{the function of the}} enzyme was determined in lanosterol synthase-deficient yeast. The cyclase yielded ca. 90 % shionone and small amounts of β-amyrin, friedelin, dammara- 20, 24 -dienol, and 4 -epishionone and was designated as a shionone synthase (SHS). Transcripts of SHS were detected in A. tataricus organs, confirming its involvement in shionone biosynthesis.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{wrapping}} process of magnet wire, as the haulage speed of master motor varies periodically, {{it is difficult}} for slave wrapping motor to track master motor due to the mechanical resonance, which destabilizes {{the wrapping}} pitch. In the proposed system, the synchronization speed control scheme of master-slave motor based on repetitive control compensation is employed. In the process of control, real-time spectrum analysis of the haulage speed is given, which can be used to adjust the parameters of wrapping speed controller adaptively with the <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristic</b> information of the mechanical resonant. Simulation shows that wrapping speed can track haulage speed well in the proposed system, and the maximum tracking synchronous deviation can be reduced to 56 % of that in the system without repetitive control...|$|E
40|$|Current {{evolutionary}} consensus, {{based on}} both molecular and morphological data, {{suggests that there}} are two broad subdivisions at the base of living birds (Neornithes), the neognaths (Neognathae) and palaeognathous birds (Palaeognathae). Palaeognaths are characterised by their primitive skull morphology and a secondarily <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristic</b> – flightlessness. The group, as traditionally defined and still recognised by phylogenetic analyses, includes flightless birds (ostrich, rhea, emu, cassowaries and kiwis) and flighted tinamous. Flightless forms are found today on the former landmasses of Gondwana, Africa, South America and Australia, whereas tinamous are restricted to South America. Traditionally, palaeognaths have been subdivided into ratites (all the large flightless groundbirds) and tinamous, although some data sets suggest that this classification might be overly simplistic: Recent molecular studies have concluded that the South American flighted taxa are nested within the traditional ratite grouping. This is interesting because it means that ratite flightlessness has evolved convergently at least four times. <br/...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of a population can be guided by phenotypic traits acquired by members of that population during their lifetime. This phenomenon, known as the Baldwin Effect, can speed the evolutionary process as traits that are initially acquired become genetically specified in later generations. This paper presents conditions under which this genetic assimilation can take place. As well as the benefits that lifetime adaptation can give a population, {{there may be a}} cost to be paid for that adaptive ability. It is the evolutionary trade-off between these costs and benefits that provides the selection pressure for acquired traits to become genetically specified. It is also noted that genotypic space, in which evolution operates, and phenotypic space, on which adaptive processes (such as learning) operate, are, in general, of a different nature. To guarantee an <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristic</b> can become genetically specified, then these spaces must have the property of neighbourhood correlation wh [...] ...|$|E
40|$|If, {{as first}} {{postulated}} by Burnet, tolerance to self-antigens is an <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the lymphoid system, then clones with anti-self recognition capability should arise during lymphopoiesis (1). In {{the absence of}} an efficient mechanism for inactivating such clones, autoimmunity would regularly be induced whenever any of these clonotypes achieved effector capacity. Three basic types of model for inactivating anti-self-reactive clones have been proposed to account for the relative infrequence of autoimmune events: clonal abortion, clonal deletion (2 - 12), and active suppression (13 - 22). All three models have found experimental support in the literature although the details of the intercellular and intracellular mechanisms by which they are presumed to operate still remain largely undefined. The theory of clonal abortion proposes that a phase in lymphocyte maturation exists when contact with antigen can only result in immunological paralysis (23). The early and continuous presence of self-antigens in appropriate concentrations would therefore ensure that clones having anti-self receptors would be permanently inactivated.

40|$|Numerous {{observations}} {{indicate a}} strong link between chronic inflammation and cancer. This link {{is supported by}} substantial experimental evidence indicating mutual negative regulation of NF-κB, the major regulator of inflammation, and p 53, the major tumor suppressor. This antagonistic relationship reflects the opposite principles of the physiological responses driven by these transcription factors, which act as sensors and mediators of intrinsic and extrinsic cell stresses, respectively. Constitutive activation of NF-κB, the underlying cause of chronic inflammation, is a common <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristic</b> of tumors. A variety of experimental methods {{have been used to}} demonstrate that constitutive activation of NF-κB reduces the tumor suppressor activity of p 53, thereby creating permissive conditions for dominant oncogene-mediated transformation. Loss of p 53 activity is also a characteristic of the majority of tumors and results in unleashed inflammatory responses due to loss of p 53 -mediated NF-κB suppression. On the other hand, in natural or pharmacological situations of enforced p 53 activation, NF-κB activity, inflammation, and immune responses are reduced, resulting in different pathologies. It is likely that the chronic inflammation that is commonly acquired in various tissues of older mammals leads to general suppression of p 53 function, which would explain the increased risk of cancer observed in aging animals and humans. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying reciprocal negative regulation of p 53 and NF-κB remain to be deciphered, this phenomenon has important implications for pharmacological prevention of cancer and aging and for new approaches to control inflammation...|$|E
