Variant 2c however has a unique pattern of <b>antigenicity.</b> This has led to claims of ineffective vaccination of dogs, but {{studies have shown that}} the existing CPV vaccines based on CPV type 2b, provide adequate levels of protection against CPV type 2c.|$|E
25|$|Tissue {{preparation}} or fixation {{is essential}} for the preservation of cell morphology and tissue architecture. Inappropriate or prolonged fixation may significantly diminish the antibody binding capability. Many antigens can be successfully demonstrated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. However, some antigens will not survive even moderate amounts of aldehyde fixation. Under these conditions, tissues should be rapidly fresh frozen in liquid nitrogen and cut with a cryostat. The disadvantages of frozen sections include poor morphology, poor resolution at higher magnifications, difficulty in cutting over paraffin sections, and the need for frozen storage. Alternatively, vibratome sections do not require the tissue to be processed through organic solvents or high heat, which can destroy the <b>antigenicity,</b> or disrupted by freeze thawing. The disadvantage of vibratome sections is that the sectioning process is slow and difficult with soft and poorly fixed tissues, and that chatter marks or vibratome lines are often apparent in the sections.|$|E

40|$|X-irradiation of C 57 BL/ 6 mice induces thymic lymphosarcomas which {{sometimes}} contain retroviruses which upon injection into normal mice mimic {{the effect of}} the irradiation. We examined whether specific <b>antigenicities,</b> viral or cellular, were expressed by tumour cells that could be recognized by antibodies from the irradiated animals. We developed monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) using splenocytes of the diseased animal. The reactivity of such MAbs towards thymoma cell lines established in vitro was investigated by means of an ELISA. At least 10 antibody specificities were detected on the 13 tumours investigated, allowing separation of the MAbs into three classes: (i) those recognizing the autologous tumour, heterologous tumours as well as normal thymic tissue, (ii) those specific for the autologous tumour, and (iii) those specific for one tumour, but not ones of autologous origin. The last two classes corresponded to specific tumour-associated antigens. Our panel of MAbs defined each tumour by the particular pattern of antigens harboured. It is striking that most of the antigens were present in the normal thymus and that only two tumours had additional <b>antigenicities.</b> Additionally, quantitative variations were observed in the levels of expression of these antigens...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenic}} yeast Candida albicans displays at its cell surface β- 1, 2 oligomannosides (β- 1, 2 -Mans). In {{contrast to}} the ubiquitous α-Mans, β- 1, 2 -Mans bind to galectin- 3, a major endogenous lectin expressed on epithelial cells. The specific role of β- 1, 2 -Mans in colonization of the gut by C. albicans was assessed in a mouse model. A selected virulent strain of C. albicans (expressing more β- 1, 2 -Man epitopes) induced more intense and sustained colonization than an avirulent strain (expressing less β- 1, 2 -Man epitopes). Synthetic (Σ) β-and α-linked tetramannosides with <b>antigenicities</b> that mimicked the <b>antigenicities</b> of C. albicans-derived oligomannosides were then constructed. Oral administration of Σβ- 1, 2 -Man (30 mg/kg of body weight) prior to inoculation with the virulent strain resulted in almost complete eradication of yeasts from stool samples, whereas administration of Σα-Man at the same dose did not. As most cases of human systemic candidiasis are endogenous in origin, this first demonstration that a synthetic analogue of a yeast adhesin can prevent yeast colonization in the gut opens the possibility of new prophylactic strategies...|$|R

30|$|A {{method for}} quickly {{screening}} and identifying dominant B cell epitopes was developed using hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen as a target. Eleven amino acid fragments from HBV surface antigen were synthesized by 9 -fluorenylmethoxy carbonyl solid-phase peptide synthesis strategy, and then CdTe quantum dots {{were used to}} label the N-terminals of all peptides. After optimizing the factors for fluorescence polarization (FP) immunoassay, the <b>antigenicities</b> of synthetic peptides were determined by analyzing the recognition and combination of peptides and standard antibody samples. The results of FP assays confirmed that 10 of 11 synthetic peptides have distinct <b>antigenicities.</b> In order to screen dominant antigenic peptides, the FP assays were carried out to investigate the antibodies against the 10 synthetic peptides of HBV surface antigen respectively in 159 samples of anti-HBV surface antigen-positive antiserum. The results showed that 3 of the 10 antigenic peptides may be immunodominant because the antibodies against them existed more widely among the samples and their antibody titers were {{higher than those of}} other peptides. Using three dominant antigenic peptides, 293 serum samples were detected for HBV infection by FP assays; the results showed that the antibody-positive ratio was 51.9 % and the sensitivity and specificity were 84.3 % and 98.2 %, respectively. In conclusion, a quantum dot-based FP assay is a very simple, rapid, and convenient method for determining immunodominant antigenic peptides and has great potential in applications such as epitope mapping, vaccine designing, or clinical disease diagnosis in the future.|$|R
