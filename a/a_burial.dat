5|$|During the 26th Dynasty (c. 685-525 BC) Userkaf's temple {{had become}} <b>a</b> <b>burial</b> ground: a large shaft tomb was dug in its midst thus {{rendering}} modern reconstruction of its layout difficult. This indicates {{that by the}} time of the Saite period, Userkaf's temple was already in ruins.|$|E
5|$|John III (died 1592), {{the second}} son of Gustav Vasa, {{and his second}} wife Gunilla Bielke are also buried in the Virgin Mary Chapel. His first wife, Catherine Jagiellon from Poland, has <b>a</b> <b>burial</b> chapel of her own {{on the north side}} of the chancel.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side lies the {{entrance}} to the underground chamber system, which was sealed by two granite portcullises indicating that <b>a</b> <b>burial</b> took place. A broken sarcophagus lid of blue-grey basalt was found in the burial chamber by Cecil Mallaby Firth during his brief excavations of the pyramid in 1930.|$|E

5|$|To the {{immediate}} south-west {{of the church}} building, St Botolph's Aldersgate owned an irregularly shaped churchyard enclosed by Aldersgate Street to the east, the Christ Church Greyfriars burial ground to the west, housing and the burial ground of St Leonard, Foster Lane, {{to the south and}} housing along Little Britain to the north. The churchyard was used as <b>a</b> <b>burial</b> ground and as a public open space. As with other City churchyards, as the amount of available burial space in London failed {{to keep pace with the}} growing population it came to be used exclusively as <b>a</b> <b>burial</b> ground.|$|E
5|$|A large tumulus of {{uncertain}} {{origin and}} purpose stands approximately {{in the middle}} of the excavated area, between the old and new parts of the city. Various theories have been advanced to explain it, such as that it was <b>a</b> <b>burial</b> site, a religious structure of some kind, a funerary monument or a monument to a Roman victory. However, these remain unproven hypotheses.|$|E

5|$|At {{an archaeological}} dig in the Ecuadorian highlands, two archaeologists, Dr. Bilac and Dr. Roosevelt, {{get into an}} {{argument}} over the removal of <b>a</b> <b>burial</b> urn that contains an Amaru, or a female shaman. Roosevelt argues that the urn must be taken from the site and preserved in a museum, much {{to the chagrin of}} Bilac and the tribespeople present. Later, a native shaman distributes Yaje to the local villagers and Bilac. During this ritual, a jaguar spirit kills Roosevelt in his tent.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, a safe was {{discovered}} during excavations of <b>a</b> <b>burial</b> trench at the Hanford nuclear site. Inside the safe were various items, including a large glass bottle containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently {{identified as the}} oldest sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist. Isotope analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory indicated that the plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge during 1944.|$|E

5|$|The Nineteenth Dynasty saw {{a further}} {{standardisation}} of tomb layout and decoration. The {{tomb of the}} first king of the dynasty, Ramesses I, was hurriedly finished due {{to the death of}} the king and {{is little more than a}} truncated descending corridor and <b>a</b> <b>burial</b> chamber. However, KV16 has vibrant decoration and still contains the sarcophagus of the king. Its central location makes it one of the more frequently visited tombs. It shows the development of the tomb entrance and passage and of decoration.|$|E

5|$|The {{continued}} growth of long-distance railway traffic {{led to a}} major expansion along the station's west side starting in 1887. The work involved rerouting Cardington Street over <b>a</b> <b>burial</b> ground; to avoid public outcry, the graves were re-interred at St Pancras Cemetery. Two extra platforms (Nos.4–5) opened in 1891, and four further departure platforms (now Nos.12–15) opened on 1 July 1892, bringing the total to fifteen, along with a separate booking office on Drummond Street.|$|E

These large settlements, one from the 6th-century Germanic Iron Age, the other from the Viking Age in the 9th to 11th centuries, evolved at the narrowest point on Limfjord {{as a result of the}} traffic between Himmerland to the south and Vendsyssel to the north.|$|E
