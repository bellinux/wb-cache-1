40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus is an autoimmune disease {{and can be}} associated with other autoimmune endocrine disorders and also with autoimmune impairment of a non-endocrine tissue. In this work we studied specific antibodies against islet antigens - glutamic acid decarboxylase, protein thyrosine phosphatase IA- 2 ?, against thyroid autoantigens - thyroid microsomal peroxidase, thyroglobulin, autoantigens of small bowel - endomysial autoantibodies, tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies, antibodies against gliadin in class IgA (AGA-IgA) and IgG (AGA-IgG), and adrenal <b>cortex</b> <b>antibodies</b> in a cohort of Type 1 diabetic patients.

Sixty-seven (0. 8 %) patients were ACA-positive, {{with the highest}} prevalence in those with premature ovarian failure (8. 9 %). Forty-eight ACA-positive and 20 ACAnegative individuals were enrolled into a prospective study.

40|$|The murine ZnT 3 gene was cloned {{by virtue}} of its {{homology}} to the ZnT 2 gene, which encodes a membrane protein that facilitates sequestration of zinc in endosomal vesicles. ZnT- 3 protein is predicted to have six transmembrane domains and shares 52 % amino acid identity with ZnT- 2, with the homology extending throughout the two sequences. Human ZnT- 3 cDNAs were also cloned; the amino acid sequence is 86 % identical to murine ZnT- 3. The mouse ZnT 3 gene has 8 exons and maps to chromosome 5. Northern blot and reverse transcriptase–PCR analyses demonstrate that murine ZnT- 3 expression is restricted to the brain and testis. In situ hybridization reveals that within the brain, ZnT- 3 mRNA is most abundant in the hippocampus and cerebral <b>cortex.</b> <b>Antibodies</b> raised against the C-terminal tail of mouse ZnT- 3 react with the projections from these neurons and produce a pattern similar to that obtained with Timm’s reaction, which reveals histochemically reactive zinc within synaptic vesicles.

40|$|Objective: Patients with {{autoimmune}} Addison’s disease (AAD) {{are prone}} to develop other autoimmune manifestations. An increased prevalence of celiac disease (CD) has recently been demonstrated in Northern European patients with AAD. IgA deficiency is the most frequent type of immunodeficiency among humans and is present in about one in every 600 individuals in the population. IgA deficiency is frequent in patients with other autoimmune diseases, but data concerning AAD are still unavailable. Design: The aim was to define the prevalence of CD and of IgA deficiency {{in a group of}} Italian patients with AAD. Methods: One hundred and nine patients with AAD were enrolled and examined for tissue transglu-taminase autoantibodies of the IgA class, circulating levels of IgA and adrenal <b>cortex</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Results: Two (1. 8 %) of the patients were affected by already diagnosed CD and were already on a gluten-free diet. Out of the remaining 107 patients, four (3. 7 %) were found to be positive for IgA anti-bodies to human tissue transglutaminase.

Here, we demonstrated the presence of two MAP 1 A isoforms with a differential spatial distribution in the adult mouse barrel <b>cortex.</b> <b>Antibody</b> A stained MAP 1 A in pyramidal and stellate cells, including dendrites that crossed layer IV in the septa between barrels. The other antibody, BW 6 recognized a MAP 1 A isoform that was mainly confined to the barrel hollow and identified smaller caliber dendrites. Previously, an interaction of MAP 1 A and the serotonin 5 -hydroxytryptamine 2 A (5 -HT(2 A)) receptor was shown in the rat cortex. Here, we identified, by double-immunofluorescent labeling, MAP 1 A isoform and serotonin 5 -HT(2 A) receptor distribution. MAP 1 A co-localized mainly with 5 -HT(2 A) receptor in larger apical dendrites situated in septa. This differential staining of MAP 1 A and a serotonin receptor in defined barrel compartments {{may be due to}} changes in the expression or processing of MAP 1 A during dendritic transport as a consequence of functional differences in processing of whisker-related sensory input...|$|R
40|$|Characterization and {{distribution}} of interstitial cell types in the renal cortex of rats. A precise classification of the cellular components of the cortical peritubular interstitium is missing {{in spite of its}} physiological and pathophysiological importance. By combining electronmicroscopy and immunohistochemistry we attempted to better identify and localize the different interstitial cell types in rat kidney, with special attention to the <b>cortex.</b> <b>Antibodies</b> against common leukocyte antigen (OX 1), a macrophage antigen (ED 2), MHC class II antigen (OX 6) and ecto- 5 ′-nucleotidase were applied to cryostat sections. The two latter antibodies were used additionally in electron microscopy. Four groups of cell types were identified that displayed distinct antigenic patterns, distributions and morphological features. They were identified as fibroblasts, dendritic cells, macrophages and lymphocytes. Fibroblasts and dendritic cells constituted the most abundant cell types in the cortex and outer medulla, and they were rather uniformly distributed in these zones throughout the peritubular interstitium, where macrophages were very scarce. The latter were abundant in the connective tissue of large vessels and of the pelvic wall. The incidence of lymphocytes was generally low. These data may be helpful on the one hand for the further phenotypic characterization of renal interstitial cells {{and on the other hand}} for the evaluation of the roles of those cells in pathological processes...|$|R
40|$|Glyoxylic acid is {{synthesized}} and catabolized {{in cells}} of vertebrates; several pathways have been described. In previous papers, we {{have demonstrated the}} localization {{in some areas of}} the rat cerebral cortex both of β-NAD-dependent glyoxylate dehydrogenase (glyoDH), using an enzymohistochemical method, and of glyoxylate-complex molecules, using immunocytochemical procedures. In this study we have applied these two techniques in various areas of the prefrontal cortex with different histological cytoarchitecture. GlyoDH has been located in most neurons, in some glial cells, and in capillary wall structures in all cortical layers of all areas of the rat prefrontal <b>cortex.</b> <b>Antibodies</b> against glyoxylate-complex molecules showed positive immunoreactivity in scattered neurons, mostly of multipolar or stellate appearance, from layers III, IV, and V in the medial precentral area, but not in cortical areas 24, 25, or 32 of the prefrontal cortex. Immunoreaction was found in the periphery of neuronal perikarya and in some of their processes. These results demonstrate the existence of a particular area-dependent neuronal cortical system, of specific but uncertain function, related to glyoxylic acid and/or glyoxylate compounds. At the electron microscope level, positive reaction was associated with synaptic sites, axonal filaments, glial cells, and several components of the blood- brain barrier. These localizations suggest the involvement of glyoxylate derivatives in synaptic functioning and also in glial cell functions. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss Inc. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPrimary Adrenocortical {{insufficiency}} (Addison's disease) is {{a potentially}} fatal condition that often develops incidentally {{and can be}} easily overlooked. Although rare in the general population, it {{is more common in}} patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 D). In this study, we reviewed our experience with the occurrence of associated adrenal insufficiency (AI) in children with T 1 D over 15 year's period at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaMethodsThis is a retrospective hospital based study, included children and adolescents with T 1 D at KKUH in the period January 1995 –December 2012. All patients were serologically screened for Celiac and thyroid diseases. Adrenal function was assessed at the time of diagnosis, and annually thereafter by measuring serum cortisol and adrenal corticotrophic hormone (ACTH) using the available commercial kit. Adrenal <b>cortex</b> <b>antibodies</b> (AAA) test was done by Bioscientia laboratory, Germany, in one patient. ResultsIn a cohort of 305 children and adolescents with T 1 D at KKUH, only one patient was found to have AI as a part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1. Thyroid functions were abnormal in 65 (21. 3 %) patients. Of these, 26 (8. 5 %) patients have evidence of overt hypothyroidism and 39 (12. 8 %) patients had subclinical hypothyroidism. In twenty-six patients (8. 5 %), the intestinal biopsy results were positive for CD. ConclusionThere is no international consensus on the issue of screening for AI in children with T 1 D. In our experience, we do not favour screening for AI in children with T 1 D unless there is a clear risk factor...|$|R

Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the clinical characteristics, coexisting diseases, presence of autoantibodies and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) in Estonian adult vitiligo patients. Methods:Adult patients with vitiligo were called to participate in the study at the Dermatology Department of Tartu University from January 2005 to July 2008. One hundred fifty five subjects were examined in 141 of those the level of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab), gastric parietal cell antibodies (PCA), antinuclear <b>antibodies</b> (ANA), anti-adrenal <b>cortex</b> <b>antibodies</b> (AAA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) in blood were measured. Results: Study group (mean age 44. 9 years, mean age of vitiligo onset 28. 5 years, mean duration of vitiligo 16. 9 years) consisted of 44 males and 111 females. Vitiligo vulgaris was the most common clinical type (81. 3 %), followed by acrofacial, focal, segmental and universal vitiligo. Two-thirds of subjects reported a coexisting disease and 36. 7 % had one or more disease of autoimmune origin. The presence of autoantibodies was established in 49. 6 %. TPO-Ab was found in 36. 9 %, PCA in 14. 2 %, ANA and AAA both in 2. 8 % and positive RF in 7. 8 % cases. 17 subjects had APS 3, 35 had subclinical APS 3 and two subjects had APS 4.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{were used to}} study the intrathymic distribution of T cell-specific antigens, Ia antigens, and beta 2 - microglobulin in frozen sections of human thymus by immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques. Most of the cortical thymocytes reacted with anti-T 4, anti-T 5, anti-T 6, anti-T 8, and anti-T 10 antibodies, thus indicating coexpression of multiple antigens on cortical lymphocytes. The staining of cells in the medulla was most satisfactorily judged in sections stained with the immunoperoxidase technique. Many medullary cells reacted with anti-T 4 [...] and a smaller fraction with anti-T 5, anti-T 6, anti-T 8, and anti-T 10 antibodies. In addition, T 1 and T 3 antibodies, which react with all peripheral T cells, stained a majority of medullary cells. The medullary cells were also more intensely stained with antibodies directed against beta 2 - microglobulin than the majority of cortical cells. Hence, the staining profile of medulla approximates the staining pattern of peripheral T cells, {{with large numbers of}} cells bearing T 1 +, T 3 +, and T 4 + antigens (helper/inducer cells) and a small number of cells bearing T 1 +, T 3 +, and T 5 +/T 8 + antigens (suppressor/cytotoxic cells). This supports the conclusion that mature cells present in the medulla are derived from immature cells in the cortex. However, a small number of cells scattered throughout the cortex stained with T 1 and T 3 antibodies, which suggests that maturation of thymocytes can also occur in the <b>cortex.</b> <b>Antibody</b> directed against Ia antigens resulted in a characteristic patchy pattern of staining in the cortex and in diffuse staining in the medulla, which was interpreted as resulting from staining of epithelial reticulum. The majority of thymocytes did not stain. The staining pattern suggests a close relationship between epithelial cells and thymocytes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Addison's disease (AD) {{is a rare}} {{endocrine}} condition. DESIGN: We {{aimed to}} evaluate clinical, immunologic, adrenal imaging, and genetic features in 633 Italian patients with AD followed up since 1967. METHODS: Adrenal cortex autoantibodies, presence of other autoimmune and nonautoimmune diseases, nonadrenal autoantibodies, adrenal imaging, and genetic profile for HLA-DRB 1 and AIRE were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 492 (77. 7 %) patients {{were found to be}} affected by autoimmune AD (A-AD), 57 (9 %) tuberculous AD, 29 (4. 6 %) genetic-associated AD, 10 (1. 6 %) adrenal cancer, six (0. 94 %) post-surgical AD, four (0. 6 %) vascular disorder-related AD, three (0. 5 %) post-infectious AD, and 32 (5. 1 %) were defined as idiopathic. Adrenal <b>cortex</b> <b>antibodies</b> were detected in the vast majority (88100 %) of patients with recent onset A-AD, but in none of those with nonautoimmune AD. Adrenal imaging revealed normal/atrophic glands in all A-AD patients: 88 % of patients with A-AD had other clinical or subclinical autoimmune diseases or were positive for nonadrenal autoantibodies. Based on the coexistence of other autoimmune disorders, 65. 6 % of patients with A-AD were found to have type 2 autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS 2), 14. 4 % have APS 1, and 8. 5 % have APS 4. Class II HLA alleles DRB 1 * 03 and DRB 1 * 04 were increased, and DRB 1 * 01, DRB 1 * 07, DRB 1 * 013 were reduced in APS 2 patients when compared with controls. Of the patients with APS 1, 96 % were revealed to have AIRE gene mutations. CONCLUSIONS: A-AD is the most prevalent form of adrenal insufficiency in Italy, and ∼ 90 % of the patients are adrenal autoantibody-positive at the onset. Assessment of patients with A-AD for the presence of other autoimmune diseases should be helpful in monitoring and diagnosing APS types 1, 2, or 4 and improving patients' care...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn amphibians, the {{cortical}} rotation, a translocation {{of the egg}} cortex {{relative to}} the cytoplasm, specifies the dorsoventral axis. The cortical rotation involves an array of subcortical microtubules whose alignment is mediated by Kinesin–related proteins (KRPs), and stops as M-phase promoting factor (MPF) activation propagates across the egg. To dissect the role of different motor proteins in the cortical rotation and to analyse their regulation, we have developed an open cell assay system involving reactivation of microtubule movement on isolated cortices. Microtubule movements were dependent on ATP and consisted mainly of wriggling and flailing without net displacement, consistent with a tethering of microtubules to the cortex. Reactivated movements were inhibited by anti-KRP and anti-dynein antibodies perfused together but not separately, the KRP antibody alone becoming fixed to the <b>cortex.</b> Neither <b>antibody</b> could inhibit movement {{in the presence of}} MPF, indicating that arrest of the cortical rotation is not due to MPF-dependent inhibition of motor molecules. In contrast, D 2 O treatment of live eggs to protect microtubules from progressive depolymerisation prolonged the cortical rotation. We conclude that the cortical rotation probably involves cytoplasmic dynein as well as cortical KRPs and terminates as a result of local MPF-dependent microtubule depolymerisation...|$|R

40|$|Alport {{syndrome}} {{is a common}} hereditary basement membrane disorder caused by mutations in the collagen IV α 3, α 4, or α 5 genes that results in progressive glomerular and interstitial renal disease. Interstitial monocytes that accumulate in the renal cortex from Alport mice are immunopositive for integrin α 1 β 1, while {{only a small fraction}} of circulating monocytes are immunopositive for this integrin. We surmised that such a disparity might be due to the selective recruitment of α 1 β 1 -positive monocytes. In this study, we report the identification of collagen XIII as a ligand that facilitates this selective recruitment of α 1 β 1 integrin-positive monocytes. Collagen XIII is absent in the vascular endothelium from normal renal cortex and abundant in Alport renal <b>cortex.</b> Neutralizing <b>antibodies</b> against the binding site in collagen XIII for α 1 β 1 integrin selectively block VLA 1 -positive monocyte migration in transwell assays. Injection of these antibodies into Alport mice slows monocyte recruitment and protects against renal fibrosis. Thus, the induction of collagen XIII in endothelial cells of Alport kidneys mediates the selective recruitment of α 1 β 1 integrin-positive monocytes and may potentially serve as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases in which lymphocyte/monocyte recruitment involves the interaction with α 1 β 1 integrin...|$|R

The purpose of the present study is to investigate whether melanopsin is also expressed in the other areas of the central visual system outside the retina. We have studied the distribution and morphology of neurons containing melanopsin in the mouse visual <b>cortex</b> with <b>antibody</b> immunocytochemistry. Melanopsin immunoreactivity was mostly present in neu-ronal soma, but not in nuclei. We found that melanopsin was present in a large subset of neurons within the adult mouse visual cortex with the highest density in layer II/III. In layer I of the visual cortex, melanopsin-immunoreactive (IR) neurons were rarely encountered. In the mouse visual cortex, the majority of the melanopsin-IR neurons consisted of round/oval cells, but was varied in morphology. Vertical fusiform and pyramidal cells were also rarely labeled with the anti-melanopsin antibody. The labeled cells did not show any distinctive distributional pattern. Some melanopsin-IR neurons in mouse visual cortex co-localized with nitricoxide synthase, calbindin and parvalbumin. Our data indicate that melanopsin is located in specific neurons and surprisingly widespread in visual cortex.

A thiazide sensitive Na-C 1 cotransporter, rTSC 1, {{has recently}} been cloned from a rat kidney cortex cDNA library. The molecular regulation and nephron localization of this protein is unknown. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the nephron distribution and subcellular localization of the rTSC 1 protein in the rat kidney. In situ hybridization showed rTSC 1 transcripts were localized to short, convoluted tubule segments in the kidney <b>cortex.</b> Polyclonal <b>antibodies</b> raised against a 110 amino acid segment from the amino terminus of rTSC 1 recognized three major bands of 135, 140 and 155 kDa on Western blotting of membrane protein from cortex but not outer medulla of the rat kidney. Immunofluorescence studies using the antibody alone and in double labeling experiments with antibodies against the H+ ATPase and calbindin D 28, showed intense labeling of apical membranes in the distal nephron beginning in the initial distal convoluted tubule and terminating within the connecting tubule. The intensity of labeling diminished from proximal to distal sites along the distal tubule. Ultrastructural studies by immunoelectron microscopy showed the cotransporter protein to be localized predominately on apical microvilli of the distal convoluted tubule cells.

Survey of various organs showed that the MoAb reacted with the brush border of the gut, but also with antigens associated with the distal vascular system. In the liver antigenic determinants were located along the sinusoid walls but mainly on bile canaliculi. Specific glomerular binding could be demonstrated in vivo by immunofluorescence after an intravenous injection of 2 mg of antibody or by paired label methodology using tracer amounts. Kinetics however were dramatically different from those observed in classical passive Heymann nephritis since glomerular binding was transient during the first hours after injection. Binding was also found in tubular structures, {{as well as in}} lung, liver, spleen and heart. These results identify a well defined antigen-antibody system responsible for the formation of transient extramembranous glomerular deposits and may be relevant to some human cases of glomerulonephritis.

40|$|The subunit {{composition}} of the AMPA receptor is critical to its function. AMPA receptors that display very low calcium permeability include the GluR 2 subunit, while AMPA receptors that contain other subunits, such as GluR 1, display high calcium permeability. We have studied the distribution and morphology of neurons containing GluR 1 in the hamster visual <b>cortex</b> with <b>antibody</b> immunocytochemistry. We compared this labeling to that for calbindin D 28 K, parvalbumin, and GABA. Anti-GluR 1 -immunoreactive (IR) neurons were located in all layers. The highest density of GluR 1 -IR neurons was found in layers II/III. The labeled neurons were non-pyramidal neurons, but were varied in morphology. The majority of the labeled neurons were round or oval cells. However, stellate, vertical fusiform, pyriform, and horizontal neurons were also labeled with the anti-GluR 1 antibody. Two-color immunofluorescence revealed {{that many of the}} GluR 1 -IR neurons in the hamster visual cortex were double-labeled with either calbindin D 28 K (31. 50 %), or parvalbumin (22. 91 %), or GABA (63. 89 %). These results indicate that neurons in the hamster visual cortex express GluR 1 differently according to different layers and selective cell types, and that many of the GluR 1 -IR neurons are limited to neurons that express calbindin D 28 K, parvalbumin, or GABA. The present study elucidates the neurochemical structure of GluR 1, a useful clue in understanding the differential vulnerability of GluR 1 -containing neurons with regard to calcium-dependent excitotoxic mechanisms...|$|R

To investigate to what extent calmodulin and the interaction between B- 50 and calmodulin are involved in the mechanism of Ca 2 +-induced noradrenaline release, we introduced polyclonal anti-calmodulin antibodies, calmodulin, and the calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine, W- 7, calmidazolium, and polymyxin B into streptolysin-O-permeated synaptosomes prepared from rat cerebral <b>cortex.</b> Anti-calmodulin <b>antibodies,</b> which inhibited Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II autophosphorylation and calcineurin phosphatase activity, decreased Ca 2 +-induced noradrenaline release from permeated synaptosomes. Exogenous calmodulin failed to modulate release, indicating that if calmodulin is required for vesicle fusion it is still present in sufficient amounts in permeated synaptosomes. Although trifluoperazine, W- 7, and calmidazolium inhibited Ca 2 +-induced release, they also strongly increased basal release. Polymyxin B potently inhibited Ca 2 +-induced noradrenaline release without affecting basal release. It is interesting that polymyxin B was also the only antagonist affecting the interaction between B- 50 and calmodulin, thus lending further support to the hypothesis that B- 50 serves as a local Ca 2 +-sensitive calmodulin store underneath the plasma membrane in the mechanism of neurotransmitter release. We conclude that calmodulin {{plays an important role in}} vesicular noradrenaline release, probably by activating Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent enzymes involved in the regulation of one or more steps in the release mechanism...|$|R

The authors cloned and sequenced a full-length cDNA encoding the beta-protein precursor (beta APP) of cynomolgus monkey. The predicted {{amino acid sequence}} of the 695 -residue protein is completely homologous to that of human. The alternatively transcribed exons encoding the Kunitz protease inhibitor region in monkey were cloned, showing only a single conservative amino acid substitution in the 751 -residue form of beta APP and four substitutions in beta APP 770. Immunoblots of cerebral <b>cortex</b> with <b>antibodies</b> to various beta APP domains showed highly similar beta APP polypeptides in human and monkey, in contrast to those of mouse and rat. The latter differences reflect sequence substitutions, transcriptional regulation, and possibly post-translational modifications that may decrease the amyloidogenic potential of rodent beta APP. Immunocytochemistry of aged cynomolgus brain showed A beta P deposited in blood vessels and diffuse and compacted plaques closely resembling those of humans, {{and the presence of}} beta-amyloid-associated proteins (alpha 1 -antichymotrypsin; complements C 1 q and C 3 c) characteristic of A beta P deposits in Alzheimer's disease.

This region of the brain {{is considered}} to be a major neural circadian pacemaker in mammals. The purpose of this study was to confirm that PER-like proteins are detectable in the SCN of female rats and to determine whether PER-like proteins exhibit a circadian rhythm. Female rats were killed at several times of day under both light/dark and constant conditions. Using the same anti-PER antibody in Western blots with Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Western-ECL) detection, the levels of the PER-like proteins were quantified in the SCN and cerebral <b>cortex.</b> The <b>antibody</b> identified a doublet band of approximately 170 - 160 kDa and a single band at 115 kDa. Of the three PER-like proteins only the largest exhibited a daily rhythm in the SCN, which peaked in the middle of the dark and attained its nadir around lights off; levels during the light were intermediate with a tendency towards a second drop around lights on. This rhythm did not persist under constant dim red light. The data demonstrate that an antigen similar to PER exhibits a daily rhythm in the pacemaker region of the rat brain and suggest that it may play a role in the maintenance of 24 -h rhythmicity in mammals...|$|R
40|$|Non-species isoform-specific {{antibodies}} against three isoforms of {{the plasma}} membrane Ca 2 + pump (PMCA) {{were used for}} immune-localization of PMCA by Western blot analysis in membrane preparations isolated from different regions of gerbil brain. All three gene products were detected in the membranes from hippocampus, cerebral cortex and cerebellum. However, they showed a distinct distribution pattern. Two proteins were revealed {{in the case of}} PMCA 1 with molecular masses 129 and 135 kDa. The antibody against PMCA 2 recognized three proteins of about 130 - 137 kDa. Only one protein was detected with the anti-PMCA 3 antibody. Levels of immune-signal for the PMCA isoforms varied significantly among the different brain regions. The PMCA 1 is the most abundant in the cerebro-cortical and hippocampal membrane preparations. The PMCA 2 was detected in a lesser amount comparing to PMCA 1 and was highest in the membrane preparations from cerebellum and in a slightly lesser amount from cerebral <b>cortex.</b> Anti-PMCA 3 <b>antibody</b> stained weakly and was localized in the cerebellar and hippocampal membrane preparations. Transient forebrain ischemia (10 min) and reperfusion (for a prolonged period up to 10 d) leads to a significant decrease of PMCA immune-signal. This decrease could be ascribed to the loss of PMCA 1 signal, especially in hippocampal membrane preparations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Renal {{inflammatory}} {{conditions are}} characterized by mononuclear cell recruitment to sites of inflammation. We have developed a modified Stamper-Woodruff assay system to analyze mechanisms of functional T cell adhesion to cryostat sections of renal biopsy material from patients with vasculitic glomerulonephritis (GN) and acute allograft rejection. Peripheral blood T cells adhered to intraglomerular, periglomerular, and tubulointerstitial regions of the <b>cortex.</b> Blocking monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> against tissue expressed ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, and the CS- 1 domain of fibronectin (CS- 1 Fn) differentially attenuated T cell adhesion. Glomerular adhesion in vasculitic GN and tubulointerstitial adhesion in acute rejection were particularly sensitive to both anti-ICAM- 1 and anti-VCAM- 1 antibodies, indicating a prominent role for ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 at glomerular sites in vasculitis and at tubulointerstitial sites in rejection. Furthermore, using KL/ 4 cells (LFA- 1 expressing) and Jurkat cells (VLA- 4 expressing), we demonstrated specific LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 - and VLA- 4 /VCAM- 1 -mediated interactions within glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments. Jurkat cells also adhered to VCAM- 1 -free sites, and binding was inhibitable by anti-CS- 1 Fn antibody, thereby demonstrating a role for VLA- 4 /fibronectin interactions especially at intraglomerular sites in acute rejection where VCAM- 1 is notably absent. We therefore propose a prominent functional role for ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, and CS- 1 domain fibronectin in T cell recruitment to the inflamed kidney...|$|R
40|$|Basophilic Inclusion Body Disease (BIBD) is a tau-negative form of frontotemporal lobar {{degeneration}} (FTLD), {{characterized by}} neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) that are visible on hematoxylin and eosin stain (HE), contain RNA, and are inconsistently ubiquitin-immunoreactive (ir). The normal nuclear expression of TDP- 43 is not altered. Here we investigate whether {{the distribution of}} the structurally and functionally related protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) is altered in BIBD. Mutations in the FUS gene have recently been identified as a cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In addition to these familial ALS cases, FUS protein has recently been demonstrated in NCI in a subset of FTLD with ubiquitinated inclusions (atypical FTLD-U) and in neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID). We examined seven BIBD brains of patients with average age at onset 46 (range 29 - 57) and average duration of disease 8 years (range 5 - 12). Three cases presented with the behavioural variant of fronto-temporal dementia (FTD-bv) and one with FTD-bv combined with severe dysarthria. All four developed motor neuron disease/ALS syndrome (MND/ALS) several years later. In the other three cases, presentation was predominantly with motor symptoms, construed as MND/ALS in two, and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in one. Severity of cortical degeneration varied, but all cases shared severe nigrostriatal atrophy and lower motor neuron pathology. In spared areas of <b>cortex,</b> FUS <b>antibodies</b> showed intense labelling of neuronal nuclei and weak positivity of cytoplasm, whereas, in affected areas, intense labelling of NCI was accompanied by reduction or disappearance of the normal IR pattern. The number of FUS-ir NCI was much greater than the number detected by HE or with ubiquitin or P 62 immunohistochemistry. FUS-ir glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI) were abundant in the grey and white matter in all cases, whereas neuronal intranuclear inclusions were rare and only seen in 2 / 7 cases. Thus, BIBD shares with atypical FTLD-U and NIFID the presence of FUS-ir NCI and GCI, and together comprise a new biochemical category of neurodegenerative disease (FUS proteinopathies). The consistent involvement of motorneurons in BIBD indicates that the association of FTLD and MND/ALS can occur on a FUS or TDP- 43 pathological substrate...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the outermost {{structure of the}} Bacillus subtilis spore, we analyzed the accessibility of anti-bodies to proteins on spores of B. subtilis. Anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibodies efficiently accessed GFP fused to CgeA or CotZ, which were previously assigned to the outermost layer termed the spore crust. However, anti-GFP antibodies did not bind to spores of strains expressing GFP fused to 14 outer coat, inner coat, or <b>cortex</b> proteins. Anti-CgeA <b>antibodies</b> bound to spores of wild-type and CgeA-GFP strains but not cgeA mutant spores. These {{results suggest that the}} spore crust covers the spore coat and is the externally exposed, outermost layer of the B. subtilis spore. We found that CotZ was essential for the spore crust to surround the spore but not for spore coat formation, indicating that CotZ plays a critical role in spore crust formation. In addition, we found that CotY-GFP was exposed {{on the surface of the}} spore, suggesting that CotY is an additional component of the spore crust. Moreover, the localization of CotY-GFP around the spore depended on CotZ, and CotY and CotZ depended on each other for spore assembly. Furthermore, a disruption of cotW affected the assembly of CotV-GFP, and a disruption of cotX affected the assembly of both CotV-GFP and CgeA-GFP. These results suggest that cgeA and genes in the cotVWXYZ cluster are involved in spore crust formation. The sporulation of Bacillus subtilis is initiated in response t...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) {{represents}} the deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in the meningeal and intracerebral vessels. It is often observed as an accompanying lesion of Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{or in the}} brain of elderly individuals {{even in the absence}} of dementia. CAA is largely age-dependent. In subjects with severe CAA a higher frequency of vascular lesions has been reported. The goal of our study was to define the frequency and distribution of CAA in a one-year autopsy population (91 cases) from the Department of Internal Medicine, Rehabilitation, and Geriatrics, Geneva. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five brain regions were examined, including the hippocampus, and the inferior temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital <b>cortex,</b> using an <b>antibody</b> against Abeta, and simultaneously assessing the severity of AD-type pathology with Braak stages for neurofibrillary tangles identified with an anti-tau antibody. In parallel, the relationships of CAA with vascular brain lesions were established. RESULTS: CAA was present in 53. 8 % of the studied population, even in cases without AD (50. 6 %). The strongest correlation was seen between CAA and age, followed by the severity of amyloid plaques deposition. Microinfarcts were more frequent in cases with CAA; however, our results did not confirm a correlation between these parameters. CONCLUSION: The present data show that CAA plays a role in the development of microvascular lesions in the aging brain, but cannot be considered as the most important factor in this vascular pathology, suggesting that other mechanisms also contributes importantly to the pathogenesis of microvascular changes...|$|R
40|$|A {{previously}} identified Tetrahymena thermophila actin gene (C. G. Cupples and R. E. Pearlman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83 : 5160 - 5164, 1986), here called ACT 1, was {{disrupted by}} insertion of a neo 3 cassette. Cells {{in which all}} expressed copies of this gene were disrupted exhibited intermittent and extremely slow motility and severely curtailed phagocytic uptake. Transformation of these cells with inducible genetic constructs that contained a normal ACT 1 gene restored motility. Use of an epitope-tagged construct permitted visualization of Act 1 p in the isolated axonemes of these rescued cells. In ACT 1 Δ mutant cells, ultrastructural abnormalities of outer doublet microtubules were present {{in some of the}} axonemes. Nonetheless, these cells were still able to assemble cilia after deciliation. The nearly paralyzed ACT 1 Δ cells completed cleavage furrowing normally, but the presumptive daughter cells often failed to separate from one another and later became reintegrated. Clonal analysis revealed that the cell cycle length of the ACT 1 Δ cells was approximately double that of wild-type controls. Clones could nonetheless be maintained for up to 15 successive fissions, suggesting that the ACT 1 gene is not essential for cell viability or growth. Examination of the cell <b>cortex</b> with monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> revealed that whereas elongation of ciliary rows and formation of oral structures were normal, the ciliary rows of reintegrated daughter cells became laterally displaced and sometimes rejoined indiscriminately across the former division furrow. We conclude that Act 1 p is required in Tetrahymena thermophila primarily for normal ciliary motility and for phagocytosis and secondarily for the final separation of daughter cells...|$|R
40|$|Expression of a {{monoclonal}} antibody (3 G 5) defined ganglioside antigen in the renal <b>cortex.</b> The monoclonal <b>antibody</b> (mAb) 3 G 5 was found, by indirect immunofluorescence, to bind to renal cortical structures in frozen sections of human, rat and calf kidneys. Double indirect immunofluorescence studies on frozen sections of rat kidneys showed that 3 G 5 stained only the glomerulus {{and the distribution}} of the 3 G 5 antigen on the glomerulus was more extensive than the staining observed with antibodies to Factor VIII antigen. 3 G 5 stained the proximal convoluted tubules and collecting tubules in bovine renal sections but glomeruli did not stain with 3 G 5. The 3 G 5 mAb did not stain tissue cultured bovine glomerular endothelial cells or mesangial cells, but did stain bovine glomerular epithelial cell cultures. 3 G 5 did not stain MDCK cell cultures. The binding of mAb 3 G 5 to glomeruli was investigated by immunoelectron microscopy of rat renal tissue. In contrast to the podocyte specificity on bovine glomerular cells in vitro, {{it was found that the}} specificity of 3 G 5 expression on rat glomerular cells in vivo was broader. No binding of mAb 3 G 5 was found outside the glomerulus in the rat renal cortex. Podocytes, endothelial cells and capsular epithelial cells expressed the 3 G 5 antigen most strongly. A lesser amount of binding was found in the glomerular basement membrane. The mesangium showed a little binding of mAb 3 G 5 and no binding at all was found to other cortical structures. The 3 G 5 antigen in rat renal tissue was found to be a glycolipid that migrated between the ganglioside markers GM 2 and GM 1 by immunostaining of thin layer chromatograms. The 3 G 5 mAb has previously been shown to react with microvascular pericytes, resting T-lymphocytes and cells of the brain, thyroid gland and adrenal gland as well as various malignancies. The significance of the tissue specific patterns of expression remains unclear and will be understood only when the function of this ganglioside is elucidated...|$|R
