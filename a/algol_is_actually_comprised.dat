Joel Stebbins at the University of Illinois Observatory used an early selenium cell photometer to produce the first-ever photoelectric study of a variable star. The light curve revealed the second minimum and the reflection effect between the two stars.Some difficulties in explaining the observed spectroscopic features led to the conjecture that a third star may be present in the system; four decades later this conjecture was found to be correct.|$|R

The twist number of the MFR is estimated to be T_w=- 1. 54 ± 0. 67.

The mechanism of this oscillation was determined; antagonist blocks an NR 2 C-like conductance that has low Mg block at resting potential {{and thus can}} contribute a resting inward current in response to ambient glutamate. Block of this current hyperpolarizes the cell, deinactivating T-type Ca channels and thus triggering delta frequency bursting. The basis for assuming a NR 2 C-like conductance was that (1) transcripts for NR 2 C are abundant in the thalamus and (2) the current-voltage curve of the synaptically evoked NMDAR current has the low rectification characteristic of NR 2 C.

40|$|Spatial {{variability}} in salt-affected fields is normally very high. Thus, most salinity affected lands <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> <b>comprised</b> of many micro-environments, ranging from low to high salinity {{in the same}} field. The evidence on testing genotypes across {{a broad range of}} salinity levels shows that the genotype-by-salinity level interaction is commonly large. Thus, breeding for saline areas can be compared to what has been known as breeding for 'wide adaptation'. The target environments both for breeding for saline soils or for wide adaptation <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> a population of many possible environments, for which there exists a significant component of genotype-by-environment(G x E) interaction. Thus it is possible to study the merit of potential strategies for breeding for salinity tolerance using the tools that have been developed for the study of breeding for wide adaptation. The evidence from selection and breeding experiments for wide adaptation seems to favour testing on a representative subset of environments, including stress and non-stress locations; but the choice of these locations is complicated by the multidimensional nature of G x E. However, in the case of salt stress, the crop-yield response functions to salinity are well known. This paper presents an attempt to systematise the choice of the optimum environment(s) to select for improved yield under saline soil conditions, based on the three-piece linear equation presented by Maas and Hoffman (1977) and the theory of direct and indirect responses to selection. It is proposed that three saline levels should be enough to make a valid estimation of the suitability of a number of selection strategies. A worked example with data from a set of grain sorghum inbred lines tested on ten saline levels shows that the same selection strategies would be chosen using the information from the ten saline levels as that obtained using the two extremes and one intermediate level. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

Various systems along with the people, policies, and processes used to provide services to travelers must be coordinated both inside and outside Boeing in order for overall travel operations to function properly. The intent of this project is to establish a systems-based architecture for Boeing's Next Generation Travel System. This thesis proposes re-designing the Boeing travel system using an enterprise architecting framework to select a future state architecture for a service organization. The analysis recommends a supplier integrated "off-the-shelf' software solution, employing the software as a service business model. Under this model the supplier is paid per transaction completed in the system; adoption of this metric aligns the system to reduce re-work costs, increase first-time pass quality, and improve usability. Additionally, new supplier software tools will allow the Boeing travel organization to transition from a process-focused to a more knowledge-focused service team. by Hector E. Silva. Thesis (M. B.

The present study aimed to use Diffusion Tensor tractography to subdivide the CB into its constituent sub-connections, and to investigate the structural integrity of these sub-connections in patients with schizophrenia and matched healthy controls. Diffusion Tensor Imaging scans were acquired from 24 patients diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia and 26 matched healthy controls. Deterministic tractography was used in conjunction with FreeSurfer-based regions-of-interest to subdivide the CB into 5 sub-connections (I 1 to I 5). The patients with schizophrenia exhibited subnormal levels of FA in two cingulum sub-connections, specifically the fibers connecting the rostral and caudal anterior cingulate gyrus (I 1) and the fibers connecting the isthmus of the cingulate with the parahippocampal cortex (I 4).

Low-resolution bilayer recordings of BPTI-induced substates display excess noise that is well described by a [3 -distribution characteristic of a filtered, two-state process. High-resolution patch recordings of maxi K(Ca) channels from vascular smooth muscle cells confirm that the BPTI-induced substate <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>comprised</b> of rapid, voltage-dependent transitions between the open state and a nearly closed state. Patch recordings of DTX-induced substates also exhibit excess noise consistent with a similar two-state fluctuation process that occurs at rates faster than those measured for the BPTI-induced substate. The results indicate that these examples of ligand-induced substates originate by a fluctuating barrier mechanism {{that is similar to}} one class of models proposed by Dani,J. A., andJ. A.

This simulation defines a range of transition rates relative to filter frequency where rapid fluctuations can lead to serious underestimation of actual unitary current levels.

40|$|To {{test the}} roles of motif and amino acid {{sequence}} in the folding mechanisms of TIM barrel proteins, hydrogen-deuterium exchange was used to explore {{the structure of the}} stable folding intermediates for the of indole- 3 -glycerol phosphate synthase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (sIGPS). Previous studies of the urea denaturation of sIGPS revealed the presence of an intermediate that is highly populated at approximately 4. 5 M urea and contains approximately 50 % of the secondary structure of the native (N) state. Kinetic studies showed that this apparent equilibrium intermediate <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>comprised</b> of two thermodynamically distinct species, I(a) and I(b). To probe the location of the secondary structure in this pair of stable on-pathway intermediates, the equilibrium unfolding process of sIGPS was monitored by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. The intact protein and pepsin-digested fragments were studied at various concentrations of urea by electrospray and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, respectively. Intact sIGPS strongly protects at least 54 amide protons from hydrogen-deuterium exchange in the intermediate states, demonstrating the presence of stable folded cores. When the protection patterns and the exchange mechanisms for the peptides are considered with the proposed folding mechanism, the results can be interpreted to define the structural boundaries of I(a) and I(b). Comparison of these results with previous hydrogen-deuterium exchange studies on another TIM barrel protein of low sequence identify, alpha-tryptophan synthase (alphaTS), indicates that the thermodynamic states corresponding to the folding intermediates are better conserved than their structures. Although the TIM barrel motif appears to define the basic features of the folding free energy surface, the structures of the partially folded states that appear during the folding reaction depend on the amino acid sequence. Markedly, the good correlation between the hydrogen-deuterium exchange patterns of sIGPS and alphaTS with the locations of hydrophobic clusters defined by isoleucine, leucine, and valine residues suggests that branch aliphatic side-chains {{play a critical role in}} defining the structures of the equilibrium intermediates...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 1998 I studied {{development}} and larval biology, host use, and gamete interactions in three obligately symbiotic polychaetes in the genus Arctonoe (Family Polynoidae). The three polychaetes are ectosymbionts of other marine invertebrates, {{and within the}} Puget Sound region, their host ranges do not overlap. Except for A. fragilis, which feeds on host tissue, they are probably commensals. The three species have similar ontogenies, with long-lived planktotrophic larvae; benthic juveniles seek out hosts soon after metamorphosis. Surveys of allozyme variation confirmed that the three Arctonoe species were genetically distinct. Populations of A. pulchra on two host species were also strongly differentiated, and should be considered distinct species. Populations of A. vittata associated with three host species were weakly differentiated {{in one of two}} years. Thus, some "host generalists" <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> <b>comprised</b> of isolated lineages of host specialists. I used transplant experiments to examine the role of physiological incompatibilities in restricting symbiont host range. A. pulchra and A. vittata died when paired with the seastar Evasterias troschelii, the principal host of A. fragilis. In other combinations of symbionts and hosts tested, all symbionts survived. While these incompatibilities can partially explain observed patterns of host use in Arctonoe, other processes must also be operating. Gamete incompatibilities among closely-related species may be a consequence of divergence at gamete recognition loci as a by-product of reproductive isolation, selection against hybrids, or a process of sexual selection at polymorphic gamete recognition loci. The first two hypotheses predict that gamete incompatibility appears after reproductive isolation has arisen, and the third that incompatibility appears simultaneously with isolation. Gametes of Arctonoe spp. are compatible in all crosses, over a range of concentrations and contact times, despite estimated divergence times of 1 - 3 million years before present. These data are consistent with the first two hypotheses but allow rejection of the third. Another common pattern in interspecific gamete interactions is asymmetric gamete compatibility. I use a simple genetic model to show that such asymmetries are predictable, but temporary, consequences of divergence between isolated populations...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This thesis formulates a model for explaining stylistic, functional, and compositional diversity in ceramic artifacts produced during the contact period (A. D. 1590 - 1700) of northern New England. The seventeenth century saw dramatic increases in internecine warfare among New England's indigenous populations and with European colonists. Additionally, introductions of epidemic and endemic disease decimated the native population by well over half within less than 100 years. Individuals and families responded to the rapid social change of this time by fleeing high-stress areas and joining communities perceived to be more stable. A model for detecting this refugee movement is proposed and evaluated using a sample of archaeological pottery from Fort Hill (27 CH 85), in Hinsdale, New Hampshire. Hypotheses comprising this model propose that amalgamations of refugees may be detectable within the archaeological record through the appearance of greater diversity in stylistic elements and decreased variability in functional traits. Analyses of the Fort Hill assemblage support the hypothesis that multiple ethnic groups were present at Fort Hill, despite the fact that European chroniclers used a single tribal name to refer to the Native Americans who lived at the site. These findings suggest that archaeologists and anthropologists must consider that social groups mentioned in historical accounts <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> <b>comprised</b> of multiple ethnic groups, and that the material record of contact period Native Americans may reflect processes of cultural amalgamation of small groups of refugees rather than stable communities of unified ethnic affiliation...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Type I Diabetes (TID) is a devastating autoimmune disorder in which autoreactive T cells attack the insulin-producing [beta] cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans and control of blood glucose levels is lost. A therapy that could target the autoreactive immune cells and prevent the destruction of the [beta] cells could circumvent the complications of exogenous insulin therapy and reduce the burden on diabetic patients. In this research, we describe an immunogenic compound, Ig [...] GAD 1, that is able to protect against TID in a mouse model of disease. When administered to mice, Ig [...] GAD 1 binds to Fc[gamma]RIIB on CD 8 [...] CD 4 [...] CD 11 c+ Dendritic Cells (DC), which then produce IL [...] 10 and expand Regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs in our model of diabetes <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> <b>comprised</b> of two types: FoxP 3 hi and FoxP 3 int, named for their level of expression of the canonical FoxP 3 transcription factor. When IL [...] 10 is produced, Tregs are expanded and the FoxP 3 int population, which highly expresses the suppressive protein TGF[beta], traffics to the pancreas using CD 62 L and protects against TID. Intriguingly, this FoxP 3 int population also expresses ROR[gamma]t, the canonical transcription factor for Th 17 pathogenic cells. This implies that transitional T cells are not only plastic, as has been described, but functional. Mice treated with Ig [...] GAD 1 {{at a very early age}} were protected from TID through week 26 through this mechanism, highlighting the effectiveness of therapies targeted against the autoreactive immune system...|$|R
