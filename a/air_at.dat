5|$|The metal {{takes on}} a bluish tinge when exposed to <b>air</b> <b>at</b> room {{temperature}} for extended periods.

Furthermore, it is corrosion-resistant, exhibits superconductivity properties, and forms dielectric oxide layers.|$|E
5|$|Actinium trifluoride can be {{produced}} either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding hydrofluoric acid to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700°C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900–1000°C yields oxyfluoride AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in <b>air</b> <b>at</b> 800°C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.|$|E
