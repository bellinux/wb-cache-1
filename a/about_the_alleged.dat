5|$|On September 23, 2007, however, he tore {{his right}} ACL while being {{restrained}} by Padres manager Bud Black during an altercation with first base umpire Mike Winters. Home plate umpire Brian Runge reportedly told Bradley that Winters {{said that he}} had tossed his bat in Runge's direction in a previous at-bat. After Bradley reached first base, he questioned Winters <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> bat throwing and subsequent communication with Runge. According to Bradley and Padres first base coach Bobby Meacham, Winters addressed Bradley with a barrage of profanity. Bradley then moved towards Winters. While restrained by Black, Bradley fell to the ground and injured himself. He missed the final week of the regular season in 2007, during which the Padres lost to the Colorado Rockies in a one game playoff for the National League wild card on October 1.|$|E

25|$|As {{word spread}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> rape, an angry crowd of whites {{gathered}} at the county jail in Tavares, demanding that McCall turn the suspects over to them for lynching.

25|$|Normally {{a routine}} process, McChrystal's Senate {{confirmation}} was stalled {{by members of}} the Senate Armed Services Committee who sought more information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> mistreatment of detainees by Special Operations troops under McChrystal's command in Iraq and Afghanistan. After meeting with McChrystal in private, the Senate Armed Services Committee confirmed his reappointment as lieutenant general in May 2008 and he became Director of the Joint Staff in August 2008.|$|E

25|$|Tutankhamun was the 11th pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom of Egypt, {{making his}} mummy over 3,300 years old. The {{discovery}} of the tomb {{as a whole was}} one of the most significant and famous archeological discoveries in modern times. There has been great speculation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> Curse of the Pharaohs and also the actual cause of death of King Tutankhamun since very little information about the young king is known.|$|E
25|$|Heinrich Göbel in 1893 {{claimed he}} had {{designed}} the first incandescent light bulb in 1854, with a thin carbonized bamboo filament of high resistance, platinum lead-in wires in an all-glass envelope, and a high vacuum. Judges of four courts raised doubts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> Göbel anticipation, {{but there was never}} a decision in a final hearing due to the expiry date of Edison's patent. A research work published 2007 concluded that the story of the Göbel lamps in the 1850s is a legend.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the many}} other {{allegations}} against Cosby, the earliest date claimed was December 1965; Kristina Ruehli accused Cosby of drugging and assaulting her in his Beverly Hills home on that date. Ruehli alleged that at the time, she told her boyfriend about the incident, and also claimed that she later told her daughter <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> encounter in the 1980s. However, she did not speak about it in public until 2005, when she came forward in the Andrea Constand case as Jane Doe #12.|$|E
50|$|Second, Tsatsarov charged Vassilev with {{criminal}} embezzlement, saying that Vassilev stole {{large amounts of}} money from his bank.

The accusations “had no merit or evidentiary support”, according to CISTRAN Finance.|$|R
5000|$|Historians {{disagree}} <b>about</b> whether <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> bias {{shown to}} Cribb {{was motivated by}} racism, nationalism or fears {{on the part of}} Cribb backers that they would lose their wagers. Certainly, before the fight there was nervousness <b>about</b> <b>the</b> prospect of a Molineaux victory, with the Chester Chronicle claiming that [...] "many of the noble patronizers sic of this accomplished art, begin to be alarmed, lest, to the eternal dishonour of our country, a negro should become the Champion of England!" ...|$|R

25|$|Finally, the {{defendants}} claimed the affirmative defense of laches, asserting that Steinberg had waited over {{six months to}} complain to Columbia Pictures <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> infringement {{in order to increase}} his award in the eventual lawsuit. The court dismissed this allegation on the grounds that Steinberg had registered his complaint with {{the defendants}} within weeks of beginning their advertising campaign, and that a six-month delay between publication of the allegedly infringing work and instigation of a lawsuit was not sufficient to establish a claim of laches.|$|E
25|$|Loose Change 9/11: An American Coup was the 2009 edition {{that was}} written, directed, and edited by Dylan Avery. Unlike the {{previous}} editions, this was narrated by actor Daniel Sunjata (who shares the same beliefs of this film). Original music was composed by Mic Cartier and the music/score used in previous versions were not used. This version {{started with a}} history of false flag operations. The graphics, interviews, and footage were changed and updated. There were interviews with Stephen Jones <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> nano-thermite residue found at the bottom of World Trade Centers 1, 2, and 7.|$|E
25|$|The issue gained greater {{attention}} when Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak dodged questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> abduction of Manohara by the Malaysian prince as he met Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in Jakarta on 23 April 2009. The {{mother of the}} missing model {{held a press conference}} at the National Commission on Violence Against Women in Jakarta. She complained that Malaysian authorities had stopped her going to Malaysia to check on her daughter's condition. The circumstances have been compared to the case of Altantuya Shaariibu. The Indonesian government demanded an explanation from the Malaysian government as to why an Indonesian woman was denied entry to see her daughter amid claims of abuse by her husband of Malaysian royalty.|$|E

50|$|The Adagio in G minor for violin, strings, and organ continuo is a neo-Baroque {{composition}} popularly {{attributed to}} the 18th-century Venetian master Tomaso Albinoni, but actually composed by 20th-century musicologist and Albinoni biographer Remo Giazotto, purportedly based on {{the discovery of a}} manuscript fragment by Albinoni. There is a continuing scholarly debate <b>about</b> whether <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> fragment was real, or a musical hoax perpetrated by Giazotto, but {{there is no doubt about}} Giazotto's authorship of the remainder of the work.|$|R
25|$|Concerns about {{immunization}} safety often {{follow a}} pattern. First, some investigators {{suggest that a}} medical condition of increasing prevalence or unknown cause is an adverse effect of vaccination. The initial study and subsequent studies by the same group have inadequate methodology—typically a poorly controlled or uncontrolled case series. A premature announcement is made <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> adverse effect, resonating with individuals suffering from the condition, and underestimating the potential harm of forgoing vaccination to those whom the vaccine could protect. Other groups attempt to replicate the initial study but fail {{to get the same}} results. Finally, it takes several years to regain public confidence in the vaccine. Adverse effects ascribed to vaccines typically have an unknown origin, an increasing incidence, some biological plausibility, occurrences close to the time of vaccination, and dreaded outcomes. In almost all cases, the public health effect is limited by cultural boundaries: English speakers worry about one vaccine causing autism, while French speakers worry about another vaccine causing multiple sclerosis, and Nigerians worry that a third vaccine causes infertility.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts, King played then-BDO player John Henderson in {{his last}} group game. Despite winning the game 5–4, he {{exchanged}} heated words with Henderson {{towards the end of}} the match and was visibly unhappy. Whilst refusing to reveal the precise reason to his actions, it was understood through television analysis that King felt Henderson, after having to move across the oche for a better shot with his third dart, had stepped across the oche line and thrown from a closer distance to the board, thus believing he had gained an unfair advantage. It was also discovered that King had complained to the match referee, George Noble, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> infringement. Many pundits, most notably Chris Mason, pointed out that Henderson rarely checks his standing position before throwing, and publicly criticised King for insinuating that Henderson cheated. However, two days later King admitted that he had overreacted after watching the match again on television and apologised to Henderson during a pre-match interview. King was booed by the crowd while attempting to hit a double four to win in the deciding leg of the second round match against James Wade; he failed, and lost.|$|E
25|$|Al-Fayed first {{claimed that}} the Princess was {{pregnant}} to the Daily Express in May 2001, {{and that he was}} the only person who had been told of this news. Witnesses at the inquest who said the Princess was not pregnant, and could not have been, were part of the conspiracy according to Al-Fayed. Fayed's testimony at the inquest was roundly condemned in the press as being farcical. Members of the British Government's Intelligence and Security Committee accused Fayed of turning the inquest into a 'circus' and called for it to be ended maturely. Lawyers representing Al-Fayed later accepted at the inquest that there was no direct evidence that either the Duke of Edinburgh or MI6, had been involved in any murder conspiracy involving Diana or Dodi. A few days before Al-Fayed's appearance, John Macnamara, a former senior detective at Scotland Yard and Al-Fayed's investigator for five years from 1997, was forced to admit on 14 February 2008 that he had no evidence to suggest foul play, except for the assertions Al-Fayed had made to him. His admissions also related to the lack of evidence for Al-Fayed's claims <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> pregnancy of the Princess and the couple's supposed engagement.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2015, The Globe and Mail {{revealed}} that Canadian intelligence officials suspected Chan {{was under the}} [...] "undue influence" [...] {{of the government of}} China, prompting CSIS to formally caution <b>the</b> province <b>about</b> <b>the</b> minister’s <b>alleged</b> conduct in a 2010 briefing.

50|$|On {{leaving the}} army, to {{enable him to}} {{continue}} his work with the trade union, he joined a subsidiary of ITT Corporation because it gave him time {{to sit on a}} Dutch state committee to reform the army.

5000|$|Following {{the recall}} vote, Súmate {{requested}} that Ricardo Hausmann of Harvard University and Roberto Rigobón of MIT perform a statistical analysis analyzing how fraud could have {{occurred during the}} referendum.

25|$|Stravinsky proved {{adept at}} playing {{the part of}} a 'man of the world', {{acquiring}} a keen instinct for business matters and appearing relaxed and comfortable in public. His successful career as a pianist and conductor took him to many of the world's major cities, including Paris, Venice, Berlin, London, Amsterdam and New York and he was known for his polite, courteous and helpful manner. Stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer and was rumoured to have had affairs with high-profile partners, such as Coco Chanel. He never referred to it himself, but Chanel spoke <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> affair at length to her biographer Paul Morand in 1946; the conversation was published thirty years later. The accuracy of Chanel's claims has been disputed by both Stravinsky's widow, Vera, and by Craft. Chanel's fashion house avers {{there is no evidence that}} any affair between Chanel and Stravinsky ever occurred. A fictionalization of the supposed affair formed the basis of the novel Coco and Igor (2002) and a film, Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky (2009). Despite these alleged liaisons, Stravinsky was considered a family man and devoted to his children.|$|E

500|$|The Atomic Energy Commission {{decided that}} the {{implosion}} concept could be declassified for the trial, and limited all discussion to the weapons used in World War II (fearing that Greenglass may have seen prototypes for future weapons while at Los Alamos). As {{a result of a}} surprise defense motion that all testimony <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleged</b> [...] "secret of the atomic bomb" [...] be impounded, Federal Judge Irving Kaufman at first made all spectators and news reporters leave the room when Greenglass began testifying about his [...] "secrets".|$|E
