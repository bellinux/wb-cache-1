5|$|It is each shooter's {{responsibility}} {{to get the}} pistol <b>and</b> <b>shoes</b> validated in a specific area, the equipment control, prior to starting the competition. Clothing is only inspected during the actual competition. To discourage shooters from lowering the trigger pull weight after passing the equipment control, random controls are conducted after the match with failure resulting in immediate disqualification.|$|E

5|$|As {{in other}} ISSF pistol events, special {{supportive}} clothing <b>and</b> <b>shoes</b> are not permitted. Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not mounted on the pistol, which may only have open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF as well as by coaches, who sometimes stress their usefulness in shutting out distracting noise rather than their necessity for safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E

5|$|Besides {{farming and}} its {{associated}} industries, including making cider, cheese and yoghurt, and peat extraction, the county has little industry. It {{has been involved in}} the manufacture of helicopters, some heavy industries related to defence, quarrying and the mining of gravels and sands, brick-making and tile-making, and the manufacture of slippers, boots <b>and</b> <b>shoes,</b> but many of these industries have declined. Tourism {{is one of the main}} sources of income.|$|E
5|$|Each {{apprentice}} was to {{be given}} two sets of clothing, suitable linen, stockings, hats, <b>and</b> <b>shoes,</b> and a new set each year thereafter. Working hours were limited to 12 hours a day, excluding the time taken for breaks. Apprentices were no longer permitted to work during the night (between 9 pm and 6 am). A grace period was provided to allow factories time to adjust, but all night-time working by apprentices {{was to be}} discontinued by June 1804.|$|E
5|$|In the Northover {{district}} {{industrial production}} of sheepskins, woollen slippers and, later, boots <b>and</b> <b>shoes,</b> developed {{in conjunction with}} the growth of C Clark in Street. Clarks still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there.

5|$|Leonardo's {{notes and}} {{drawings}} display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations, some as mundane as lists of groceries {{and people who}} owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings <b>and</b> <b>shoes</b> for walking on water. There are compositions for paintings, studies of details and drapery, studies of faces and emotions, of animals, babies, dissections, plant studies, rock formations, whirlpools, war machines, flying machines and architecture.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia ants are {{frequently}} encountered by humans, and avoiding them is difficult. Wearing closed footwear such as boots <b>and</b> <b>shoes</b> {{can reduce the}} risk of getting stung; these ants are capable of stinging through fabric, however. A risk of being stung while gardening also exists; most stings occur when someone is gardening and is unaware of the ants' presence. Eliminating nearby nests or moving to areas with low Myrmecia populations significantly decreases the chances of getting stung.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 1947, the Polish {{government}} {{passed a}} law, establishing a state {{memorial to the}} victims of Nazism {{on the site of the}} camp. In 1955, an exhibition opened, displaying prisoner mug shots; hair, suitcases, <b>and</b> <b>shoes</b> taken from murdered prisoners; canisters of Zyklon B pellets; and other objects related to the killings. UNESCO added the camp to its list of World Heritage Sites in 1979. In 2011, the museum drew 1,400,000 visitors.|$|E

5|$|The Society of Friends {{established}} itself {{here in the}} mid-17th century, {{and among}} the close-knit group of Quaker families were the Clarks: Cyrus Clark started a business in sheepskin rugs, later joined by his brother James, who introduced the production of woollen slippers and then boots <b>and</b> <b>shoes.</b> Under James's son, William, the business flourished, {{but most of the}} profits were ploughed back into employee welfare, housing and education.|$|E

5|$|Toy Story {{had a large}} {{promotion}} {{before its}} release, leading to numerous tie-ins with the film including images on food packaging. A variety of merchandise was released during the film's theatrical run and its initial VHS release including toys, clothing, <b>and</b> <b>shoes,</b> among other things. When an action figure for Buzz Lightyear and Sheriff Woody was created it was initially ignored by retailers. However, after over 250,000 figures were sold for each character before the film's release, demand continued to expand, eventually reaching over 25million units sold by 2007.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves <b>and</b> <b>shoes</b> while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E

5|$|A second {{mandatory}} {{roll call}} {{took place in}} the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes <b>and</b> <b>shoes</b> to prevent them from being stolen.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} left Plateros at 22:30 to trek back towards American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners. The majority of the prisoners {{had little or no}} clothing <b>and</b> <b>shoes,</b> and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk. When the group reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50carts. Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced the speed of the return trip. By the time the group reached American lines, 106carts were being used.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} kept as pets, cats are also used in the {{international}} fur and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets and stuffed toys; <b>and</b> <b>shoes,</b> gloves and musical instruments respectively (about 24 cats are {{needed to make a}} cat fur coat). This use has now been outlawed in the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism. In the Western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.|$|E
