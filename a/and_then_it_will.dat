25|$|There are lobes on {{each side}} of the frontal part of the foot and there is also a lobe with {{operculum}} on the foot.

60|$|Brown Paper.--Brown {{paper is}} an {{excellent}} non-conductor of heat and excluder of draughts: English cottagers often enclose sheets of it within their quilted counterpanes. If thoroughly soaked <b>and</b> <b>then</b> dried, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not crackle.|$|R

2500|$|Later, {{after meeting}} with PM Netanyahu, Ya'alon {{retracted}} parts of his statements {{and said that he}} [...] "recognized the importance of democratic discourse and respecting other opinions." [...] Ya'alon explained that, indeed, all Israelis want peace, now. He stressed, however, the need {{to accept the fact that}} peace will not come immediately, otherwise it [...] "hurts Israel." [...] Ya'alon stated that, in his view, the way of thinking that Israel just needs to give one more piece of land <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> have peace is a kind of [...] "virus." ...|$|E
