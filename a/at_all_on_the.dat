5|$|The courts {{recognise}} {{two forms}} of secret trust. Fully secret trusts are trusts not referred to <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face of the will. Instead, an agreement made between the testator and trustees elsewhere. The trustee will instead be named only a beneficiary. In {{the case of a}} half-secret trust, the fact that the beneficiary holds as trustee only is declared {{on the face of the}} will, but not the other terms of the trust.|$|E
5|$|However, a close {{examination}} of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the grooves {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, a {{large portion}} of the highway was removed from the state highway system. On October 19, 1937, between the SH-9 junction and US-66, the route ceased to be maintained by the Department of Highways. SH-30 still appeared as such on the 1938 state highway map, but with dashed lines, indicating the route was not maintained. By the 1940 edition, SH-30 was not marked <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> map between just north of SH-9 to US-66 west of Erick. As a result, SH-30 was effectively in two sections, one running from Hollis to SH-9, and another between Erick and Sweetwater.|$|E

25|$|Young {{was awarded}} a benefit match in the 1930 season, and picked the game against Sussex at Bath: rain {{interfered}} badly with play on the Saturday, delayed the resumption on Monday until mid-afternoon, and then prevented any play <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Tuesday.

25|$|Additionally, the Mordechai (Pesachim 107) quotes {{the ruling}} of his {{father-in-law}} Rabbeinu Yechiel that firstborns need not fast <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day before Passover; firstborns need only limit their diet to snacks. (The Bigdei Yesha commentary suggests {{the rationale behind}} this ruling was to avoid holding a fast {{during the month of}} Nisan, which is generally prohibited.)

Cecil Holden made 86 for Liverpool but Tommie Burton and Cox took 5 wickets each to give the tourists a first innings lead of 47.

25|$|The field between Kirkmuir & Righead {{was known}} as Lady Moss Meadow. Righead was a tollhouse at a later stage, however it was built as a 'butt and ben'. Skirmshaw {{is the name of}} some fields nearby in 1797, {{although}} no building appears to be present at that time. Picken's (formerly Padzean) Park was across the road from Righead, behind the estate tree boundary. Picken (Padzean) is a fairly common local name (see Kirkhill). Millstone Flat Park is the field above the chalybeate spring on its side of the Ha Ha.through Lady Moss Meadow Kirkmuir was originally a farm on the Longridge Plantation near Highcross Farm (Thomson 1832), later becoming Little Kirkmuir and being marked but not named by 1895, before ceasing to be recorded <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> OS maps by 1921.|$|E
25|$|In {{a highly}} publicized {{experiment}} in 2012, researchers claimed to have identified the path each particle had taken without any adverse effects <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> interference pattern generated by the particles. In order to do this, they used a setup such that particles coming to the screen were not from a point-like source, but from a source with two intensity maxima. However, commentators such as Svensson {{have pointed out that}} there is in fact no conflict between the weak measurements performed in this variant of the double-slit experiment and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Weak measurement followed by post-selection did not allow simultaneous position and momentum measurements for each individual particle, but rather allowed measurement of the average trajectory of the particles that arrived at different positions. In other words, the experimenters were creating a statistical map of the full trajectory landscape.|$|E

25|$|The GT variant {{kept the}} twin driving lights, but reverted to a bonnet {{blackout}} with no stripes <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. The front guards received fake 'vents' {{just behind the}} indicators, and NACA ducts {{were added to the}} bonnet. Steel 12-slot wheels were reintroduced, although some GTs received the five-spoke Globe 'Bathurst' wheels, which had been ordered for the GT-HO Phase IV and now needed to be used. The GT's rear suspension featured radius rods to help locate the elliptical-spring solid rear axle. Other performance parts from the aborted Phase IV found their way onto GTs, including larger fuel tanks and winged sumps. These GTs are generally referred to as RPO83s after the option code covering the additional parts, although what parts any given RPO83 received seem to have been governed by the luck of the draw rather than any specific process.|$|E
25|$|Evaluation of {{numerous}} public health interventions has generally shown that improvement in each individual component ordinarily attributed to poverty (for example, sanitation, health education and underlying nutrition status) often have minimal impact on transmission. For example, {{one study found}} that the introduction of latrines into a resource-limited community only reduced the prevalence of hookworm infection by four percent. However, another study in Salvador, Brazil found that improved drainage and sewerage had a significant impact (p<0.0001) on the prevalence of hookworm infection but no impact <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> intensity of hookworm infection. This seems to suggest that environmental control alone has a limited but incomplete effect on the transmission of hookworms. It is imperative, therefore, that more research is performed to understand the efficacy and sustainability of integrated programs that combine numerous preventive methods including education, sanitation, and treatment.|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} to completely eliminate errors in the detector and meter if a precision variable attenuator {{is used in the}} test setup.
