30|$|We {{retrospectively}} {{analyzed the}} clinical data {{of patients with}} acute ischemic stroke who received intravenous tPA treatment at a Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (there are four branches at Linkou, Kaohsiung, Keelung, and Chiayi) from January 2007 to April 2014. The clinical data of these acute stroke patients were prospectively registered in the Chang Gung Stroke registry databank. We identified 499 patients who received intravenous tPA treatment, 28 of whom with a baseline modified Rankin scale (mRS) score > 1 were excluded. A total of 471 patients were analyzed and classified according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST), including LAA, CE, SVD, undetermined etiology (UnD) and other determined etiology. The outcomes after intravenous thrombolysis included mRS on discharge from the hospital, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), any hemorrhage, and mortality. A good outcome was defined <b>as</b> a <b>mRS</b> score ≤ 2, and a favorable outcome was defined <b>as</b> a <b>mRS</b> score ≤ 1. Symptomatic ICH was defined according to the ECASS criteria (Hacke et al. 1995).

Therefore, it is sometimes referred to <b>as</b> dynamic <b>MRS,</b> event-related MRS or time-resolved MRS. A novel variant of fMRS is functional diffusion-weighted spectroscopy (fDWS) which measures diffusion properties of brain metabolites upon brain activation.|$|R

30|$|A {{retrospective}} {{review of}} patients who had underwent endovascular coiling for symptomatic and asymptomatic saccular cerebral aneurysm between January 2011 and June 2016 in Suez insurance hospital was performed. Thirty-five aneurysms in 31 cases {{were included in the}} current study. All patients’ aneurysms were fulfilling the following inclusion criteria: ruptured (presenting with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage) or unruptured either presented with mass effect or accidentally discovered (≥[*] 5  mm in size in the anterior circulation, posterior circulation aneurysms, cavernous segment ICA aneurysms, and aneurysms in patients with past or family history of SAH). Patients with Hunt and Hess grade V (deep coma, decerebrate posturing, or moribund) were excluded. Written consents were obtained from all patients before the procedures. The study was approved by Ain Shams University, Faculty of Medicine Ethical Committee. All patients underwent clinical assessment together with Hunt and Hess scale (H&H scale), Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) on admission, before discharge and during follow-up, brain CT scan[*]±[*]CSF analysis, Fisher grading, cerebral CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA) when necessary, and six vessel digital subtraction cerebral angiography (DSCA) followed by endovascular aneurysmal coiling. Clinical and radiological (3 D MRA time of flight or DSCA) follow-up was done 6  months after discharge and then yearly till 5  years. A “good” outcome was defined <b>as</b> a <b>mRS</b> score of 0 – 2 at discharge; a “poor” outcome was defined <b>as</b> a <b>mRS</b> score of 3 – 6 at discharge.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{benefit of}} recanalization in basilar artery {{occlusion}} (BAO) has been established. The baseline extent of brain stem damage may also influence the outcome. We investi-gated whether a baseline diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) score may provide additional prognostic value in BAO. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed baseline clinical and DWI parameters in consecutive patients treated with endovascular procedures for acute BAO. Brain stem DWI lesions were assessed {{by using a}} semiquantitative score based on arterial territory segmentation. Outcome at 3 months was dichot-omized according to the modified Rankin Scale (<b>mRS)</b> <b>as</b> favorable (<b>mRS,</b> 0 – 2) or unfavorable (mRS, 3 – 6). Spearman rank correlation tests assessed the correlation between DWI and clinical variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify clinical and MR imaging predictors of outcome. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were included. The brain stem DWI score (median, 3; range, 0 – 14) was correlated with the baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and the presence and length of coma (r 0. 67, 0. 49, and 0. 53, respectively; P. 01). Recanalization was achieved in 76 %. A higher baseline NIHSS score (P. 02) and brain stem DWI score (P. 03), a lowe...|$|R
