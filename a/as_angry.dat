25|$|The {{origins of}} the Hungarian punk {{movement}} {{go back to the}} early eighties, when a handful of bands like ETA, QSS, CPG, and Auróra emerged <b>as</b> <b>angry</b> young men playing fast and raw punk rock music. Like many other musicians of their age, they often criticized the communist government. They were a part of the national movement to reject the oppressiveness, and particularly the censorship, of the communist regime. As their music {{was on the verge of}} acceptance both by the public and the authorities, concerts were held under tight police control, and often caused moral outrage. With band members often living under constant surveillance, prison was a serious possibility. Two members of the band CPG were found guilty and sent to prison for two years for allegedly unmoral lyrics. After their release, they had to leave Hungary, as did Auróra’s lead singer.|$|E
25|$|In some manifestations, {{particularly}} <b>as</b> <b>angry,</b> ferocious {{aspects of}} Shakti such as Durga or Kali, she has {{eight or ten}} arms, and is astride on a tiger or lion. In benevolent manifestation such as Kamakshi or Meenakshi, a parrot sits near her right shoulder symbolizing cheerful love talk, seeds and fertility. A parrot is found with Parvati's form as Kamakshi - the goddess of love, as well as Kama - the cupid god of desire who shoots arrows to trigger infatuation. A crescent moon is sometimes included near the head of Parvati particularly the Kamakshi icons, for her being half of Shiva. In South Indian legends, her association with the parrot began when she won a bet {{with her husband and}} asked for his loin cloth as victory payment; Shiva keeps his word but first transforms her into a parrot. She flies off and takes refuge in the mountain ranges of south India, appearing as Meenakshi (also spelled Minakshi).|$|E

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review and awarded it three stars out of four.
