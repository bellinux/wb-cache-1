Clan badges consisted of plants which were worn on a bonnet or attached to a pole or spear. There have been several clan badges <b>attributed</b> to Clan Macfie, and the clans shares the use of them with several associated clans. Clan badges <b>attributed</b> to Clan Macfie include: scots pine (Scottish Gaelic: giuthas), <b>attributed</b> to all seven of the clans of Siol Alpin; oak (Scottish Gaelic: darag), also <b>attributed</b> to Clan Cameron; crowberry (Scottish Gaelic: dearca fithich), also <b>attributed</b> to Clan Maclean and Clan Cameron.|$|E

In <b>attribute</b> A2, the examinee needs to have knowledge about the property of factors. In <b>attribute</b> A3, the examinee not only requires knowledge of factoring (i.e., <b>attribute</b> A2), but also the skills of applying the rules of factoring.

40|$|Most {{research}} on <b>attribute</b> identification in database integration {{has focused on}} integrating <b>attributes</b> using schema and summary information derived from the <b>attribute</b> values. No research has attempted to fully explore the use of <b>attribute</b> values to perform <b>attribute</b> identification. We propose an <b>attribute</b> identification method that employs schema and summary instance information as well as properties of <b>attributes</b> derived from their instances. Unlike other <b>attribute</b> identification methods that match only single <b>attributes,</b> our method matches <b>attribute</b> groups for integration. Because our <b>attribute</b> identification method fully explores data instances, it can identify corresponding <b>attributes</b> to be integrated even when schema information is misleading. Three experiments were performed to validate our <b>attribute</b> identification method. In the first experiment, the heuristic rules derived for <b>attribute</b> classification were evaluated on 119 <b>attributes</b> from nine public domain data sets.
