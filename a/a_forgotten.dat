5|$|Although Chaplin {{remained}} {{politically active}} {{in the years following}} the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, his next film, about <b>a</b> <b>forgotten</b> vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E

5|$|The scandalous trick and {{the frank}} {{language}} have {{for much of}} the play's history kept it off the stage and out of print. Between 1753 and 1924, The Country Wife was considered too outrageous to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by David Garrick's cleaned-up and bland version The Country Girl, now <b>a</b> <b>forgotten</b> curiosity. The original play is again a stage favourite today, and is also acclaimed by academic critics, who praise its linguistic energy, sharp social satire, and openness to different interpretations.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} Soeman's life, {{his books}} were only rarely republished and discussed, and a 2014 profile by the Tanjungpinang Center for Preserving Cultural Values {{describes}} Soeman as <b>a</b> <b>forgotten</b> educator and writer.

In 2010, the Sagang Foundation posthumously awarded Soeman the Sagang Kencana Prize for his dedication to preserving Malay culture.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of the Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, the Forgotten Realms were updated again to the new rules system, {{featuring}} a very changed Realms and moving the fictional world's timeline 104 years into the future. The Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, released August 2008, is a 288-page book for Dungeon Masters. The Forgotten Realms Player's Guide was released the following month, and contains information for players to help create Forgotten Realms characters. An adventure, Scepter Tower of Spellgard, was also released in September 2008 and can be used in combination with the adventure in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide to start <b>a</b> <b>Forgotten</b> Realms campaign. In 2008, the Forgotten Realms also became the setting for the RPGA's sole living campaign, Living Forgotten Realms, replacing Living Greyhawk. In 2011, the Neverwinter Campaign Setting was released.|$|E
5|$|The party {{continues}} {{to travel to}} the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp and <b>a</b> <b>forgotten</b> underworld where dinosaurs live. When the Sound Stone is eventually filled, Ness visits Magicant, a surreal location in his mind where he fights his personal dark side. Upon returning to Eagleland, Ness and his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring their souls into robots. The group discovers a device that contains the alien, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who is revealed to have been helping Giygas all along. After defeating him in a fight, Pokey turns the device off, releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight the monster. During the fight, Paula reaches out to the inhabitants of Earth, who pray for the children's safety. The prayers manage to exploit Giygas' fatal weakness — human emotions — and defeat the alien, eradicating him from all of existence. In a post-credits scene, Ness, whose life has returned to normal following Giygas' defeat, receives a note from Pokey, who challenges Ness to come and find him.|$|E

5|$|The {{performance}} of Sarvapitri amavasya rites can also compensate <b>a</b> <b>forgotten</b> or neglected annual Shraddha ceremony, which should ideally {{coincide with the}} death anniversary of the deceased. According to Sharma, the ceremony {{is central to the}} concept of lineages. Shraddha involves oblations to three preceding generationsby reciting their namesas well as to the mythical lineage ancestor (gotra). A person thus gets to know the names of six generations (three preceding generation, his own and two succeeding generationshis sons and grandsons) in his life, reaffirming lineage ties. Anthropologist Usha Menon of Drexel University presents a similar ideathat Pitru Paksha emphasises the fact that the ancestors and the current generation and their next unborn generation are connected by blood ties. The current generation repays their debt to the ancestors in the Pitru Paksha. This debt is considered of utmost importance along with a person's debt to his gurus and his parents.|$|E

40|$|Many {{practical}} applications of clustering involve data collected over time. In these applications, evolutionary clustering {{can be applied}} to the data to track changes in clusters with time. In this paper, we consider an evolutionary version of spectral clustering that applies <b>a</b> <b>forgetting</b> factor to past affinities between data points and aggregates them with current affinities. We propose to use <b>an</b> adaptive <b>forgetting</b> factor and provide a method to automatically choose this forgetting factor at each time step. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method through experiments on synthetic and real data and find that, with <b>an</b> adaptive <b>forgetting</b> factor, we are able to obtain improved clustering performance compared to <b>a</b> fixed <b>forgetting</b> factor.

40|$|People can {{intentionally}} forget previously studied material if, after study, <b>a</b> <b>forget</b> cue {{is provided}} and new material is learned. It {{has recently been}} suggested that such list-method directed forgetting arises because the <b>forget</b> cue induces <b>a</b> change in internal context and causes context-dependent forgetting of the studied material (L. Sahakyan & C. M. Kelley, 2002). The authors compared directed forgetting and context-dependent forgetting by examining whether, like <b>a</b> <b>forget</b> cue, <b>a</b> change in internal context needs subsequent learning of new material to be effective. Participants studied an item list and, after study, received a remember cue or <b>a</b> <b>forget</b> cue or their internal context was changed through an imagination task. In each condition, half the participants learned a second list, {{and the other half}} fulfilled an unrelated distractor task. Both the forget cue and the change in internal context induced forgetting of the first list only when learning of the second list was interpolated. These results suggest that postcue encoding of new material is crucial for both directed forgetting and (some forms of) context-dependent forgetting...|$|R
