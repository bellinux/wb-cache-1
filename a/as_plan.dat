5|$|Australian Army {{involvement}} in UNTAG was formalised in February 1979 by Cabinet, which approved {{the plan to}} commit the 17th Construction Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers and Workshop as the main force for deployment. The squadron was to be supplemented by a Field Troop and by members posted from other units throughout the Army, bringing the squadron to a deployment strength of 275. A headquarters was to be formed, supporting the Chief Engineer at the UNTAG Military Headquarters. The total strength of the force was to be over 300 of all ranks, in what was known <b>as</b> <b>Plan</b> Witan. The unit had been placed on eight weeks' notice in July 1978, which {{was reduced to a}} week's notice to move in February 1979.|$|E
5|$|German {{submarine}} U-30 was a Type VIIA U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{that served}} during World War II. She was ordered in April 1935 {{in violation of}} the Treaty of Versailles, which prevented the construction and commissioning of any U-boats for the German navy, and as part of the German naval rearmament program known <b>as</b> <b>Plan</b> Z. She sank the liner , the first ship sunk in World War II, on 3 September 1939, under the command of Fritz-Julius Lemp. She was retired from front-line service in September 1940 after undertaking eight war patrols, having sunk 17 vessels and damaging two others. U-30 then served in a training role {{until the end of the}} war when she was scuttled. She was later raised and broken up for scrap in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, the Bureau of Reclamation and the State of Arizona {{agreed on}} an {{alternative}} to Orme. This was known <b>as</b> <b>Plan</b> 6, and it recommended four projects: a reconstruction of the Stewart Mountain Dam, a new or larger Roosevelt Dam, the Cliff Dam on the Verde River and finally, the New Waddell Dam on the Agua Fria River (a tributary of the Gila River). On November 6, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt recommended Plan 6. In April 1984, it was approved {{with the exception of}} the Cliff Dam, which needed further study and would eventually be removed from CAP.|$|E

25|$|After Soda's separation, Cerati {{released}} the studio albums Amor Amarillo (1993), Bocanada (1999), +Bien (2001) and Siempre Es Hoy (2002). In 2002 he released 11 Episodios Sinfónicos that contained some Soda Stereo and solo songs played {{live with a}} symphony orchestra. Cerati also released electronic music <b>as</b> <b>Plan</b> V, and other projects. Ahí Vamos! (2006), is considered as a back-to-basics return.

25|$|According to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 and the {{subsequent}} German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, Lithuania {{became part of the}} Russian sphere of influence. Delayed by the Winter War with Finland, Soviet Union began heightening tensions in late spring 1940 just as Nazi Germany was winning the Battle of France. Though the Lithuanian government and army had several months to plan for a contingency, the reaction was sluggish and no decisive steps were taken. The military developed a defensive plan against Russia (known <b>as</b> <b>Plan</b> R), but it was just a slightly modified Plan L for defense against Poland.|$|E
25|$|During {{the lead}} up to the Allied {{invasion}} of Normandy, many new tactics in psychological warfare were devised. The plan for Operation Bodyguard set out a general strategy to mislead German high command as to the exact date and location of the invasion. Planning began in 1943 {{under the auspices of}} the London Controlling Section (LCS). A draft strategy, referred to <b>as</b> <b>Plan</b> Jael, was presented to Allied high command at the Tehran Conference. Operation Fortitude was intended to convince the Germans of a greater Allied military strength than existed, through fictional field armies, faked operations to prepare the ground for invasion and leaked information about the Allied order of battle and war plans.|$|E
25|$|Decisions {{on how to}} use {{the newly}} created land were not {{resolved}} until 1914. In 1900, the United States Senate established the McMillan Commission, a body to advise the Congress and District of Columbia on ways to improve the parks, monuments, memorials, and infrastructure of the city as well <b>as</b> <b>plan</b> for urban renewal, economic growth, and expansion of the federal government. The McMillan Commission concluded that commercial land was not needed and proposed turning the reclaimed flats into parkland. The D.C. government agreed in 1905, and the United States Commission of Fine Arts (a federal advisory agency with review authority over the design and aesthetics of projects within Washington, D.C.) and the Army Corps of Engineers concurred in 1914. Most of the reclaimed mudflats were subsequently declared to be parkland and named Anacostia Water Park (now Anacostia Park) in 1919.|$|E

25|$|On 15 March 1938, a major re-equipment and {{expansion}} {{program of the}} French Air Force, known <b>as</b> <b>Plan</b> V, was approved. While there had been intentions to order a more capable twin-engine aircraft, these were not ready for production, thus the Potez 631 and 633 were retained for this production program, which first involved 207 twin-engined day-and-night fighters along with 449 daytime light bombers. On 25 March 1938, the order for the Potez 633 was increased to 125 bombers, which were also requested to be three-seaters. The Potez 633 orders were subsequently cancelled, ordering additional Potez 631 aircraft in their place; further orders of the Potez 631 were placed {{to allow for the}} speedy withdrawal of the troublesome Potez 630. Between January and June 1940, an average production rate of 100 aircraft per month was maintained.|$|E

500|$|In May 1917, he was {{recalled}} to England, {{initially to}} run the Machine-Gun Corps training centre and from 28 July hold the position of Director-General of the newly formed Tank Corps at the War Office. Operational command of tanks at the frontlines was {{in the hands of}} Hugh Elles, the first commander of the Heavy Branch. Although tanks had first been introduced on the Somme the year before, their design and manufacture were both [...] inadequate and the tactics of their deployment almost non-existent. Capper's job at the Tank Corps was to shape the organisation of the unit into an efficient battlefield force, improve mechanical reliability and develop effective tactics. It was in this role that Capper was given the nickname Stone Age, as his subordinates considered him to be unwilling to accept new innovations in tank tactics. In fact, Capper was an able tactician who worked with General J. F. C. Fuller to develop a plan for a large scale armoured assault on German lines in 1919 (known <b>as</b> <b>Plan</b> 1919): his subordinates' prejudices were based on Capper's rigid adherence to the military hierarchy and his consequent failure to communicate his ideas to those below his rank. For his services as Director General of the Tank Corps, Capper was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
500|$|The critic Michael Medved {{characterized}} {{examples of}} the [...] "so bad it's good" [...] class of low-budget cult film through books such as The Golden Turkey Awards. These films include financially fruitless and critically scorned films that have become inadvertent comedies to film buffs, such <b>as</b> <b>Plan</b> 9 from Outer Space (1959) and The Room (2003). [...] Similarly, Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls (1995) bombed in theaters but developed a cult following on video. [...] Catching on, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer capitalized on the film's ironic appeal and marketed it as a cult film. [...] Sometimes [...] fans will impose their own interpretation of films which have attracted derision, such as reinterpreting an earnest melodrama as a comedy. [...] Jacob deNobel of the Carroll County Times states that films can be perceived as nonsensical or inept when audiences misunderstand avant-garde filmmaking or misinterpret parody. [...] Films such as Rocky Horror can be misinterpreted as [...] "weird for weirdness sake" [...] by people unfamiliar with the cult films that it parodies. [...] deNobel ultimately rejects {{the use of the}} label [...] "so bad it's good" [...] as mean-spirited and often misapplied. [...] Alamo Drafthouse programmer Zack Carlson has further said that any film which succeeds in entertaining an audience is good, regardless of irony. The rise of the Internet and on-demand films has led critics to question whether [...] "so bad it's good" [...] films have a future now that people have such diverse options in both availability and catalog, though fans eager to experience the worst films ever made can lead to lucrative showings for local theaters and merchandisers.|$|E
500|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, attachment means [...] "a biological instinct {{in which}} proximity to an attachment figure is sought {{when the child}} senses or perceives threat or discomfort. Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort". Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver these bonds {{are based on the}} child's need for safety, security and protection, paramount in infancy and childhood. John Bowlby begins by noting that organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways, ranging from primitive reflex-like [...] "fixed action patterns" [...] to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components. In the most complex organisms, instinctive behaviors may be [...] "goal-corrected" [...] with continual on-course adjustments (such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey). The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized <b>as</b> <b>plan</b> hierarchies (Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) thus came to replace Freud's concept of drive and instinct. Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate, but—depending on the organism—can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances, provided that these do not deviate too much from the organism's environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Such flexible organisms pay a price, however, because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development. For humans, Bowlby speculates, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles that of present-day hunter-gatherer societies for the purpose of survival, and, ultimately, genetic replication. Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with love and affection, although these may indicate that bonds exist.|$|E
