However, before the Amber Room could be moved, Erich Koch, {{who was in charge}} of civil administration in Königsberg during the final months of the war, abandoned his post and fled from the city, leaving General Otto Lasch in command.|$|E
5|$|Pierce <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>administration</b> used {{threats and}} {{promises}} to keep most Democrats on board {{in favor of the}} bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and would come to define the Pierce presidency. The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, often called the Know Nothings, and the founding of the Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|At present, Romania {{is divided}} into 41 {{counties}} and one municipality (Bucharest); these are assigned as the NUTS-3 geocode statistical subdivision scheme of Romania within the European Union. Each of the counties is further divided into cities (some of which have municipality status) and communes. The prefect <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>administration</b> have executive prerogatives within the county limits, while limited legislative powers are assigned to a County Council elected every four years during local elections. The territorial districts of the Romanian judicial system overlap with county borders, thus avoiding further complication in {{the separation of powers}} on the government.|$|E
5|$|Following Kennedy's death, Marcus {{maintained}} {{close ties}} with Johnson <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>administration,</b> being considered for diplomatic posts to France and to the United Nations General Assembly while continuing to run his company and providing the wedding dresses for both the Johnsons' daughters, personally assisting Luci Johnson in selecting the designer for her own dress and the styles for the bridesmaids' gowns. After Johnson's retirement, Marcus's invitations were among the few the former president and his wife continued to accept. Marcus's own daughter Wendy joined Mrs. Johnson's staff {{for a time in}} 1963, working under Mrs. Johnson's personal secretary, Liz Carpenter.|$|E
5|$|Sherman, by {{this time}} {{thoroughly}} displeased with Grant <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>administration,</b> nonetheless took up the call {{in the name of}} party loyalty, joining James A. Garfield, Stanley Matthews, and other Republican politicians in Louisiana a few days later. The Democrats likewise sent their politicos, and the two sides met to observe the elections return board arrive at its decision that Hayes should be awarded their state's electoral votes. This ended Sherman's direct role in the matter, and he returned to Washington, but the dispute carried over until a bipartisan election commission was convened in the capital. A few days before Grant's term would end, the commission narrowly decided in Hayes's favor, and he became the 19th President of the United States.|$|E

5000|$|Diego de Velasco (?? - 1575) was {{a career}} soldier {{who served as}} interim Lieutenant Governor of Spanish Florida between 1574 <b>and</b> 1576. <b>His</b> <b>administration</b> ended with <b>his</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> {{treasurer}} Bertolomeo Martinez's imprisonment by his successor as governor, Hernando de Miranda, following investigations of corruption in <b>his</b> <b>administration,</b> as well as crimes committed against Native Americans and the Spanish settlers of Florida.|$|R
5|$|Odense Municipality is the {{administrative}} unit which covers {{not only the}} city of Odense but surrounding suburbs and villages. Odense City Council consists of 29 members, including a mayor. The mayor of Odense, Anker Boye, {{is a member of}} the Social Democratic Party. His first term was from 1993 to 2005 when he was defeated by Jan Boye, a Conservative. He was re-elected in the 2009 election, forming a coalition with the Red–Green Alliance, the Socialist People's Party and the Social Democrats. The city council's motto is At lege er at leve (Playing is living) summarising a new approach addressing learning, innovation, development and growth with targets for 2017. Boye <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>administration</b> have been criticised for mismanaging the celebrations for the 200th anniversary of Hans Christian Andersen in 2005, above all for allegedly signing a contract with Tina Turner for a show which resulted in a deficit of 13 million kroner.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi allowed the {{emergence}} of the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi and Crown Prince Surendra onto the political stage. To consolidate her political influence and see her own son, rather than the heir apparent, Surendra, succeed on the throne, Rajya Laxmi had obtained pardon for Sherjung Thapa and other jailed members of Thapa family. It was only after this that Bhimsen Thapa managed to get a symbolic funeral rite in August 1841. Thus, the Nepalese court was split into three factions centered around the King, the Queen, and the Crown Prince. Fateh Jung <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>administration</b> supported the King, the Thapas supported the Junior Queen, while the Pandes supported the Crown Prince. The resurgent Thapa coalition succeeded in sowing animosity between Fateh Jung's ministry and the Pande coalition, who were swiftly imprisoned. During his two years in power, Fateh Jung was able to maintain a rule of law in the country; however, after the incarceration of the Pandes, nobody could rein in the worsening sadistic tendencies, sometimes with fatal consequences, of Surendra, who was then still a minor. Under immense pressure from the Queen and the nobility, along with the backing from army and the general populace, the King in January 1843 handed the highest authority of the state to his Junior Queen, Rajya Laxmi, curtailing both his own and his son's power.|$|E
