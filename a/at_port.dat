The Navy determined {{that the quality of}} African American petty officers <b>at</b> <b>Port</b> Chicago suffered because of the absence of high-scoring black men, and that overall levels of competence were further reduced by the occasional requirement for Port Chicago to supply drafts of men with clear records for transfer to other stations. The Navy's General Classification Test (GCT) results for the enlisted men <b>at</b> <b>Port</b> Chicago averaged 31, putting them in the lowest twelfth of the Navy. Officers <b>at</b> <b>Port</b> Chicago considered the enlisted men unreliable, emotional, and lacking the capacity to understand or remember orders or instructions.|$|E

The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) responded to word of unsafe practices by offering to bring in experienced men to train the battalion but Navy leadership declined the offer, fearing higher costs, slower pace, and possible sabotage from civilian longshoremen.
