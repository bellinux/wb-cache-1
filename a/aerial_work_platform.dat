Pinguely manufactured tower cranes in the meantime, mainly to fulfill a contract with the French Army. By the mid-90s, Haulotte was the leading manufacturer of <b>aerial</b> <b>work</b> <b>platforms</b> in France. The companies were kept separate through the 80s, and in 1995 became Pinguely-Haulotte.

5000|$|An <b>aerial</b> <b>work</b> <b>platform</b> (AWP), {{also known}} as an aerial device, {{elevating}} work platform (EWP), or mobile elevating work platform (MEWP) is a mechanical device used to provide temporary access for people or equipment to inaccessible areas, usually at height.

50|$|Rope {{access is}} a form of work positioning, {{initially}} developed from techniques used in climbing and caving, which applies practical ropework to allow workers to access difficult-to-reach locations without the use of scaffolding, cradles or an <b>aerial</b> <b>work</b> <b>platform.</b> Rope access technicians descend, ascend, and traverse ropes for access and work while suspended by their harness. Sometimes a work seat may be used. The support of the rope is intended to eliminate the likelihood of a fall altogether, but a back-up fall arrest system is used in case of the unlikely failure of the primary means of support. This redundancy system is usually achieved by using two ropes - a working line and a safety line.|$|E

The term 'powered access' in the federation's name points out its specialization in personal lifting devices which operate with the help of hydraulics and motors, unlike ladders, which are un-powered, and unlike lifting devices for goods, such as forklifts or cranes.|$|R
