5|$|In 1930, the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture began {{a search}} in China for ancient buildings. In the seventh {{year of the}} society's search in 1937, an {{architectural}} team led by Liang Sicheng discovered that Foguang Temple was <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> the Tang Dynasty. Liang was able to date the building after his wife found an inscription {{on one of the}} rafters. The date's accuracy was confirmed by Liang's study of the building which matched with known information about Tang buildings.|$|E

5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} {{the free exercise of}} those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> slavery.|$|E
5|$|Many former US Highways in Michigan {{have left}} an M-numbered highway {{with the same}} number as <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> their existence. For example, M-27 runs along a portion of former US27. In addition, there are two occurrences of {{original}} M-numbered state routes which became US Highways with the same designations: all of M-16 became US16 and most of M-10 from Detroit to Saginaw was assumed into the route of US10 in 1926. In fact, each iteration of M-10 has existed in whole or part along a former or future alignment of US10.|$|E
5|$|The {{expressway}} {{portion of}} M-63 is <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> a now revised plan of a freeway corridor through the St. Joseph–Benton Harbor area. The highway was significantly reconfigured in 2000–2002, with the overpass over the industrial access road to Whirlpool's warehouse in Benton Harbor and a rail line removed and rebuilt in late 2000 through early 2001, {{and one of}} the two grade-separated interchanges, at Klock Road, demolished and downgraded to an at-grade intersection in 2002. Today, there are only two overpasses over smaller roads existing on this stretch of expressway.|$|E

5|$|The {{liberty of}} being {{employed}} in silk factories starting in 1865 allowed some women to style themselves tzu-shu nii (never to marry) {{and live in}} communes with other women. Other Chinese called them sou-hei (self-combers) for adopting hairstyles of married women. These communes passed because of the Great Depression and were subsequently discouraged by the communist government for being <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> feudal China. In contemporary Chinese society, tongzhi (same goal or spirit) is the term {{used to refer to}} homosexuals; most Chinese are reluctant to divide this classification further to identify lesbians.|$|E
5|$|Aldwych is {{a closed}} {{station on the}} London Underground, located in the City of Westminster in Central London. It was opened in 1907 with the name Strand, after the street on which it is located, and was the {{terminus}} of the short Piccadilly line branch from Holborn that was <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> the merger of two railway schemes. The station building {{is close to the}} Strand's junction with Surrey Street, near Aldwych. During its lifetime, the branch {{was the subject of a}} number of unrealised extension proposals that would have seen the tunnels through the station extended southwards, usually to Waterloo.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey was {{a patron}} of scholarship, and {{employed}} scholars throughout his life, one of whom, Honorius of Kent, Geoffrey appointed Archdeacon of Richmond. Honorius was subsequently employed by Hubert Walter {{and wrote a}} legal work on canon law. The Leiden St Louis Psalter is a lavishly illuminated psalter made for the archbishop, probably in northern England in the 1190s, which passed {{into the hands of}} Blanche of Castile after Geoffrey's death, and, as religious manuscripts often were, was used to teach the future saint King Louis IX of France how to read, as recorded by a 14th-century inscription. After the king's death it passed through several royal owners, regarded as <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> the saint, before reaching the University Library at Leiden in 1741.|$|E

5|$|In November 2011, {{a lock of}} John Paul II's {{hair was}} brought to the cathedral after the Holy See granted the Diocese of Hong Kong a relic from the late pontiff. The diocese had earlier {{requested}} this, since they felt this would symbolically accomplish the Pope's longtime dream of visiting China. He had constantly stated his intent of visiting the country, but never did so due to the longstanding tensions and strained relations between China and the Holy See. Bishop John Tong Hon expressed his hope that the relic would be able to venerated by the Mainland Chinese faithful who visited Hong Kong, the only city on Chinese soil and the first city in Asia to house <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> John Paul II. It is currently displayed in the same chapel as the bishops' crypt.|$|E
5|$|Pantulf married Lescelina {{and they}} had four sons– Philip, Ivo, Arnald and Robert. He and his wife founded Noron Priory, in 1073. This was located in Normandy and was founded as a small {{dependent}} priory of Saint Evroul. Besides Noron, Pantulf was also a benefactor of the Saint-Evroul. In 1092 Pantulf journeyed to southern Italy again, this time to secure <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> Saint Nicholas for his foundation at Noron. During this visit, he was offered extensive lands in Apulia by Robert Guiscard, but declined the offer {{and returned to the}} north. Pantulf died on 16 April, probably in 1112, when his English lands were transferred to his second son Robert. The Norman lands went to the eldest son, Philip. Pantulf and his wife were buried at Noron in the cloister of his priory there.|$|E
5|$|The Castellania is {{considered}} as the masterpiece of architecture projected by Grand Master Pinto, {{being the most}} original intact of secular High Baroque architecture and <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> the early modern period, {{under the rule of}} the Order of St. John. It has an elaborate façade designed to be imposing, of similar proportions to an auberge, and it is a prominent building in the area. It is two stories high, being built on three sides of a small courtyard at the rear. Although the building has an asymmetrical plan, the main façade in Merchants street is symmetrical. The design prominently includes sumptuous edges, spread over the exterior.|$|E

5|$|The Finsta Chapel or St Eric's Chapel on the north-west {{corner of}} the chancel houses the relics of Eric the Holy, {{the patron saint of}} Sweden, who was killed in 1160 on the site where Uppsala Cathedral was later built. His shrine was moved from the first cathedral in Gamla Uppsala as soon as work began on the new building. In 1580, King John III melted his shrine down but {{replaced}} it with a new gold-plated one which still contains Eric's relics and crown. The name Finsta originates from the Uppland estate where Judge Birger Persson and his wife were born. They were entombed in the chapel in 1328. <b>A</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> their daughter Saint Bridget housed in a small gold-plated shrine was donated by the Saint Bridget Order in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The Shogunate took major steps {{towards the}} {{construction}} of a modern and powerful military: a navy with a core of eight steam warships had been built over several years and was already the strongest in Asia. In 1865, Japan's first modern naval arsenal was built in Yokosuka by the French engineer Léonce Verny. In January 1867, a French military mission arrived to reorganize the shogunal army and create the Denshūtai elite force, and an order was placed with the United States to buy the French-built ironclad warship CSS Stonewall, <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> the American Civil War. Due to the Western powers' declared neutrality, the Americans refused to release the ship, but once neutrality was lifted, the imperial faction obtained the vessel and employed it in engagements in Hakodate under the name Kōtetsu ("Ironclad").|$|E
5|$|In 1022 Æthelnoth went to Rome {{to obtain}} the pallium, and was {{received}} by Pope Benedict VIII. On his return trip, he bought <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> St Augustine of Hippo for 100 silver talents and one gold talent. He gave the relic to Coventry Abbey. He also presided over the translation of the relics of Ælfheah, his predecessor at Canterbury who {{was regarded as a}} martyr and saint. In 1022 Æthelnoth consecrated Gerbrand as bishop for the Diocese of Roskilde, which was in Scandinavia. The archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen was the metropolitan of Roskilde, and the fact that Gerbrand was consecrated by an English archbishop later caused friction between the bishop and his metropolitan. Cnut was forced to concede that in the future he would not appoint bishops in Bremen's archdiocese without the metropolitan's advice. A later tradition held that Æthelnoth consecrated two Welsh bishops, one at Llandaff and one at St. David's.|$|E

5|$|The Italian {{government}} {{refused to}} carry out death sentences, as the death penalty had been abolished in Italy in 1944 and was regarded as <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> Mussolini's Fascist regime. The Italian decision was very disappointing to the British government because the trials had partly been intended {{to meet the expectations}} of the Italian public. The War Office notified Lieutenant General Sir John Harding, who had succeeded Alexander as commander of British forces in the Mediterranean in 1946, {{that there should be no}} more death sentences and those already imposed should be commuted. Accordingly, Harding commuted the death sentences imposed on von Mackensen, Mälzer and Kesselring to life imprisonment on 4 July 1947. Mälzer died while still in prison in February 1952, while von Mackensen, after having his sentence reduced to 21 years, was set free in October 1952. Kesselring was moved from Mestre prison near Venice to Wolfsberg, Carinthia, in May 1947. In October 1947 he was transferred for the last time, to Werl Prison, in Westphalia.|$|E
5|$|The monastery {{itself was}} founded by Senekerim-Hovhannes early in his reign (1003–24) to house <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> the True Cross that had been kept on the site since Hripsime. In 1021, when Vaspurakan fell to Byzantine rule, Senekerim-Hovhannes took the relic to Sebastia, where the {{following}} year his son Atom founded the Surb Nshan Monastery. In 1025, following his death, Senekerim-Hovhannes was buried at Varagavank and the True Cross was returned to the monastery. Fearing an attack by Muslims, Varagavank Father Ghukas took the True Cross in 1237 to the Tavush region of northeastern Armenia. There he settled in the Anapat monastery, which was renamed Nor Varagavank. In 1318, the Mongols invaded the region and ransacked the monastery. All the churches were destroyed except St. Hovhannes, which had an iron door and was where the monks hid. Between 1320 and the 1350s, the monastery was completely restored.|$|E
5|$|The tranomasina were {{destroyed}} in March 1897 by French authorities who removed {{the bodies of}} the sovereigns interred here and relocated them to the royal tombs at the Rova of Antananarivo. The rich collection of funerary objects enclosed within the tombs was also removed for display in the Manjakamiadana palace on the Antananarivo rova grounds, which the Colonial Authority transformed into an ethnological museum. This was done in an effort to desanctify the city of Ambohimanga and break the spirit of the Menalamba resistance fighters who had been rebelling against French colonization for the past year, break popular belief {{in the power of the}} royal ancestors, and relegate Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> an unenlightened past. A French garrison was housed within the royal city and military buildings were erected on top of the stone tomb foundations. A kitchen and military canteen were built on top of the tombs of Andrianampoinimerina and Andriamasinavalona. By 1904, the military buildings were likewise demolished, leaving the stone tomb foundations intact.|$|E
