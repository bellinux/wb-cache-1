25|$|The naive {{approach}} to finding a congruence of squares is {{to pick a}} random number, square it, <b>and</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> least non-negative remainder modulo n is a perfect square (in the integers). For example, 802 mod 5959 is 441, which is 212. This approach finds a congruence of squares only rarely for large n, but when it does find one, more often than not, the congruence is nontrivial and the factorization is complete. This is roughly the basis of Fermat's factorization method.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{prominent}} {{members of a}} generation of young painters from the School of Art were elected as the Society of Artists' first associates in the 1860s, including Walter Langley, William Wainwright, Frank Bramley and Edwin Harris.

Although he was later joined by Harris, Bramley, Wainwright and numerous London artists including Stanhope Forbes, Langley's work remained vital to the image of the Newlyn School and was matched only by that of Forbes for substance and consistency.
