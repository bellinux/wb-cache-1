40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [59]- 64). The {{present study}} investigated children’s comprehension of social misunderstandings. Kindergarten, second-grade, and fourth-grade children were read illustrated stories describing social misunderstandings. Children {{were asked to}} infer each story characters’ emotions, interpretations, explanations of interpretations, attributions, motivations, and explanations of the <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>to</b> a third person as well as reality. Results indicated that kindergarten, second, and fourth graders were equally able to infer characters’ emotions, interpretations, {{and the reality of}} the situation. However, an agerelated increase was found in children’s ability to (a) identify misinterpretations, (b) explain characters’ interpretations, and (c) predict how a character might explain the <b>misunderstanding</b> <b>to</b> a third person. In sum, older children’s utilization of knowledge of a character’s past interpretations to explain subsequent perceptions suggests a conceptualization of social misunderstandings as cyclical. Such a conceptualization should make them better able <b>to</b> resolve <b>misunderstandings</b> and prevent conflict. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R

It goes on to suggest that the widespread but mistaken belief among modern cohabitants in the existence of ‘common-law marriage’ must also be of recent origin...|$|R
