5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} <b>attic.</b> Homer claims not {{to know what they}} are talking about, even though he is seen heading into the <b>attic</b> with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the <b>attic,</b> and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the <b>attic,</b> where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the <b>attic</b> and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the <b>attic.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Christianity {{became the}} {{dominant}} religion, <b>Attic</b> {{began to be}} used in Christian writings in addition to and often interspersed with koine Greek. Nonetheless, from the 6th at least until the 12th century, <b>Attic</b> remained entrenched in the educational system; while further changes to the spoken language can be postulated for the early and middle Byzantine periods.|$|E

50|$|This doorway {{leads to}} the <b>attics</b> which were the servants’ {{quarters}} during the Georgian period. However, the door is now kept locked and the <b>attics</b> undisturbed because {{it is now a}} bat roost. There are 3 species of bats living in the <b>attics</b> at Nantclwyd y Dre - pipistrelle, long eared and lesser horseshoe bats. The lesser horseshoes are the rarest and their colony size is estimated at around 60 individuals.|$|R

5|$|Lennon {{did much}} of his songwriting in the <b>attic,</b> where he had several Studer tape recorders. Little was done with them until fellow Beatle Paul McCartney came over and helped re-install them in sequence, so overdubs could be made. Lennon could thus record his own doubletracked song demos. (These demos, and some other, more avant garde sound {{recordings}} also made in the <b>attic,</b> have appeared on various bootlegs). The <b>attic</b> also contained a mellotron, an electronic organ, a piano, a Vox AC30 amplifier and several guitars (including his first Rickenbacker 325, a Hofner Senator, and his Rickenbacker 1996), {{all of which were}} used when songwriting. Lennon also wrote on an upright piano in the sunroom.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{family members}} painted {{signatures}} and graffiti in the <b>attic</b> around 1856, which remain {{visible on the}} stairwell wall.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the <b>attic.</b> Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look like they have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the <b>attic</b> suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her <b>attic</b> while looking at a photo album.|$|E

5|$|The central {{chimney stack}} exists, but the {{back-to-back}} fireplaces have been blocked. The staircase may have originally been located {{to one side}} of the back-to-back fireplaces, but no evidence of this remains. There are two rooms on the upstairs floor, the southern one having been partitioned, plus an additional two rooms in the <b>attic</b> complete with modern fittings. The first floor and <b>attic</b> was used as a flat, with a kitchen, living room and office on the first floor, and two bedrooms in the <b>attic.</b> The roof is thought to be from around 1800 but has subsequently been strengthened.|$|E

5|$|George Sr. is not, in fact, gone. After faking {{his death}} in Mexico by paying off the cops, George Sr. returns to the family model home, where George Michael discovers him and hides him in the <b>attic.</b> To protect his son from legal implications, Michael hides George Sr. in Gob's prop Aztec Tomb, orchestrates a diversion, and tells the family that George Sr. has escaped once more. Throughout {{the rest of the}} season, Michael sneaks George Sr. provisions, and George Sr. keeps tabs on the Bluth family through the {{ventilation}} system. George Sr. also faces onslaught from the outside world; the press begins looking for him in Iraq, fumigators surround the house while he's still in the <b>attic,</b> and Kitty returns to steal a sample of his semen to make her own Bluth baby.|$|E
50|$|The village {{houses are}} {{built in a}} double {{horseshoe}} around a village green. Two-storey cottages with <b>attics</b> were built in terraces of eight in red brick with a decorative first floor band and saw tooth eaves cornices. Their Welsh slate roofs have decorative ridge cresting. Each house has three-light casement windows in ashlar surrounds and a doorway with ashlar lintels and an overlight. The first floors have two-light casement windows under chamfered ashlar lintels. Gabled dormers to the <b>attics</b> have two-light casements with small panel glazing. Similar two-storey cottages were built without dormers to their <b>attics.</b> All the houses have back yards enclosed by brick walls. The village houses are grade II listed buildings.|$|R

5|$|The low granite block {{foundation}} {{of the house is}} more exposed {{on the west side of}} the house, allowing for a full-height door exiting from the cellar. The stone stack supports four fireplaces that each support the hall, hall chamber, parlor and the cellar. Also there is a smoke chamber in the stack in the <b>attic.</b> The original kitchen, now in the hall, features a large fireplace with bake oven in the rear wall of the firebox. The <b>attic</b> once housed a large loom that was later moved down to the west side of the cellar. Amos G. Avery, who owned and restored the house prior to its 1992 National Register of Historic Places listing, removed a 1871 Victorian balustrade on the front staircase installed by the second Theophilus Avery.|$|E

In the <b>attic</b> scenes, for instance, Hepworth's use of arc lights was celebrated {{for being an}} early use of harsh lighting conditions to create ambiance and indicate a dangerous setting. Prints have been saved both in the Library of Congress film archive, and the National Film and Television Archive of the British Film Institute.|$|E
