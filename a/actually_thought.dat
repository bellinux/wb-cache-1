The cover art was designed by a friend of the band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album.

[...] GamesRadar also panned the system, placing it as their ninth-worst console with reviewer Mikel Reparaz criticizing that [...] "it was a stopgap system that would be thrown under the bus when the Sega Saturn came out six months later, and everyone seemed to know it except for die-hard Sega fans and the company itself." [...] Retro Gamers Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of Space Harrier, After Burner, and Virtua Fighter that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-on's price point, stating, [...] "If you didn't have deep enough pockets to afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; it's just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness." [...] Levi Buchanan, writing for IGN, saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation. [...] According to Buchanan, [...] "I <b>actually</b> <b>thought</b> the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball.

Dan DeLuca from The Philadelphia Inquirer assumed that the song was designed to address her transition from her innocent Hannah Montana image and then-recent breakup with fiance Liam Hemsworth; from a production standpoint, he jokingly referenced Cyrus' earlier single [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] when mentioning that [...] " [...] her party and she can do what she wants", in regards to the increasingly diverse genres she had begun experimenting with.

Then, Collins performed [...] "Against All Odds" [...] and [...] "In the Air Tonight", and finished the night playing drums for Led Zeppelin's aforementioned act.

With so many loose ends to wrap up, the hour felt overstuffed: the impending wedding, The Norseman, Agent X, Morgan's first field assignment...I mean, that's a lot of stuff. And it doesn't help that Vivian Volkoff {{is at the center of}} three of those things, and inserted herself into the fourth at the last moment. And in thinking about the clunkiness of aspects of this episode, I thought about the clunkiness of this latter half of the season as a whole." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, writing that it was a mistake not to include Timothy Dalton as Alexei Volkoff after the plot twists of the previous episode.
