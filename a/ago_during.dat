5|$|St. Helens {{started its}} {{growth in the}} Pleistocene 37,600 years <b>ago,</b> <b>during</b> the Ape Canyon stage, with dacite and {{andesite}} eruptions of hot pumice and ash. 36,000 years ago a large mudflow cascaded down the volcano; mudflows were significant forces in all of St. Helens' eruptive cycles. The Ape Canyon eruptive period ended around 35,000 years ago and was followed by 17,000 years of relative quiet. Parts of this ancestral cone were fragmented and transported by glaciers 14,000 to 18,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>during</b> the last glacial period of the current ice age.|$|E

5|$|Dermotherium major {{was found}} in a lignite pit known as Wai Lek in Krabi Province, southwestern Thailand. It is part of the Krabi Basin fauna, which {{contains}} at least 40 mammalian genera, mostly artiodactyls but also including some primates, such as Siamopithecus, Wailekia, and Muangthanhinius. This fauna has been dated to about 33 to 35 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>during</b> the Late Eocene.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea in {{tropical}} Hawaii. There {{is evidence of}} past subglacial eruptive activity on the volcano {{in the form of}} a subglacial deposit on its summit. The eruptions originated about 10,000 years <b>ago,</b> <b>during</b> the last ice age, when the summit of Mauna Kea was covered in ice.|$|E
5|$|The Precambrian gneiss and schist {{that make}} up the {{majority}} of the steep walls of the Black Canyon formed 1.7 billion years <b>ago</b> <b>during</b> a metamorphic period brought on by the collision of ancient volcanic island arcs with the southern end of what is present-day Wyoming. The lighter-colored pegmatite dikes that can be seen crosscutting the basement rocks formed later during this same period.|$|E
50|$|Pachyrhinosaurini was a {{subfamily}} of centrosaurine dinosaurs. The clade existed {{during the}} Late Cretaceous, about 84.9 to 66 million years <b>ago,</b> evolving <b>during</b> the earliest Campanian, and becoming extinct in the Maastrichtian.|$|R

50|$|Mount Kinabalu {{was only}} formed around 1 million years <b>ago</b> and <b>during</b> {{the last ice}} age, around 20,000 to 10,000 years ago, it had an ice cap on its summit. As such, it appears that N. edwardsiana is a {{relatively}} recent species in evolutionary terms.|$|R
5|$|The koala is {{classified}} with wombats (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families (including marsupial tapirs, marsupial lions and giant wombats) in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order Diprotodontia. The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) and possums. The ancestors of vombatiforms were likely arboreal, and the koala's lineage was possibly {{the first to}} branch off around 40 million years <b>ago</b> <b>during</b> the Eocene.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks of}} which the mountain is made were formed in the caldera of an ancient volcano, {{many of them in}} violently explosive eruptions, about 450 million years <b>ago</b> <b>during</b> the Ordovician period. During the last ice age these rocks were carved by glaciers to create the landforms seen today.|$|E
5|$|This genus {{of dinosaurs}} lived {{in what is}} now mid-western North America {{at the end of the}} Jurassic period. Diplodocus is one of the more common dinosaur fossils found in the middle to upper Morrison Formation, between about 154 and 152 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>during</b> the late Kimmeridgian age. The Morrison Formation records an {{environment}} and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs, such as Apatosaurus, Barosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Brontosaurus, and Camarasaurus.|$|E
50|$|In the {{geological}} timescale, the Ludlow epoch (from 422.9 ± 2.5 {{million years ago}} to 418.7 ± 2.7 million years <b>ago)</b> occurred <b>during</b> the Silurian period, {{after the end of}} the Homerian age. It is named for the town of Ludlow in Shropshire, England.|$|R
50|$|In the {{geological}} timescale, the Llandovery epoch (from 443.7 ± 1.5 {{million years ago}} to 428.2 ± 2.3 million years <b>ago)</b> occurred <b>during</b> the Silurian period.

5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation {{is known as the}} cosmic microwave background radiation. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years <b>ago,</b> <b>during</b> a habitable epoch when {{the universe}} was only 10–17 million years old.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{molecular}} clock estimation, Trigonognathus {{is thought to}} have originated around 41 million years <b>ago</b> <b>during</b> the Middle Eocene, {{as part of a larger}} evolutionary radiation of etmopterid genera. The genus is represented in this time period by the extinct species T. virginiae, whose fossilized teeth have been recovered from Lutetian age (47.8–41.3 Mya) strata in Landes, southwestern France. Fossil teeth virtually identical to those of the modern viper dogfish are known from the Cubagua Formation in northeastern Venezuela, which dates to the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene (11.6–3.6 Mya).|$|E
5|$|However, {{studies of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{indicate that the}} russet sparrow is an early offshoot or basal species among the Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows. While mitochrondrial DNA suggests speciation in Passer occurred during the Miocene and Pliocene, British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith estimated that the russet sparrow separated from the other Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows about 25,000 to 15,000 years <b>ago,</b> <b>during</b> the last glacial period. During this time, sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free refugia, such as the lower Yangtze valley, which Summers-Smith considered the most likely centre of evolution for the russet sparrow.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Cervus (and hence early {{relatives}} or possible ancestors of the elk) first appear in the fossil record 25 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>during</b> the Oligocene in Eurasia, but do {{not appear in the}} North American fossil record until the early Miocene. The extinct Irish elk (Megaloceros) was not a member {{of the genus}} Cervus, but rather the largest member of the wider deer family (Cervidae) known from the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|Multiple eruptions of silica-rich {{rhyolite}} from 40,000 to 600 {{years ago}} built the Mono Craters. Black Point, {{today on the}} north shore of Mono Lake, is a flattened volcanic cone of basaltic debris that formed under the surface of a much deeper Mono Lake about 13,300 years <b>ago,</b> <b>during</b> the most-recent glacial period. Several eruptive episodes from 1,600 to 270 years before present in Mono Lake formed Negit Island. The magma reservoir feeding the Mono Lake Volcanic Field is unrelated to the Mono Craters magma reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Nigersaurus {{is known}} from the Elrhaz Formation of the Tegama Group in an area called Gadoufaoua, located in Niger. It {{is one of the}} most {{commonly}} found vertebrates in the formation. The Elrhaz Formation consists mainly of fluvial sandstones with low relief, much of which is obscured by sand dunes. The sediments are coarse- to medium-grained, with almost no fine-grained horizons. Nigersaurus lived in what is now Niger about 115 to 105 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>during</b> the Aptian and Albian ages of the mid-Cretaceous. It likely lived in habitats dominated by inland floodplains (a riparian zone).|$|E

5|$|Starting 10 {{million years}} ago, {{vertical}} movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block {{and the resulting}} accelerated uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the gradient of western-flowing streams. The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces. Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years <b>ago</b> <b>during</b> the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|The Metacomet Ridge is {{the result}} of {{continental}} rifting processes that took place 200 million years <b>ago</b> <b>during</b> the Triassic and Jurassic periods. The basalt (also called traprock) crest of the Metacomet Ridge {{is the product of a}} series of massive lava flows hundreds of feet thick that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of the North American continent from Eurasia and Africa. Essentially, the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric rift valley which was once a branch of (or a parallel of) the major rift to the east that became the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
