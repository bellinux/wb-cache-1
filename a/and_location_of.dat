5|$|Although many of {{the coins}} bear {{the name of a}} moneyer, there is no {{indication}} of the mint where each coin was struck. As a result, the number <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> mints used by Offa is uncertain. Current opinion is that there were four mints, in Canterbury, Rochester, East Anglia and London.|$|E
5|$|During the Severian persecutions of 202–203, Clement left Alexandria. In 211, Alexander of Jerusalem wrote {{a letter}} commending him to the Church of Antioch, which may imply that Clement was living in Cappadocia or Jerusalem at that time. The date <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> his death are unknown.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to literary evidence, archaeological excavation conducted mainly {{since the late}} 1970s have revealed further information about the palace.

5|$|The pygmy slow loris has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n=50.

5|$|Dazed {{survivors}} immediately {{feared that}} the explosion {{was the result of}} a bomb dropped from a German plane. Troops at gun batteries and barracks immediately turned out in case the city was under attack, but within an hour switched from defence to rescue roles as the cause <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the explosion were determined. All available troops were called in from harbour fortifications and barracks to the North End to rescue survivors and provide transport to the city's hospitals, including the two army hospitals in the city.|$|E
5|$|Following {{historical}} sources, Shepseskare was traditionally {{believed to}} have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted {{only a few months}} at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung.|$|E
5|$|Further south, near Mount St. Helens, is {{a similar}} situation, where the St. Helens Fault Zone (SHZ) is {{believed}} to be the eastern edge of the Crescent Formation, but the pre-Cenozoic continental basement is near Mount Rainier. Separating these is the marine sedimentary formation known as the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC); it is possible that it was deposited over a fragment of Siletzia. Or not: the oldest parts of the SWCC likely predate Siletzia, and the nature <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the contact between these two formations is unknown.|$|E

5|$|In most cases, thyroid cancer {{presents}} as a painless {{mass in the}} neck. It is {{very unusual}} for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, medullary, and thyroid lymphoma. Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the cancer and metastases.|$|E
5|$|Operation Overlord was {{the name}} {{assigned}} {{to the establishment of}} a large-scale lodgement on the Continent. The first phase, the amphibious invasion and establishment of a secure foothold, was codenamed Operation Neptune. To gain the air superiority needed to ensure a successful invasion, the Allies undertook a bombing campaign (codenamed Operation Pointblank) that targeted German aircraft production, fuel supplies, and airfields. Elaborate deceptions, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, were undertaken {{in the months leading up}} to the invasion to prevent the Germans from learning the timing <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the invasion.|$|E
5|$|Prognosis differs {{depending}} on the severity <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the lesion, and access to immediate, specialised acute management. Subarachnoid hemorrhage approximately doubles mortality. Subdural hematoma is associated with worse outcome and increased mortality, while people with epidural hematoma {{are expected to have}} a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly. Diffuse axonal injury may be associated with coma when severe, and poor outcome. Following the acute stage, prognosis is strongly influenced by the patient's involvement in activity that promote recovery, which for most patients requires access to a specialised, intensive rehabilitation service. The Functional Independence Measure is a way to track progress and degree of independence throughout rehabilitation.|$|E

5|$|Temporary {{brachytherapy}} involves {{placement of}} radiation sources {{for a set}} duration (usually a number of minutes or hours) before being withdrawn. The specific treatment duration will depend on many different factors, including the required rate of dose delivery and the type, size <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the cancer. In LDR and PDR brachytherapy, the source typically stays in place up to 24 hours before being removed, while in HDR brachytherapy this time is typically a few minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{load borne}} by the two wheels varies not only with center of mass location, which in turn varies with the amount <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> {{passengers}} and luggage, but also with acceleration and deceleration. This phenomenon is known as load transfer or weight transfer, depending on the author, and provides challenges and opportunities to both riders and designers. For example, motorcycle racers {{can use it to}} increase the friction available to the front tire when cornering, and attempts to reduce front suspension compression during heavy braking has spawned several motorcycle fork designs.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} barrier {{was to be}} backed up by air-dropped and hand-emplaced acoustic and seismic sensors that would provide both warning <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> enemy movements. A scientific group was established to find or develop the technology for what was initially titled Practice Nine. On 17 June 1967 {{the title of the}} program was altered to Illinois City and on 15 July to Dyemarker, the electronic barrier portion of which was designated Muscle Shoals. In June 1968 it was renamed for the last time, becoming Operation Igloo White.|$|E

5|$|When he {{examined}} Tom McLaury's body, Mathews found twelve buckshot wounds {{from a single}} shotgun blast {{on the right side}} under his arm, between the third and fifth ribs. The wound was about four inches across. The nature <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the wound indicated that it could not have been received if Tom's hands were on his coat lapels as the Cowboys later testified. Both Virgil and Wyatt stated that Holliday had shot Tom, which the coroner's exam supported.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} considered tactical {{surprise to}} be a necessary {{element of the}} plan for the landings. Information on the exact date <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the landings was provided only to the topmost levels of the armed forces. Men were sealed into their marshalling areas {{at the end of}} May, with no further communication with the outside world. Troops were briefed using maps that were correct in every detail except for the place names, and most were not told their actual destination until they were already at sea. A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations. Travel to and from the Republic of Ireland was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.|$|E
5|$|Blaster Master has {{two modes}} of {{gameplay}} {{that depends on}} the situation <b>and</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the player. The first mode is where the player controls SOPHIA in a two–dimensional platform mode; the second mode is where the player controls Jason while outside SOPHIA in either the same 2D platform mode or in a top-down perspective. Gameplay in the top-down perspective consists of a series of labyrinths in which players navigate and defeat enemies along the way. Gameplay is non-linear, and players must return to earlier levels in order to advance to later levels in the game. The objective is to complete all eight levels and destroy the mutants and their bosses with various weaponry such as guns, grenades, and special weapons.|$|E
