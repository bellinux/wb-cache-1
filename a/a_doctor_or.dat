5|$|Losing the undersheriff {{position}} left Wyatt Earp {{without a}} job in Tombstone; however, Wyatt and his brothers were beginning {{to make some money}} on their mining claims in the Tombstone area. In January 1881, Oriental Saloon owner Mike Joyce gave Wyatt Earp a one-quarter interest in the faro concession at the Oriental Saloon in exchange for his services as a manager and enforcer. Gambling was regarded as a legitimate profession, comparable to <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> member of clergy, at the time. Wyatt invited his friend, lawman and gambler Bat Masterson, to Tombstone to help him run the faro tables in the Oriental Saloon. In June 1881, Wyatt also telegraphed another friend and gambler from Dodge, Luke Short, who was living in Leadville, Colorado, and offered him a job as a faro dealer.|$|E
5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E

Saher's brother once took him to different places where people usually sang, and told him it's your choice to sing a respectful way or you can choose to do it the bad way.

25|$|Some memory {{issues are}} due to stress, anxiety, or depression. A {{traumatic}} life event, such as {{the death of a}} spouse, can lead to changes in lifestyle and can leave an elderly person feeling unsure of themselves, sad, and lonely. Dealing with such drastic life changes can therefore leave some people confused or forgetful. While in some cases these feelings may fade, it is important to take these emotional problems seriously. By emotionally supporting a struggling relative and seeking help from <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> counselor, the forgetfulness can be improved.|$|E
25|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Surgeon General, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{recommend}} that aspirin and combination products containing aspirin {{not be given}} to children under 19 years of age during episodes of fever-causing illnesses. Hence, in the United States, it is advised that the opinion of <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> pharmacist should be obtained before anyone under 19 years of age is given any medication containing aspirin (also known on some medicine labels as acetylsalicylate, salicylate, acetylsalicylic acid, ASA, or salicylic acid).|$|E

40|$|Information on {{delays in}} obtaining {{appointments}} {{in a city}} practice was collected. The results showed that although overall 89 % of patients could be offered appointments {{with one of the}} doctors by the next day, only 60 % chose to accept one, the remainder electing to wait for <b>a</b> particular <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> surgery time. When patients making urgent requests for appointments were analysed separately, it was shown that 98 % were offered same-day appointments and 96 % accepted. Only 17 % of patients making an urgent request expressed a preference for <b>a</b> particular <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> time, compared with 68 % of non-urgent requests. The frequency of urgent requests was greater for patients under five years of age and lower for those over 65 years old. The study suggested that longer waiting times for an appointment were the result of patient choice for <b>a</b> particular <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> time, which in turn was dependent on the degree of urgency, rather than the unavailability of appointments...|$|R
25|$|In transcribing {{directly}} for <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> {{a group of}} physicians, there are specific formats and report types used, dependent on that doctor's speciality of practice, although history and physical exams or consults are mainly utilized. In most of the off-hospital sites, independent medical practices perform consultations as a second opinion, pre-surgical exams, and as IMEs (Independent Medical Examinations) for liability insurance or disability claims. Some private practice family doctors choose not to utilize a medical transcriptionist, preferring to keep their patient's records in a handwritten format, although {{this is not true}} of all family practitioners.|$|E
25|$|On 11 August, {{after her}} counsel {{maintained}} that Siddiqui {{had not seen}} a doctor since arriving in the US the previous week, US Magistrate Judge Henry B. Pitman ordered that she be examined by a medical doctor within 24 hours. Prosecutors maintained that Siddiqui had received adequate medical care for her gunshot wound but could not confirm whether she had been seen by <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> paramedic. The judge postponed her bail hearing until 3 September. An examination by a doctor the following day found no visible signs of infection; she also received a CAT scan.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, the {{delusion}} may {{be assumed}} to be false by <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> psychiatrist assessing the belief, {{because it seems to}} be unlikely, bizarre or held with excessive conviction. Psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person’s claims leading to some true beliefs to be erroneously classified as delusional. This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect, after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House. At the time, her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the Watergate scandal broke was she proved right (and hence sane).|$|E

25|$|A {{blood sample}} after 12-hour fasting is taken by <b>a</b> <b>doctor,</b> <b>or</b> a home cholesterol-monitoring device {{is used to}} {{determine}} a lipoprotein profile. This measures total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides. It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every five years if a person has total cholesterol of 5.2mmol/L or more (200+mg/dL), or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL (good) cholesterol less than 1mmol/L (40mg/dL), or there are other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Other risk factors for heart disease include Diabetes, Hypertension (or use of anti-hypertensive medications), low HDL, family history of CAD and hypercholesterolemia, and cigarette smoking.|$|E
25|$|Some countries, {{including}} the Czech Republic, require that an alien {{who needs a}} visa on entry be {{in possession of a}} valid visa upon exit. To satisfy this formal requirement, exit visas sometimes need to be issued. Russia requires an exit visa if a visitor stays past the expiration date of their visa. They must then extend their visa or apply for an exit visa and are not allowed to leave the country until they show a valid visa or have a permissible excuse for overstaying their visa (e.g., a note from <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> a hospital explaining an illness, missed flight, lost or stolen visa). In some cases, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can issue a Return-Home certificate that is valid for ten days from the embassy of the visitor's native country, thus eliminating the need for an exit visa.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{utilitarian}} rationalization {{for research}} on human beings is the ends justify the means. This means that any sort of research on a human being is justified {{by the possibility of}} successfully saving others. For example, all cancer research would be justified by the possibility of finding a cure for cancer, which would inevitably save the life of many others. The utilitarian argument focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number of people or the greater good. Under the utilitarian justification it is a person's duty to sacrifice himself or herself if it would save others as long as the individual person's societal worth is less than the combined societal worth of the others. Therefore, if either <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> a homeless person must die to save the lives of many others, the homeless person must sacrifice himself since he is worth less to society than the doctor.|$|E
