Specifically, the longitudinal integral scale of turbulence, the size scale of turbulence, the number of turbine blades, and free stream velocity were varied.

The sound pressure level was found to vary directly with the integral scale of the ingested turbulence but not with its intensity level.

40|$|Landing gear noise {{prediction}} method is developed using Building-Cube Method (BCM). The BCM is a multiblock-structured Cartesian mesh flow solver, {{which aims to}} enable practical large-scale computation. The computational domain is composed of assemblage of various sizes of building blocks where small blocks are used to capture flow features in detail. Because of Cartesian-based mesh, easy and fast mesh generation for complicated geometries is achieved. The airframe noise is predicted through the coupling of incompressible Navier-Stokes flow solver and the aeroacoustic analogy-based Curle’s equation.

50|$|Traffic {{operations}} {{noise is}} affected significantly by vehicle speeds, since sound energy roughly doubles for each increment of ten {{miles an hour}} in vehicle velocity; an exception to this rule occurs at very low speeds where braking and acceleration noise dominate over <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>noise.</b> Small reductions in vehicle noise occurred in the 1970s as states and provinces enforced unmuffled vehicle ordinances.

Hybrid vehicles are so quiet at low speeds that they create a pedestrian safety issue when reversing or maneuvering when parking etc. (but not when going travelling forward), and so are typically fitted with electric vehicle warning sounds.|$|E

The lift distribution obtained in this analysis has different characteristics from those of the conventional distribution. The present distribution shows negative lift values over a quarter of the span from the blade tip, and a maximum lift at about the midspan.

50|$|In 1943, Schubauer and Skramstad (S and S) {{created a}} wind tunnel {{that went to}} {{extremes}} to damp mechanical vibrations and sounds that might affect the airflow studies along a smooth flat plate. Using a vertical array of evenly spaced hot wire anemometers in the boundary layer (BL) airflow, they substantiated the existence of T-S oscillations by showing SH velocity fluctuations in the BL laminae. The T-S waves gradually increased in amplitude until a few random spikes of in-phase amplitude appeared, triggering focal vortices (turbulent spots), with noise. A further increase in flow rate resulted suddenly in many vortices, <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>noise</b> and a great increase in resistance to flow. An oscillation of a mass in a fluid creates a sound wave; SH oscillations of a mass of fluid, flowing in that same fluid along a boundary, must result in SH sound, reflected off the boundary, transversely into the fluid.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} Computational Aeroacoustics can only very likely be dated {{back to the}} middle of the 1980s, with a {{publication}} of Hardin and Lamkin who claimed, that [...] "... the field of computational fluid mechanics has been advancing rapidly in the past few years and now offers the hope that [...] "computational aeroacoustics," [...] where noise is computed directly from a first principles determination of continuous velocity and vorticity fields, might be possible, ..."Later in a publication 1986 the same authors introduced the abbreviation CAA. The term was initially used for a low Mach number approach (Expansion of the acoustic perturbation field about an incompressible flow) as it is described under EIF. Later in the beginning 1990s the growing CAA community picked up the term and extensively used it for any kind of numerical method describing the noise radiation from an aeroacoustic source or the propagation of sound waves in an inhomogeneous flow field. Such numerical methods can be far field integration methods (e.g. FW-H) as well as direct numerical methods optimized for the solutions (e.g.) of a mathematical model describing the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>noise</b> generation and/or propagation.
