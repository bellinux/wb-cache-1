25|$|Going into spring {{training}} in , newly acquired Kevin Kouzmanoff was slated {{for the job}} at third base. This left Branyan as a bench player going into the season. Branyan addressed the issues stating that {{he just wanted to}} play, no matter the circumstances. However, Branyan was seen as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>option</b> if Kouzmanoff failed to produce at third base and at the plate. He got {{off to a slow start}} out of {{spring training}}.|$|E
25|$|If {{the team}} is {{uncertain}} {{about the nature of}} the pitch or simply wants to play safe, they often bat first. If the opposition bowling is strong, batting first is often considered <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>option.</b> Sometimes the nature of the pitch deteriorates while the game progresses, making batting more difficult especially if facing spin bowling. Another advantage of batting first is that the batting team sets a target for the team batting second to chase. This can create pressure on the teams batsmen and cause problems for the team batting second.|$|E

TITSA even run two daily services up Mount Teide – from Puerto de la Cruz (348) and from Los Christianos/Las Americas (342) up to the Teide Parador, Teleferico cable car, Montana Blanca and El Portillo.

25|$|When {{absorbed by}} cancer cells and exposed to light radiation, the {{reaction}} that creates reactive oxygen damages the DNA, proteins, and lipids {{that make up}} the cancer cell. This cellular damage forces the cancerous cell to go through apoptosis, which can lead to the reduction in size of a tumor. Once the light radiation treatment is finished the fullerene will reabsorb the free radicals to prevent damage of other tissues. Since this treatment focuses on cancer cells, it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>option</b> for patients whose cancer cells are within reach of light radiation. As this research continues, the treatment may penetrate deeper into the body and be absorbed by cancer cells more effectively.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{negative}} reactions, concerns and criticisms {{as a result}} of the December 2008 public meetings and online hearing where the preliminary findings of the MAPS (Mobility, Access and Pricing Study) were discussed. One participant questioned the rationale for having to pay to drive on a public street. Others considered that congestion pricing is a regressive tax imposing a greater burden on those without <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>option</b> to ride public transit and on low-income commuters. Other considered too expensive to pay USD 6.00 for a short duration trips. Zone residents with children and inflexible schedules complained they would be unfairly affected. Another major concern is the lack of reliability and capacity of San Francisco's existing network of transit services, limiting commuters to switch to public transport once the congestion pricing is implemented.|$|E
25|$|At mealtimes {{very dry}} wines with little {{minerals}} are recommended with oysters and seafood: their acidity reveals the salinity of the shellfish. The most fragrant wines go well with shellfish, fish, or poached white meat. For stews the acidity {{of white wine}} counterbalances the weight of fat. If the sauce is well balanced with an intense ingredient (lemon juice or mustard) a more opulent wine can be recommended: sweet or dry wine aged in barrels. Sweet wines either just sweet or fortified are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>option</b> for exotic dishes with sweet spices (dishes with cinnamon, vanilla etc.). Fortified white wines are recommended with foie gras. Sparkling wines can be taken {{at any time during}} the meal, their diversity allows this. A choice of sparkling wine also allows the retention of the same wine from the beginning to the end of the meal.|$|E

2500|$|The early 19th century saw {{contraceptives}} {{promoted to}} the poorer classes for the first time: birth control advocates in England included Jeremy Bentham and Richard Carlile, and noted American advocates included Robert Dale Owen and Charles Knowlton. Writers on contraception tended to prefer other methods of birth control, citing both the expense of condoms and their unreliability (they were often riddled with holes, and often fell off or broke), but they discussed condoms as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>option</b> for some, and as the only contraceptive that also protected from disease.

40|$|Image {{restoration}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} fundamental issues in imaging science. Total variation (TV) regularization is widely used in image restoration problems for its capability to preserve edges. In the literature, however, it is also well known for producing staircase-like artifacts. Usually, the high-order total variation (HTV) regularizer is <b>an</b> <b>good</b> <b>option</b> except its over-smoothing property. In this work, we study a minimization problem where the objective includes an usual $l_ 2 $ data-fidelity term and an overlapping group sparsity total variation regularizer which can avoid staircase effect and allow edges preserving in the restored image. We also proposed a fast algorithm for solving the corresponding minimization problem and compare our method with the state-of-the-art TV based methods and HTV based method. The numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of PSNR, relative error and computing time. Comment: 11 pages, 37 figure...|$|R

30|$|In this study, 7 nodes {{have been}} taken into {{consideration}} for hidden layer which provides good results. However, this number is not an optimal selection for any model and can be selected as per the requirements {{and the size of}} the data. The back propagation algorithm can be utilized in Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS) because of its efficiency in reducing prediction error. ATIS is a system which makes prediction based on the information stored in the database [34]. More the predictions are accurate, better the suggestions of ATIS would be. Therefore, the thirst for developing more robust and accurate short term prediction model is in demand. Our model achieved the better R 2 score (0.9962) among other models for short term traffic flow prediction on two lane undivided highways with mixed traffic conditions. Moreover, if accuracy can be sacrificed a little and processing time is more important, then methods like SVM and conventional regression-b estimators can be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>options</b> rather than going with ANN.|$|R
