5|$|It was {{announced}} at a general meeting on 22 March 1895 that the club could finally <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> Goodison Park. Mahon revealed that Everton were buying Goodison Park for £650 {{less than the}} price of Anfield three years earlier, with Goodison Park having more land and a 25% larger capacity. The motion to purchase Goodison Park was passed unanimously. Dr. Baxter also lent the club £5,000 to redeem the mortgage early {{at a rate of}} 3½%. By this time the redrawing of political boundaries put Walton, and hence Goodison Park, inside the City of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2008, Fey {{once again}} portrayed Palin, {{this time in}} a sketch {{featuring}} the real John McCain, the last of numerous sketches featuring the Arizona Senator. In the sketch, McCain poked fun at himself and his campaign, as well as Barack Obama's purchase of airtime on several major networks earlier in the week. In the sketch, McCain and Palin can only <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> airtime on QVC, a home-shopping channel. McCain's wife, Cindy, also made an appearance in the sketch as herself.|$|E
5|$|The Koryak {{of eastern}} Siberia {{have a story}} about the fly agaric (wapaq) which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity Vahiyinin ("Existence") spat onto earth, and his spittle became the wapaq, and his saliva becomes the warts. After {{experiencing}} the power of the wapaq, Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it. Among the Koryaks, one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the mushrooms.|$|E
50|$|The Moscow and Gorky {{automobile}} plants produced automobiles for the public—despite few Soviet citizens <b>affording</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a car—and {{the expansion}} of steel production and other industrial materials made the manufacture of {{a greater number of}} cars possible. Car and truck production, for example, reached 200,000 in 1931.|$|R
5000|$|Congested housing, no {{requirement}} that landlords provide working toilets, and virtually no urban planning [...] "have combined to create lethal sanitation {{conditions in the}} capital". The poor infrastructure [...] "means toilet-users may have to use up to four gallons of water each time they flush", according to a civil servant interviewed by IRIN News in 2008. “At US 25 cents a gallon, for some it is a choice between flushing and <b>affording</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> food {{at the end of}} the day”.|$|R
50|$|British {{historian}} and archaeologist Sheppard Frere wonders how Carausius {{was able to}} win support from the army when his command had been sea-based, and speculates that he had perhaps been involved in an unrecorded victory in Britain, connected with Diocletian's assumption of the title Britannicus Maximus in 285, and signs of destruction in Romano-British towns at this time. The campaign against the Bagaudae, however, was evidently land-based {{and may have been}} responsible for Carausius's popularity with the army. Equally, if the accusations of larceny are true, he could perhaps have <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> their loyalty.|$|R
5|$|Money was {{a problem}} in the McCartney house, as Jim only earned up to £6.00 a week, which was less than his wife. Because of their {{financial}} situation, the McCartney family could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a television set until the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, and never owned a car. His two sons were the first in the McCartney family line to buy cars. When The Beatles became successful, Jim had to leave Forthlin Road because fans used to stand outside and stare through the windows, which made him feel uncomfortable and nervous. Eight years after Mary's death, Jim married , on 24 November 1964. Williams had a daughter from a previous marriage, Ruth, whom Jim legally adopted.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} large debts, which {{at one point}} {{amounted}} to 4million euros, the club could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> new players. As a consequence, the first team at the time consisted mostly of youth players mixed {{with a couple of}} foreign players brought to the club on free transfers. In the autumn of 2006, the leadership of the club changed, with the debt still amounting to over 3million euros, and it was not until January 2011 that the club announced that the debt had been paid in full. During this period, Maribor never finished above third place in the Slovenian league, and were runners-up in the Slovenian Cup twice. They were, however, one of the 11 winners of the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup, in which they defeated Spanish side Villarreal in the final round, only a couple of months after Villareal had played in the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} few years, the new regime optimistically engaged in reform and {{experimentation}} {{and for the first}} time many Poles could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> cars, televisions and other consumer goods. The authorities made sure that the workers received proper wages. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. The intellectuals had censorship eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were strengthened. There was some cultural and political relaxation and an improved freedom of speech environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly Polityka of the Polish party. Massive investments were made, expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture, based on purchases of Western technology. The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.|$|E
5000|$|By most accounts, {{the term}} has its modern origins on October 17, 1945, when {{thousands}} of supporters of Juan Perón gathered {{in front of the}} Casa Rosada making a demonstration to demand Perón's release from prison. While waiting for Perón on this hot day, many men in the crowd removed their shirts—hence the term [...] "shirtless". However, there is much debate among scholars in regards to the origins of the label. Some claim that the word was coined to describe the working poor, the social class from which Perón drew the greatest amount of his political backing, who were so downtrodden that they could not have <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> shirts. Perón's use of the labor unions as a means of consolidating his power lends credibility to the claim.|$|R
6000|$|Turning {{from the}} {{question}} of quantity of food to that of quality, we may discern the same ascetic tendency. Not simply a restricted diet, but a comparatively low diet, is thought proper for children. The current opinion is, {{that they should have}} but little animal food. Among the less wealthy classes, economy seems to have dictated this opinion--the wish has been father to the thought. Parents not <b>affording</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> much meat, answer the petitions of juveniles with--"Meat is not good for little boys and girls;" [...] and this, at first probably nothing but a convenient excuse, has by repetition grown into an article of faith. While the classes with whom cost is no consideration, have been swayed partly by the example of the majority, partly by the influence of nurses drawn from the lower classes, and in some measure by the reaction against past animalism.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, {{the former}} Greek Queen {{was sold to}} Carnival Cruise Lines; and the ship was renamed — {{this time as the}} SS Carnivale. As Carnival's market {{expanded}} and the company was able <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>buying</b> new ships, the ship transferred into a Latin market subsidiary cruise line.|$|R
5|$|Rural {{families}} that sold a large agricultural surplus {{to the market}} not only could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> more charcoal, tea, oil, and wine, but they could also amass enough funds to establish secondary means of production for generating more wealth. Besides necessary agricultural foodstuffs, farming families could often produce wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods they sold through brokers. Farmers in Suzhou often specialized in raising bombyx mori to produce silk wares, while in Fujian, Sichuan, and Guangdong farmers often grew sugarcane. In order to ensure the prosperity of rural areas, technical applications for public works projects and improved agricultural techniques were essential. The vast irrigation system of China had to be furnished with multitudes of wheelwrights mass-producing standardized waterwheels and square-pallet chain pumps that could lift water from lower planes to higher irrigation planes.|$|E
25|$|Typical light {{refreshments}} include cake, cookies, popcorn, pretzels, {{nuts and}} seeds, soft drinks, and beer. In addition, chickpeas are customarily served {{because they are}} a round-shaped food eaten by mourners (as they symbolize the cyclical nature of life). Beer is served as it is cheap and most can <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> it.|$|E
25|$|The name „Volksflugzeug“ is only {{acceptable}} for {{a plane that}} wide layers of a Volk can <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> and upkeep. However, in the foreseeable time one can neither count on a plane of that type nor {{on the creation of}} the necessary conditions for it, such as take-off, landing and maintenance infrastructures.|$|E
50|$|The {{convertibility}} law reduced inflation sharply {{preserved the}} value of the currency. That raised {{the quality of life for}} many citizens, who could again <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> travel abroad, <b>buy</b> imported goods or ask for credit in dollars at traditional interest rates. The fixed exchange rate reduced the cost of imports, which produced a flight of dollars from the country and a massive loss of industrial infrastructure and employment in industry.|$|R
50|$|Birdseye {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} in the frozen food industry. Birdseye Company used {{vertical}} integration to manage their business. Because of the fact that during these times, there was not a well developed infrastructure to produce and sell, Birdseye developed its own system by using vertical integration. As many members of the supply chain such as farmers and small food retailers, couldn't <b>afford</b> high costs <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> equipment, Birdseye provided them with equipment.|$|R
500|$|Liverpool's {{recovery}} {{depended on}} new players being acquired and, in his autobiography, Shankly recalled the struggles {{he had with}} the board to make them realise the club's potential {{and the need to}} spend money on good players. He said there were times when he felt like walking out. He found a valuable ally in Eric Sawyer, of the Littlewoods pools organisation, who joined the board not long after Shankly's appointment and shared Shankly's vision of Liverpool as the best club in England. At one board meeting in 1961 when Shankly insisted the club make offers for two players in Scotland, the board's initial response was that [...] "we can't afford them" [...] but Sawyer stepped in and said: [...] "We can't <b>afford</b> not <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> them".|$|R
25|$|The scholar, educationist and {{reformer}} Vidyasagar came to Kolkata {{with his}} father from Birshingha in Midnapore in 1829 and settled in Panchanantala, a locality within Bowbazar. Thakur Das Bandhopadhyay, Vidyasagar’s father, could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> oil for lamps; and thus young Vidyasagar would sit under a roadside lamppost at night to do his lessons.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} aspect of the preparation of soul food was the reuse of cooking lard. Because many cooks could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> new shortening to replace what they used, they would pour the liquefied cooking grease into a container. After cooling completely, the grease re-solidified and could be used again the next time the cook required lard.|$|E

40|$|We {{surveyed}} local people’s {{collection and}} use of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) as well as knowledge about the national park regulations and villagers’ perception about those regulations, in three villages in the West Java. Kutajaya villagers used five groups of NTFPs, firewood and fodder being most commonly collected and medicinal plants, food, and construction materials less frequently. In Hanjawar, seven groups of NTFPs were used: foliage other than food and household appliances {{in addition to the}} above. The most frequently used were fodder plants and firewood. In Majasari, eight groups of NTFPs were used, palm sugar in addition, which was the most frequently collected. Food and firewood were also important NTFPs exploited there. The typical personal characteristics of the interviewed NTFP users were low education level, agricultural employment (except in Kutajaya) and a low rate of agricultural land ownership. Perceptions about national park regulations were similar among the three villages. Their knowledge of the regulations was low, usually limited to such regulations as the prohibitions of cutting trees down, hunting wildlife, opening new land for cultivation, and collecting firewood and cattle feed. They were ready to accept the former three restrictions, but they tended to be against the prohibitions on firewood and cattle feed collection because there was no alternative place to collect such resources. As for the prohibition of tree cutting, the Hanjawar and Majasari villagers hoped that there would be exceptions to the regulations to meet their minimum needs for house construction. They argued that they could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>buying</b> non-wood construction materials due to low income levels. In addition they considered that cutting one or two trees would not have significant negative impacts on forests as they each would be certainly replaced by new seedlings growing naturally or by seedlings {{they would be willing to}} plant...|$|R
50|$|Douglas' {{previous}} {{thinking about}} the airliner market {{seemed to be coming}} true; the transition to turbine power looked likely to be to turboprops rather than turbojets. The pioneering 40-60-seat Vickers Viscount was in service and proving popular with passengers and airlines: it was faster, quieter and more comfortable than piston-engined types. Another British rival was the 90-seat Bristol Britannia, and Douglas's main rival in the large airliner market, Lockheed, had committed to the short/medium range 80-100-seat turboprop Electra, with a launch order from American Airlines for 35 and other orders flowing in. Meanwhile, the Comet remained grounded, the French 90-passenger twin jet Sud Aviation Caravelle prototype had just flown for the first time, and the 707 was not expected to be available until late 1958. The major airlines were reluctant to commit themselves to the huge financial and technical challenge of jet aircraft. However, no one could <b>afford</b> not <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> jets if their competitors did.|$|R
6000|$|... 1. The most {{generally}} useful book, to myself, hitherto, in such {{little time}} as I have for reading about plants, has been Lindley's 'Ladies' Botany'; {{but the most}} rich and true I have yet found in illustration, the 'Histoire des Plantes,'[35] by Louis Figuier. I should like those of my readers who can <b>afford</b> it <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> both these books; the first named, at any rate, as I shall always refer to it for structural drawings, and on points of doubtful classification; while the second contains much general knowledge, expressed with some really human intelligence and feeling; besides some good and singularly just history of botanical discovery {{and the men who}} guided it. The botanists, indeed, tell me proudly, [...] "Figuier is no authority." [...] But who wants authority! Is there nothing known yet about plants, then, which can be taught to a boy or girl, without referring them to an 'authority'? ...|$|R

He said he represents the owners of some rental properties who were counting on that monthly revenue for their retirement and said most homeowners cannot <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> re-build or <b>buy</b> in that area with the incentive package.|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Rural-urban migrations {{have contributed}} to the steady {{increase}} in the population of Cape Town. Many of the migrants have settled in informal settlements because they cannot <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> rent or <b>buy</b> decent housing. Many of these settlements are however located on marginal and often poorly drained land. Consequently, most of these settlements are prone to flooding after prolonged rainfall. Current flood risk management techniques implemented by the authorities of the Cape Town City Council (CTCC) are ideal for formally planned settlements but are not designed to support informal settlements [...] . This study sought to investigate a methodology that the CTCC could use to improve flood risk assessment...|$|R

The only constraint is that excessive spending by any sector of the economy (whether households, firms or public) has the potential to cause inflationary pressures.|$|E
