5|$|The {{difficult}} {{habitat and}} retiring {{nature of the}} invisible rail mean that information on its lifestyle is sparse, and there are few confirmed sightings. Recorded food items include sago shoots and insects. It also feeds <b>at</b> <b>cut</b> sago plants, although {{it is unclear whether}} it is eating the decaying plant or searching for other edible items. It swallows small stones, as do all rails, to help break up its food in the gizzard.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working <b>at</b> <b>Cut</b> and Stack.|$|E
2500|$|The group's early {{recordings}} (up {{until their}} 1985 12" [...] EP [...] ) were recorded as [...] "econo" [...] (Pedro slang for inexpensive, short for [...] "economical") as possible – {{the group would}} book studio time after midnight <b>at</b> <b>cut</b> rates, tech their own shows, practice the songs before going into the studio, record on less-expensive used tape, and record the songs in the order they intended to have them on the record rather than waste time editing the master tape during the sequencing phase. In fact, contrary to standard practice even in indie rock, Minutemen sometimes saw records {{as a way to}} promote their tours, not the other way around.|$|E

60|$|The {{duties of}} Master Pugsy Maloney at {{the offices of}} Cosy Moments were not heavy; and he was {{accustomed}} to occupy his large store of leisure by reading narratives dealing with life in the prairies, which he acquired at a neighbouring shop <b>at</b> <b>cut</b> rates in consideration of their being shop-soiled. It was while he was engrossed in one of these, on the morning following the visit of Mr. Parker, that the seedy-looking man made his appearance. He walked in from the street, and stood before Master Maloney.|$|E
6000|$|Parsons {{had made}} a huge {{symmetrical}} pile of thick white and red blankets twisted and rolled to accentuate their woolly richness, heaped up in a warm disorder, with large window tickets inscribed in blazing red letters: [...] "Cosy Comfort <b>at</b> <b>Cut</b> Prices," [...] and [...] "Curl up and Cuddle below Cost." [...] Regardless of the daylight he had turned up the electric light {{on that side of}} the window to reflect a warm glow upon the heap, and behind, in pursuit of contrasted bleakness, he was now hanging long strips of grey silesia and chilly coloured linen dusterings.|$|E

60|$|The thrushes {{are singing}} now {{as if they}} would speak to the winds, because their big brother Jack, the Spring, was not far off. I am reading Voltaire and Gibbon, {{although}} I wrote to Reynolds the other day to prove reading of no use; I have not seen Hunt since, I am a good deal with Dilke and Brown, we are very thick; they are very kind to me, they are well. I don't think I could stop in Hampstead but for their neighbourhood. I hear Hazlitt's lectures regularly, his last was on Gray, Collins, Young, etc., and he gave a very fine piece of discriminating Criticism on Swift, Voltaire, and Rabelais. I was very disappointed at his treatment of Chatterton. I generally meet with many I know there. Lord Byron's 4th Canto is expected out, and I heard somewhere, that Walter Scott has a new Poem in readiness. I am sorry that Wordsworth has left a bad impression wherever he visited in town by his egotism, Vanity, and bigotry. Yet {{he is a great}} poet if not a philosopher. I have not yet read Shelley's Poem, I do not suppose you have it yet, at the Teignmouth libraries. These double letters must come rather heavy, I hope you have a moderate portion of cash, but don't fret at all, if you have not--Lord! I intend to play <b>at</b> <b>cut</b> and run as well as Falstaff, that is to say, before he got so lusty.|$|E

When I got to Boston I introduced [...] myself to Mr. Phil Newell, the one-legged man you used to work [...] for, and he took me to police headquarters, and now I am [...] stopping here at a boarding-house on Hammond Street. The police [...] sent a detective to me, and he is going to find them heirlooms [...] and that rascal of a Deck Mumpers, or whatever his name is, or [...] know the reason why. If he finds the things, I'm to give him [...] two hundred dollars in cash; if he don't, I pay his travelling [...] expenses and no more. I wouldn't make such a bargain, but I [...] know all you boys want the things back and I can't do the [...] running after the thief. It's a waste of money, but it can't be [...] helped.

After trees are felled by hand, brownpots strip the branches and cut the logs into the appropriate lengths using chainsaws. Brownpots are the only individuals allowed to use chainsaws at any stage of bonfire.|$|E
