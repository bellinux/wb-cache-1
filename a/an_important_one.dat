5|$|Erik Chisholm {{was the son}} of John Chisholm, master house painter, and his wife, Elizabeth McGeachy Macleod. He left Queen's Park School, Glasgow, at {{the early}} age of 13 due to ill-health but showed a talent for music {{composition}} and some of his pieces were published during his childhood. He had piano lessons with Philip Halstead at Glasgow's Athenaeum School of Music, now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and later studied the organ under Herbert Walton, the organist at Glasgow Cathedral. By the time he was 12 he was giving organ recitals including <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one</b> in Kingston upon Hull. The pianist Leff Pouishnoff then became his principal teacher and mentor. In 1927 he travelled to Nova Scotia, Canada, where he was appointed the organist and choirmaster at the Westminster Presbyterian Church, New Glasgow, and director of music at Pictou Academy.|$|E
5|$|Wind is {{the flow}} of gases on a large scale. On {{the surface of the}} Earth, wind {{consists}} of the bulk movement of air. In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspects, <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one</b> being its velocity (wind speed); another the density of the gas involved; another its energy content or wind energy.|$|E
5|$|The role of {{wildfire}} is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one</b> {{for plant}} and animal species diversity. Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire. Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire. Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park, studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded than the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities. One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types. The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and this is particularly true of the Lodgepole Pine. Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill Lodgepole Pine seeds, lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post wildfire regeneration of this species. In accordance with {{a better understanding of the}} role wildfire plays in the environment, the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem.|$|E

Between 1980 and 1982 the club endured three {{consecutive}} relegations, the first club ever to experience this unwanted feat. With Terry Cooper as manager the team regained some stability. But by 1989 the fans were frustrated {{after several years}} of austerity. The signing of Taylor provided them with a long sought-after goal-scoring hero.|$|E

25|$|The temple was, most likely, {{dedicated}} to the Gallo-Roman god Mercurius Cissonius, a syncretic combination of Mercury and the gallic god Cissonius. The temple worships Mercury as the god of travellers and trade and being located on the main street through the city would have been visited by both.

25|$|In {{statistics}} and numerical analysis, {{the problem of}} numerical methods for linear least squares is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one</b> because linear regression models {{are one of the}} most important types of model, both as formal statistical models and for exploration of data sets.

Hence it is appropriate that considerable effort has been devoted to the task of ensuring that these computations are undertaken efficiently and with due regard to numerical precision.|$|E

This was followed by his posting as Local Director of the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt on 12 July. He married Countess Maria Renata von und zu Trauttmansdorff (1741–1808) a week later on 19 July 1779. He received promotion to Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 19 March 1785 and two days later was named Supreme Director of the Theresian Military Academy.|$|E

25|$|From {{the late}} 1960s onwards, several studies {{attempted}} to establish soma as a psychotropic substance. A number of proposals were made, included <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one</b> in 1968 by Robert Gordon Wasson, an amateur mycologist, who (on Vedic evidence) asserted that soma was an inebriant, and suggested fly-agaric mushroom, Amanita muscaria, as the likely candidate. Wasson and his co-author, Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, drew parallels between Vedic descriptions and reports of Siberian {{uses of the}} fly-agaric in shamanic ritual. Furthermore, the mountainous origin of soma matches the habitat of fly-agaric, and when discussing soma, the Vedas do not mention any part of a flowering tree.|$|E
25|$|England {{toured the}} West Indies in 1953/54, {{after losing the}} first two Tests England came back to draw the series 2–2 with wins {{in the third and}} fifth Tests. Evans missed the fourth Test with an injury and was {{replaced}} by Dick Spooner, however Evans returned for the fifth Test where he played the longest innings of his career, batting 142 minutes for 28. Although not the largest innings of his career it was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one</b> as he shared a 108-run partnership with Len Hutton, whose double century built England a substantial first innings lead. Evans finished the series with 72 runs at 12.00 and six dismissals.|$|E

Since 8 June 2009, the television coverage has been shown on the club website. Sevilla issue a physical and digital newspaper the day after every match and on the same day as <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one,</b> as well as a magazine before home games.

25|$|He {{submitted}} {{his memoir}} on equation theory several times, {{but it was}} never published in his lifetime due to various events. As noted before, his first attempt was refused by Cauchy, but in February 1830 following Cauchy's suggestion he submitted it to the Academy's secretary Joseph Fourier, to be considered for the Grand Prix of the Academy. Unfortunately, Fourier died soon after, and the memoir was lost. The prize would be awarded that year to Niels Henrik Abel posthumously and also to Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Despite the lost memoir, Galois published three papers that year, one of which laid the foundations for Galois theory. The second one was about the numerical resolution of equations (root finding in modern terminology). The third was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one</b> in number theory, in which the concept of a finite field was first articulated.|$|E
25|$|An {{apparent}} magnitude 4.18 type A0p star, Lambda Boötis is {{the prototype of}} a class of chemically peculiar stars, only some of which pulsate as Delta Scuti-type stars. The distinction between the Lambda Boötis stars as a class of stars with peculiar spectra, and the delta Scuti stars whose class describes pulsation in low-overtone pressure modes, is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one.</b> While many Lambda Boötis stars pulsate and are delta Scuti stars, not many delta Scuti stars have Lambda Boötis peculiarities, since the Lambda Boötis stars are a much rarer class whose members can be found {{both inside and outside}} the delta Scuti instability strip. Lambda Boötis stars are dwarf stars that can be either spectral class A or F. Like BL Boötis-type stars they are metal-poor. Scientists have had difficulty explaining the characteristics of Lambda Boötis stars, partly because only around 60 confirmed members exist, but also due to heterogeneity in the literature. Lambda has an absolute magnitude of 1.8.|$|E
