40|$|Isolation of {{the brain}} from other tissue types in {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) images {{is an important step}} in many types of neuro-imaging research using both humans and animal subjects. The importance of brain extraction is well appreciated—numerous approaches have been published and the benefits of good extraction methods to subsequent processing are well known. We describe a tool—the marker based watershed scalper (MBWSS) —for isolating the brain in T 1 -weighted MR images built using filtering and segmentation components from the Insight Toolkit (ITK) framework. The key elements of MBWSS—the watershed transform from markers and aggressive filtering with large kernels—are techniques that have rarely been used in neuroimaging segmentation applications. MBWSS is able to reliably isolate the brain without expensive preprocessing steps, such as registration to an atlas, and is therefore useful as the first stage of processing pipelines. It is an informative example of the level of accuracy achievable without using priors in the form of <b>atlases,</b> <b>shape</b> models or libraries of examples. We validate the MBWSS using a publicly available dataset, a paediatric cohort, an adolescent cohort, intra-surgical scans and demonstrate flexibility of the approach by modifying the method to extract macaque brains...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{construction}} of 3 D anatomical <b>shape</b> <b>atlas</b> {{has been extensively}} studied in medical image analysis research {{for a variety of}} applications. Among the multiple steps of <b>shape</b> <b>atlas</b> construction, establishing anatomical correspondences across subjects is probably the most critical and challenging one. The adaptive focus deformable model (AFDM) [16] was proposed to tackle this problem by exploiting crossscale geometry characteristics of 3 D anatomy surfaces. Although the effectiveness of AFDM has been proved in various studies, its performance is highly dependent on the quality of 3 D surface meshes. In this paper, we propose a new framework for 3 D anatomical <b>shape</b> <b>atlas</b> construction. Our method aims to robustly establish correspondences across different subjects and simultaneously generate high-quality surface meshes without removing shape detail. Mathematically, a new energy term is embedded into the original energy function of AFDM to preserve surface mesh qualities during the deformable surface matching. Shape details and smoothness constraints are encoded into the new energy term using the Laplacian representation An expectation-maximization style algorithm is designed to optimize multiple energy terms alternatively until convergence. We demonstrate the performance of our method via two diverse applications: 3 D high resolution CT cardiac images and rat brain MRIs with multiple structures...|$|R

40|$|A hybrid {{framework}} of probabilistic <b>atlas</b> and statistical <b>shape</b> and appearance model (SSAM) is proposed to achieve 3 D prostate segmentation. An initial 3 D segmentation {{of the prostate}} is obtained by registering the probabilistic atlas to the test dataset with deformable Demons registration. The initial results obtained are used to initialize multiple SSAMs corresponding to the apex, central and base regions of the prostate gland to incorporate local variabilities. Multiple mean parametric models of shape and appearance are derived from principal component analysis of prior shape and intensity information of the prostate from the training data. The parameters are then modified with the prior knowledge of the optimization space to achieve 2 D segmentation. The 2 D labels are registered to the 3 D labels generated using probabilistic atlas to constrain the pose variation and generate valid 3 D shapes. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity coefficient value of 0. 89 ± 0. 11 and mean Hausdorff distance of 3. 05 ± 2. 25 mm when validated with 15 prostate volumes of a public dataset in a leave-one-out validation framework.

We do not compute continuous approximations of objects so that we have neither approximations nor interpolation errors. The first step of our method performs a rigid transformation that aligns the shapes as best as possible and decreases geometrical differences between them. The next step consists in searching the progressive transformations of one object toward the other one, that iteratively adds or suppresses pixels. These operations are based on geodesic distance transformation and lead to an optimal (linear) algorithm. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceStatistical {{analysis}} of shapes, performed by constructing an atlas composed {{of an average}} model of shapes within a population and associated deformation maps, is a fundamental aspect of medical imaging studies. Usual methods for constructing a <b>shape</b> <b>atlas</b> require point correspondences across subjects, which are difficult in practice. By contrast, methods based on currents do not require correspondence. However, existing atlas construction methods using currents suffer from two limitations. First, the template current {{is not in the}} form of a topologically correct mesh, which makes direct analysis on shapes difficult. Second, the deformations are parametrized by vectors at the same location as the normals of the template current which often provides a parametrization that is more dense than required. In this paper, we propose a novel method for constructing <b>shape</b> <b>atlases</b> using currents where topology of the template is preserved and deformation parameters are optimized independently of the shape parameters. We use an L 1 -type prior that enables us to adaptively compute sparse and low dimensional parameterization of deformations.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} takes a fresh {{approach to}} the study of the exchange in scientific knowledge between Europe and continental East Asia in the 17 th and 18 th centuries, with a particular interest in cartographic practice. The mapping of territories controlled by the Great Qing, initiated at the behest of the Kangxi emperor (r. 1661 - 1722) and executed by teams of surveyors consisting of Qing officials and European missionaries, sets the stage and forms the backbone of this study. This unprecedented mapping project, the largest the world had ever seen at the time, is revisited in three major steps. First, I illustrate how a new Qing cartographic practice was established, the direct result of a converging of interests between the Kangxi emperor, the Jesuit order and the French Académie des sciences. Next, the unique and collaborative character of the mapping project is emphasized, with attention to the wide variety of individuals and institutions involved in the land surveys that took place between 1708 and 1718. In a last step, I explore the subsequent circulation of printed maps and <b>atlases,</b> <b>shaped</b> by individual connections and spanning the entire Eurasian continent. In all, I aim to reach a deeper understanding of how the circulation of cartographic knowledge and practices occurred between and within Europe and continental East Asia at the turn of the 18 th century. This is done by tracing the trajectories of two kinds of material objects: surveying instruments and maps. By closely following the process of their many adaptations, I reassemble the constantly changing web of social relations that emanates from studying these trajectories. As a result, I argue, an improved cartography of cross-cultural circulation emerges, one that reveals unstudied patterns and actors while emphasizing their basic connectedness. This approach allows me to nuance several of the dichotomies that have pervaded the literature for decades: traditional versus scientific practice, global versus local networks, circulation versus production of knowledge, and Chinese versus European elements. As such, a fresh perspective emerges that presents new possibilities for studying cross-cultural scientific exchanges in history. status: publishe...|$|R

Atlas-based parametric shape {{analysis was used to}} analyze ventricular geometries of eight adolescent or adult single-ventricle CHD patients with tricuspid atresia and Fontans. These patients were compared with an “atlas” of non-congenital asymptomatic volunteers, resulting in a set of Z-scores which quantify deviations from the control population distribution on a patient-by-patient basis. We examined the potential of these scores to: (1) quantify abnormalities of ventricular geometry in single ventricle physiologies relative to the normal population; (2) comprehensively quantify wall motion in CHD patients; and (3) identify possible relationships between ventricular shape and wall motion that may reflect underlying functional defects or remodeling in CHD patients. CHD ventricular geometries at end-diastole and end-systole were individually compared with statistical shape properties of an asymptomatic population from the Cardiac <b>Atlas</b> Project. <b>Shape</b> analysis-derived model properties, and myocardial wall motions between end-diastole and end-systole, were compared with physician observations of clinical functional parameters. Relationships between altered shape and altered function were evaluated via correlations between atlas-based shape and wall motion scores. Atlas-based shape analysis identified a diverse set of specific quantifiable abnormalities in ventricular geometry or myocardial wall motion in all subjects. Moreover, this initial cohort displayed significant relationships between specific shape abnormalities such as increased ventricular sphericity and functional defects in myocardial deformation, such as decreased long-axis wall motion. These findings suggest that atlas-based ventricular shape analysis may be a useful new tool in the management of patients with CHD who are at risk of impaired ventricular wall mechanics and chamber remodeling...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the problem of detecting local changes or differences in shape between two samples of objects via the non-linear deformations required to map each object to an <b>atlas</b> standard. Local <b>shape</b> changes are then detected by high values of the random field of Hotelling’s T 2 statistics for detecting a change in mean of the vector deformations at each point in the object.

40|$|The {{development}} of faster and higher resolution MR imaging devices has made accessible mass quantities of image data. Much {{information can be}} extracted by analyzing these high spatial resolution images. For instance, tissue volumes, which can be measured through MR images, are used as an indicator in many clinical applications and research studies. Research studies involving tissue volume analysis often require the processing of {{a vast amount of}} data hence manual segmentation of the images by experts is very time-consuming. Data segmented by human experts are also likely to show inter- and intra-observer inconsistency. For these reasons, automated segmentation of MR images is of great importance and interest. MR images present many challenges for automated segmentation. In addition to noise, MR images are also corrupted by problems specific to MR imaging such as intensity inhomogeneity. Furthermore, poor contrast at tissue boundaries due to multiple tissues having similar MR intensities also present problems. On the other hand, strong contours may exist where boundaries are not desired, because multiple tissues with very different MR intensities may be present within the same anatomical structure. Prior information, such as spatial <b>atlases</b> and <b>shape</b> priors can be very powerful in these cases. In this thesis, we developed highly accurate and robust graph cuts-based method that automatically segments MR images. The images we are most interested in are those that cannot be correctly segmented using intensity information alone.

Specifically, we developed methods to incorporate spatial atlas, statistical and geometric shape priors with graph cuts for MR image segmentation.

40|$|Abstract. Models {{of object}} {{appearance}} based on {{principal components analysis}} provide powerful and versatile tools in computer vision and medical image analysis. A major shortcoming is that they rely entirely on the training data to extract principal modes of appearance variation and ignore underlying variables (e. g., subject age, gender). This paper introduces an appearance modeling framework based instead on generalized multi-linear regression. The training of regression appearance models is controlled by independent variables. This makes it straightforward to create model instances for specific values of these variables, which is akin to model interpolation. We demonstrate the new framework by creating an appearance model {{of the human brain}} from MR images of 36 subjects. Instances of the model created for different ages are compared with average <b>shape</b> <b>atlases</b> created from age-matched sub-populations. Relative tissue volumes vs. age in models are also compared with tissue volumes vs. subject age in the original images. In both experiments, we found excellent agreement between the regression models and the comparison data. We conclude that regression appearance models are a promising new technique for image analysis, with one potential application being the representation of a continuum of mutually consistent, age-specific atlases of the human brain. ...|$|R

They are Juelich histological atlas and Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical structural atlases. Both are probabilistic labelled and registered in MNI 152 space. Juelich model was created by averaging multi-subject post-mortem cyto and myelo-architectonic segmentations, which has detected 52 grey matter structures and 10 white matters ones. Harvard-Oxford models cover 48 cortical and 21 subcortical structural regions, computed by segmentation of T 1 -weighted images of healthy male and female. The joint process was possible choosing a reference atlas and then adding lacking anatomical structures. In our case, Juelich atlas was the template from which regions dearth were easily included choosing them from Harvard-Oxford <b>atlases.</b> This procedure, <b>shaped</b> with complete or partial union operations, gives rise to an hybrid atlas that covers 161 regions, in which 121 are the 100 % of Juelich, and other 40 are a variable percentage of Harvard-Oxford original brain volumes. The benefits of this hybrid atlas are the integration of fundamental neuroanatomy models useful for co-registration that in the standard template were absent, e. g. many frontal and temporal cortexes, subcallosal portions, cingulate gyrus and thalamus halves...|$|R
