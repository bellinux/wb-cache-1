5|$|Despite {{his father}} {{saying he was}} betrayed by his friend C. W. McAllister during their climb on the mountain, Homer accepts and is aided by two Sherpas, but fires them after waking up one night to find them {{secretly}} dragging him up. Realizing he lacks the strength and resources to reach the top, Homer enters a cave to find McAllister's frozen body and evidence proving it was Abraham who betrayed him. Tired <b>and</b> <b>ashamed,</b> Homer sticks his flag pole on the ledge. The ensuing crack collapses {{the rest of the}} mountain, making where he is on now the peak. Proud, he uses McAllister's body to sled down, where he is greeted by the crowd.|$|E
5|$|John Travolta as Edna Turnblad, Tracy's {{mother and}} laundry {{business}} owner, who is agoraphobic <b>and</b> <b>ashamed</b> of her obesity. Travolta's casting as Edna continued {{the tradition of}} having a man in drag portray the character, {{going back to the}} original 1988 film, which featured drag queen Divine as Edna and at Hairspray's Broadway version, which featured Harvey Fierstein as Edna. Executives at New Line Cinema originally expected the part to be filled by an actor accustomed to playing comic roles, tossing around names such as Robin Williams, Steve Martin, and Tom Hanks. However, Travolta was aggressively sought after by producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron for this role because he had starred as Danny Zuko in Grease, the second most successful movie musical to date, beaten only by Mamma Mia!.|$|E

60|$|She felt small <b>and</b> petty: <b>ashamed</b> of the {{pleasure}} {{she had felt}} in the woods, ashamed of her high spirits <b>and</b> light-heartedness, <b>ashamed</b> of that feeling of sudden pity and admiration {{for the man who}} had done her and her family so deep an injury, which she was too feeble, too vacillating to avenge.|$|R

Doris befriends Montgomery, but worries that she is too ordinary against the colorful personalities of the other students. Leroy and his English teacher, Mrs. Sherwood, clash over his refusal to do homework. It is later revealed that Leroy is illiterate <b>and</b> <b>ashamed</b> to admit it. Bruno and his father argue over Bruno's reluctance to play his electronic music publicly. Miss Berg, the school's Dance teacher, warns Lisa {{that she is not}} working hard enough.

Xu Shu remained with Cao Cao, but he swore never to give advice to Cao.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid being delayed by the Virgin <b>and</b> <b>ashamed</b> at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked {{where he was going}} (fourth apparition); Juan Diego {{explained}} what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked, “¿No estoy yo aquí que soy tu madre?” (Am I not here, I who am your mother?). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and she told him to gather flowers from the top of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in December. Juan followed her instructions and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there. The Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan's tilma, or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak before archbishop Zumárraga on December 12, the flowers fell to the floor, and on the fabric was the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.|$|E

Miriam then sings her mother's lullaby, which Moses remembers; he returns to the palace, eager to return to familiar surroundings. The truth about his past is later confirmed by a nightmare, and finally by Seti himself, who disturbs Moses by claiming the Hebrews are [...] "only slaves". The next day, Moses accidentally pushes an Egyptian guard to his death while trying to stop him from whipping an elderly Hebrew slave. Horrified <b>and</b> <b>ashamed,</b> Moses flees into the desert in exile, despite Rameses' pleas to stay.|$|E
500|$|Although Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with Mercedes' sister, Jacqui (Claire Cooper), he and Mercedes had sex. Metcalfe explained this was because Mercedes was intoxicated and unaware of her actions, [...] "but she was also furious at Jacqui for giving her a slap". Metcalfe explained that when Mercedes woke up, she was in disbelief about the events of the previous night and felt [...] "appalled". She added that Mercedes did not fancy Tony and that they did not even like each other, which was why [...] "neither of them can understand what happened between them". Regarding Mercedes' feelings about hurting Jacqui, Metcalfe stated: [...] "Mercedes hates herself for it. She feels incredibly guilty <b>and</b> <b>ashamed</b> of what she's done. It's surprising Jacqui doesn't guess something is wrong because Mercedes can't look her in the eye".|$|E

He joined the Selkirk Fishermen senior {{team for the}} 1924–25 season. The Fishermen played in the highest amateur league in Manitoba and were finalists for the {{championship}} the year before. Gardiner appeared in 18games for Selkirk, posting two shutouts and a 1.83goals against average. They again reached the finals but lost to the Port Arthur Bearcats. The loss made Gardiner feel dejected <b>and</b> <b>ashamed,</b> though people assured him he had played well and had several offers for different teams. He decided to join the professional Winnipeg Maroons of the Central Hockey League (CHL). As {{he would be a}} professional, Gardiner was forced to give up his baseball career, which he was reluctant to do; he finished with a career batting average of [...]300.

500|$|As {{her story}} {{progresses}} following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, {{the daughter of}} the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed [...] "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, [...] "I was so excited when I found out Chloe was going to have some family ties. I knew it would give me, as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." [...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never had anyone tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces". Kate Linder was also pleased with the writing direction, describing it as an [...] "honor" [...] to work with Hendrickson. She said, [...] "When they decided to bring [...] back, I was stunned and pleasantly surprised. Maria Bell called me and {{told me that it was}} top secret. It was a great reveal." [...] Chloe initially gives Esther the cold shoulder. Of her reasoning behind this, Hendrickson said, [...] "Chloe is very young and immature — as well, hurt <b>and</b> <b>ashamed</b> about her upbringing. She’s not going to let her mother forget it easily." [...] She described their initial relationship as [...] "realistic" [...] and similar to [...] "a lot of mother-and-daughter relationships".|$|E

2500|$|Ruth did {{not attend}} court but issued a statement, saying [...] "I am {{breaking}} my silence now because my reluctance to speak has been interpreted as indifference or lack of sympathy {{for the victims of}} my husband Bernie's crime, which is exactly the opposite of the truth.

2500|$|True to his {{empirical}} thesis, Hume {{tells the}} reader that, though testimony {{does have some}} force, it is never quite as powerful as the direct evidence of the senses. That said, he provides some reasons why {{we may have a}} basis for trust in the testimony of persons: because a) human memory can be relatively tenacious; and b) because people are inclined to tell the truth, <b>and</b> <b>ashamed</b> of telling falsities. Needless to say, these reasons are only to be trusted {{to the extent that they}} conform to experience. (Hume 1974:389) ...|$|E

The Bible {{graphically}} recounts Egypt's demise in Isaiah 20:4 [...] "So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 5 And they shall be afraid <b>and</b> <b>ashamed</b> of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the end, after {{discussions with}} Schreiner, Fagan {{accepted}} the post. They {{decided it was}} best for him to accept the appointment, despite all its problems, to prevent notorious National Party favourite L. C. Steyn becoming Chief Justice. Initially they had, at Centlivres' suggestion, tried {{to reach an agreement}} among the judges of the Court that they would all refuse appointment, so that the government would be forced to appoint Schreiner. But this plan failed, unsurprisingly, when Steyn refused to agree. Fagan therefore accepted the Chief Justiceship with misgivings. He wrote to his wife after his appointment that he still felt [...] "sick about Oliver [...] " [...] <b>and</b> <b>ashamed</b> when people congratulated him.|$|E
2500|$|In the aftermath, Borges {{found himself}} much in demand as a {{lecturer}} {{and one of}} the intellectual leaders of the Argentine opposition. In 1951 he was asked by anti-Peronist friends to run for president of SADE. Borges, then suffering from depression caused by a failed romance, reluctantly accepted. He later recalled that he would awake every morning and remember that Perón was President and feel deeply depressed <b>and</b> <b>ashamed.</b> Perón's government had seized control of the Argentine mass media and regarded SADE with indifference. Borges later recalled, however, [...] "Many distinguished men of letters did not dare set foot inside its doors." [...] Meanwhile, SADE became an increasing refuge for critics of the regime. SADE official Luisa Mercedes Levinson noted, [...] "We would gather every week to tell the latest jokes about the ruling couple and even dared to sing the songs of the French Resistance, as well as 'La Marseillaise'".|$|E
