50|$|<b>Associative</b> <b>Entity</b> and Nonentity Association: An <b>associative</b> <b>entity</b> is {{an entity}} that {{represents}} {{an association between}} two independent entities; the <b>associative</b> <b>entity</b> is an entity in itself {{because it has a}} surrogate. A nonentity association is similar to an <b>associative</b> <b>entity</b> however it has no surrogate. This lack of a surrogate stops the nonentity association from having, for example, any descriptive characteristic entities.|$|E

50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>associative</b> <b>entities</b> {{are implemented}} in a database structure using associative tables, which are tables that can contain references to columns {{from the same}} or different database tables within the same database.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>associative</b> <b>entity</b> is a {{term used}} in [...] {{relational}} and entity-relationship theory. A relational database requires {{the implementation of a}} base relation (or base table) to resolve many-to-many relationships. This kind of base relation is called an associative table.|$|E
50|$|Designative - {{entities}} that contain a designation. A designative entity {{is at the}} many end of a one-to-many relationship between two independent entities. For example, a writer may write many books, hence a one-to-many relationship between writer and book entities; {{the book is the}} designative entity because it contains a designation (or designative reference) to the writer - namely the primary key of the writer entity. Note that an <b>associative</b> <b>entity</b> contains at least two designations. For example, we can regard a booking as either an entity that associates a person with a flight, or as an entity that designates a person and designates a flight. Hence a designative entity must contain at least one designation whereas an <b>associative</b> <b>entity</b> must contain at least two designations.|$|E
50|$|In general (though not necessarily) a weak entity {{does not}} have any items in its primary key other than its {{inherited}} primary key and a sequence number. There are two types of weak entities: <b>associative</b> <b>entities</b> and subtype entities. The latter represents a crucial type of normalization, where the super-type entity inherits its attributes to subtype entities based on the value of the discriminator.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Relational {{modelling}} is {{used for}} the modelling of transactional data stored in relational databases while dimensional modelling is prevalently used for the modelling of dimensional data stored in data warehouses. The modelling approach used is quite different. In relational modelling the focus is on identification of fundamental or strong entities involved in the execution of business transactions, while in dimensional modelling the focus is on identification of <b>associative</b> <b>entities</b> that carry business measures. In the paper some equivalence problems of two models are discussed. Also, the main steps of transformation of relational into dimensional model are described...|$|R

This paper discusses a method developed by the authors for model based change management at development and correction of products and their variants. The product-production model complex is considered as virtual space. Modeling and processing capabilities of this virtual space give a great chance for including intelligence in robot application related engineering. The paper starts {{with a discussion of}} background of the reported research including engineering modeling and robotics. Following this, integration by the application of shape intensive modeling is considered. Next information structure and procedures in the virtual space are outlined. Finally, methods for verification and management of product and production object changes are explained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} a modeling method as {{a contribution to}} advanced modeling of products where the main objectives are changing from simple description and relating of engineering objects to description of engineering process related entities and modeled object behaviors. In the proposed method, techniques have been introduced by the authors to include intelligent model features in industrial CAD/CAM systems. The reported research was started from earlier achievements by the authors in development of integrated feature based product modeling. As a solution for intelligent modeling, an active model is proposed that integrates knowledge from modeling procedures, generic part models and engineers. Paper starts {{with a discussion of}} knowledge content in engineering models, and actual issues in intelligent modeling based engineering. Then the proposed knowledge based modeling by <b>associative</b> <b>entities</b> is explained. Application of computational intelligence in engineering systems is detailed and behavior based model with intelligent content, involving specifications and knowledge for the design processes are emphasized. Following this, an active approach to feature driven modeling of engineering objects is outlined and basic considerations are concluded...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEn la {{literatura}} abundan los trabajos dirigidos a caracterizar las entidades que integran la “Economía Social” en España y a cuantificar su contribución a los diferentes sectores económicos y, en especial, al sector agroalimentario. Sin embargo, estos trabajos no se han hecho eco de la importancia de estas organizaciones para la gestión de un recurso tan fundamental para el sector agrario como el agua, y del papel que en ella juegan las Comunidades de Regantes (CCRR), sobre todo, junto a las entidades asociativas agrarias (Cooperativas Agrarias y Sociedades Agrarias de Transformación). Aunque apenas contempladas como entidades de “Economía Social” en los estudios publicados sobre este tipo de organizaciones, a las Comunidades de Regantes (CCRR) corresponde la función prioritaria de distribuir y administrar de {{una manera}} eficiente las aguas asignadas entre sus miembros. A ello, también pueden contribuir otras organizaciones ampliamente reconocidas dentro de la “Economía Social” como es el caso de las Cooperativas Agrarias y las Sociedades Agrarias de Transformación. En este contexto, el objetivo de este trabajo es, de un lado, poner de relieve que las CCRR comparten los principios de las empresas de “Economía Social”, y resaltar sus características con relación a las Cooperativas Agrarias y SAT. Por otra parte, se identifican los componentes de la eficiencia en la gestión del agua para uso agrícola y se analiza la contribución que las CCRR y las entidades asociativas agrarias de la Región de Murcia realizan a la mejora de la misma a través de los diversos servicios que prestan a sus socios (formación, información, asesoramiento, financiación, etc). /In the literature {{there are many}} works directed at characterizing those entities which form the “Social Economy” in Spain and at quantifying their contribution to the different economic sectors, especially the agricultural food sector. However, these works have not reflected {{the importance of these}} organizations for the management of a resource as fundamental for the agricultural sector as is water, and {{of the role of the}} agrarian <b>associative</b> <b>entities</b> (Agricultural Cooperatives and Agricultural Transformation Societies) and, above all, the Irrigation Communities (CCRR). Although scarcely mentioned as entities of “Social Economy” in the studies on this type of organizations, the Irrigation Communities have the priority function of efficiently distributing and administering the water assigned amongst their members. To that, other organizations widely recognised within the “Social Economy” can also make a contribution, as is the case with the Agricultural Cooperatives and Agricultural Transformation Societies (SAT). In this context, the objective of this paper is, on the one hand, to highlight that the CCRR share the principles of the “Social Economy” companies, and to underline their characteristics with regard to the Agricultural Cooperatives and SAT. On the other hand, the components of the efficiency in the management of water for agricultural use are identified and the contribution that the CCRR and the agrarian <b>associative</b> <b>entities</b> of the Region of Murcia make to improve them is analyzed...|$|R
50|$|Following {{a disappointing}} uptake of RM/T by the {{database}} industry, Codd decided {{to introduce the}} RM/T model more gradually. He planned to release a sequence of RM versions: RM/V2, RM/V3 etc. each time progressively {{including some of the}} ideas of the original RM/T into the new version. Perhaps this explains why there is no obvious mapping of concepts between RM/T and RM/V2. For example, there is no reference to <b>associative</b> or designative <b>entity</b> types in Codd's 1990 book that defines RM/V2. On the other hand, the book extends and builds on the existing body of query language issues, many of which were addressed by Codd in several papers throughout the 1980s.|$|R
40|$|Previous work {{in animal}} {{nutrition}} {{has focused on}} single feeds and assumed additivity in ration systems. In the tropics, farmers are likely to feed mixtures of feeds, including tree fodders, {{which may not be}} simply additive in nutritional terms. This study has increased our understanding of the mechanisms that determine the associative effects on the in vitro fermentation of mixtures of fodder tree leaves. Associative effects are governed by a synchronisation in the fermentation rates of the components of the mixture. This is in turn dependent on the fermentability of their chemical constituents. Effects were demonstrated by changes in the fermentation kinetics of gas production curves. The chemical components of fodder tree leaves that affect the fermentation, and the time at which the effect occurs, were identified, using two media of different nitrogen contents. The fermentation of mixtures of pure chemical entities in various combinations was then examined. The greatest associative effects were found when the mixture had components of similar fermentability. It is proposed that associative effects are a function of the synchronisation of fermentation of the different components and was shown to occur at the point when the rate was maximal. With two types of protein (casein and bovine serum albumin (BSA)), utilisation of a protein by rumen microbes was shown to be a function of its fermentability and not of its solubility. This is also influenced by the type of associated carbohydrate. Fodder tree leaves were then combined with different pure chemical <b>entities.</b> <b>Associative</b> effects between fodder tree leaves and carbohydrates were shown to occur and the responses were similar to those obtained with mixtures of pure carbohydrates and proteins. The effect of tannins and phenolic compounds was studied using quebracho tannin as a model, and in five of the tree species. They were shown to affect the fermentability of both carbohydrates and proteins. The effect was greater with carbohydrates of medium to low fermentability. They also reacted with both soluble and insoluble protein. Forages with phenolic compounds showed both positive and negative effects. The effects were possible due to a synchrony or asynchrony in the release of protein. In mixtures of leaves from different species, associative effects were related to their fermentability. Again, this appeared {{to be the result of}} the synchronisation of the release of nutrients. Associative effects with fodder tree leaves were of a composite nature and can be both positive and negative. The implications of these findings in relation to in vivo digestion and animal production are discussed. Due to the diversity of fodder trees, there is the potential to develop feeding systems based on mixtures which make better use of available resources. This will also contribute to improved efficiency in the management and use of natural resources, and take advantage of natural plant diversity in the tropics. </p...|$|R
