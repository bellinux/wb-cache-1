5|$|In 1948, the Militia {{units that}} had fought {{during the war}} were re-raised {{as part of the}} Citizens Military Force (CMF), and it was decided to entrust the battle honours of the 2nd AIF units to their {{associated}} CMF units. As a result, the 2/3rd Battalion's battle honours were passed to the 3rd Battalion (The Werriwa Regiment), which was reformed around Canberra. In 1960, with the introduction of the Pentropic division into the Australian Army, the CMF was reorganised and the 3rd Battalion (The Werriwa Regiment) was reduced to company strength, forming 'C' Company, 3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (3 RNSWR). In 1965, following the abandonment of the Pentropic divisional structure, the 3rd Battalion was reformed in its own right <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> companies were split up to form new battalions with the old regionally based numerical designations. In 1987, however, following another reorganisation of the Army Reserve which saw a {{reduction in the number of}} the infantry battalions across Australia, 3 RNSWR was linked with 4 RNSWR to become 4th/3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (4/3 RNSWR).|$|E

5|$|Nine {{counties}} in Texas were declared disaster areas after Tropical Storm Fay: Brazoria, Frio, Galveston, La Salle, Live Oak, Matagorda, Nueces, San Patricio and Wharton. The declaration enabled business owners and residents {{to apply for}} federal and state government aid programs. Disaster housing checks handed out after the storm totaled to over $2.7million (2002USD; $3.1million 2007USD) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had carried out over 2,700home and building inspections. Non-government relief programs such <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Individual</b> and Family Grant Program had distributed over $400,000 (2002USD; $469,000 2007USD) in checks, and over $1million (2002USD; $1.2million 2007USD) in relief funds. The Small Business Administration also funded over $250,000 (2002USD; $294,000 2007USD) in relief aid.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the rear}} {{part of the}} skull is preserved. It likely showed a horselike, broad snout {{equipped}} with pencil-like teeth, as seen in related sauropods for which more complete skulls are known. As in other dicraeosaurids, the external naris (nostril opening) was situated in the posterior half of the skull, diagonally above the eye socket, which was proportionally large. As in most other dinosaurs, the skull featured three additional openings (fenestrae). The infratemporal fenestra, located below the eye socket, was long and narrow. Behind the eye socket was the supratemporal fenestra, which in dicraeosaurids was uniquely small and can be seen when the skull is viewed from the side. This contrasts with other diapsid reptiles, where these openings were directed upwards, thus being visible only in top view. The antorbital fenestra would have been located {{in front of the}} eye socket, although this region is not preserved. An unusual feature were small openings seen on the backside of the skull, the so-called parietal openings or fontanelles. In other tetrapods, these openings are usually seen only in juveniles and would close <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> grows. Skull features shared with Dicraeosaurus but absent in other sauropods included the fused frontal bones and the notably long basipterygoid processes, bony extensions connecting the braincase with the palate.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} some {{important}} aspects related to safeguarding environmental quality. Beginning by defining {{the identity of}} the agents considered, we conceptually describe how while they have different identities, they can be simultaneously influenced by three distinct elements: self image and environmental attitude and behavior. We define self image <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual's</b> willingness to cooperate {{for the sake of the}} public good, we define environmental attitude <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual's</b> concern regarding waste prevention and disposal, and <b>the</b> environmental behavior <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual's</b> recycling behavior. Using the 1998 wave of the Multipurpose Household Survey (MHS), which is conducted annually by the Italian Central Statistical Office, and univariate probit models, we show that there is a positive relationship among these factors that is robust to the inclusion of social participation variables and to the use of a sub-sample of individuals who have no interest in environmental issues...|$|R

25|$|Dorsiflexion: In {{order to}} stretch the {{anterior}} muscles of the lower leg, crossover shin stretches work well. This motion will stretch the dorsiflexion muscles, mainly the anterior tibialis, extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus, by slowly causing the muscles to lengthen as body weight is leaned on the ankle joint by using the floor as resistance against {{the top of the}} foot. Crossover shin stretches can vary in intensity depending on the amount of body weight applied on the ankle joint <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> bends at the knee.
