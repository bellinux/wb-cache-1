40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{aesthetic}} {{outcomes of the}} upper blepharoplasty with or without resection of the preseptal orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle.</b> Methods: An interventional randomized double-blind left-right {{study was conducted in}} 15 consecutive patients with dermatochalasis of the upper eyelid. One side was randomly chosen for resection of the preseptal orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> (group 1). the orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> of the contralateral side was preserved (group 2). All patients scored differences between both sides on the seventh day, the thirtieth day, and the ninetieth day after the surgery regarding the following symptoms: edema, hematoma, itching, and pain. Three masked ophthalmic plastic specialists analyzed the aesthetic outcomes by the visual analogical scale. Results: the scoring of symptoms was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 on the seventh postoperative day. On the thirtieth and ninetieth days, {{there were no significant differences}} between groups 1 and 2. the analysis by 3 masked observers showed that the aesthetic result was worse in group 1 than in group 2 on the seventh postoperative day. There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 on the thirtieth and ninetieth days. Conclusions: Upper blepharoplasty causes more postoperative symptoms and presents worse initial aesthetic outcome when the preseptal orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> is excised. However, the final aesthetic outcome is the same when the preseptal orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> is excised or preserved.

An interventional randomized double-blind left right study was conducted in 10 patients with upper eyelid dermatochalazis. One side was randomly chosen for incision of the preseptal orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> and direct coagulation or resection of fat pockets. The orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> of the contralateral side was not incised. Only a soft coagulation was performed on the muscle to induce a septal contraction and push the orbital fat back. All interventions were performed with an Ellman Dual frequency high frequency low temperature unit. Digital photos were taken before and after surgery and patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire to evaluate the surgery itself as well as the aesthetic outcome. In an attempt to objectify these findings, NMR imaging of the orbits was performed before and 6 weeks after surgery. Symptoms scoring was similar in both groups. At 6 weeks post-operation, no significant differences were observed between left and right eye. In conclusion, patients with dermatochalazis but without prominent fat prolapse in the upper eyelid, did not exhibit significant differences after cutting or not the orbicularis muscle to excise orbital fat.

Six patients underwent a videographic control, which was assessed by a blinded independent investigator. In two patients with hyperlacrimation an extra dose of botulinum toxin (on average 20 mouse units BTX A) was injected into the lacrimal gland and the effect was assessed using the Schirmer test and on a three point scale.  RESULTS—Botulinum toxin type A had a good to excellent (grades 3 and 4) effect over an average of six months after 91 % of injections. In 9 % the injections had a moderate (grade 2) effect. Patients with hyperlacrimation showed a nearly complete recovery. There were no systemic side effects but focal side effects due to a temporary weakness of the orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> were not uncommon.  CONCLUSIONS—Botulinum toxin type A is the treatment of choice in motor and autonomic effects of aberrant regeneration of facial nerve after a peripheral palsy.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{clarify the}} causative factor of Asian double eyelid. DESIGN: Experimental {{anatomic}} study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six upper eyelids (13 right and 13 left) from 17 Japanese cadavers (9 males and 8 females, mean age at death: 73. 1 years). METHODS: The specimens, {{obtained from the}} central part of the upper eyelids, were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, cut into 7 -μm thick slices and stained with Masson trichrome. Statistical analysis was based on the Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0. 05. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> thickness and shape, with or without the levator extension, orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> bundle spacing, thickness of upper eyelid skin and subcutaneous tissue, fusional site between the levator aponeurosis and the orbital septum, with or without inferior drooping of fat tissue. RESULTS: The orbicularis muscle was thinner at the skin crease of a double eyelid than at 10 mm from the eyelid margin in the single eyelid group (p = 0. 029). In 3 specimens the skin crease of double eyelid was at the tip of the bending orbicularis muscle, which was thick. Although the skin crease in the region of a double eyelid was thinner than in other parts of the skin, excluding the simple crease regions, other outcome measures were not shown as definite causative factors in creating the Asian double eyelid.

40|$|Background: Our primary aim in {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether electrically induced activation of the injected muscle increases effectiveness of botulinum type A toxin (BonT-A) in patients with blepharospasm (BPS). The second aim was to assess the safety of BonT-A by investigating whether BonT-A injection alters the excitability of blink reflex circuits in the brainstem. Methods: Twenty-three patients with BPS received BonT-A (Botox) injected bilaterally into the orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> at a standard dose. In 18 patients, electrically induced muscle activation of the orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> on one side was performed for 60 min (4 Hz frequency) in a single session, immediately after BonT-A injection and in five patients for 60 min once a day for five consecutive days. The severity of BPS was assessed clinically with the BPS score. Compound muscle action potential (cMAPs) from the orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscles</b> were measured bilaterally. The blink reflex recovery cycle was studied at interstimulus intervals of 250 and 500 ms. Participants underwent clinical and neurophysiological assessment before BonT-A injection (T 0) and 2 weeks thereafter (T 1). Results: Compound muscle action potential amplitude significantly decreased at T 1 but did not differ between stimulated and non-stimulated orbicularis oculi in the two groups. BonT-A injection left the blink reflex recovery cycle tested on the stimulated and non-stimulated sides unchanged. Conclusions: In patients with BPS, the electrically induced muscle activation neither increases the effectiveness of BonT-A nor produces larger electrophysiological peripheral effects. The lack of BonT-A-induced changes in the blink reflex recovery cycle provides evidence that BonT-A therapy is safe in patients with BPS. © 2009 EFNS...|$|R

To determine the functional recovery in patients with severe transient peripheral facial motor paralysis (Bell palsy). Study Design. Prospective controlled trial. Setting. Academic medical center. Subjects and Methods. Blink recovery was studied in 2 groups of severely affected Bell palsy patients during a follow-up period of 84 weeks. The patients in one group received pre-dnisolone within the first week after the onset of symptoms. No medication was given to the other group. A control group of healthy subjects was also included. Simultaneous orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> activity and eyelid kinematics were recorded by surface electromyographic (EMG) recording and eyelid search coils, respectively. Results. At the beginning of the paralysis, very little integrated orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> activity and eyelid movement was mea-sured at the palsied side of the face. Thirteen weeks later, the integrated orbicularis oculi EMG and functional blink recovery gradually improved until 39 weeks. Beyond, only the integrated orbicularis oculi EMG slightly increased. At 84 weeks, the inte-grated orbicularis oculi EMG was significantly larger in the pre-dnisolone group compared with the control group. The integrated EMG of the nonmedicated group recovered to normal values. Curiously enough, the functional blink recovery at the palsied side remained reduced to 64 % compared with the healthy controls in the prednisolone-treated group and to 36 % in the nonmedicated group. Conclusion. The authors demonstrate that prednisolone signifi-cantly increased the orbicularis <b>oculi</b> <b>muscle</b> activity and signifi-cantly improved functional blink recovery in severely affected Bell palsy patients.
