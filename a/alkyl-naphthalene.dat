[...] Boston UniversityA clinically satisfactory method of lipolytic {{analysis for the}} duodenal contents must fulfill eight criteria: (1) and (2) the optimal pH and optimal temperature must be maintained {{during the course of}} the reaction; (3) inhibiting agents must be avoided and necessary activators or co-enzymes must be added; (4) operative variables in the system must be held to a minimum by the use of a fixed concentration of a suitable and evenly emulsified substrate; (5) the method of measuring the final extent of digestion must be accurate; (6) the enzyme must be protected from destructive influences in the interim between its procurement and its analysis; (7) the method must be simple, should preferably use ordinary laboratory apparatus and must consume as little time as possible; (8) the method must be designed to give as true a picture as possible of what might be expected to occur in vivo. The following method is presented as more satisfactorily fulfilling these criteria than previously published methods; as substrate serves a 1 % tributyrin emulsion rendered permanent by the addition of one gram of Alkanol B per one hundred cc. That is a DuPont product which they kindly stated is <b>alkyl-naphthalene</b> sodium sulfonate. This emulsion is stable after putting it twice through a hand homogenizer and will keep at least one month if kept in the ice box. The only other reagents required are three dilutions of sodium bicarbonate: 1. 00 %, 1. 11 %, and 1. 25 %. The method is one of serial dilution and all analyses are done in duplicate. Ten tubes are set up in pairs to contain the following reagents: tube (1) receives 4 cc. of 1. 25 % NaHCO 3; tube (2) 9 cc. of 1. 11 % NaHCO 3; tubes (3), (4), and (5) 5 cc. of 1. 00 % NaHCO 3. To tube (1) is added 1 cc. of the duodenal specimen to be analyzed and the same to tube (2). After thorough mixing 5 cc. of the contents of tube (2) are added to tube (3). In like manner 5 cc. of the contents of tube (3) are added to tube (4) etc. Five cc. are taken from the last tube of the series and discarded. In working with the duodenal contents a sixth tube is occasionally necessary and with experience one may predict that by noting the speed of digestion in the first tubes of the series immediately after the addition of the substrate. As soon as the various enzymic dilutions have been made, five cc. of the substrate are rapidly added to each tube. The tubes are then all well-stoppered, shaken and incubated in a water bath for two hours. The time interval begins the moment the substrate is added to the first tube and ends the moment the first tube is read in the colorimeter. The tubes should be read in the same order in which they are filled for within narrow limits it takes as long to fill them as it takes to read them in the colorimeter and in that way slight differences in the time of digestion for each tube are held to a minimum. Filter # 565 is used for the colorimetric readings. Ninety-five per cent, of the light which it transmits lies in the range between 550 and 580 millimicra. For comparative purposes single figures expressing the relative enzymic effects of each specimen were obtained in the following manner: it was assumed that each tube exhibiting complete digestion, as shown by the reading in the colorimeter and the grossly apparent clarification of the tube's contents, had present 1 % of undigested substrate. By using the equation for calculating the velocity constant of a first order reaction and expressing the time in minutes, a value for the constant of 0. 03838 was obtained. This figure was multiplied by the reciprocal of the dilution of the specimen in the last tube of the series showing complete digestion and to that product was added the constant calculated from the Evelyn readings of the first tube in the series to show incomplete digestion. For clinical purposes it suffices to note the number of tubes in the series revealing complete digestion. The percentage of digestion of the substrate indicated by the colorimetric readings is determined by interpolation on a graph which represents the curve obtained by plotting the per cent, of undigested substrate against the colorimetric readings of standard dilutions of the substrate. For that purpose five tubes are prepared containing respectively 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 cc. of the substrate diluted to a total volume, in each case, of 10 cc. with 1 % NaHCO 3. In this case, as in all determinations, 10 cc. of 1 % NaHCO 3 serves as a blank. The readings so obtained for different lots of emulsion do not vary by more than one quarter of a unit from the respective values: 5 ^ 0, 6 ^ 0, 7 ^ 2, 11 ^ 0 and 21 ^ 0 where the superscripts as usual indicate quarter units. The method just described was employed in the analysis of specimens obtained from fifty intubations. The subjects comprised ten hospital patients, twelve healthy nurses and twenty-one healthy medical students, of which latter group two were women. The activity in fasting specimens was found to range from zero to complete digestion through the fifth tube and partial digestion in the sixth. The specimens obtained at varying intervals, but usually fifteen minutes, after stimulation of the duodenal mucosa with twenty cc. of 0. 1 N HCl displayed activity varying from complete digestion through the second tube with partial digestion in the third to complete digestion through the fifth with partial digestion in the sixth. The latter group showed a sufficiently narrow range of dispersion to permit statistical analysis on the basis of the number of tubes showing complete digestion. The 64 specimens analyzed after stimulation gave a mean of 3. 34 tubes with a standard deviation of 0. 82 and a probable error of the mean of 0. 07. The chance of finding normal cases showing complete digestion only through the first tube was found to be 22 in 10, 000. The analogous figure for complete digestion through the sixth tube was 6 in 10, 000. The same figures for the group exclusive of the ten hospital patients (all of whom, however, gave results falling within normal limits but tending to fall in the lower range of normal) were: mean, 3. 80; standard deviation, 0. 72; and probable error of the mean, 0. 07. On the basis of this limited group the chance of finding a normal case with complete digestion only through the first tube was found to be one in 10, 000 and the chance of finding a normal case revealing complete digestion through the sixth tube was found to be eleven in 10, 000. In fifteen cases at least two specimens obtained after stimulation were analyzed and in five of those, three specimens were analyzed. They usually showed complete digestion through the same number of tubes but in a few of the cases differed by one tube in that respect. It was concluded, therefore, that for clinical purposes the analysis of more than one specimen obtained after stimulation was not necessary. Seven subjects were twice intubated. Of those seven, three gave specimens after stimulation of the same strength on the two different occasions. Of the remaining four two gave results differing by only one tube; one differed by two tubes on the two occasions; the results in the seventh case cannot be compared as a neutral or faintly alkaline specimen after stimulation was not obtained after one of the two intubations. With the subject whose specimens differed by two tubes the first intubation, which gave the lowest value, took an exceptionally long time. The results indicate a tendency for specimens obtained from the same individual on different occasions to be closely parallel in enzymic activity. Reports in the literature indicate that such a test may have its greatest diagnostic value in cases of pancreatitis, steatorrhea, pancreatic and vicinal malignancies, pancreatic calculi and cysts and occasionally in biliary and hepatic diseases in which a secondary pancreatitis may be caused by the primary condition. The test may have prognostic value in following the course of a chronic pancreatitis. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{concentrations}} of 28 PAHs, 15 oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs) and 11 trace metals/metalloids (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn) in muscle and gut + gill tissues of demersal fishes (Drapane africana, Cynoglossus senegalensis and Pomadasys peroteti) from three locations {{along the coast of}} the Gulf of Guinea (Ghana). The concentrations of ∑ 28 PAHs in muscle tissues averaged 192 ng g− 1 dw (range: 71 – 481 ng g− 1 dw) and were not statistically different between locations. The concentrations of ∑ 28 PAHs were higher in guts + gills than in muscles. The PAH composition pattern was dominated by low molecular weight compounds (naphthalene, <b>alkyl-naphthalenes</b> and phenanthrene). All fish tissues had benzo[a]pyrene concentrations lower than the EU limit for food safety. Excess cancer risk from consumption of some fish was higher than the guideline value of 1 × 10 − 6. The concentrations of ∑ 15 OPAHs in fish muscles averaged 422 ng g− 1 dw (range: 28 – 1715 ng g− 1 dw). The ∑ 15 OPAHs/∑ 16 US-EPA PAHs concentration ratio was > 1 in 68 % of the fish muscles and 100 % of guts + gills. The log-transformed concentrations of PAHs and OPAHs in muscles, guts + gills were significantly (p < 0. 05) correlated with their octanol–water partitioning coefficients, strongly suggesting that equilibrium partitioning from water/sediment into fish tissue was the main mechanism of bioaccumulation. The trace metal concentrations in the fish tissues were in the medium range when compared to fish {{from other parts of the}} world. The concentrations of some trace metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn) were higher in guts + gills than in muscle tissues. The target hazard quotients for metals were < 1 and did not indicate a danger to the local population. We conclude that the health risk arising from the consumption of the studied fish (due to their PAHs and trace metals content) is minimal...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 A {{fundamental}} {{understanding of}} the process of devolatilization requires extensive knowledge of not only the intrinsic properties of the parent coal and its subsequent formed products (tars, gases and chars), but also its characteristic reaction rate behaviour. Devolatilization behaviour has been extensively addressed in literature with the use of powdered coal samples, which normally do not adhere to particle size constraints of coal conversion processes utilizing lump coal. The aim of this investigation was therefore to assess the devolatilization behaviour (with respect to product yield and -quality; and reaction rate modelling) of four typical South African coals (UMZ, INY, G# 5 and TSH) confined to the large particle regime. All four coals were found to be bituminous in rank, with vitrinite contents ranging between 24. 4 vol. % and 69. 2 vol. % (mineral matter free basis). Two were inertinite-rich coals (UMZ and INY) and the other two were vitrinite-rich coals (G# 5 and TSH). From thermoplasticity measurements it was evident that only coal TSH displayed extensive thermoplastic behaviour, while a comparison between molecular properties confirmed the higher abundance of poly-condensed aromatic structures (aromaticity of 81 %) present in this coal. Product evolution was evaluated under atmospheric conditions in a self-constructed, large particle, fixed-bed reactor, on two particle sizes (5 mm and 20 mm) at two isothermal reactor temperatures (450 °C and 750 °C) using a combination of both GC and MS techniques for gas species measurement, while standard gravimetric methods were used to quantify tar- and char yield respectively. Elucidation of tar- and char structural features involved the use of both conventional- and advanced analytical techniques. From the results it could be concluded that temperature was the dominating factor controlling product yield- and quality, with significant increases in both volatile- and gas yield observed for an increase in temperature. Tar yields ranged between 3. 6 wt. % and 10. 1 wt. % and increased in the order UMZ < INY < TSH < G# 5, with higher tar yields obtained for coal G# 5, being ascribed to larger abundances of vitrinite and liptinite present in this coal. For coal TSH, lower tar yields could mainly be attributed to the higher aromaticity and extensive swelling nature of this coal. Evolved gases were found to be mainly composed of H 2, CH 4, CO and CO 2, low molecular weight olefins and paraffins; and some C 4 homologues. Advanced analytical techniques (NMR, SEC, GC-MS, XRD, etc.) revealed the progressive increase of the aromatic nature of both tars and chars with increasing temperature; as well as subsequent differences in tar composition between the different parent coals. In all cases, an increase in devolatilization temperature led to the evolution of larger amounts of aromatic compounds such as <b>alkyl-naphthalenes</b> and PAHs, while significant decreases in the amount of aliphatics and mixed compounds could be observed. From 13 C NMR, HRTEM and XRD carbon crystallite results it was clear that an increase in temperature {{led to the formation of}} progressively larger, more aromatic and structurally orientated polycondensed carbon structures. Reaction rate studies involved the use of non-isothermal (5 - 40 K/min) and isothermal (350 - 900 °C) thermogravimetry of both powdered (- 200 μm) and large particle samples (20 mm) in order to assess intrinsic kinetics and large particle rate behaviour, respectively. Evaluation of the intrinsic kinetic parameters of each coal involved the numerical regression of non-isothermal rate data in MATLAB® 7. 1. 1 according to a pseudo-component modelling philosophy. Modelling results indicated that the intrinsic devolatilization behaviour of each coal could be adequately described by using a total number of eight pseudo-components, while reported activation energies were found to range between 22. 3 kJ/mol and 244. 3 kJ/mol. Description of the rate of large particle devolatilization involved the evaluation of a novel, comprehensive rate model accounting for derived kinetics, heat and mass transport effects, as well as physical changes due to particle swelling/shrinkage. Evaluation of the proposed model with the aid of the COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 3 simulation software provided a suitable fit to the experimental data of all four coals, while simulation studies highlighted the relevant importance of not only the effect of particle size, but also the importance of including terms affecting for heat losses due to particle swelling/shrinkage, transport of volatile products through the porous char structure, heat of reaction and heat of vaporization of water.

40|$|In the 19 th and 20 th century, {{thousands}} of coal gasification plants were operating {{all over the}} world. Pipeline {{distribution of natural gas}} following World War II replaced manufactured gas as a major fuel; as a result manufactured gas production came to an end and determined widespread shutdown of gas plants. Soil and groundwater contamination by coal tars, very complex oganic mixtures resulted as a byproduct of the dry distillation of coal, potentially exists at all former gasworks sites because of prior process operations and residual management practices. This lasted now up to more than one century and the contaminant release persists as the sources are still present. The complexity of groundwater contamination at former gasworks arises from the complex original composition of tars, but also from the biotic transformations undergone by organic componds in the subsurface environment. This work focuses on 'Testfeld Süd', a former gas manufacturing plant located in the Neckar Valley in S-W Germany, which has been operating between 1870 and 1970. The main objective was the qualitative and quantitative assessment of groundwater contamination by site-specific organic chemicals. This included both investigations of the NAPL source(s) and of the plume(s) of dissolved contaminants. First the composition of coal tars from different locations in the field was determined. The three main compouns classes assessed were monocyclic aromatic hydocarbons (MAHs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic compounds. Some of them are known to be of serious toxicologic concern, but for the majority, possible health effects have not yet been assessed. Two main types of NAPLs have been spilled in the subsurface at the site: coal tarsltar oils {{in the area of the}} former tar distilleries and ligther distillation fractions in the area of the former benzene distileries located further downstream. The initial composition of NAPLs was variable, but also contamination events occured over almost one century at different points in time. The composition of the sources has changed during decades, mainly due to faster release of easy soluble compounds into the groundwater and enrichment of the less soluble ones in the organic mixtures. Compounds recalcitrant to biodegradation, such as acenaphthene, which persist in high concentrations in the aqueous phase, were found to be also enriched in aged NAPLs, probably by partitioning from the groundwater into the leached organic phase. Dissolution out of residual NAPL phase and desorption out of contaminated aquifer material or low permeability zones were identified as the most important release mechanisms of coal tar constituents into the groundwater. The maximum concentrations for dissolution out of residual phase monitored in column experiments in the laboratory were equal to the saturation concentrations and depend on the composition of the mixture. In most cases, dissolution out of residual phase takes place only within a short domain relative to the entire volume containing residual NAPL, explaining the extremely long periods of time needed for complete dissolution. Mass transfer zones longer than the contaminated domain are more asvantageous for remediation purposes, as they allow higher mass fluxes for dissolution. Even if saturation is reached, measured concentrations depend on the observation scale. In small, homogeneous columns in the laboratory or locally in the field - e. g. individual sampling ports in multilevel wells - the measured concentration equals saturation. Average concentrations in multilevel wells were indeed in very good accordance with saturation concentrations for the organic mixture from the same location. In larger columns or in conventional, depth averaged groundwater samples, the observed concentration would be lower due to dillution effects, although saturation is locally attained. For desorption, the maximum concentrations in column experiments were much lower than for dissolution out of residual phase. For a given contaminated volume, diffusion limited desorption plays a secondary role, as long as residual NAPL is present. However, release rates measured in column experiments cannot be extrapolated to field conditions without knowledge of the contamination history and the exact volume and geometry of the source. Field investigations (concentrations in multilevel wells, pumping tests) showed that, at least close to the source area, there are several different plumes. Sharp vertical concentration profiles may attenuate with increasing distance from the source. A further objective of this work was to characterise the behaviour of the most relevant compound classes in the contaminant plume, with Special emphasis on substances recalcitrant to biodegradation. Over the entire distance assessed (ca 130 m from the source area), the plume is entirely anaerobic. Due to poor biodegradation, as the distance from the source area increases, there is as an enrichment of 0 - and N-heterocyclic compounds in the plume relative to usually assessed tar constituants (PAHs and MAHs). Most of the investigated compounds undergo a first order decay process (linear decrease of concentration with distance in a semi-logarithmic plot). The half-life distance varied between 30 m for benzene and up to 200 m for <b>alkyl-naphthalenes.</b> With an estimated decay rate of only 0. 1 % per day, dimethyl-benzofurans were the most recalcitrant of all compounds that could be identified with the available analytical method. Acenaphthene is degraded only within about 50 m downstream from the source area, then its concentration remains almost constant and very high (ca 180 µg/l) over a long distance. This behaviour of acenaphthene has been observed at numerous other former gasworks sites. 1 s supports earlier findings that the biodegradation of acenaphthene under anaerobic conditions takes place only by cometabolism, e. g. with naphtahlene, and Comes to a standstill if the concentration of the easily biodegradable naphthalene drops under a certain threshold. It is not known how far the plume extends downstream at 'Testfeld Süd'. Freisetzung und Verhalten spezifischer organischer Schadstoffe an einem ehemaligen Gaswerkstandort An ehemaligen Gaswerkstandorten entstand über Jahrzehnte eine massive Verunreinigung vor allem durch Teer und Teerdestillate, sehr komplexe organische Gemische, die bis heute noch in erheblichen Mengen in den Untergrund vorliegen. Die Komplexität der Grundwasserkontamination beruht sowohl auf die toxischen, zum Teil kanzerogenen und mutagenen ursprünglichen Teerbestandteilen, als auch auf die komplizierten Umwandlungen dieser Stoffe infolge biologischer Abbauprozessen im Grundwasser. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war die Identifizierung und Quantifizierung standortrelevanter organischer Schadstoffe im Grundwasser des 'Testfeld Süd', ein ehemaliger Gaswerkstandort im Neckartal. Im Schadensherd am 'Testfeld Süd' liegt eine in ihrer Zusammensetzung sehr komplexe, heterogen verteilte residuale Teerphase vor. Es handelt sich um Gemische organischer Stoffe, hauptsächlich monozyklische aromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe (MAK), polyzykilsche aromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe (PAK) und hetrozyklische aromatische Verbindungen. Viele dieser Verbindungen (vor allem die Heterozyklen) sind in Routineanalysen an ähnlichen Standorten noch nicht untersucht worden. Aufgrund ihrer hohen Konzentrationen und Toxizität, sowie ihrer oft geringen Bioabbaubarkeit, stellen sie ein erhebliches Gefährdungspotential für das Grundwasser im Abstrom dar. Im Gelände wurden Teerphasenkörper identifiziert, die unterschiedliche Alterungsgrade aufweisen. Dieses ist sowohl durch technologisch bedingte unterschiedliche Zusammensetzung, aber auch durch zeitlich versetze Versickerung, also unterschiedliche Verweilzeiten im Untergrund zurückzuführen. Nicht oder sehr schwer abbaubare Stoffe, wie zum Beispiel Acenaphthen, die im Grundwasser in konstant hohen Konzentrationen vorliegen, sind zum Teil auch in gealterten Teerphasen angereichert. Langzeit-Säulenversuche zur Bestimmung der lösungs- und desorptionsbedingten Emission aus kontaminiertem Aquifermaterial zeigten, daß die Lösung aus residualer Phase für die sich im Grundwasser einstellenden Konzentrationen maßgeblich ist. Die Desorption von Teerinhaltstoffen aus kontaminiertem Aquifermaterial bzw. der Eintrag aus Zonen geringer Durchlässigkeit werden von der Lösung aus residualer Teerphase vollständig überlagert. Die im Schadensherd im Multilevelmeßstellen ermittelten lokalen Konzentrationsmaxima stimmen mit den im Sduleneluat bei homogener Schadstoffverteilung bestimmten Sättigungskonzentrationen überein. Eine Übertragung der im Labor gemessenen Freisetzungsraten auf Feldmaßstab zur Grundwasser-Gefährdungsabschätzung ist nur möglich, wenn die Lage und Größe des kontaminierten Bereichs, die Kontaktoberfläche TeerIWasser und die Grundwassergeschwindigkeit bekannt sind. Felduntersuchungen (tiefenhorizontierte Konzentrationsprofile, Immissionspumpversuche) deuten darauf hin, daß nahe am Schadensherd mehrere Schadstoffahnen vorhanden sind. Im Abstrom vom Schadensherd wurde das Verhalten einzelner Schadstoffklassen in der 'Hauptfahne' untersucht. Die Schadstoffahne am 'Testfeld Süd' ist im gesamten untersuchten Bereich (ca 130 m vom Schadensherd in Grundwasserfließrichtung) anaerob. Es wurde eine Anreicherung von 0 - und N-Heterozyklen im Vergleich zu routinenmäßig quantifizierten Teerinhaltsstoffen (PAK und BTEX) festgestellt, was auf ihre geringe Bioabbaubarkeit zurückzuführen ist. Der Bioabbau der meisten Verbindungen in der Fahne verläuft als Reaktion erster Ordnung. Die Halbwärtsstrecke lag zwischen ca 30 m für Benzol und 200 m für Alkyl-Naphtaline. Die Konzentrationen der Alkyl-Benzofurane blieben praktisch unverändert mit zunehmender Entfernung vom Schadensherd. Die Acenaphthen-Konzentration nimmt nur innerhalb der ersten 50 m vom Schadensherd geringfügig ab und bleibt dann im Ubrigen, bisher erfassten Verlauf der Fahne, konstant hoch (ca 180 µg/l). Dadurch werden neueste Untersuchungen zum Bioabbau vom Acenaphthen aus Kreosot bestätigt die belegen, daß dieses nur durch Kometabolismus in Gegenwart von Naphthalin oder Phenanthren abgebaut werden kann; selbst dann sind die Abbauraten nur gering. Damit könnte die auch an anderen Gaswerkstandorten festgestellte Persistenz von Acenaphthen im Grundwasser erklärt werden. Weil Naphthalin von allen PAK aufgrund der hohen Wasserlöslichkeit sehr schnell im Teer abgereichert und biologisch abgebaut wird, kommt wahrscheinlich auch der Acenaphthenabbau rasch zum Erliegen. Die tatsächliche Länge der Schadstoffahne am 'Testfeld Süd' ist bisher noch nicht bekannt...|$|R
