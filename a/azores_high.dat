50|$|The warming {{of the air}} near to {{the ground}} leads to rising {{movements}} and the atmosphere becomes less stable. One of these patterns is the air pressure difference between the Arctic and mid-latitudes: the so-called Arctic oscillation with the <b>Azores</b> <b>highs</b> and Iceland lows known from the weather reports. If this difference is high, a strong westerly wind will result which in winter carries warm and humid Atlantic air masses right down to Europe. In the negative phase when pressure differences are low, cold Arctic air can then easily penetrate southward through Europe without being interrupted by the usual westerlies, {{as has been the}} case frequently over the last three winters. Model calculations show that the air pressure difference with decreased sea ice cover in the Arctic summer is weakened in the following winter, enabling Arctic cold to push down to mid-latitudes.|$|R

5|$|Proxy records {{based on}} paleotempestological {{research}} {{have revealed that}} major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia. Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium.

Encountering the anticyclone situated off of the Mid-Atlantic states, Helene began to curve slightly towards the west. The lack of strong steering currents in the storm's vicinity caused the hurricane to move very slowly throughout the day, giving the hurricane time to significantly intensify. By 0000 UTC on September 26, Helene strengthened to {{the equivalent of a}} modern-day Category 2 hurricane, with a minimum pressure of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94 inHg). Moving slowly towards The Carolinas, the hurricane rapidly intensified. A recon flight reported a minimum pressure of 948 mbar (hPa; 28.00 inHg), a drop of 40 mbar (hPa; 1.18 inHg) from the previous day. As the hurricane neared the coast, its eye became apparent on coastal long-range WSR-57 weather radar images. By 1800 UTC on September 26, Helene strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane and then to a Category 4 hurricane the following day. The major hurricane continued to strengthen before reaching its peak intensity on September 27 with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). However, Helene's lowest barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg) was recorded earlier during the day.

50|$|At 12:00 UTC on September 11, Humberto reached {{hurricane}} status while turning northward. About {{six hours}} later, it peaked with sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). By late on September 12, increasing wind shear, cooling sea surface temperatures, {{and a more}} stable atmosphere led to a weakening trend of the storm. Around 12:00 UTC on the next day, Humberto fell to tropical storm intensity, while curving west-northwestward in the low-level flow south of the <b>Azores</b> surface <b>high</b> pressure. Early on September 14, the storm degenerated into a remnant low. However, deep convection began re-developing later that day. At 00:00 UTC on September 15, Humberto regenerated into a tropical storm about 1,095 mi (1,760 km) southwest of Ponta Delgada, Azores. An approaching mid- to upper-level cyclone began to capture Humberto, causing the storm to decelerate between late on September 16 and early on September 17. When Humberto's low-level circulation became vertically stacked under the non-tropical cyclone, the system transitioned into a subtropical storm on September 17. Humberto then weakened to a subtropical depression early the next day, about 1120 mi south of Ponta Delgada. The subtropical depression continued north-northwestward until degenerating into an open trough, and was soon absorbed by a cold front.|$|R

40|$|The 3 He/ 4 He {{ratio and}} helium {{concentration}} have been {{measured in the}} vent fluids and the dispersing plume of the Rainbow hydrothermal site, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). The 3 He/ 4 He ratio (7. 51 Ra) and 3 He end-member concentration (25 pmol/kg) {{are in the range}} of observed values elsewhere on mid-ocean ridges, pointing to the relative homogeneity of the upper mantle with respect to helium isotope geochemistry. 3 He is linearly correlated with methane and manganese throughout the plume, with CH 4 / 3 He and Mn/ 3 He ratios identical to those measured in the hot fluids. The bulk residence time of the plume in the rift valley estimated from the plume 3 He budget is V 20 days. The 3 He flux transported by the plume, calculated from current-meter data, is 12. 3 : 3 nmol/s, requiring a flux of 490 kg/s of high-temperature fluid. The scaling of the heat flux emitted by the Rainbow site to that of 3 He, using the 3 He/heat ratio measured in the hydrothermal fluids (9. 3 : 2 U 10318 mol/J), indicates a heat output of 1320 MW. With a regional spreading rate of V 25 mm/year, we calculate that the annual 3 He flux for this section of the MAR is of the order of 0. 5 : 0. 2 mmol per kilometre of ridge per millimetre of newly formed crust. This figure compares well with the flux calculated for the neighbouring Lucky Strike segment. Although the uncertainties remain large, both fluxes are V 40 - 50 % above the world average (0. 33 mmol/km/mm), thus supporting earlier suggestions that the intensity of the hydrothermal activity south of the <b>Azores</b> is <b>higher</b> than expected from the regional spreading rate...|$|R

This heterogeneity reflects a contrasting influence of oceanographic processes on the distribution of cetacean species.

40|$|The present thesis’ {{topic is}} the {{biomonitoring}} of atmospheric trace elements with {{attention focused on}} the long-range transported trace elements. The aim was to provide improved understanding of aerosol characteristics under the atmospheric transport dynamics of Central North Atlantic at different altitudes, and also evaluate the usability of lichen transplants to monitor those long-range transported elements. The study was carried out at Pico mountain in <b>Azores,</b> Portugal. The <b>high</b> altitude of this mountain reaching the Low Free Troposphere and {{its position in the}} central North Atlantic were the decisive factors for the selection of this sample site, because it was possible to analyze aerosol deposition from surrounding continents (Africa, Europe and Central-North America) at the layer of the atmosphere where the aerosol transportation occurs, both with sample collectors (active sampling) and with biomonitors (passive sampling). Since the number of samples was several hundreds, the thesis also includes a study on analytical aspects: a comparison of Nuclear Activation Analysis methods, in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and flexibility in routine application. The thesis comprises three main parts, divided in 8 chapters, including the general introduction and the general discussion and outlook: the first part is about a comparison of several NAA approaches under different experimental conditions; the second part is about aerosol characterization and source apportionment; and the third part focused on vitality of transplanted lichens and their usability, the latter in the case study implying several altitudes transects at Pico mountain, aiming at the possible recognition of elemental deposition from long-range pollution sources.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the integration of}} additive partitioning with species [...] area relationships to island biogeography {{in order to address}} the question "How are the pteridophyte and spermatophyte native and endemic flora of different oceanic archipelagos partitioned across islands?". Species richness data of all endemic species and all native species of pteridophytes and spermatophytes were obtained for the Azores, Canaries and Cape Verde in the Atlantic Ocean and Galbpagos, Hawaii and Marquesas in the Pacific Ocean. Additive partitioning of species diversity was used to quantify how much of the total diversity of an oceanic archipelago flora ([gamma]-diversity) is due to (i) the mean species richness of the flora of each island ([alpha]-diversity), (ii) the variability in species richness of the floras across islands ([beta]Nestedness) and (iii) the complementarity in species composition of the floras of different islands ([beta]Replacement). The analysis was separately performed for the native and endemic pteridophyte and spermatophyte floras. The diversity partitioning of the six archipelagos showed large differences in how the flora of each archipelago is partitioned among the [alpha], [beta]Nestedness and [beta]Replacement components, for pteridophytes and spermatophytes and for all endemic species and all native species. The [alpha]-diversity was more important for all native species than for endemic species and more important for pteridophytes than for spermatophytes, with the <b>Azores</b> showing outstanding <b>high</b> values of [alpha]-diversity. The [beta]Nestedness was higher for pteridophytes than for spermatophytes and higher for endemic species than for all native species in both pteridophytes and spermatophytes. The values of [beta]Replacement suggested that: (i) the spermatophyte native flora is more differentiated across islands than the pteridophyte native flora and (ii) the pteridophyte endemic flora and, especially, the spermatophyte endemic flora are more differentiated across islands than the corresponding native flora. An outstanding value of [beta]Replacement for endemic and all native spermatophytes was found in Hawaii, confirming the biogeographical island differentiation in this archipelag...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC) 2007. In {{recent years}} Harmonia axyridis (Pallas, 1773) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) {{has become a}} very popular insect among {{biological}} control practitioners and scientists, {{not only for its}} potential to be an efficient biological control agent but also because it is considered invasive. Individuals of this species were deliberately introduced into several countries for biological control of different arthropods pests. However the predator itself became an invasive species, affecting the dynamics and composition of several guilds through direct or indirect interactions with established species, including intraguild predation. In this paper we discuss the reasons why the species has a high invasiveness and what are the limits to invasion by this species. It is not clear if the invasiveness of the beetle is linked to its biological, ecological and behavioural abilities, or to other factors such as invasibility and interactions between the invaders, the noninvaders, and the habitat, which may in part explain the reasons of its success and help us to answer the question “what will stop the invader?” We also discuss the reason for the absence of the predator in the Azores islands. Despite the intentional introduction of H. axyridis in the <b>Azores</b> and the <b>high</b> number of individuals released, there are no records of this species in the wild, despite recent extensive sampling effort. In this paper we discuss the reasons for the apparent failure or the delay in establishment of the predator. One factor which may hamper the establishment of H. axyridis in some of the Azores islands is the absence of winter environmental conditions, mainly the temperature which is seldom lower than 12 °C, essential for the induction of diapause. The lack of success in the establishment could be also related to functional diversity saturation, that is species saturation and competitive exclusion of H. axyridis by other previously established species may be operating...|$|R
500|$|According to the <b>Azores</b> <b>High</b> {{hypothesis}} by Kam-biu Liu, an anti-phase {{pattern is}} expected to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the North American Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods (3000–1400 BC, and 1000 AD to present), a more northeasterly position of the <b>Azores</b> <b>High</b> would result in more hurricanes being steered toward the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period (1400 BC to 1000 AD), more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the <b>Azores</b> <b>High</b> was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the <b>Azores</b> <b>High</b> is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP,C yr Record of Climate and Vegetation Change from Haiti |journal=Quaternary Research |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=159–170 |doi=10.1006/qres.1999.2062 [...] |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1999QuRes..52..159H|display-authors=etal}} and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the <b>Azores</b> <b>High</b> hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity has increased significantly during the past 500–1000 years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.|$|E
