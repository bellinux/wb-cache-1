30|$|Generally speaking, <b>AC</b> {{traction}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> {{is applied}} for rural areas in Japan {{as shown in}} Fig.  5, and {{the total amount of}} residual regenerative energy tends to be small in <b>AC</b> traction <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> because of its low operation frequency. The Joban Line was, exceptionally, electrified by AC 20  kV near Tokyo area because there is Kakioka Magnetic Observatory of Japan Meteorological Agency and so the DC electrification of railway was restricted by the low frequency of operations to avoid the influence of DC stray current on the survey of geomagnetic intensity. In this area, the number of operated electric trains is moderate enough because Ushiku SP (Sectioning Post) on Joban Line is located near Tokyo, about 40  km from city center. Here, SP is located between two substations and two single-phase circuits from each substation are faced at SP.|$|R
30|$|Considering the {{characteristics}} of the traction <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> for trunk railways, metros, and light rails in urban transit system, and comparing the merits and demerits between the DC system and the industrial frequency single-phase AC system, it is naturally necessary to provide a new industrial frequency single-phase <b>AC</b> traction <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> without phase-split or stray current in urban transit system.|$|R
30|$|To avoid {{stray current}} and {{maintain}} the benefit of no phase-split in the DC traction <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system,</b> an <b>AC</b> traction <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> was proposed for the urban public transport such as metro and light rail transit. The proposed system consists of a main substation (MSS) and cable traction network (CTN). The MSS includes a single-phase main traction transformer and a negative-sequence compensation device, while the CTN includes double-core cables, traction transformers, overhead catenary system, rails, etc. Several key techniques for the proposed system were put forward and discussed, which can be summarized as (1) the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> principle, equivalent circuit and transmission ability of the CTN, the cable-catenary matching technique, and the selection of catenary voltage level; (2) the segmentation technology and status identification method for traction <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> network, distributed and centralized protection schemes, etc.; (3) a <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> scheme for single-line MSS and a <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> scheme of MSS shared by two or more lines. The proposed industrial frequency single-phase <b>AC</b> traction <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> shows an excellent technical performance, good economy, and high reliability, hence provides a new alternative for metro and urban rail transit <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{development}} of the high-speed railway in China where the mileages has been increased substantially {{in recent years has}} shown the advantages of using industrial frequency (50 / 60 Hz) single-phase AC traction power supply system [1]. However, the phase split in such a system becomes the breakpoint of power supply to the train [2, 3, 4], which could affect the power traction generation. It is also the point where the mechanical failure could occur so that the system reliability is degraded. In Germany and its neighboring countries, the low-frequency single-phase <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> is adopted. Although the system can realize co-phase traction power supply without phase splits, the high cost limits its worldwide applications. It is concluded that in an electrified railway traction power supply system, avoiding phase splits while keeping investment costs down {{is one of the most}} important factors to be considered.|$|E
30|$|Compared to trunk railways, the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{lines of}} metros and light rails are shorter, usually less than 50  km, {{and does not}} have line-crossing or line-joining. To achieve an <b>AC</b> {{traction}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> for metros and light rails without phase-split, a direct approach {{would be used to}} co-phase <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> technique that was proposed for trunk railways [8, 9, 10] and the recently developed traction <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> of new generation [11]. However, the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> for metros and light rails is significantly different from that for trunk railways, because it has shorter <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> line, lower voltage grade, and denser traction substations. In order to reduce the impact of negative-sequence current, negative-sequence compensation devices have to be installed at every traction substation. Additionally, bilateral supply mode needs to be carried out at section posts (between two adjacent substations) by connecting different <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> lines at the high-voltage side, which is known as loop closing [12, 13]. Feasibility study must be carried out after obtaining consent from power sectors. To avoid complications and difficulties mentioned above, a new industrial frequency-based single-phase <b>AC</b> traction <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> using 35  kV cables is proposed in this paper for urban rail transit, {{due to the fact that}} 35  kV cables have widely been used in metro systems.|$|R

The electronic circuit will fill the gaps of the distorted current waveform so that it becomes sinusoidal and also in phase with the mains supply. In this paper different configurations of the proposed electronic circuit are covered (depending on the location with respect to the non-linear load). An optimization algorithm is carried out in order to find the best location, minimum device rating for different type of loads.

The paper suggests innovative energy saving directions in traction networks of railways and new circuit solutions accessing traction substations in energy systems networks, ensure energy security of the transportation process. To ensure the energy security of rail transport special schemes were developed to propose the concept of external power traction substations, which would {{increase the number of}} connections to the networks of 220 – 330 kV, as well as the creation of transport and energy corridors, development of its own supply of electric networks of 110 kV substations and mobile RP- 110 kV of next generation. Therefore, the investment program of the structures owned by the Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) need to be synchronized in their technological characteristics, as well as the criteria of reliability and quality of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> with the same external energy investment programs. It is found that without any load on left or right supplying arm one of two less loaded phases of traction transformer begins generating specific modes in the supplying three-phase line. Thus, modes of mobile substation cause leakage in one of the phases of the supply line of traction transformers of active-capacitive current, and as a result generating energy in the main power line of 154 kV, which is fixed and calculated by electricity meters.

The mathematical model of aircraft synchronous generator, electricity distribution, three-phase static active-inductive load are considered. When making a mathematical description the author used the equations for the voltages of windings and flux linkages cir- cuits of the stator and rotor of the generator in a stationary system phase coordinates "ABC". When considering the mathe- matical model of the distribution system, the equations that took into account the drop of the voltages on the active and inductive resistance of the distribution system power wires were used. When considering the mathematical models of three- phase static loads connected on a "wye with neutral" and "delta", the equations that took into account the drop of the volt- ages on the active and inductive resistance loads were used. The matrix equations system of channel PSS AC when running on a generalized three-phase static active-inductive load was obtained. The three phase static loads scheme connected ac- cording to the "delta" scheme was converted to "wye" to simplify the solution of channel PSS AC circuit matrix equations system. The choice of the phase coordinates system "ABC" for the mathematical description of the generator, distribution system and the static load was made due to its advantage over the coordinate system "dq", because the equation written in phase coordinates are valid for symmetric and asymmetric modes of the generator, while the equations written in the coor- dinate system "dq" will be valid only for symmetric modes. As a result of joint solution of the generator equations, distribution system, three-phase static loads there were obtained the formulae for the generator stator winding phases, gen- erator phases currents, the voltage drops on the load phases and load phases currents connected on a "wye with neutral" and "delta"...|$|R
