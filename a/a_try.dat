5|$|Geen was {{selected}} to play for Oxford against Cambridge in four consecutive years from 1910 to 1913. In the first of these, on 13 December 1910, a 9,000-strong crowd turned up at Queen's, mostly to watch Ronnie Poulton, playing for Oxford. Cambridge started strong but <b>a</b> <b>try</b> by Bryn Lewis was disallowed in the opening minutes after a touch judge signalled that Geen had put his foot into touch in the preceding Oxford move. Moments later, Poulton ran through the Cambridge defence, drew the fullback and passed to Geen to dive in at the corner for <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> With Turner's conversion, Oxford led 5–0. A similar passage of play again saw Poulton put Geen through for <b>a</b> <b>try,</b> but he dropped the ball after crossing the line while trying {{to get closer to}} the posts.|$|E
5|$|Hunt scored <b>a</b> <b>try</b> {{in each of}} {{the first}} two games of the season. In Round 6, he was knocked {{unconscious}} by a high tackle from a St George Illawarra Dragons player, Shaun Timmins. The following week, still suffering from the effects of concussion, he missed his first NRL game since his debut. Hunt returned a week later and scored <b>a</b> <b>try</b> {{in each of the}} next three games. However, he only scored three more tries in the remaining sixteen weeks of the season. Hunt {{was a part of the}} junior Australian representative team at the end of the 2005 season, but was not considered for the game against Papua New Guinea for personal reasons.|$|E

Biggs played twice more for the Barbarians, both matches against Bath Rugby. In the 1894 encounter Biggs converted <b>a</b> <b>try</b> in a 14-0 victory, while the 1896 match saw Biggs score <b>a</b> <b>try</b> and two conversions in a 13-13 draw.|$|E
5|$|Just before half time, <b>a</b> <b>try</b> by Newport's Jack Wetter was {{disallowed}} for {{a forward}} pass. The ball was then worked back to Fred Birt, standing within range {{in front of}} the posts, and he kicked a drop-goal, putting the home side 4–0 ahead at the break. In the second half, the Springboks repeatedly attacked but the Newport defence kept them from crossing the line, although a break from Dick Luyt, the South African centre, left Douglas Morkel to score under the posts. Luyt failed to convert and Newport remained a point ahead. Newport scored again through a cross-kick from Wetter, which Birt jumped on over the line for <b>a</b> <b>try,</b> which he then converted.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} played on 18 November on an icy pitch (straw had not been spread over the pitch the night before), which nearly caused the game to be cancelled. The All Blacks kicked off, and had {{the best of the}} first ten minutes. Scotland {{eventually}} got a scrum near the All Blacks goal-line, and after winning the scrum, passed to Ernest Simson, who dropped a goal to put Scotland ahead 4–0. It {{was the first time the}} All Blacks had been behind on tour. The All Blacks replied with <b>a</b> <b>try</b> under the posts, which was unconverted. A second try was then scored, by Smith; again it went unconverted. Scotland then scored an unconverted try, to lead at half time 7–6. With less than ten minutes to go the score remained 7–6 and it looked like the All Blacks might lose their first match on tour. However, with four minutes to go the All Blacks had a scrum on halfway; the resulting movement finished with George Smith crossing for <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> Bill Cunningham then scored <b>a</b> <b>try</b> with seconds remaining, and the All Blacks were victorious 12–7.|$|E

5|$|Bennett {{pulled his}} first {{selection}} surprise of 2007, experimenting with Hunt at halfback {{for the opening}} game of the season. At the time Bennett maintained {{that this would be}} a long term switch, but due to the Broncos' poor form, Hunt returned to fullback for Round 3. Hunt was selected to play for the Australian national team at fullback in the 2007 ANZAC Test match against New Zealand, scoring <b>a</b> <b>try</b> in the Kangaroos' 30-6 victory.|$|E
5|$|Centre Philippe Sella (born 1962), who {{was also}} in the 1987 team, played 111 times for France between 1982 and 1995, setting an {{appearances}} record that stood until Fabien Pelous broke it during the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In 1986, he achieved the rare feat of scoring <b>a</b> <b>try</b> in each of France's Five Nations matches. Sella entered the International Hall in 1999 and the IRB Hall in 2005.|$|E
5|$|England {{reached the}} final again in 2007, where they faced South Africa, {{who had won}} 36–0 when the two teams met during the pool stage. South African full-back Percy Montgomery scored three {{penalties}} to Wilkinson's one to give South Africa a 9–3 lead at half-time. England had <b>a</b> <b>try</b> disallowed in the first minutes of the second half, when Mark Cueto was adjudged {{to be in touch}} before scoring. A penalty from Wilkinson and a further two from Montgomery reduced the gap but did not prevent South Africa from winning 15–6 and secure their second World Cup victory. The 2011 final pitted hosts New Zealand against France {{for the second time in}} the tournament, after their first encounter in the pool stage resulted in a 37–17 win for New Zealand. The host team scored the first points of the match, with <b>a</b> <b>try</b> in the 15th minute through prop Tony Woodcock. Nine minutes later, New Zealand's third-choice fly-half Aaron Cruden went off injured and was replaced by Stephen Donald, who had only been called into the squad following injuries to first-choice fly-halves Dan Carter and Colin Slade. Donald extended New Zealand's lead in the second half with a penalty; a minute later, French captain Thierry Dusautoir scored <b>a</b> <b>try,</b> which was converted by François Trinh-Duc to leave France one point behind New Zealand. Despite constant pressure from the French for the remainder of the final, they were unable to score more points and New Zealand won the match 8–7 to lift their second World Cup trophy.|$|E

5|$|For {{the return}} match between NSW and the British Isles on 25 June, each side made four changes. In the opening period, the sides were evenly matched but {{eventually}} the British scored <b>a</b> <b>try</b> in the corner, which was converted, and a second try soon after took them eight points clear. The visitors were up 13–0 at half time after another converted try: the home side had made numerous attacking attempts but had failed to cross the line. The second half started as the first had ended, with NSW dominating, but they failed to score; instead, the British managed to counter-attack to score another converted try. NSW then managed to score <b>a</b> <b>try</b> but Verge failed to convert. The tourists then scored another three tries, one of them converted. With Britain leading 3–29 in the closing minutes, NSW scored a second try; this time Wickham missed the conversion. The final score was 6–29.|$|E

5|$|In Round 11, the Broncos {{had their}} biggest victory yet, winning 71–6 over Newcastle. In that game Hunt set up three tries and scored one himself. The Brisbane {{newspaper}} The Sunday Mail described Hunt as not performing consistently throughout the 2007 {{season for the}} Broncos. However, Hunt played an exceptionally good game in Round 15 against the Wests Tigers, scoring three tries, assisting in <b>a</b> <b>try</b> and gaining 281 metres in the Broncos' win.|$|E

5|$|The 1971 Five Nations Championship {{was a new}} dawn for Welsh rugby. The new National Stadium was completed, and {{the team}} now into their Second Golden era were both {{experienced}} and talented. John and Edwards played in all four games, starting with an easy win over England. Wales won 22–6, with John scoring six points from two dropped goals. The second game of the Championship, played against Scotland, was a close encounter, won by Wales 19–18 thanks to a late Gerald Davies try converted by John Taylor. Barry John scored eight of Wales' points, with <b>a</b> <b>try,</b> penalty goal and a conversion; missing only his trademark drop goal to complete a full house of scores. John surpassed his Scotland tally in the next match, a home game against Ireland, scoring 11points with a dropped goal, conversion and two penalty goals. Seen as one of Wales' more accomplished victories, the 23–0 win gave the team a Triple Crown title, {{and set up a}} Grand Slam encounter with France. Despite the low score, the 9–5 win over France at Stade Colombes on 27 March was a match of the highest quality. Edwards and John scored all the points in the encounter, Edwards with <b>a</b> <b>try,</b> John <b>a</b> <b>try</b> and a penalty goal. This was Wales' first Grand Slam since 1952 and the 1971 squad is seen as the greatest ever to be fielded by Wales.|$|E
5|$|The Brisbane Broncos {{defeated}} the Storm 15–8 in the 2006 NRL Grand Final. The Storm sought revenge through a 40–0 thrashing in the 2007 Qualifying Final at Olympic Park Stadium. The 2008 Semi-Final at Suncorp Stadium ended with Melbourne dramatically winning 16–14 with <b>a</b> <b>try</b> {{on the final}} play of the game. In 2009 Brisbane were again beaten by eventual premiers Melbourne, this time 40–10 at Etihad Stadium, catapulting the Storm to their 4th consecutive Grand Final Appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of rugby {{in the first}} half of the 19th century was driven by ex-pupils from many of England's Public Schools, especially Rugby, who, upon finishing school, took the game with them to universities, to London, and to the counties. England's first international match was against Scotland on Monday 27 March 1871. Not only was this match England's first, but it also proved to be the first ever rugby union international. Scotland won the match by a goal and <b>a</b> <b>try</b> to <b>a</b> <b>try,</b> in front of a crowd of 4,000 people at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. A subsequent international took place at the Oval in London on 5 February 1872 which saw England defeat Scotland by a goal, a drop goal and two tries to one drop goal. In those early days there was no points system, it was only after 1890 that a format allowing the introduction of a points system was provided. Up until 1875 international rugby matches were decided by the number of goals scored (conversions and dropped goals), but from 1876 the number of tries scored could be used to decide a match if teams were level on goals.|$|E
