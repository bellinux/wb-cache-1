(Talk presented at 32 nd Ahrenshoop International Symposium on Elementary Particle Theory in Buckow, Germany) 1 Problems with Conventional Approach The construction of a field theory <b>action</b> <b>for</b> the superstring is an important problem since it may lead to information about non-perturbative superstring theory which is unobtainable from the on-shell perturbative S-matrix. This information might be useful for understanding the nonperturbative dualities of the superstring. Although there was much activity ten years ago concerning a field theory <b>action</b> <b>for</b> the bosonic string, there was not much progress on constructing a field theory <b>action</b> <b>for</b> the superstring. For reasons described below, there was no obvious generalization of the bosonic string field theory action to the superstring. Since th...|$|R

Useful information has also been obtained from the opinions of general advocates of the CJEU. The article of TFEU 265, which governs the <b>action</b> <b>for</b> failure to act, is very abstract. For this reason, a whole procedure under the article 265 TFEU was developed by the EU courts. The original purpose of the <b>action</b> <b>for</b> failure to act was to constitute whether European Union (EU) institution properly fulfilled its obligations under the EU legislation. However, in the course of case-law, a mere EU institution’s express refusal to fulfill its duties became sufficient to constitute that the EU institution acted and therefore <b>action</b> <b>for</b> failure to act became devoid of purpose.
