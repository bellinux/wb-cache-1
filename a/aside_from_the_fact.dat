25|$|Pachelbel's {{large-scale}} vocal {{works are}} mostly written in modern style influenced by Italian Catholic music, {{with only a}} few non-concerted pieces and old plainchant cantus firmus techniques employed very infrequently. The string ensemble is typical for the time, three viols and two violins. The former are either used to provide harmonic content in instrumental sections or to double the vocal lines in tutti sections; the violins either engage in contrapuntal textures of varying density or are employed for ornamentation. Distinct features of Pachelbel's vocal writing in these pieces, <b>aside</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it is almost always very strongly tonal, include frequent use of permutation fugues and writing for paired voices. The Magnificat settings, most composed during Pachelbel's late Nuremberg years, are influenced by the Italian-Viennese style and distinguish themselves from their antecedents by treating the canticle {{in a variety of ways}} and stepping away from text-dependent composition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aside</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that the}} Gospels provide {{different}} {{accounts of the}} Jewish role in Jesus's death (for example, Mark and Matthew report two separate trials, Luke one, and John none), Fredriksen, like other scholars (see Catchpole 1971) argues that many elements of the gospel accounts {{could not possibly have}} happened: according to Jewish law, the court could not meet at night; it could not meet on a major holiday; Jesus's statements to the Sanhedrin or the High Priest (e.g. that he was the messiah) did not constitute blasphemy; the charges that the Gospels purport the Jews to have made against Jesus were not capital crimes against Jewish law; even if Jesus had been accused and found guilty of a capital offense by the Sanhedrin, the punishment would have been death by stoning (the fates of Saint Stephen and James the Just for example) and not crucifixion. This necessarily assumes that the Jewish leaders were scrupulously obedient to Roman law, and never broke their own laws, customs or traditions even for their own advantage. In response, {{it has been argued that}} the legal circumstances surrounding the trial have not been well understood, and that Jewish leaders were not always strictly obedient, either to Roman law or to their own. Furthermore, talk of a restoration of the Jewish monarchy was seditious under Roman occupation. Further, Jesus would have entered Jerusalem at an especially risky time, during Passover, when popular emotions were running high. Although most Jews did not have the means to travel to Jerusalem for every holiday, virtually all tried to comply with these laws as best they could. And during these festivals, such as the Passover, the population of Jerusalem would swell, and outbreaks of violence were common. Scholars suggest that the High Priest feared that Jesus' talk of an imminent restoration of an independent Jewish state might spark a riot. Maintaining the peace was one of the primary jobs of the Roman-appointed High Priest, who was personally responsible to them for any major outbreak. Scholars therefore argue that he would have arrested Jesus for promoting sedition and rebellion, and turned him over to the Romans for punishment.However, Paul's preaching of the Gospel and its radical social practices were by their very definition a direct affront to the social hierarchy of Greco-Roman society itself, and thus these new teachings undermined the Empire, ultimately leading to full-scale Roman persecution of Christians aimed at stamping out the new faith.|$|E

40|$|The Benguela {{upwelling}} in Namibia and South Africa {{experienced an}} ecosystem collapse after overfishing in the 1960 s and 1970 s, and as several industrially important species became scarce, others grew abundant. One {{of these was}} Sufflogobius bibarbatus, {{also known as the}} pelagic goby. The Benguela ocean floor has many areas with low levels of oxygen combined with high concentrations of H 2 S. These potentially lethal conditions are avoided by most species, but the pelagic goby spend daytime in this inhospitable mud. In April 2008 a the research vessel “G. O. Sars” left port in Namibia, with a goal of investigating exactly how and why the goby prefer to seek shelter in such areas. 	Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the fourth complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. It uses oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor during oxidative phosphorylation. Without oxygen oxidative phosphorylation stops and ATP production has to rely on anaerobic glycolysis. Accumulation of the end-product lactate is potentially deadly, and must be avoided. H 2 S binds to COX and inhibits the interaction with oxygen, thus stopping oxidative phosphorylation, making the organism functionally anoxic. In this thesis I have used respirometry to investigate the hypoxia-tolerance and H 2 S-tolerence of the pelagic goby. Finally I have done real-time RT-PCR experiments to examine the expression of COX subunits I-III during exposure to anoxia and/or, H 2 S. 	My findings indicate that the pelagic goby is exceptionally good at taking up oxygen in hypoxia, being able to maintain resting oxygen consumption down to a water oxygen level of 5. 3 % of air saturation. It {{does not appear to have}} any special mechanism for tolerating H 2 S, <b>asides</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it can survive exposures to anoxia for hours.
