60|$|<b>And</b> <b>he,</b> <b>shaken</b> to {{the depths}} of his selfish soul by her tears, her {{clinging}} caresses, and her protestations of affection, answered with an oath and a sob that no better or more loyal and devoted subject than himself could all Scotland yield her.|$|R
60|$|Thursday's mobile countenance at once became profoundly sad, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> {{his head}} slowly.|$|E

60|$|COLONEL. 'You do, indeed,' <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>shakes</b> {{her with}} a ferocity that would have startled any sudden visitor.

60|$|So {{the servant}} {{gave her the}} pot of gold, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> tried to pluck the apple. First he reached for it, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> climbed for it, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> the limb.|$|R
