25|$|Six and Out - If {{you hit it}} {{over the}} fence you're out <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get the ball. The 6 runs are usually not awarded to the batsman unless agreed to by both teams. This rule is {{especially}} popular in small backyards (where the rule may be applied to any ball that lands over the fence - not just 6's), and encourages the batsman to exercise control and restraint by aiming for 4's instead of 6's. Six-and-out is also often extended to include nearby fragile objects such as windows and cars which are declared out-of-bounds; if a ball hits an out-of-bounds object on the full it is deemed six-and-out, even if no damage is evident.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free spool. They have a star drag <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep your thumb on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for really big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E

[...] The idea behind [...] "Next Tuesday" [...] came when Kindler and Wood noticed a rescue helicopter that was available for rent, prompting the two {{to come up with}} a [...] "helicopter story." [...] The episode also introduces a next level in Will and Magnus' friendship; arguments, which would create a [...] "far more realistic thread of tension" [...] between the two characters who [...] "obviously love each other," [...] and [...] "obviously get along," [...] which Kindler felt made a [...] "cool character layer." [...] This was also based on the producers themselves, who despite being good friends, often argue while producing the series.|$|E

The Deltalab set-up posed problems, because it included bare mains cables and dated, malfunctioning equipment from the 1960s and 1970s. Bloc Party took three sessions to get acquainted with Epworth's methodology. The producer has called the recording time a [...] "growing process" [...] because Okereke was not wholly comfortable singing in front of people, especially after tonsil problems. Although the band members had preliminary ideas about a track's rhythm, {{they did not know}} how songs were going to start or end.
