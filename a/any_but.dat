5|$|Following {{the sack}} of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the office's {{continuity}} was broken, {{and when it}} reappears in {{the sources of the}} Palaiologan period, it had lost any judicial functions and resembled more its original military character: according to the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the Grand Droungarios of the Watch was a subordinate of the Grand Domestic, charged with the night watch and with supervising the army's scouts. In reality, however, it had become more of a sinecure and was essentially a court dignity devoid of <b>any</b> <b>but</b> ceremonial duties.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 1864, the {{soldiers}} began traveling up Fishing Creek. For the next week, they searched the northern portion of Columbia County for deserters and draft evaders. They {{were unable to}} find <b>any,</b> <b>but</b> on August 28 they arrested 100 local citizens. Most were released, although some were taken to Fort Mifflin. The soldiers continued heading into the northernmost reaches of the Fishing Creek watershed. Unable to find any evidence of a conspiracy, they returned to Bloomsburg and remained in the county until December 1864. The last of the prisoners were released from Fort Mifflin several months after their arrest.|$|E
5|$|The 1st-centuryAD rhetorician Quintilian ranked Philitas {{second only}} to Callimachus among the elegiac poets. Philitas' {{influence}} has been found or suspected {{in a wide range}} of ancient writing; Longus' 2nd centuryAD novel Daphnis and Chloe contains a character likely named after him. Almost all that he wrote seems to have disappeared within two centuries, though, so it is unlikely that any writer later than the 2nd centuryBC read <b>any</b> <b>but</b> a few of his lines.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs {{benefit from}} feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in {{addition}} to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though some controversy exists over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in <b>any</b> <b>but</b> pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa {{as a source for}} replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber.|$|E

25|$|After 1871, Bavaria shared to {{the full}} in the rapid {{development}} of Germany; but her particularism, founded on traditional racial and religious antagonism to the Prussians, {{was by no means}} dead, though it exhibited itself in no more dangerous form than the prohibition, reissued in 1900, to display <b>any</b> <b>but</b> the Bavarian flag on public buildings on the emperor's birthday; a provision which was subsequently modified so as to allow the Bavarian and imperial flags to be hung side by side.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{the priesthood}} in Judaism has {{significantly}} diminished since {{the destruction of the}} Second Temple in 70 CE when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices. The priesthood is an inherited position, and although priests no longer have <b>any</b> <b>but</b> ceremonial duties, they are still honored in many Jewish communities. Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future Third Temple and need to remain in readiness for future duty.|$|E
25|$|But no {{organizing}} {{drive in}} steel emerged. The AFL executive council meeting in January 1935 considered organizing steel workers into FLUs, but only Green {{and two other}} vice presidents supported the plan. Green pointed out to the council that the AA had no resources to organize new members, and was philosophically opposed to organizing <b>any</b> <b>but</b> skilled workers. But the council refused to authorize an AFL-led organizing drive. Instead, the council voted to initiate a joint organizing drive similar to the failed 1919 campaign.|$|E

25|$|During the New Kingdom the pharaoh Akhenaten {{abolished}} the official worship of other gods {{in favor of}} the sun-disk Aten. This is often seen as the first instance of true monotheism in history, although the details of Atenist theology are still unclear and the suggestion that it was monotheistic is disputed. The exclusion of all but one god from worship was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition and some see Akhenaten as a practitioner of monolatry rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshipping <b>any</b> <b>but</b> the Aten. Under Akhenaten's successors Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.|$|E
25|$|The Act was {{intended}} to curb the cost of poor relief, and address abuses of the old system, prevalent in southern agricultural counties, by enabling a new system to be brought in under which relief would only be given in workhouses, and conditions in workhouses would be such as to deter <b>any</b> <b>but</b> the truly destitute from applying for relief. The Act was passed by large majorities in Parliament, {{with only a few}} Radicals (such as William Cobbett) voting against. The act was implemented, but the full rigours of the intended system were never applied in Northern industrial areas; however, the apprehension that they would be was a contributor to the social unrest of the period.|$|E
25|$|Her {{career began}} in 1909 when she replied {{to a local}} {{newspaper}} advertisement placed by producer/director Thomas Ince's Bison Motion Pictures. The movie studio was looking for someone with the physical attributes to portray an American Indian and who was physically capable of doing stunts and riding horses. While she had never acted before, Workman fit the appearance that Ince wanted. She apparently embellished her riding skills, as {{she did not have}} <b>any,</b> <b>but</b> nevertheless quickly learned horsemanship. Given the stage name Mona Darkfeather, she was cast in her first starring role as an Indian maiden named Owanee in the 1911 movie Owanee's Great Love.|$|E

25|$|Many RAOU {{members in}} the early 20th century called {{themselves}} 'oologists', though {{the distinction between the}} notionally scientific discipline of oology and simple egg-collecting was blurred. Identification of <b>any</b> <b>but</b> the most common and distinctive species usually entailed the collection of specimens to be made into study skins. Modern field-guides did not exist and few people could afford the massive multi-volume, lavishly illustrated, handbooks of John Gould and Gregory Mathews. However, both Archibald J. Campbell and Alfred North had produced comprehensive guides to what was known about the nests and eggs of Australian birds, with illustrations of the eggs rather than of the birds themselves, reflecting the dominance of egg and skin collecting in the ornithology of the time.|$|E
25|$|He was {{succeeded by}} Dom António José de Sousa Barroso, who {{within a few}} months of his arrival at Saint Thomas was {{promoted}} to the See of Oporto. Bishop Barroso was succeeded by bishop Dom Teotónio Manuel Ribeiro Vieira de Castro, who was presented on 12 June 1899, and confirmed by Leo XIII ten days later. He was consecrated at Oporto on 15 August 1899, and reached Saint Thomas on 23 December. The tercentenary of the creation of the diocese occurred in January 1906, in which almost all of the archbishops and bishops of the vast tract that constituted the original Diocese of Saint Thomas of Mylapur took part in person in addition to the delegate Apostolic and other prelates, numbering fifteen bishops in all. With the single exception of the Archdiocese of Madras, all of the dioceses into which the original Diocese of Saint Thomas of Mylapur is divided were served by non-British clergy, save for the Indian and few Indo-European priests, where there are <b>any.</b> <b>But</b> even in the Archdiocese of Madras, served by the British Missionary Society of St. Joseph, the majority of the priests and the coadjutor bishop were from the Continent. Dacca was served by the Fathers of the Holy Cross from Notre Dame, Indiana, United States of America.|$|E

500|$|The {{division}} of the legislature into an upper and lower house wasn't questioned either, despite the obscure origins of the English House of Lords and its role as {{the representative of the}} hereditary nobility. Americans had seldom known <b>any</b> <b>but</b> bicameral legislatures, both in Britain and in most state governments. The main exceptions to this were the dysfunctional Confederation Congress and the unicameral Pennsylvania legislature, which was seen as quickly vacillating between partisan extremes after each election. Experience had convinced the delegates that an upper house was necessary to tame the passions of the lower classes against the interests of wealthy merchants and landowners. Since America had no native hereditary aristocracy, the character of this upper house was designed to protect the interests of this wealthy elite, the [...] "minority of the opulent," [...] against the interests of the lower classes, who constituted the majority of the population.|$|E
500|$|A {{dissident}} Catholic, Guy Fawkes, {{was discovered}} in the cellars of the parliament buildings {{on the night of}} 4–5 November 1605, the eve of the state opening of the second session of James's first English Parliament. He was guarding a pile of wood not far from 36 barrels of gunpowder with which Fawkes intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction, as James put it, [...] "not only... of my person, nor of my wife and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general". The sensational discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, as it quickly became known, aroused a mood of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons. Salisbury exploited this to extract higher subsidies from the ensuing Parliament than <b>any</b> <b>but</b> one granted to Elizabeth. Fawkes and others implicated in the unsuccessful conspiracy were executed.|$|E
500|$|They {{knew little}} of the {{permanent}} effects of the war. Nine million had died and France lost more than <b>any.</b> <b>But,</b> as elsewhere, news was scant. Who even knew if {{there was still a}} road to Roubaix? If Roubaix was still there? The car of organisers and journalists made its way along the route those first riders had gone. And at first all looked well. There was destruction and there was poverty and there was a strange shortage of men. But France had survived. But then, as they neared the north, the air began to reek of broken drains, raw sewage and the stench of rotting cattle. Trees which had begun to look forward to spring became instead blackened, ragged stumps, their twisted branches pushed to the sky like the crippled arms of a dying man. Everywhere was mud. Nobody knows who first described it as 'hell', but there was no better word. And that's how it appeared next day in the papers: that little party had seen 'the hell of the north.' ...|$|E
