Color compounds formed in <b>alliaceous</b> <b>plants</b> significantly reduce their sensory quality percieved by consumers and represent a relatively significant financial burden for the food industry. While especially blue and yellow compounds are formed during processing of garlic, pink to red compounds are formed during processing of Sicilian honey garlic. The theoretical part of the Master's thesis {{is focused on}} two plants of the genus Allium L. - garlic and Sicilian honey garlic, their significance, occurrence and usage. The study also discusses the mechanism of color compounds formation, that involves mainly sulfur compounds. The experimental part of the Master's thesis is focused on isolation and identification {{of the most significant}} color compounds formed during processing of alliaceous species and proposal probable mechanism of their formation...|$|E
