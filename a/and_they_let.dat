500|$|In an {{interview}} for YouTube posted on December 24, 2009, Carey elaborated on the lyrical meaning, saying that it [...] "really hits people in their hearts because it's like... everybody has experienced when you love somebody, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>let</b> you go, but you can't let them go. So 'I can't wait to hate you' is a strong statement". Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club compared the seagull chirp [...] "vocal acrobatic" [...] sung by Carey during the track's climax to the whistle notes she sings on her 1991 single [...] "Emotions".|$|E
500|$|Speaking on the album's musical content, Armstrong remarked, [...] "For us, American Idiot {{is about}} taking those classic {{rock and roll}} elements, kicking out the rules, putting more {{ambition}} in, and making it current." [...] Part of recording the album was attempting to expand their familiar punk rock sound by experimenting with different styles such as new wave, Latin, and polka music. The band listened to various rock operas, including The Who's Tommy (1969) and David Bowie's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972). Armstrong was particularly inspired by the Who's Quadrophenia, finding {{more in common with}} its [...] "power chord mod-pop aesthetic" [...] than other concept records, such as The Wall by Pink Floyd. In addition, they listened to the cast recordings of Broadway musicals West Side Story, The Rocky Horror Show, Grease, and Jesus Christ Superstar, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>let</b> contemporary music influence them, including rappers Eminem and Kanye West, as well as rock band Linkin Park. Armstrong considered rock music a [...] "conservative" [...] business with regard to the rigidity in which a band must release a single, create a music video, or head out on tour. He felt groups like hip hop duo OutKast were [...] "kicking rock's ass, because there's so much ambition." ...|$|E
2500|$|The curse falls {{upon the}} town, an indigo {{thunderstorm}} covers the town, and mirror shards begin to rain {{down from the}} sky as Hook looks on from the docks.

2500|$|In later years, Burr freely invented {{stories of}} a happy childhood. In 1986 he told {{journalist}} Jane Ardmore {{that when he was}} 12 years old his mother sent him to New Mexico for a year to work as a ranch hand. He was already his full adult height and rather large and [...] "had fallen in with a group of college-aged kids who didn't realize how young Raymond was, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>let</b> him tag along with them in activities and situations far too sophisticated for him to handle." [...] He developed a passion for growing things and, while still a teenager, joined the Civilian Conservation Corps for a year. Throughout his teenage years, he had some acting work, making his stage debut at age 12 with a Vancouver stock company.|$|E
2500|$|Goddard was {{appointed}} captain for the five-Test {{series against the}} visiting English side in 1964–65. However, after England won the First Test and the next two were drawn, the selectors asked him to relinquish the captaincy. They wanted him to issue a statement, [...] "the gist of which {{was that he had}} asked to be relieved of the captaincy". He refused to do so, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>let</b> him remain captain {{for the rest of the}} series. When he scored his only Test century, 112, in the Fourth Test, [...] "almost the entire England team moved over to congratulate this most popular player. The crowd rose for fully a minute. It was an inspiring spectacle." [...] Goddard finished the series with 405 runs at 40.50, and 6 wickets at 51.66.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{expected}} a less personal {{treatment for the}} film and were at times uncomfortable with {{the extent to which}} Guggenheim probed into their history. Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, [...] "I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers. My process strips layers away. Rock stars are more comfortable creating an aura and mystique." [...] Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, [...] "They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>let</b> me make the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. I think part of it is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, they sort of let me have a free hand." [...] Bono said that it was the least involved the band had ever been in a U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, [...] "They were over the moon. They loved it." [...] The only request the band made was that the film should be shortened in length, and Guggenheim agreed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had hoped}} not, Susan," [...] said Mr. Harding. Both the archdeacon and Mrs. Grantly {{knew that it}} was useless to argue with him on such a point, <b>and</b> so <b>they</b> <b>let</b> that go.|$|R

2500|$|With Washington {{clinging}} to a 4-3 lead, Max Scherzer came in on short rest to pitch {{the top of the}} fifth inning for the Nationals – his first relief appearance since the 2013 American League Division Series, when he was with the Detroit Tigers – and quickly got two outs; Cubs officials in the stands later told the press that they were preparing for Scherzer to pitch three or four lockdown innings and preserve Washington′s lead late into the game. Then the inning took a bizarre turn and descended into disaster for Washington. Scherzer gave up consecutive singles to Willson Contreras and pinch-hitter Ben Zobrist and a bases-clearing double to Addison Russell that gave the Cubs a 5-4 lead. [...] The Nationals intentionally walked Jason Heyward, and then Scherzer struck out [...] second baseman Javier Báez for what should have been the third out. However, the third strike got past Wieters, and Báez ran to first on the passed ball. Rather than hold the ball at home to prevent the Cubs from scoring, Wieters tried to throw out Báez at first, and his throw went into right field, allowing Russell to score, Heyward to advance to third, and Báez to reach second, and giving Chicago a 6-4 lead. Wieters asked the umpires to declare the ball dead and the play a strikeout on the grounds of offensive interference, claiming Báez's bat had hit him {{in the back of the}} head on the backswing – a contention confirmed by video evidence – but the umpires made a controversial ruling that even if the bat had struck Wieters, it did not interfere with the play and did not merit a ruling that the ball was dead, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>let</b> the play stand. Next, Cubs pinch-hitter Tommy La Stella reached first base on a catcher's interference call against Wieters, loading the bases, and Scherzer followed that by hitting Jon Jay in the foot with a pitch, sending him to first and forcing in Heyward from third to increase Chicago′s lead to 7-4. Kris Bryant returned to the plate as the tenth Cubs batter of the inning, and popped out on Scherzer′s 28th pitch to bring the shocking inning to a close. After the game, Cubs manager Joe Maddon described the inning as [...] "bizarro world," [...] and Scherzer said, [...] "I′m sure I′ve been in some crazy stuff before, but nothing like that." [...] It was the first time in recorded MLB history, a total of some 2.73 million half-innings, that an intentional walk, a passed-ball strikeout, catcher′s interference, and a hit batsman had ever occurred in a single half-inning.|$|E
60|$|This {{was beyond}} the boys, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>let</b> it slip by, words and thoughts, as a mere senile {{wandering}} in the narrative.|$|E

50|$|Four more races were {{in store}} for Hendrick. He had one top-20 finish. That was a 19th at Texas, racing for Rob Rizzo. He had started the year off with the team, but after {{finishes}} of 29th <b>and</b> 24th, <b>they</b> <b>let</b> him go.|$|R
60|$|After {{that she}} {{proceeded}} {{to lay out}} dinner <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>let</b> the subject drop, but Alison, who entered the room just then, wondered why Mrs. Farquhar flashed a searching glance at her.|$|E
60|$|Gerald sighed, {{submitting}} perforce, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>let</b> him out {{to exhale}} as much impatience as he could in a tramp over the hills, while they sat and pitied him from their very hearts.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not long}} after this that a mass of {{wreckage}} drifted past them. There {{was a bit of}} broken spar and some other woodwork, but no human being, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>let</b> the wreckage go.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, and I'm afraid you're {{not likely}} to. The fellow was a {{reporter}} on the paper at the time; but he happened to have looked up the literature of defalcation, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>let</b> him say his say." ...|$|E

60|$|And {{then from}} both sides arose a great din of horns and rattles. In {{the rear of the}} field were several {{automobiles}} <b>and</b> <b>they,</b> too, <b>let</b> off their horns and screech whistles, adding to the noise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{never saw}} anybody like Gertrude in my life. In London, if men were {{attentive}} to her, {{she sat on}} them for being officious; <b>and</b> if <b>they</b> <b>let</b> her alone she was angry at being neglected. Erskine is quite good enough for her, I think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. That's {{where the}} cop hit me. I suppose cops {{get a lot}} of fun out of lecturing murderers, too. He was a big fellow. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't <b>let</b> me help carry Zilla down to the ambulance." ...|$|R

60|$|They looked round, but {{the sea was}} now {{dark and}} empty <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>let</b> the matter drop. When they crossed the Adexe bight no steamer was {{anchored}} near, but a cluster of lights on the dusky beach marked the coaling wharf.|$|E

60|$|Bright {{moonlight}} {{touched the}} river, streaking the angry {{water with a}} silver track, when Scott and Thirlwell poled against the stream in the gloom of the wooded bank. The Shadow, swollen by melted snow, rolled by in flood, swirling along the stony beach in lines of foam, and tossing about battered trunks brought down by winter storms. Farther down stream, a shimmering haze of spray indicated the Grand Rapid, and Thirlwell meant to stem the current until they were far enough from the foaming turmoil to paddle across. The gray trout were shy that evening <b>and</b> <b>they</b> had <b>let</b> the canoe drift farther than they thought. Presently somebody hailed them from the bank, <b>and</b> as <b>they</b> <b>let</b> the canoe swing round in an eddy a dark figure moved out from the gloom of the pines.|$|R
