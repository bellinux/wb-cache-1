50|$|The UAE {{penal code}} {{is not based}} {{strictly}} on Islamic Sharia, but derives elements from it. Sharia law does exist in the UAE but is only used in specific circumstances, {{such as in the}} payment of blood money. Individual emirates have also suspended some Sharia punishments such <b>as</b> <b>flogging,</b> replacing them with jail terms.|$|R
2500|$|In 2003 {{the resolutions}} began again with Canada {{sponsoring}} a resolution criticizing Iran's [...] "confirmed instances of torture, stoning {{as a method}} of execution and punishment such <b>as</b> <b>flogging</b> and amputations," [...] following the death of an Iranian-born Canadian citizen, Zahra Kazemi, in an Iranian prison. The resolution has passed in the UN General Assembly every year since.|$|R
50|$|As of 2014, certain {{provisions}} of the Qatari Criminal Code allows punishments such <b>as</b> <b>flogging</b> and stoning to be imposed as criminal sanctions. The UN Committee Against Torture found that these practices constituted a breach of the obligations imposed by the UN Convention Against Torture. Qatar retains the death penalty, mainly for threats against national security.|$|R

25|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, various laws {{fundamentally}} {{changed the}} course of American merchant shipping. These laws put an end to common practices such <b>as</b> <b>flogging</b> and shanghaiing, and increased shipboard safety and living standards. The United States Merchant Marine is also governed by more than 25 (as of 17 February 2017) international conventions to promote safety and prevent pollution.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} expression with its modern meaning is by Bright, referring to the Reform Bill of 1867, which called for more democratic representation in Parliament, an issue about which Parliament was singularly apathetic. The Oxford English Dictionary cites The Globe, 1872, as the earliest verifiable use of flogging a dead horse, where someone {{is said to have}} [...] "rehearsed that ... lively operation known <b>as</b> <b>flogging</b> a dead horse".|$|R
2500|$|Flogging and stoning {{are legal}} punishments in the UAE. The {{requirement}} {{is derived from}} Sharia law, and has been federal law since 2005. Some domestic workers in the UAE are victims of the country's interpretations of Sharia judicial punishments such <b>as</b> <b>flogging</b> and stoning. The annual Freedom House report on Freedom in the World has listed the United Arab Emirates as [...] "Not Free" [...] every year since 1999, the first year for which records are available on their website.|$|R
50|$|The Innsbruck-Reichenau {{camp was}} located in western Austria and was an {{offshoot}} of the Dachau camp. It was surrounded by an electric fence, there was separation between men and women and the inmates were all forced to work. Unlike the other prisoners, the Jews of Libya were allowed to stay in their civilian clothes. The SS guards were cruel to the Jews- they were banned from any religious expression or worship, and punishment such <b>as</b> <b>flogging,</b> imprisonment and death by shooting were common.|$|R
60|$|But we may press {{this thing}} nearly two centuries further back, {{for it is}} a matter of {{historical}} doubt whether, in Robert Blake's time, Cromwell's great admiral, such a thing <b>as</b> <b>flogging</b> was known at the gangways of his victorious fleets. And as in this matter we cannot go further back than to Blake, so we cannot advance further than to our own time, which shows Commodore Stockton, during the recent war with Mexico, governing the American squadron in the Pacific without employing the scourge.|$|R
25|$|Sharia {{was perhaps}} most famous for {{calling for the}} {{abolition}} of interest-bearing banks, hadd penalties such <b>as</b> <b>flogging</b> and amputation for alcohol consumption, theft, fornication, adultery and other crimes. Hadd penalties have been criticized by Westernized Muslims as cruel and in violation of international human rights but Maududi argued that any cruelty was far outweighed by the cruelty in the West that resulted from the absence of these punishments, {{and in any case}} would not be applied until Muslims fully understood the teachings of their faith and lived in an Islamic state.|$|R
2500|$|March 31, 2005 - Dr. Shahram Azam, the Iranian {{doctor who}} {{examined}} Kazemi {{just prior to}} her death, said he {{was shocked by the}} extent of her injuries, and felt she had been tortured. He reported injuries consistent with torture, such <b>as</b> <b>flogging</b> wounds on the back and missing fingernails. A female nurse told him of [...] "brutal" [...] genital injuries. Azam did not give her a vaginal examination himself as it is considered inappropriate in Iran for a male physician to examine a woman in this manner. Azam fled the country, seeking political asylum in Canada in order to tell his story.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Oxford English Dictionary, {{the first}} {{recorded}} {{use of the}} expression in its modern sense was by the English politician and orator John Bright, referring to the Reform Act of 1867, which called for more democratic representation in Parliament. Trying to rouse Parliament from its apathy on the issue, {{he said in a}} speech, would be like trying to flog a dead horse to make it pull a load. The Oxford English Dictionary cites The Globe, 1872, as the earliest verifiable use of flogging a dead horse, where someone is said to have [...] "rehearsed that [...] [...] lively operation known <b>as</b> <b>flogging</b> a dead horse".|$|R
5000|$|Narrated 'Abdullah bin Zam'a: The Prophet said, [...] "None of {{you should}} <b>flog</b> his wife <b>as</b> he <b>flogs</b> a slave {{and then have}} sexual {{intercourse}} {{with her in the}} last part of the day." [...] see also ...|$|R

50|$|Those labeled infames (singular infamis) were {{liable to}} {{corporal}} punishment, {{usually reserved for}} slaves. Under the Republic and early Empire, {{one of the ways}} in which the citizen's liberty was defined was through the freedom of his body from physical coercion or punishment such <b>as</b> <b>flogging</b> by authorities. Citizens who chose to become public performers, however, and to use their bodies to offer public pleasure, were excluded from these physical protections, and could be beaten or otherwise subjected to violence. Any free man who became a gladiator took an oath to suffer branding, bondage, and beating, as well as potential death by the sword. Both glamorized and despised, the gladiator was supposed to exert a compelling sexual allure over women.|$|R
5000|$|Tull is {{the first}} of only two people [...] - [...] the other being Simon Vance [...] - [...] to have {{recorded}} the entire Aubrey-Maturin series of nautical historical novels by Patrick O'Brian in complete and unabridged form. O’Brian once expressed disapproval of a dramatic rendition of recorded novels ("To revert to my ideal reader: he would avoid obvious emotion, italics and exclamation marks like the plague [...] - [...] trying to put life into flat prose is <b>as</b> useful <b>as</b> <b>flogging</b> a dead horse"). Many of Tull's listeners disagree. His lively dramatization of the characters, especially Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and his comprehensive command of the dialects and tenor of the novels endeared him to many O’Brian fans.|$|R
5000|$|The {{source of}} sharia, {{was to be}} found {{not only in the}} Quran but also in the Sunnah (the doings and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), since the Quran proclaimed [...] "Whoever obeys the {{messenger}} Muhammad obeys Allah."Sharia was perhaps most famous for calling for the abolition of interest-bearing banks, hadd penalties such <b>as</b> <b>flogging</b> and amputation for alcohol consumption, theft, fornication, adultery and other crimes. Hadd penalties have been criticized by Westernized Muslims as cruel and in violation of international human rights but Maududi argued that any cruelty was far outweighed by the cruelty in the West that resulted from the absence of these punishments, and in any case would not be applied until Muslims fully understood the teachings of their faith and lived in an Islamic state.|$|R
50|$|The {{treatment}} of juvenile offenders {{in the colony}} of Victoria reflected the system of criminal law inherited from England. There was nothing unusual in that as the law of Australia at that time were heavily influenced by the social norms of English society. Children criminals were treated no differently than adult criminals, and there was little distinction in the way penalties were imposed. Children were liable to the same harsh penalties as adults, such <b>as</b> <b>flogging,</b> imprisonment and even death. The Judicial Commission of New South Wales cites {{an example of one}} English judge who, after condemning a 10-year-old boy to death, described the boy as “a proper subject for capital punishment”. The commission also noted that on one day in 1815, five children aged between eight and 12 years were hanged for petty larceny in England.|$|R
5000|$|Capital {{punishment}} {{represents the}} most dramatic clash between a ‘UN-sponsored’ human rights concept and Shari'a law. [...] Shari'a establishes the death penalty as mandatory punishment {{for a number of}} Hudud crimes. “Moreover, some execution methods envisaged in the holy texts, such <b>as</b> <b>flogging,</b> stoning and amputation, violate international conventions that prohibit torture and cruel and inhuman treatments.”The Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), aimed at abolishing the death penalty, was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989. Article 1 of the Protocol states that all the Protocol's Parties shall refrain from carrying out executions and shall take all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty within their jurisdiction. None of the countries in the Middle Eastern region have ratified this protocol, although most have signed and ratified the ICCPR.|$|R
5000|$|Historically the flagellants are {{the origin}} of the current traditions, <b>as</b> they <b>flogged</b> {{themselves}} to do penance. Pope Clement VI ordered that flagellants could perform penance only under control of the church therefore he decreed Inter sollicitudines ("inner concerns" [...] for suppression). This {{is considered one of the}} reason why often flaggelants hide their faces.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{the next}} {{generation}} I believe that the world's rulers will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power {{can be just as}} completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude <b>as</b> by <b>flogging</b> and kicking them into obedience.|$|R
50|$|Later, at the market, <b>as</b> Del <b>flogs</b> oranges, Rodney {{shows up}} {{and tells him}} all about the meeting as well as Margaret Mackenzie, one of the {{well-known}} higher-ups of the Tenants Association. Grandad also shows up, even though his legs are hurting. Rodney offers Grandad a lift home, but he plans to walk off the pain.|$|R
50|$|The {{band has}} toured tirelessly {{throughout}} Europe and America. They have made numerous appearances at international festivals and have toured with such diverse bands <b>as</b> Primus, <b>Flogging</b> Molly, and Cake. In {{an interview with}} NPR, frontman Eugene Hütz cites Jimi Hendrix and Parliament-Funkadelic as among the band's main musical influences. They have also mentioned Manu Chao, Fugazi, Zvuki Mu, Karamelo Santo, Sasha Kolpakov and The Clash as influences.|$|R
5000|$|The name of Ian Dury's first band, Kilburn and the High Roads, {{refers to}} this road, <b>as</b> does the <b>Flogging</b> Molly song, [...] "Kilburn High Road" [...] and the Shack song, [...] "Kilburn High Road".|$|R
25|$|The courts {{continue}} to impose sentences of <b>flogging</b> <b>as</b> a principal or additional punishment for many offences. At least five defendants {{were sentenced to}} flogging of 1,000 to 2,500 lashes. Flogging {{was carried out in}} prisons.|$|R
5000|$|It was an official, though rare, {{punishment}} in the Dutch navy, {{as shown in}} the painting (above, right), [...] "The keel-hauling of the ship's surgeon of Admiral Jan van Nes." [...] This shows a large crowd gathered to watch the event, as though it was a [...] "show" [...] {{punishment in}}tended to frighten other potential offenders, <b>as</b> was <b>flogging</b> round the fleet. A contemporary description suggests it was not intended to be fatal.|$|R
50|$|Discipline {{followed}} {{the customs of}} the Royal Navy but punishment was much milder than typical in European navies. Sodomy was rarely prosecuted. The Army abolished <b>flogging</b> <b>as</b> a punishment in 1812, but the Navy kept it until 1850.|$|R
50|$|In Sparta, {{young men}} were <b>flogged</b> <b>as</b> a test of their masculinity. Jewish law limited {{flagellation}} to forty strokes, and in practice delivered thirty-nine, {{so as to avoid}} any possibility of breaking this law due to a miscount.|$|R
