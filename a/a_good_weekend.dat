50|$|In December 1970, {{things were}} {{beginning}} to take shape. Upon incorporation, the decision {{had to be made}} whether DCI would be for-profit or nonprofit. Dr. Johnson and his team unanimously decided on the non-profit status and also determined that any excess revenues generated would be used for research and education in the field of kidney disease or in other ways that would benefit people with kidney disease. Just five months later, in April 1971, Dialysis Clinic, Incorporated, was established, a location was secured for the first clinic, negotiations were held with the hospital to move the patients over to the new facility, and patients began dialyzing. The first DCI clinic was housed in a 1,000 square foot, refurbished home on 21st Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1971, with DCI’s first clinic already operating, there was no Medicare funding and most patients still did not have insurance {{to cover the cost of}} treatment. Dr. Johnson and his staff asked Kentucky Fried Chicken for KFC buckets to collect donations. Then the staff placed pictures of patients on their red and white buckets. On Saturday and Sunday afternoons, the staff made their way to the busiest intersections in Nashville. On <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>weekend,</b> they could raise $10,000 to help pay for treatments, but it would only last for so long and then they would be out conducting road blocks again. In 1973, the Medicare ESRD Program began, and thousands of dialysis patients across the U.S. were able to receive treatment that was and still is paid for by that program.|$|E

After topping the first qualifying session, Ericsson continued his form into second practice, recording the fastest lap in the history of the Macau Guia Circuit. His lap of 2:10.042 put him on pole position, despite hitting the barriers at Matsuya close to the end of qualifying, and damaging his rear wing. After setting the ninth-fastest time during the Thursday qualifying session, Vernay joined Ericsson on the front row after setting a time fractionally slower than his Swedish rival. Bottas lined up third, also moving up seven places from his Thursday position, and was joined on row two by Mortara. Ricciardo wound up in fifth position, after making an error at Lisboa which resulted in his front wing making slight contact with the barriers, and was the only other driver within a second of Ericsson's pace. The two remaining ART Grand Prix cars adorned row four with Bianchi edging out Bird, while the top ten was completed by Coletti and Mäki. Iguchi again finished up as the top Japanese runner in eleventh position, ahead of Hartley, who did not improve on his Thursday time and thus tumbled from row two to row six, as he recorded the thirteenth fastest time in the session. Merhi's twelfth-fastest time put him thirteenth in the classification, ahead of Sims, van der Zande, Kunimoto, Chilton and Boyd. Huertas held onto nineteenth overall, despite only being 26th in the session after suffering from engine gremlins that restricted him to just one flying lap.

50|$|In 2014 Reynolds {{was again}} the pilot for the #55 Rod Nash Racing Bottle-O Falcon, {{with the car}} taking on a {{different}} look after acquiring Jim Beam Devil's Cut as the secondary sponsor replacing Canadian Club. Reynolds season again started with mix results, following a trend of poor results in the short, two race 'sprint' races but top ten results in the longer races that gave more points. This took {{a turn for the}} better after Symmons Plains where he claimed 17 top 15 results from 18 races, with an unfortunate tyre delamination in the last race in New Zealand when he was running in third place being the only omission. However, from the last race at Queensland Raceway where he qualified and finished in last place until the first race at Surfers Paradise Dean Canto and himself endured a run of terrible luck. In the first race at a drying Sydney Motorsport Park he was turned around by James Moffat at turn three and was then hit heavily by Tim Slade. The team were able to get the car out for the second race that day, but Reynolds, not known for his wet-weather driving, struggled in the treacherous conditions only managing 13th from starting 8th. In the last race where the track was dry, Reynolds was again spun around again by teammate Winterbottom {{for the second time in}} two seasons, at the same corner as he had been 2 races earlier. He collected Scott Pye on his way to heavy back end contact with the concrete wall, with both Fords out of the race and Winterbottom being given a drive-through penalty for his efforts, with the #5 eventually finishing 20th. For the Sandown 500 the Bottle-O team again tried an alternate strategy as Reynolds could only manage an 8th place qualifying position. The team would start Reynolds in the car while nearly all the other teams would start their co-drivers. This paid off as Reynolds made his way up to third position in his stint, then giving the car to Canto who maintained position. A perfectly timed safety car for their strategy looked to be putting the team on for their first podium of the season, but when getting in the car in the second driver change Reynolds tapped the accelerator, spinning the wheels of the car while it was on the air jacks. This is illegal in the V8 Supercars Championship for safety reasons, and they were given a drive through penalty, but recovered to finish 9th. The Bathurst 1000 looked to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>weekend</b> for the #55, as the car was in the top three in all the free practice sessions, breaking the lap record in the final Thursday practice with a 2:06.3714, over half a second quicker than Craig Lowndes' lap four years earlier. However, qualifying was a different story. Early in the session on his first flying lap Reynolds had to go slightly wide at Reid Park because of a trundling Todd Kelly. This unsettled the car enough and put it on the dirty part of the track, causing it to smash into the outside wall at over 200kph. Reynolds later stated 'I knew the car was stuffed when I saw one of the wheels roll past me'. An exclusion from the session for fellow Ford driver and eventual Bathurst winner Chaz Mostert and the #2 HRT car not taking part in the race ensued that Reynolds started the race from 24th position. Again the Bottle-O team ran an alternate strategy, pitting at different times to the cars around them. This, consistent safety cars and raw car speed left them well inside the top ten by the middle of the race, and at the red flag period on lap 61 were sitting in second position. The car continued on to lap 102, where under safety car period and running second in the race alternator problems forced them to retire. This was heartbreak for the team after a tumultuous weekend, with Dean Canto visibly upset and being comforted by the team after seeing the car stopped on Mountain Straight on the television coverage. The issues were found to not be from the crash in qualifying, but rather in the red flag period, where for over an hour the alternator was keeping the dry ice bucket used for the driver's cool suit cold while the engine was off. Hopes of rebounding at the last endurance event in Surfers Paradise were dashed when while running in the top five cars Reynolds clipped a tyre bundle in the back chicane. He drove on for a couple corners before a right front suspension component gave way and put the #55 in the fence at turn 6. Yet another retirement left Reynolds squandering in the points standings, but the car was repaired in time for the race the next day where he and Canto finished a respectable 6th. The end of the season was consistent for Reynolds, a nice change for the team. However, a decent result went begging at the final race at Phillip Island, where an unsafe release out of his pit bay resulted in contact with Jason Bright. Reynolds would have been well inside the top ten had it not have been for this, but instead finished the race 22nd. At the final round in Sydney Reynolds showed good qualifying speed, benefiting from a red flag in the qualifying session he started from third and maintained that position to achieve his first podium of the season. However, consistent heavy storms in the late afternoon of each day dropped him down the order of the following races and these races were soon red-flagged because of the treacherous conditions. Reynolds eventually finished the season a disappointing 15th after showing early promise and being a high of 8th in the championship standings. Bad luck and unfortunate accidents in high point scoring races were the downfall of his championship position in 2014.|$|E
40|$|In October 1995, {{the last}} run {{foreseen}} for dedicated Z production at CERN {{was performed in}} LEP, thereby bringing to a close {{the first phase of}} operation of the machine. A total luminosity of 200 pb- 1 has been delivered to each of the four experiments, which together have recorded the decays of over 20 millions Zs. Machine performance has increased to the extent that <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>weekend</b> in 1995 saw as much luminosity delivered as in the whole of 1989. This improvement has been made possible by a combination of several things. Over and above general operational expertise, special care went into the treatment and stabilisation of the closed orbit in order to obtain reproducible high performances with vertical beam-beam tune shifts exceeding values of xy = 0. 04. Both Pretzel and Bunch Train schemes have been introduced to double the number of bunches, and high-tune optics have been developed to produce low transverse emittances which allow operation at the beam-beam limit throughout physics runs. Included in the integrated luminosity are data taken off the peak of the Z resonance, to allow precise determination of the mass and width of this particle. Accurate measurements of the beam energy during these runs have brought to the fore some unusual effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of tasks to a heterogeneous work force at libraries and other service institutions is a time consuming task for manual schedulers. In this thesis, we study the possibility of making the assignment using operations research techniques. The problem studied concerns seven days per week, five types of tasks, two types of staff qualifications and around 100 tasks per week to be assigned to the staff. Staff member satisfaction is also {{taken into account in}} the scheduling process. The main objective is to create an optimal ten week rotating schedule, in which the stand-in staff members are evenly distributed. Such a schedule is considered to be robust, since stand-in staff can replace the regular staff when there is unforseen absence. A mathematical model is formulated for the problem and is solved using the commercial solver CPLEX. We also present two different large neighbourhood search heuristic implementations for this problem. The first heuristic assigns complete week blocks to the staff members, while the second one distributes one task at a time. The latter heuristic works better than the former and achieves results comparable to those of the commercial solver. Our conclusion is that the second heuristic works better because it focuses on finding <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>weekend</b> distribution before creating the rest of the schedule.
