25|$|Much of the {{confusion}} concerning modularity exists in neuroscience because there is evidence for specific areas (e.g. V4 or V5/hMT+) and the concomitant behavioral deficits following brain insult (thus taken as evidence for modularity). In addition, evidence shows other areas are involved and that these areas subserve processing of multiple properties (e.g. V1) (thus taken as evidence against modularity). That these streams have the same implementation in early visual areas, like V1, is not inconsistent with a modular viewpoint: to adopt the canonical analogy in cognition, {{it is possible for}} different software to run on the same hardware. A consideration of psychophysics and neuropsychological data would suggest support for this. For example, psychophysics has shown that percepts for different properties are realized asynchronously. In addition, although achromats experience other cognitive defects they do not have motion deficits when their lesion is restricted to V4, or total loss of form perception. Relatedly, Zihl and colleagues' <b>akinetopsia</b> patient shows no deficit to color or object perception (although deriving depth and structure from motion is problematic, see above) and object agnostics do not have damaged motion or color perception, making the three disorders triply dissociable. Taken together this evidence suggests that even though distinct properties may employ the same early visual areas they are functionally independent. Furthermore, that the intensity of subjective perceptual experience (e.g. color) correlates with activity in these specific areas (e.g. V4), the recent evidence that synaesthetes show V4 activation during the perceptual experience of color, as well as the fact that damage to these areas results in concomitant behavioral deficits (the processing may be occurring but perceivers {{do not have access to}} the information) are all evidence for visual modularity.|$|E

50|$|Inconspicuous <b>akinetopsia</b> {{is often}} {{described}} by seeing motion as a cinema reel or a multiple exposure photograph. This {{is the most common}} kind of <b>akinetopsia</b> and many patients consider the stroboscopic vision as a nuisance. The <b>akinetopsia</b> often occurs with visual trailing (palinopsia), with afterimages being left at each frame of the motion. It is caused by prescription drugs, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD), and persistent aura without infarction. The pathophysiology of <b>akinetopsia</b> palinopsia is not known, but it has been hypothesized to be due to inappropriate activation of physiological motion suppression mechanisms which are normally used to maintain visual stability during eye movements (e.g. saccadic suppression).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Akinetopsia</b> (Greek: a for [...] "without", kine for [...] "to move" [...] and opsia for [...] "seeing"), {{also known}} as {{cerebral}} <b>akinetopsia</b> or motion blindness, is a neuropsychological disorder in which a patient cannot perceive motion in their visual field, despite {{being able to see}} stationary objects without issue. There are varying degrees of akinetopsia: from seeing motion as a cinema reel to an inability to discriminate any motion. There is currently no effective treatment or cure for <b>akinetopsia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Akinetopsia</b> {{may be an}} {{acquired}} deficit from lesions in the posterior side of the visual cortex. Lesions more often cause gross <b>akinetopsia.</b> The neurons of the middle temporal cortex respond to moving stimuli and hence the middle temporal cortex is the motion-processing area of the cerebral cortex. In the case of LM, the brain lesion was bilateral and symmetrical, {{and at the same}} time small enough not to affect other visual functions. Some unilateral lesions have been reported to impair motion perception as well. <b>Akinetopsia</b> through lesions is rare, because damage to the occipital lobe usually disturbs more than one visual function. <b>Akinetopsia</b> has also been reported as a result of traumatic brain injury.|$|E
50|$|Inconspicuous <b>akinetopsia</b> can be {{selectively}} and temporarily induced using {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) of area V5 of {{the visual}} cortex in healthy subjects. It is performed on a 1 cm² surface of the head, corresponding in position to area V5. With an 800-microsecond TMS pulse and a 28 ms stimulus at 11 degrees per second, V5 is incapacitated for about 20-30 ms. It is effective between −20 ms and +10 ms before and after onset of a moving visual stimulus. Inactivating V1 with TMS could induce some degree of <b>akinetopsia</b> 60-70 ms after {{the onset of the}} visual stimulus. TMS of V1 is not nearly as effective in inducing <b>akinetopsia</b> as TMS of V5.|$|E

50|$|Types {{of visual}} illusions include oscillopsia, halos around objects, illusory palinopsia (visual trailing, light streaking, {{prolonged}} indistinct afterimages), <b>akinetopsia,</b> visual snow, micropsia, macropsia, teleopsia, pelopsia, Alice in Wonderland syndrome, metamorphopsia, dyschromatopsia, intense glare, blue field entoptic phenomenon, and purkinje trees.|$|E
50|$|A {{change in}} brain {{structure}} (typically lesions) disturbs the psychological process of understanding sensory information, {{in this case}} visual information. Disturbance of only visual motion is possible due to the anatomical separation of visual motion processing from other functions. Like <b>akinetopsia,</b> perception of color can also be selectively disturbed as in achromatopsia. There is an inability to see motion despite normal spatial acuity, flicker detection, stereo and color vision. Other intact functions include visual space perception and visual identification of shapes, objects, and faces. Besides simple perception, <b>akinetopsia</b> also disturbs visuomotor tasks, such as reaching for objects and catching objects. When doing tasks, feedback of one's own motion appears to be important.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inability}} to perceive motion is called <b>akinetopsia</b> {{and it may}} be caused by a lesion to cortical area V5 in the extrastriate cortex.

50|$|V5, {{also known}} as visual area MT (middle temporal), is located {{laterally}} and ventrally in the temporal lobe, near {{the intersection of the}} ascending limb of the inferior temporal sulcus and the lateral occipital sulcus. All of the neurons in V5 are motion selective, and most are directionally selective. Evidence of functional specialization of V5 was first found in primates. Patients with <b>akinetopsia</b> tend to have unilateral or bi-lateral damage to the V5.|$|E
50|$|Visual {{trailing}} {{describes an}} object in motion leaving frozen copies in its wake. These motion-induced afterimages may be discontinuous such as in a film reel or may be blurred together such as in a long-exposure photograph. If discontinuous, the patient also usually reports <b>akinetopsia.</b> The perseverated images last a few seconds and are usually identical in color and shape to the original stimulus.

5000|$|Jackson himself went on {{to reject}} epiphenomenalism, and dualism altogether. He argues that, because when Mary first sees red, she says [...] "wow", it must be Mary's qualia that causes her to say [...] "wow". This contradicts epiphenomenalism because it {{involves}} a conscious state causing an overt speech behavior. Since the Mary's room thought experiment seems to create this contradiction, {{there must be something}} wrong with it. Jackson now believes that the physicalist approach (from a perspective of indirect realism) provides the better explanation. In contrast to epiphenominalism, Jackson says that the experience of red is entirely contained in the brain, and the experience immediately causes further changes in the brain (e.g. creating memories). This is more consilient with neuroscience's understanding of color vision. Jackson suggests that Mary is simply discovering a new way for her brain to represent qualities that exist in the world. In a similar argument, philosopher Philip Pettit likens the case of Mary to patients suffering from <b>akinetopsia,</b> the inability to perceive the motion of objects. If someone were raised in a stroboscopic room and subsequently 'cured' of the <b>akinetopsia,</b> they would not be surprised to discover any new facts about the world (they do, in fact, know that objects move). Instead, their surprise would come from their brain now allowing them to see this motion.|$|E

He had difficulty watching television with significant action or movement, such as sporting events or action-filled TV shows. He frequently commented to his wife that he could not [...] "see anything going on". When objects began to move they would disappear.

5000|$|Gross <b>akinetopsia</b> is an {{extremely}} rare condition. Patients have profound motion blindness and struggle in performing the activities of daily living. Instead of seeing vision as a cinema reel, these patients have trouble perceiving gross motion. Most {{of what is known}} about this extremely rare condition was learned through the case study of one patient, LM. LM described pouring a cup of tea or coffee difficult [...] "because the fluid appeared to be frozen, like a glacier". She did not know when to stop pouring, because she could not perceive the movement of the fluid rising. LM and other patients have also complained of having trouble following conversations, because lip movements and changing facial expressions were missed. LM stated she felt insecure when more than two people were walking around in a room: [...] "people were suddenly here or there but I have not seen them moving". Movement is inferred by comparing the change in position of an object or person. LM and others have described crossing the street and driving cars to also be of great difficulty. LM started to train her hearing to estimate distance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAkinetopsia {{is a rare}} {{syndrome}} {{in which}} a patient specifically loses the ability to perceive visual motion following bilateral cortical lesions outside the striate cortex. We describe a patient who showed <b>akinetopsia</b> recurrently as epileptic seizures. The patient was a 61 -year-old man. At age 46, a cerebral arteriovenous malformation in the right parietal lobe was discovered. At age 58, he began to have a recurrent visual symptom by which smooth movements of objects suddenly appeared, resembling freeze frames in a motion picture. This symptom was paroxysmal and recurrent. Both EEG and magnetoencephalography showed repetitive right temporal spikes. We diagnosed his visual symptom as <b>akinetopsia,</b> which was aroused by hyperexcitability of the right temporal and parietal cortices, including area MT/V 5. We administered carbamazepine 200 mg/day, which suppressed his akinetopsic symptom completely...|$|E
40|$|The dorsal visual stream, often {{referred}} to as the ‘where’ stream, represents the pathway taken by visual information from the primary visual cortex to the posterior parietal lobe and onwards. It partners the ventral or ‘what’ stream, the subject of a previous review and largely a temporalbased system. Here, we consider the dorsal stream disorders of perception (simultanagnosia, <b>akinetopsia)</b> along with their consequences on action (eg, optic ataxia and oculomotor apraxia, along with Balint’s syndrome). The role of the dorsal stream in blindsight and hemispatial neglect is also considered...|$|E
40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 21 Jun 2012 This paper offers an inconsistent model of motion perception. It {{was prompted by}} work on inconsistent motion due to Hegel and, following him, Priest. But the paper skirts Hegel's full scale idealism, by proposing that the inconsistency is with the cognitive contents of motion perception. The paper draws on work in the psychology of perception, and {{in the theory of}} inconsistency. I begin by noting the prima facie argument that temporal change threatens inconsistency, and canvassing ways in which this might be avoided. The orthodox reply to the prima facie argument is that one and the same thing can have different incompatible properties at different times. This is plausible when applied to motion in the physical world. However, applied to cognition, {{it can be seen that}} the phenomenon of phi or beta, combined with the mechanism of a Reichardt detector, lends support to one key step in the prima facie argument, namely re-identification over time. The inconsistency of the model is then seen to follow from application of the Fade Principle. Advantages of the model are stressed: including a simple explanation of the debilitating condition of <b>akinetopsia,</b> that is, motion blindness; and a suggestion as to how to account for the “moving now. ”Chris Mortense...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} probe the {{functional}} specializations present within several retinotopic divisions of human lateral occipital cortex (LO). The divisions of interest were LO 1 and LO 2, two neighbouring visual field maps that are found within object-selective LO; the posterior portion of a larger area {{referred to as the}} lateral occipital complex (LOC), and V 5 /MT, the well-known visual complex that is highly selective to visual motion. In order to seek out the causal roles played by these divisions in human visual perception, I used transcranial magnetic stimulation to temporarily disrupt neural processing within these areas, while observers performed visual tasks. The visual tasks I employed examined both spatial vision, through orientation and shape discriminations, and motion processing, through speed discrimination. The data revealed a number of double dissociations. A double dissociation was present between LO 1 and V 5 /MT in the perceptions of orientation and speed. A similar pattern of results was present during orientation and speed discrimination of the same moving stimuli, although this effect was markedly weaker. Additionally, a double dissociation was present between LO 1 and LO 2 in the perceptions of static orientation and shape, respectively. These double dissociations suggest that LO 1, LO 2 and V 5 /MT exhibit functional specializations for orientation, shape and speed, respectively and moreover, perform these specialized roles largely independently of one another. It is unsurprising that I found evidence for parallel processing of motion and aspects of spatial processing because: (1) V 5 /MT {{has been shown to be}} a cluster of multiple visual field maps with a common foveal representation – a feature that has led to the idea that the maps within clusters perform related aspects of processing, but are independent of the processing undertaken in adjacent visual field map clusters like LO; (2) neuropsychological evidence, from studies of <b>akinetopsia</b> and visual form agnosia, points to a double dissociation in processing of motion and form and (3) there is evidence of parallel processing pathways from early visual areas and even subcortical structures to V 5 /MT. The parallel processing of orientation and shape in LO 1 and LO 2 is a novel and more surprising finding for the following reasons: (1) These visual field maps are adjacent maps within a single cluster and therefore, might be expected to perform a series of related and dependent roles and (2) shape, as defined here by curvature, could be seen as a property that is dependent on orientation processing. These findings therefore, point to an architecture whereby the extrastriate visual maps in LO sample visual information from antecedent visual areas in parallel, to extract higher order spatial statistics. Mutual retinotopic information and parallel processing not only reduces replicated information across maps but also, provides a common mechanism for communication between maps which exhibit different specializations. Importantly, the well-known category-selectivity of extrastriate regions, like LO, may simply emerge from patterns of unique and low-level visual computations, which encode category specific image statistics, performed by the individual visual field maps that subdivide these areas...|$|E
40|$|What we {{consciously}} see in {{our everyday}} {{life is not}} an exact copy {{of the information that}} our eyes receive from the external world. Our brain actively elaborates and transforms the light that impinges onto the two dimensional surface of our retinas to create complex three dimensional scenes full of colorful objects of different shapes and sizes, motion and depth. Our visual perception is not a passive reception of information: our brain actively decodes and separates the retinal information into relevant and significant objects and compares this information with previous memories. One remarkable example is the ability of the visual system to decode the information that arrives from the eyes into recognizable visual objects and scenes. We are able to recognize objects even under conditions of low illumination or low contrast, when these objects are partially occluded, presented among other objects or when they are defined by textures, for example. In addition to this process of recognition, the visual system generates the conscious sensations of those objects and scenes. Even though we need our eyes to see the world these are not enough by themselves to generate visual perception. The light impinging on our retinas needs further elaboration in higher areas of the brain to generate perception. Several situations in which vision is separated from perception can demonstrate this. For example, we can imagine some object with our eyes closed in our “mind’s eye” or we can generate images in our dreams that are completely independent of external stimulation. Experimentally, it is possible to manipulate visual perception while keeping visual stimulation to the eyes constant. Examples of this are the changes in perception that occur with multi-stable phenomena (i. e, as with the Necker cube) or when subjects are presented with dissimilar images to each eye, a condition called binocular rivalry. Without a functioning visual brain we are not able to properly see. Lesions to the visual cortex produce a wide variety of visual deficits ranging from blindness to achromatopsia (the impossibility of perceiving color), <b>akinetopsia</b> (the impossibility of perceiving motion) and/or visual agnosias (the difficulty in recognizing objects through vision). Also, extensive neuroimaging experiments have shown that visual information causes the activation of wide areas of the brain and the role of many of these areas has been studied in the last two decades. However, currently the neuroscientific study of perception can only be addressed with limited resources. We cannot measure the activity of the 10 billion neurons that constitute our brain. Neither can scientists manipulate the human brain by disrupting, modifying or altering the activity of neuronal circuits. The current imaging methods for studying the brain can only provide incomplete information at different spatial levels of analysis and with different temporal resolutions. Thus, the conclusions that neuroscientists we can extract from these data are only partial attempts to reach {{to a better understanding of}} the functioning of the brain. Despite these limitations, few neuroscientists would disagree today with the fact that visual perception has a basis on distributed neuronal circuits in the brain. In the same line of thought, it is agreed that there must be circuits of neurons that code for the conscious perception of those objects. Consciousness has always been considered as one of the major mysteries of life. The study of the origins of sensations and “feelings” from the operations of our brain is for many scientists one of the final challenges for the biological sciences (Koch, 2003). The mystery of consciousness is considered to be at the same level of the mystery of the creation of the universe and the mystery of the origin of life out of inanimate matter. The topic of this thesis is the study of visual consciousness. Considering its complexity, we do not intend to provide a final answer to the explanation of consciousness. Instead, this thesis will focus on the study of vision and it will describe some properties of conscious vision as opposed to unconscious vision. We will explore the fate of unseen vision: the information that reaches the retina but that does not generate any conscious sensation. We will analyze the processing and limits of unseen visual stimuli and we will compare them with conscious processing of the same objects. In doing this we expect to shed light into some of the properties of conscious and unconscious visual perception and on the role that visual awareness might have had in evolution...|$|E
