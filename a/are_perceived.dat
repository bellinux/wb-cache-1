5|$|Female taiko {{performance}} has {{also served as}} a response to gendered stereotypes of Japanese women as being quiet, subservient, or a femme fatale.

50|$|Theories on emotion {{have focused}} on perception, {{subjective}} experience, and appraisal. Predominant theories of emotion and emotion perception include what type of emotion <b>is</b> <b>perceived,</b> how emotion <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> somatically, and at what stage of an event emotion <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> and translated into subjective, physical experience.|$|R
50|$|This {{suggests}} that for sound to <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> at 7-8 Hz, the 7-8 Hz SPL {{would have to}} be 12.3 dB higher than the 92.0 dB SPL required at 15.5 Hz, which means that the 7-8 Hz SPL would require at least 104 dB of SPL to <b>be</b> <b>perceived.</b> For 3 Hz to <b>be</b> <b>perceived,</b> the SPL would need to add another 12.3 dB, or reach 116 dB of SPL, to <b>be</b> <b>perceived.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{literature}} {{has noted that}} [...] "inositol" [...] <b>is</b> sometimes <b>perceived</b> as sweet and/or salty. In general, the inositols will <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as sweet due to their equat-trans-hydroxyl pairs. The muco-inositol isomer <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> as both sweet and salty. It <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> as salty due to its pair of diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pairs. This pair of hydroxyl groups can form a dimer with the diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pair of the hydrated sodium-ion receptor.|$|R
5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E
5|$|Asda's latest {{attempt to}} draw {{attention}} to themselves involves trying to leap on the Harry Potter bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and {{have nothing to do with}} Bloomsbury Publishing or Harry Potter and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E

50|$|The idea of {{substance}} was famously critiqued by David Hume, who held that since substance cannot <b>be</b> <b>perceived,</b> {{it should not}} be assumed to exist.

5|$|In {{many of the}} works, {{including}} the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures with a flat yellow disk. In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat. The works with torn labels <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as metaphors {{of life in the}} sense that even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{facets of}} Minnesota culture that <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as the area's early history in fact {{originated}} after this period. Notably, the heavy Scandinavian immigration {{for which the}} state is known, and the pioneering days chronicled by author Laura Ingalls Wilder occurred after statehood in the later 19th century. Unlike these later years, {{the first half of}} the 19th century was characterized by sparsely populated communities, harsh living conditions, and to some degree, lawlessness.|$|E
5|$|Since forces <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as pushes or pulls, {{this can}} provide an {{intuitive}} understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions {{that are consistent with}} direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{have often}} used the {{opposition}} between Rome and Egypt in Antony and Cleopatra to set forth defining {{characteristics of the}} various characters. While some characters are distinctly Egyptian, others are distinctly Roman, some are torn between the two, and still others attempt to remain neutral. Critic James Hirsh has stated that, [...] "as a result, the play dramatises not two but four main figurative locales: Rome as it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> from a Roman point of view; Rome as it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> from an Egyptian point of view; Egypt as it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> form a Roman point of view; and Egypt as it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> from an Egyptian point of view." ...|$|R

5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictures}} {{are not in}} strictly chronological order. If they <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as three groups, then the pictures {{in each of the}} three units inform upon each other, in the same way as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The three sections of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read from the entrance of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when looking toward the altar. This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace. However, the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{assessing}} {{the impacts of}} information communication technologies (ICTs) on tourism businesses, this study adopted a case study blueprint, with a questionnaire survey being used to collect data from selected tourism businesses. The respondents rated ICT impacts on tourism on a 5 - point Likert scale, with ratings ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to “strongly agree” (5). The {{results show that the}} impacts on hotels <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as ranging from 4. 07 (improved company image) to 4. 92 (increased market share), whereas the impacts on bed and breakfast establishments <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as ranging from 3. 88 (improved company image) to 4. 86 (speeded up service). The impacts on travel agents <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as ranging from 4. 48 (improved service quality) to 4. 94 (improved service quality), whereas the impacts on tour guides <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as ranging from 4. 58 (improved company image) to 4. 81 (heightened customer satisfaction levels). The impacts on backpackers <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as ranging from 3. 78 (improved company image) to 4. 75 (increased market share). Since ICT <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> to impact relatively little on company image improvement, tourism businesses should use such technology to improve company image.
