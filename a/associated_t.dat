40|$|Features {{that might}} {{distinguish}} uncomplicated coeliac disease from enteropathy <b>associated</b> <b>T</b> cell lymphoma were investigated. Of 76 patients with coeliac disease, 71 (93 %) had raised levels of alpha gliadin antibody and all responded clinically and histologically to treatment with a gluten free diet. In contrast, none of 16 patients with enteropathy <b>associated</b> <b>T</b> cell lymphoma had raised levels of alpha gliadin antibody, and treatment with a gluten free diet resulted in histological improvement in one and transient clinical improvement in six patients. The ratio {{of women to}} men was 2. 2 : 1 in the group with coeliac disease and 1 : 1. 6 in the patients with enteropathy <b>associated</b> <b>T</b> cell lymphoma. Thus patients with enteropathy <b>associated</b> <b>T</b> cell lymphoma do not display a humoral immune response to wheat protein (alpha gliadin), rarely respond to a gluten free diet, and are often men. Patients with uncomplicated coeliac disease usually have raised levels of alpha gliadin antibody, always respond to a gluten free diet, and are frequently women. These findings suggest the presence of two separate forms of enteropathy: one is benign and sensitive to wheat protein whereas the other runs a malignant course...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} {{the occurrence of}} abnormal patterns of HLA-ABC and HLA-DR expression in enteropathy <b>associated</b> <b>T</b> cell lymphoma and to relate such abnormalities to the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) status of the tumours. METHODS: Eleven enteropathy <b>associated</b> <b>T</b> cell lymphomas were immunostained with HC 10 (HLA-ABC heavy chain) and TAL 1 B 5 (HLA-DR alpha chain) monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal anti-beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2 m, the HLA-ABC light chain) antibodies. In situ hybridisation for EBV using EBER probes was performed on all cases. RESULTS: Tumour cells of two of 11 patients were EBER positive. One of these showed partial, and the other, complete loss of beta 2 m. HLA-DR expression was undetectable in both patients. Of the remaining nine EBER negative tumours, two were HLA-ABC heavy chain negative or showed only occasional positive cells and five of nine showed partial or complete loss of the HLA-ABC light chain, beta 2 m. Seven of the nine cases were either negative for HLA-DR or showed weak expression in a proportion of tumour cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that low or absent HLA-ABC and HLA-DR antigen expression occurs commonly in enteropathy <b>associated</b> <b>T</b> cell lymphoma. These abnormal patterns of HLA expression {{may be associated with}} escape from immune attack which, in a minority of patients, could be directed against EBV antigens...|$|E

40|$|The {{repertoire}} of gut <b>associated</b> <b>T</b> cells {{is shaped by}} exposure to microbes, including the natural enteric microflora. Previous studies compared the {{repertoire of}} gut <b>associated</b> <b>T</b> cell populations in germ free (GF) and conventional mammals often focussing on intra-epithelial lymphocyte compartments. Using GF, conventional and monocolonised (gnotobiotic) chickens and chicken TCRbeta-repertoire analysis techniques, we determined the influence of microbial status on global and regional enteric TCRbeta repertoires. The gut of conventionally reared chickens exhibited non-Gaussian distributions of CDR 3 -lengths with some shared over-represented peaks in neighbouring gut segments. Sequence analysis revealed local clonal over-representation. Germ-free chickens exhibited a polyclonal, non-selected population of T cells in the spleen and in the gut. In contrast, gnotobiotic chickens exhibited a biased repertoire with shared clones evident throughout the gut. These data indicate the dramatic influence of enteric microflora complexity on the profile of TCRbeta repertoire in the gut at local and global levels...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project was to measure the degree of relationship between reading achievement scores obtained from the Science Research <b>Associates</b> Achievement <b>Test</b> and the Houghton-Mifflin Placement Test. A second purpose {{of the project was}} to explore the possibility of predicting Houghton Mifflin Placement Levels from reading scores of the Science Research <b>Associates</b> Achievement <b>Test.</b> This study was requested by an elementary school principal in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In this principal's school, the Houghton-Mifflin Placement Test was used to determine where students should be placed in the Houghton-Mifflin Basal Reading Series. The Science Research <b>Associates</b> Achievement <b>Test</b> was also administered in this school. The school principal wished to know if the Science Research <b>Associates</b> Achievement <b>Test</b> could determine where students should be placed in the Houghton-Mifflin Basal Reading Series, thus eliminating the need for administering the Houghton-Mifflin Placement Test. This research project was concerned with determining the degree of accuracy with which the composite reading scores of the Science Research <b>Associates</b> Achievement <b>Test</b> could predict the reading levels of the Houghton-Mifflin Placement Test for the children in this school. The ability to predict reading levels of the Houghton-Mifflin Placement Test could eliminate some replication of testing.
