The Democratic Party lost two seats, one to the National Mandate Party <b>and</b> <b>Prosperous</b> Peace Party each. The Pioneers' Party gained one seat from the United Democratic Nationhood Party. Meanwhile, the only seat allocated to the Freedom Bull National Party by the General Election Commission was reassigned to the Reform Star Party.|$|E

5|$|According to the Scottish {{physician}} Francis Buchanan {{who visited}} Mangalore in 1801, Mangalore {{was a rich}} <b>and</b> <b>prosperous</b> port with flourishing trading activity. Rice was the grand article of export, and was exported to Muscat, Bombay, Goa and Malabar. Supari or Betel-nut was exported to Bombay, Surat and Kutch. Pepper and Sandalwood were exported to Bombay. Turmeric was exported to Muscat, Kutch, Surat and Bombay, along with Cassia Cinnamon, Sugar, Iron, Saltpeter, Ginger, Coir and Timber.|$|E
5|$|Before the Eighty Years' War began, people {{realized}} that the West Indies trade might bring great prosperity {{to the country and}} that more power might be developed against Spain. Rather than travel to the area singly on an armed ship or {{in the company of a}} few other vessels, traders could do business in the manner of the large <b>and</b> <b>prosperous</b> East India Company. A company for carrying on commerce in the West Indies and Africa could be organized, which might, like the sister company, act as the war-waging power in those parts and be supported by the treasury, ships, and troops of the United Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Excavations at Miletus, {{southwest}} Asia Minor, {{indicate the}} existence of a Mycenaean settlement there already from c. 1450 BC, replacing the previous Minoan installations. This site became a sizable <b>and</b> <b>prosperous</b> Mycenaean center until the 12th century BC. Apart from the archaeological evidence, this is also attested in Hittite records, which indicate that Miletos (Milawata in Hittite) was the most important base for Mycenaean activity in Asia Minor. Mycenaean presence also reached the adjacent sites of Iasus and Ephesus.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{wrote his}} most {{important}} philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major metaphysical texts published between 1774 and 1780—An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind (1774), Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind on the Principle of the Association of Ideas (1775), Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit (1777), The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777), and Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: determinism, materialism, causation, and necessitarianism. By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, <b>and</b> <b>prosperous.</b>|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution of 1810 {{marked the}} {{early stage of}} a process which later led to the {{disintegration}} of Spain's Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, independence and the eventual formation of Argentina. Rosas, like many landowners in the countryside, was suspicious of a movement advanced primarily by merchants and bureaucrats {{in the city of}} Buenos Aires. Rosas was specially outraged by the execution of Viceroy Santiago Liniers {{at the hands of the}} revolutionaries. Rosas felt nostalgic about colonial times, seeing them as stable, orderly <b>and</b> <b>prosperous.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{roots of}} the {{collapse}} of the monarchy can be traced as far back as 1850, upon the death of Pedro II's youngest male child. From that point onward, the Emperor ceased to believe in the monarchy as a viable form of government for Brazil's future, as his remaining heir was a daughter. Although constitutionally permitted, a female ruler was considered unacceptable by both Pedro II and the ruling circles. This issue was deferred for decades, during which the country became more powerful <b>and</b> <b>prosperous.</b> So long as the Emperor enjoyed good health, the matter of succession could be ignored.|$|E

However, the reading of this letter is still problematic and many interpretations have been presented by scholars.|$|E

5|$|Across the country, {{statues of}} Cecil Rhodes were removed and squares and roads named after {{prominent}} colonial figures were renamed after black nationalists. In 1982 Salisbury was renamed Harare. Mugabe employed North Korean architects to design Heroes' Acre, a monument and complex in western Harare {{to commemorate the}} struggle against minority rule. Zimbabwe also received much aid from Western countries, whose governments hoped that a stable <b>and</b> <b>prosperous</b> Zimbabwe would aid the transition of South Africa away from apartheid and minority rule. The United States provided Zimbabwe with a $25 million three-year aid package. The UK financed a land reform program, and provided military advisers to aid {{the integration of the}} guerrilla armies and old Rhodesian security forces into a new Zimbabwean military. Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA were integrated into the army, although there remained a strong rivalry between the two groups. As President, Mugabe retained Walls {{as the head of the}} armed forces.|$|E
5|$|At {{least as}} far back as the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka were {{established}} as a technologically sophisticated <b>and</b> <b>prosperous</b> people who provided slaves to slave traders supplying the plantations of the Mascarene Islands. To protect themselves and their wealth, Sihanaka villages were often fortified by earthen walls (tamboho) of the type also prevalent in the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina. Around 1700, the Sihanaka were a major trading partner of the Betsimisaraka, to whom they traded rice and zebu. The Betsimisaraka, desirous of greater access to Sihanaka wealth, successfully negotiated for French assistance to bring the Sihanaka under their control. French militiamen launched several attacks against Sihanaka communities. This incursion was foiled through a combination of firepower - the Sihanaka having obtained numerous firearms through trade with the Sakalava to the west - and the prevalence of malaria and other tropical diseases that decimated the French soldiers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Livonian War broke out, the Hanseatic League had already lost its {{monopoly}} on the profitable <b>and</b> <b>prosperous</b> Baltic Sea trade. While still involved and with increasing sales, it now shared the market with European mercenary fleets, most notably from the Dutch Seventeen Provinces and France. The Hanseatic vessels were no match for contemporary warships, and since the league was unable to maintain a large navy because of a declining share of trade, its Livonian members Riga, Reval and trading partner Narva were left without suitable protection. The Danish navy, the most powerful in the Baltic Sea, controlled {{the entrance to the}} Baltic Sea, collected requisite tolls, and held the strategically important Baltic Sea islands of Bornholm and Gotland.|$|E

Finally, {{he was accused of}} Gunnar Eilifsen's murder. Whilst not contesting the key facts, he denied all charges on the grounds that he had always worked for a free <b>and</b> <b>prosperous</b> Norway, and submitted a sixty-page response. On 11 July, a further indictment was brought, adding a raft of new charges, including more murders, theft, embezzlement and, most worrying of all for Quisling, the charge of conspiring with Hitler over the 9 April occupation of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient <b>and</b> <b>prosperous</b> economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessness and that the Iran–Contra affair lowered American credibility.|$|E
