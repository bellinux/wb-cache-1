50|$|The cheetah is {{the fastest}} land animal in the world. It was {{previously}} thought that the body temperature of a cheetah increases during <b>a</b> <b>hunt</b> due to high metabolic activity. In {{a short period of}} time during a chase, a cheetah may produce 60 times more heat than at rest, with much of the heat, produced from glycolysis, stored to possibly raise the body temperature. The claim was supported by data from experiments in which two cheetahs ran on a treadmill for minutes on end but contradicted by studies in natural settings, which indicate that body temperature stays relatively the same during <b>a</b> <b>hunt.</b> <b>A</b> 2013 study suggested stress hyperthermia and a slight increase in body temperature after <b>a</b> <b>hunt.</b> The cheetah's nervousness after <b>a</b> <b>hunt</b> may induce stress hyperthermia, which involves high sympathetic nervous activity and raises the body temperature. After <b>a</b> <b>hunt,</b> the risk of another predator taking its kill is great, and the cheetah is on high alert and stressed. The increased sympathetic activity prepares the cheetah's body to run when another predator approaches. In the 2013 study, even the cheetah that did not chase the prey experienced an increase in body temperature once the prey was caught, showing increased sympathetic activity.|$|R
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden {{building was}} constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions. Competitors were {{summoned to the}} hillside {{by the sound of}} <b>a</b> <b>hunting</b> horn, to take part in various sports. Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events, which included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports, and perhaps also money for the other events.|$|E
5|$|All {{motorized}} {{vehicles are}} prohibited, {{but it is}} permitted to bring canoes and other non-motorized boats, as well as skiing during winter. Walking and tenting is permitted everywhere. Berries and mushrooms can be harvested for personal use. Hunting and fishing is also permitted with <b>a</b> <b>hunting</b> or fishing license. Dogs may be brought along, but must be in a leash between 1 April and 20 August. Hikers must show special consideration regarding vegetation, animal life and cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|Another {{crucial role}} in the Clan is that of the deputy. When a new Clan leader is appointed, or the old deputy dies or retires, a new cat will be chosen to fulfill this role. The deputy of a Clan is {{generally}} in charge of less urgent, but still important duties, such as deciding which cats will go on <b>a</b> <b>hunting</b> patrol and which will check the borders. Although the Clan deputy still sleeps in the warriors den, they are respected by other members of the Clan. Often, a cat will come to the deputy first when asking for advice. When a Clan leader dies, the current deputy will take on the new role of leader, and receive their nine lives from StarClan.|$|E
