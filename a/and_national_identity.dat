5|$|Within Scotland, {{the monarchy}} of the United Kingdom has {{continued}} to {{use a variety of}} styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland. The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law. The continued existence of legal, educational, religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture <b>and</b> <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> since the 1707 union with England.|$|E
5|$|Poles {{were viewed}} by Nazis as subhuman non-Aryans {{and during the}} German {{occupation}} of Poland 2.7 million ethnic Poles {{were killed by the}} Nazis. Polish civilians were subject to forced labour in German industry, internment, wholesale expulsions to make way for German colonists and mass executions. The German authorities engaged in a systematic effort to destroy Polish culture <b>and</b> <b>national</b> <b>identity.</b> During operation AB-Aktion, many university professors and members of the Polish intelligentsia were arrested and executed, or transported to concentration camps. During the war, Poland lost an estimated 39 to 45 percent of its physicians and dentists, 26 to 57 percent of its lawyers, 15 to 30 percent of its teachers, 30 to 40 percent of its scientists and university professors and 18 to 28 percent of its clergy.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} {{effect of the}} war was a psychological one. The heavy losses deeply affected many directly, and war memorials were built all over the country as people sought to remember those that had been killed. However, despite the size of Australia's contribution to the fighting, there were many Australians who had had no actual experience of it. Realising this, and having witnessed the impact of the war first hand, Charles Bean, who was instrumental in editing and writing the official history of Australia's involvement in the war, advocated the need for a national memorial {{and was one of the}} main architects in establishing the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. The experience of the war also perpetuated many notions about the Australian character <b>and</b> <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> that endure to this day. For many Australians the performance of their soldiers—particularly during the failed Gallipoli campaign—served to highlight the nation's emergence as a member of the international community, while bringing to the fore a belief in Australians' natural ability as soldiers. The attitudes of many Australians towards war itself were also greatly affected. There was a widespread revulsion at the large-scale destruction and loss of life that had occurred and a desire that it should never occur again. In many regards this led to a general complacency towards defence and military matters after the war and arguably led to the nation's lack of preparedness for the next major conflict, while it may still be evident in Australian strategic behaviour to this day.|$|E

50|$|Postnationalism is {{the process}} or trend by which nation states <b>and</b> <b>national</b> <b>identities</b> lose their {{importance}} relative to supranational and global entities.

40|$|Largely {{due to the}} {{increasing}} religious and cultural pluralism caused by immigration, several European countries have attempted to address the relationship between <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> integration of immigrants in similar ways, highlighting the human rights they enforce as the core of their own <b>national</b> <b>identity.</b> This trend is problematic, however, because it fails to describe the specificities of each state. This article highlights the difficulties in framing the debate about <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> reflects upon the origins of such difficulties. Concluding that these difficulties derive from a misunderstanding of religious traditions <b>and</b> <b>national</b> <b>identities</b> that overlooks the universal self-understanding of religions, seeing them {{as opposed to the}} universal character of human rights, this article urges a reconsideration of the roles of universalism <b>and</b> religious <b>and</b> <b>national</b> <b>identities...</b>|$|R

25|$|After Singapore gained {{independence}} and autonomy in the 1960s, the Singapore government undertook measures to help foster racial harmony in Singapore.
