40|$|Abstract—Aerosol {{refractive}} index and size distribution estimations based on polarized atmospheric irradiance measurements are proposed together with {{its application to}} reflectance based vicarious calibration. A method for reflectance based vicarious calibration with aerosol {{refractive index}} and size distribution estimation using <b>atmospheric</b> <b>polarization</b> irradiance data is proposed. It is possible to estimate aerosol refractive index and size distribution with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>polarization</b> irradiance measured with the different observation angles (scattering angles). The Top of the Atmosphere (TOA) or atsensor radiance is estimated based on atmospheric codes with estimated refractive index and size distribution then vicarious calibration coefficient can be calculated by comparing to the acquired visible to near infrared instrument data onboard satellites. The estimated TOA radiance based on the proposed method is compared to that with aureole-meter based approach {{which is based on}} refractive index and size distribution estimated with solar direct, diffuse and aureole (Conventional AERONET approach). It is obvious that aureole-meter is not portable, heavy and large while polarization irradiance measurement instruments are light and small (portable size and weight).

As to 2 / 3 of China's area covered by mountains，it {{has a higher}} demand for remote sensing. In addition to light intensity, frequency, phase, polarization is also the main physical characteristics of remote sensing electromagnetic waves. Polarization {{is an important component}} of the reflected information from the surface and the atmospheric information, and the polarization effect of the ground object reflection is the basis of the observation of polarization remote sensing. Therefore, the effect of eliminating the polarization effect is very important for remote sensing applications. The main innovations of this paper is as follows: (1) Remote sensing observation method. It is theoretically deduced and verified that the polarization can weaken the light in the strong light region, and then provide the polarization effective information. In turn, the polarization in the low light region can strengthen the weak light, the same can be obtained polarization effective information. (2) Polarization effect of vegetation. By analyzing the structure characteristics of vegetation, polarization information is obtained, then the vegetation structure information directly affects the absorption of biochemical components of leaves.

40|$|The radiometric {{accuracy}} of a sensor is {{adversely affected by}} scene polarization if its optical system is sensitive to polarization. Tests performed on the reflective bands of the NS 001 Thematic Mapper simulator, an aircraft multispectral scanner, show {{that it is very}} sensitive to the polarization state of the incoming radiations. For 100 percent linearly polarized light, errors in the measured intensity vary from - 40 to + 40 percent, depending on the scan angle and spectral band. To estimate polarization-induced errors in the intensity measured at aircraft level, the intensity and <b>polarization</b> of the <b>atmospheric</b> radiances were simulated using a realistic earth-atmosphere radiative transfer model. For the <b>polarization</b> of <b>atmospheric</b> radiances in the solar meridian plane over a vegetated target, intensity errors may range from - 10 to + 10 percent. The polarization-induced errors are highest in the shortest NS 001 spectral band (0. 450 - 0. 525 microns) because of large <b>atmospheric</b> <b>polarizations</b> contributed by Rayleigh particles and small diluting effects caused by the small contributions of weakly polarized radiations coming from aerosols and the surface. Depending on the illumination and view angles, the errors in derived surface reflectance due to the radiance errors can be very large. In particular, for large off-nadir view angles in the forward scattered direction when the sun is low, the relative errors in the derived surface reflectance can be as large as 4 to 5 times the relative error in the radiances. Polarization sensitivity errors cannot be neglected for the shorter wavelengths when the surface reflectance contribution to atmospheric radiances is very small...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a novel {{attitude}} determination system aided by polarization sensor. An improved heading angle function is derived using the perpendicular relationship between directions of E-vector of linearly polarized light and solar vector in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>polarization</b> distribution model. The Extended Kalman filter (EKF) with quaternion differential equation as a dynamic model is applied to fuse the data from sensors. The covariance functions of filter process and measurement noises are deduced in detail. The indoor and outdoor tests are conducted to verify the validity and feasibility of proposed attitude determination system. The test results showed that polarization sensor is not affected by magnetic field, thus the proposed system can work properly in environments containing the magnetic interference. The results also showed that proposed system has higher measurement accuracy than common attitude determination system and can provide precise parameters for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight control. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} implementation of the EKF for incorporating the self-developed polarization sensor into the conventional attitude determination system.

40|$|SCIAMACHY is {{a passive}} imaging {{spectrometer}} onboard ENVISAT designed to obtain trace gas abundances from measured radiances and irradiances in the UV to SWIR range in nadir-, limb- and occultation-viewing modes. Its grating spectrometer introduces a substantial {{sensitivity to the}} polarization of the incoming light with nonnegligible effects on the radiometric calibration. To be able to correct for the polarization sensitivity, SCIAMACHY utilizes broadband Polarization Measurement Devices (PMDs). While for the nadir-viewing mode the measured <b>atmospheric</b> <b>polarization</b> has been validated against POLDER data (Tilstra and Stammes, 2007, 2010), a similar validation study regarding the limb-viewing mode {{has not yet been}} performed. This paper aims at an assessment {{of the quality of the}} SCIAMACHY limb polarization data. Since limb polarization measurements by other air/spaceborne instruments in the spectral range of SCIAMACHY are not available, a comparison with radiative transfer simulations by SCIATRAN V 3. 1 (Rozanov et al., 2013) using a wide range of atmospheric parameters is performed. SCIATRAN is a vector radiative transfer model (VRTM) capable of performing calculations of the multiply scattered radiance in a spherically symmetric atmosphere. The study shows that the limb polarization data exhibit a large time-dependent bias that decreases with wavelength. Possible reasons for this bias are a still unknown combination of insufficient accuracy or inconsistencies of the on-ground calibration data, scan mirror degradation and stress induced changes of the polarization response of components inside the optical bench of the instrument. It is shown that it should in principle be feasible to recalibrate the effective polarization sensitivity of the instrument using the in-flight data and VRTM simulations...|$|E

40|$|A molecular-level {{understanding}} of a heterogeneous catalytic reaction is the key goal of heterogeneous catalysis. A surface science approach enables the realization of this goal. However, the working conditions (ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions) of traditional surface science techniques restrict the investigations of heterogeneous catalysis system under industrial working conditions (<b>atmospheric</b> pressures). <b>Polarization</b> Modulation Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy (PM-IRAS) can be operated in both UHV and atmospheric pressure conditions with a wide temperature span while providing high resolution (4 cm- 1 is used in this dissertation) spectra. In this dissertation, PM-IRAS has been employed as a major technique to: 1) obtain both electronic and chemical information of catalysts from UHV to elevated pressure conditions; 2) explore reaction mechanisms by in situ monitoring surface species with concurrent kinetic measurements. In this dissertation, NO adsorption and dissociation on Rh(111) have been studied. Our PM-IRAS spectra show a transition of NO adsorption on three-fold hollow sites to atop sites occurs at low temperatures (< 275 K). NO dissociation is found to account for this transition. The results indicated the dissociation of NO occurs well below the temperature previously reported. Characterizations of highly catalytically active Au films have also been carried out. Electronic and chemical properties of (1 x 1) - and (1 x 3) -Au/TiOx/Mo(112) films are investigated by PM-IRAS using CO as a probe molecule. The Au overlayers {{are found to be}} electron-rich and to have significantly different electronic properties compared with bulk Au. The exceptionally high catalytic activity of the Au bilayer structure is related to its unique electronic properties. CO oxidation reactions on Rh, Pd, and Pt single crystals are explored from low CO pressures under steady-state conditions (less than 1 x 10 - 4 Torr) to high pressures (0. 01 - 10 Torr) at various gaseous reactant compositions. Surface CO species are probed with in situ PM-IRAS to elucidate the surface phases under reaction conditions. These experimental results are used to correlate reaction kinetics and surface reactant species.

40|$|Lauterbach, JochenIn molecular-level {{catalytic}} investigations, discrepancies {{that exist}} between surface science observations under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and industrial catalytic performance at higher pressures {{are referred to}} as the “pressure gap. ” For example, changes in the population of adsorption sites and variation in reaction mechanisms on catalyst surfaces have been observed as pressure increases above UHV conditions. This work addresses this pressure issue through the investigation of surface adsorption behavior of model catalytic systems over the range from UHV to <b>atmospheric</b> pressures using <b>polarization</b> modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRAS). Likewise, a “materials gap” exists between single crystal surfaces and the supported nanoparticle catalysts used industrially. This work also includes preliminary investigations exploring the use of the reverse micelle technique for catalyst synthesis in order to produce nanoparticles with well-controlled dispersion. Adsorption of CO on Pt(100) was investigated at elevated pressures using PM-IRAS measurements. At sample temperatures of 325 K, a linear C-O stretch (~ 2090 cm- 1) was observed. Peak sharpening and a frequency shift were observed for this CO adsorption band at higher pressures. At 325 K, the frequency shift increased with exposures between 1 and 200 Torr CO up to 6. 3 cm- 1. The full width half maximum of the IR band was observed to decrease by 27 % over the same range. These results suggest that dipole-dipole coupling effects {{play an important role in}} understanding the surface adsorption behavior in this system at higher pressures. A dipole-coupling model was applied to these experimental results. The model predicted CO surface coverages on the Pt(100) surface increasing from ~ 0. 7 at 1 Torr CO to ~ 0. 95 at 200 Torr CO. These results indicate that at higher pressures the CO surface coverage on Pt(100) is much greater than similar measurements obtained under UHV conditions. The predicted increases in surface coverage at higher pressures were verified through analysis of the integrated peak areas of the measured absorption bands. The calculated areas were observed to increase by up to 50 % in magnitude over the pressure range from 1 Torr CO to 200 Torr CO. Measurements obtained during reduction from a high-pressure environment indicate that high-pressure adsorption behavior is a mix of reversible and irreversible processes. Measured PM-IRAS spectra exhibit significant broadening and decreasing frequency with increasing sample temperature. These effects are consistent with phonon dephasing models for adsorbed molecules. Above certain sample temperatures, the absorption band associated with adsorbed CO is no longer observed in the measured spectra. This is attributed to CO dissociation at higher sample temperatures, resulting in carbon contamination of the Pt(100) surface. Subsequent spectra obtained after exposure of the system to oxidative conditions reveal the return of the absorption band corresponding to adsorbed CO. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements also corroborate this finding by excluding desorption as a likely cause of the loss of the CO band. Adsorbed CO measured in a CO oxidation reaction environment exhibit reversible adsorption/desorption processes around CO desorption temperatures. In parallel to the above high-pressure studies, initial steps toward overcoming the materials gap were taken through the synthesis of Ru nanoparticles using the reverse micelle synthesis technique. Reverse micelles were created using a microemulsion consisting of butyl ammonium laurate-water-hexanes. Dynamic Light Scattering was used to characterize the reverse micelles, which exhibited tunable sizes ranging from 5 to 30 nm depending on the molar water-to-butyl ammonium laurate ratio used. Reverse micelles having a diameter of 6 nm were then used to produce Ru nanoparticles from a RuCl 3 precursor solution. The resulting Ru particles had a diameter of ~ 3 nm, as determined from Small-Angle X-ray Scattering measurements. These results are a promising first step towards the goal of examining well-controlled nanoparticle catalysts over a wide range of pressure conditions using PM-IRAS. This approach has the potential to bridge both the pressure and materials gaps, allowing for significant improvements in the comparisons of model catalytic investigations with industrial catalytic performance.
