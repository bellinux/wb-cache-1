5|$|HMAS Melbourne (R21) was a Majestic-class light <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Operating from 1955 until 1982, she was {{the third}} and final {{conventional}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> to serve in the RAN. Melbourne was the only Commonwealth naval vessel to sink two friendly warships in peacetime collisions.|$|E
5|$|When an <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> deploys, {{it takes}} a Strike Group, made up of several other {{warships}} and supply vessels which allow the operation to be carried out. The armament of the Nimitz class is made up only of short range defensive weapons, used as a {{last line of defense}} against enemy missiles and aircraft. An <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier,</b> as with all surface ships, is particularly vulnerable to attack from below, specifically from submarines. An <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> is a very expensive, hard to replace and strategically valuable asset and therefore logically has a huge target value.|$|E
5|$|HMS Ark Royal (pennant number 91) was an <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> of the Royal Navy {{that served}} during the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|Although the Montreux Convention {{is cited}} by the Turkish {{government}} as prohibiting <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> in the straits, the treaty actually contains no explicit prohibition on <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b> However, modern <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> are heavier than the 15,000 ton limit, {{making it impossible for}} non-Black Sea powers to transit modern <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> through the Straits.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> : The current three Invincible class <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> {{are to be}} {{replaced}} by two new larger and more flexible <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b> These ships, the Queen Elizabeth Class (known {{at the time of the}} review as CVF) should enter service in 2012 and 2015.|$|R
5|$|The German <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> Graf Zeppelin was {{the lead}} ship {{in a class of}} two {{carriers}} of the same name ordered by the Kriegsmarine. She was the only <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> launched by Germany and represented part of the Kriegsmarines attempt to create a well-balanced oceangoing fleet, capable of projecting German naval power far beyond the narrow confines of the Baltic and North Seas. The carrier would have had a complement of 42 fighters and dive bombers.|$|E
5|$|The Malta-class <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> was a British large <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> {{design of}} World War II. Four ships were ordered in 1943 for the Royal Navy, but {{changing}} tactical concepts, based on American {{experience in the}} Pacific War, caused repeated changes to the design, which was not completed {{before the end of}} the war. All four ships were cancelled in 1945 before they were laid down.|$|E
5|$|The <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> I was {{the first}} planned <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> {{conversion}} project of the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) during World War I. The Imperial Navy had experimented previously with seaplane carriers, though these earlier conversions were too slow to operate with the High Seas Fleet and carried an insufficient number of aircraft. I was intended to carry between 23 and 30 aircraft, including fighters, bombers, and torpedo-bombers.|$|E
50|$|The Kiev-class <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> (also {{known as}} Project 1143 {{or as the}} Krechyet (Gyrfalcon) class) were the first class of {{fixed-wing}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> built in the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|In July 2011, {{a senior}} {{researcher}} of the Academy of Military Sciences said China needed {{at least three}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> for its fleet. During the same month, another Chinese official announced that two <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> were being built at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> are reportedly based on a similar design to the Liaoning, suggesting a displacement of approximately 65,000 tonnes. A new Chinese variant of the Sukhoi Su-33 fighter aircraft, known as the Shenyang J-15 (or Flying Shark) are expected to fly from the new <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 41 {{carriers}} are in active service with thirteen navies. 27 <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> carry fixed-wing <b>aircraft</b> (with 20 of these {{operated by the}} United States Navy), and 14 carriers solely deploy helicopters. Most navies do not have <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b> Those that do usually operate {{only one or two}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b> The USA is the single exception, with 11 super carriers and 9 amphibious assault ships in service.|$|R

5|$|Argus had her genesis in the Admiralty's desire {{during the}} First World War for an <b>{{aircraft}}</b> <b>carrier</b> that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, {{but had no}} way to recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder William Beardmore had proposed to the Admiralty an <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier.</b> Construction of the Italian ocean liners Conte Rosso and Giulio Cesare had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. Conte Rosso was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of Giulio Cesare, and the company began work on converting the ship.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{decided to}} build a class of two {{submarine}} tenders which could be converted into light aircraft carriers or fleet oilers. The first ship, Tsurugizaki, was commissioned into service in 1939. Construction of the second, Takasaki, was stopped soon after launch and she was completed as an <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier.</b> The ship was commissioned as Zuiho in December 1940. In early 1941, Tsurugizaki {{was taken out of}} service, converted to an <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier,</b> and recommissioned as Shōhō in early 1942.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{view that}} modern anti-ship weapons systems, such as torpedoes and missiles, have made <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> {{obsolete}} as too vulnerable for modern combat. [...] On the other hand, the threatening role of <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> has a place in modern asymmetric warfare, like the gunboat diplomacy of the past. Furthermore, <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> facilitate quick and precise projections of overwhelming military power into such local and regional conflicts.|$|R
50|$|The Unryū-class <b>aircraft</b> <b>{{carriers}}</b> (Unryū-gata Kōkūbokan) were World War II Japanese <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b> 16 carriers {{were planned}} under the Maru Kyū Programme (Ship #302 in 1941) and the Kai-Maru 5 Programme (#5001 - 5015 in 1942). However, only 3 of the Unryū class carriers were completed.|$|R
50|$|Of the {{services}} provided by the shipyard are building platform supply vessels and double-hulled oil tankers. Presently it is building the first range of indigenous <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> for the Indian Navy, the Vikrant-class <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 6 March, Tirpitz, {{escorted by}} three destroyers, {{launched}} {{a raid on}} the British convoys to the Soviet Union. The Germans attempted to intercept convoys PQ-12 and QP-8, but the inclement weather prevented them from finding the convoys. The British located Tirpitz, and the <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> Victorious launched a strike of twelve Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers. The aircraft were repulsed without having scored any hits on the German ships. Tirpitz and the destroyers were back in port by 12 March. The close call prompted Hitler to mandate that Tirpitz was not to attack another convoy unless its escorting <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> had been sunk or disabled.|$|E
5|$|Russian Naval Aviation – the Russian Navy {{operates}} an adapted {{version of}} the Su-25UB two-seat trainer, the Su-25UTG. This is a carrier capable version used to carrier out full deck-landing training aboard the Navy's <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Rajput class {{inherited}} its anti-aircraft and anti-submarine warfare {{roles for}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> task-force defence against submarines, low-flying aircraft and cruise missiles from the Kashin class.|$|E
50|$|The Chitose-class <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> (Chitose-gata kōkūbokan) were a {{class of}} two {{seaplane}} tenders, later converted to light <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers,</b> of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Under {{the terms of the}} Washington Naval Treaty, the total tonnage of Japans naval vessels was limited by class. The Chitose-class ships were built as seaplane tenders, designed to make the conversion to <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> relatively easy. They served as seaplane tenders during {{the early part of the}} Pacific War. After the Battle of Midway, they were converted into light <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b> Both ships participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and both were sunk in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.|$|R
25|$|Finally, both Cleveland and Baltimore hulls were {{converted}} to light <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b> The Independence-class of light <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers,</b> {{were converted}} from Cleveland-class cruisers, and the Saipan-class light carriers used the basic form of the Baltimore-class cruiser design.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to American CVNs (nuclear <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers),</b> the French Charles de Gaulle, the Russian Kuznetsov, the Brazilian São Paulo, the Chinese Liaoning, {{as well as}} the Indian Vikramaditya are active or future <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> installed with arresting gear.|$|R
5|$|The <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> II was a {{proposed}} conversion {{project for the}} incomplete French cruiser De Grasse. The ship was laid down in November 1938 and lay incomplete in the Arsenal de Lorient shipyard when Germany invaded France in May 1940. In 1942, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine decided to convert the cruiser into an auxiliary <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> with a capacity for twenty-three fighters and dive bombers. Work ceased in February 1943, however, due to concerns with the ship's design, a severe shortage of material and labor, {{and the threat of}} Allied bombing raids. The ship was eventually completed as an anti-aircraft cruiser in 1956 by the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|Two Japanese naval cruisers, one {{launched}} in 1911 {{and the second}} in 1938, were named after the Chikuma River. A 1940s <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> was named after the old Shinano Province.|$|E
5|$|A {{replacement}} for Melbourne was under consideration {{as early as}} 1956, and the question was revisited on several occasions until the 1980s. In every situation, a new <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> was turned down due to the increases in manpower and operating costs required to operate the ship when compared to Melbourne.|$|E
2500|$|The {{period has}} seen the {{introduction}} of the angled flight deck on <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> as well as the [...] "Ski jump" [...] to aid take off and mirror landing sights. New, larger <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> are planned but keep getting postponed.|$|R
2500|$|From September, Inazuma was {{reassigned to}} Kure Naval District, and {{training}} {{exercises in the}} Inland Sea with new <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> [...] and [...] From October, Inazuma escorted these <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> to Truk, and patrolled from Truk to the northern Solomon Islands.|$|R
50|$|It took {{until late}} 1942 for <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> to be universally {{considered}} capital ships. The U.S. Navy {{was forced to}} rely primarily on its <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> after the attack on Pearl Harbor sank or damaged eight of its Pacific-fleet battleships.|$|R
5|$|Among the anecdotes of {{navigation}} by bioluminescence, the Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell recounted how as a navy pilot {{he had found}} {{his way back to}} his <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> USS Shangri-La when his navigation systems failed. Turning off his cabin lights, he saw the glowing wake of the ship, and was able to fly to it and land safely.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} special {{events that have}} taken place at the {{memorial}} was a visit by a number of officers and crew members from the United States <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> USS John F. Kennedy (CV67), named in honor of the same U.S. President memorialized by this monument, during a 1997 port visit to Haifa.|$|E
5|$|An escort carrier, USS Midway (CVE-63) was {{commissioned}} on 17 August 1943. She was renamed St. Lo on 10 October 1944 {{to clear the}} name Midway for a large fleet <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier,</b> , which {{was commissioned}} on 10 September 1945, eight days after the Japanese surrender, and is now docked in San Diego, California, as the USS Midway Museum.|$|E
5000|$|From September, Inazuma was {{reassigned to}} Kure Naval District, and {{training}} {{exercises in the}} Inland Sea with new <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> [...] and [...] From October, Inazuma escorted these <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> to Truk, and patrolled from Truk to the northern Solomon Islands.|$|R

50|$|Japan put {{particular}} emphasis on <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b> The Imperial Japanese Navy started the Pacific War with 10 <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers,</b> {{the largest and most}} modern carrier fleet in the world at that time. There were seven American <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> at the beginning of hostilities, only three operating in the Pacific; and eight British <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers,</b> of which a single one operated in the Indian Ocean. The IJN's two -class carriers were superior to any carrier in the world, until the wartime appearance of the American Essex class. A large number of these Japanese carriers were of small size, however, in accordance with the limitations placed upon the Navy by the London and Washington Naval Conferences.|$|R
