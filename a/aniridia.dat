25|$|A {{scleral lens}} is a large, firm, oxygen {{permeable}} contact lens that {{rests on the}} sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses {{may be used to}} improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from a growing number of disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome (Kerotanconjuctivis sicca), microphthalmia, keratoconus, corneal ectasia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, <b>aniridia,</b> neurotrophic keratitis (aneasthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order Aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.|$|E
50|$|The glued IOL {{technique}} {{can be used}} {{in cases}} in which there is aphakia with <b>aniridia</b> (Fig 7 A and B). In such a cases one can use an <b>aniridia</b> IOL which has got an artificial iris with the IOL component. Thus we can get an <b>aniridia</b> glued IOL.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aniridia</b> may be broadly {{divided into}} {{hereditary}} and sporadic forms. Hereditary <b>aniridia</b> is usually transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner (each offspring has a 50% {{chance of being}} affected), although rare autosomal recessive forms (such as Gillespie syndrome) have also been reported. Sporadic <b>aniridia</b> mutations may affect the WT1 region adjacent to the AN2 <b>aniridia</b> region, causing a kidney cancer called nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor). These patients often also have genitourinary abnormalities and intellectual disability (WAGR syndrome).|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} of muscular hypotonia and fixed dilated pupils in infancy is suspicious of Gillespie syndrome. Early onset partial <b>aniridia,</b> cerebellar ataxia, and mental retardation are hallmark of syndrome. The iris abnormality is specific and seems pathognomonic of Gillespie syndrome.

5000|$|<b>Aniridia</b> is {{the absence}} of the iris, usually {{involving}} both eyes. It can be congenital or caused by a penetrant injury. [...] Isolated <b>aniridia</b> is a congenital disorder which is not limited to a defect in iris development, but is a panocular condition with macular and optic nerve hypoplasia, cataract, and corneal changes. Vision may be severely compromised and the disorder is frequently associated with a number of ocular complications: nystagmus, amblyopia, buphthalmos, and cataract. <b>Aniridia</b> in some individuals occurs as part of a syndrome, such as WAGR syndrome (kidney nephroblastoma (Wilms tumour), genitourinary anomalies and intellectual disability), or Gillespie syndrome (cerebellar ataxia).|$|E
50|$|In older children, {{clinical}} {{diagnosis of the}} syndrome can be made when <b>aniridia</b> {{and one of the}} other features are present. While <b>aniridia</b> is rarely absent in WAGR syndrome, cases have been reported without it. Chromosomal analysis is necessary for definitive diagnosis. Other common eye defects include cataracts and ptosis. About 50% of people develop Wilms' tumour.|$|E

50|$|Gillespie syndrome, {{also called}} <b>aniridia,</b> {{cerebellar}} ataxia and mental deficiency. {{is a rare}} genetic disorder. The disorder is characterized by partial <b>aniridia</b> (meaning {{that part of the}} iris is missing), ataxia (motor and coordination problems), and, in most cases, intellectual disability. It is heterogeneous, inherited in either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. Gillespie syndrome was first described by American ophthalmologist Fredrick Gillespie in 1965.|$|E

50|$|CNV causes may be {{congenital}} in nature, such as with <b>Aniridia,</b> or acquired. Frequently, inflammatory, infectious, degenerative, traumatic and iatrogenic (from contact lenses) {{diseases are}} responsible for acquired CNV.|$|E
50|$|Defects in the PAX6 gene cause aniridia-like ocular {{defects in}} mice (as well as Drosophila). <b>Aniridia</b> is a {{heterozygous}} disorder, meaning {{that only one}} of the two chromosome 11 copies is affected. When both copies are altered (homozygous condition), the result is a uniformly fatal condition with near complete failure of entire eye formation. In 2001, two cases of homozygous <b>aniridia</b> patients were reported; the fetuses died prior to birth and had severe brain damage. In mice, homozygous small eye defect (mouse Pax-6) leads to loss of the eyes and nose and the murine fetuses suffer severe brain damage.|$|E
50|$|Newborn {{children}} with WAGR syndrome are soon noted to have <b>aniridia.</b> The clinical suspicion for WAGR {{may be increased}} {{with the presence of}} other genital anomalies, though genitourinary anomalies are not always present, particularly in girls.|$|E

50|$|Occasionally, corneal {{tattooing}} {{is performed}} when it might improve eyesight. According to Dr. Samuel Lewis Ziegler, indications for treatment include albinism, <b>aniridia,</b> coloboma, iridodialysis, keratoconus, or diffused nebulae of the cornea. Corneal tattooing is also performed on patients who still have vision to reduce symptomatic glare associated with large iridectomies or traumatic iris loss.|$|E
50|$|Fisher {{was born}} in Lower Hutt {{and grew up in}} the nearby Upper Hutt suburb of Silverstream. She was born wiith the rare genetic {{condition}} <b>aniridia,</b> resulting in low vision which deteriorated as a teenager. She attended Silverstream Primary School, Maidstone Intermediate and Heretaunga College. She is a student at the Wellington campus of Massey University.|$|E
50|$|Molecular (DNA) {{testing for}} PAX6 gene {{mutations}} (by sequencing {{of the entire}} coding region and deletion/duplication analysis) is available for isolated <b>aniridia</b> and the Gillespie syndrome. For the WAGR syndrome, high-resolution cytogenetic analysis and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) can be utilized to identify deletions within chromosome band 11p13, where both the PAX6 and WT1 genes are located.|$|E
50|$|In ophthalmology, pannus {{refers to}} the growth of blood vessels into the {{peripheral}} cornea. In normal individuals, the cornea is avascular. Chronic local hypoxia (such as that occurring with overuse of contact lenses) or inflammation may lead to peripheral corneal vascularization, or pannus. Pannus may also develop in diseases of the corneal stem cells, such as <b>aniridia.</b> It is often resolved by peritomy.|$|E

[...] Diagnosed with <b>aniridia</b> - a {{condition}} affecting the iris - at six months old, she spent extended periods in hospital and lost her sight in childhood. At seven she became a weekly boarder at a Catholic school for blind and partially sighted children, and later studied at Teesside University, where she became involved in student politics.|$|E
5000|$|Paired box protein Pax-6, {{also known}} as <b>aniridia</b> type II protein (AN2) or oculorhombin, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PAX6 gene.Pax6 is a {{transcription}} factor present during embryonic development. Theencoded protein contains two different binding sites that are known to bind DNAand function as regulators of gene transcription. It is a key regulatory gene of eyeand brain development. Within the brain, the protein is involved in development ofthe specialized cells that process smell. As a transcription factor, Pax6 activatesand/or deactivates gene expression patterns to ensure for proper development ofthe tissue. Mutations of the Pax6 gene are known to cause various disorders of theeyes. Two common disorders associated with a mutation are: <b>aniridia,</b> the absenceof the iris, and Peters' anomaly, thinning and clouding of the cornea. Scientists havecreated a [...] "tae" [...] model using mice during which time the mouse does notexpress Pax6. The [...] "knockout" [...] model is eyeless or has very underdeveloped eyesfurther indicating Pax6 is required for proper eye development.|$|E
50|$|Wilms tumour affects {{approximately}} one person per 10,000 worldwide {{before the age}} of 15 years. People of African descent may have slightly higher rates of Wilms tumor. The peak age of Wilms tumour is 3 to 4 years and most cases occur {{before the age of}} 10 years. A genetic predisposition to Wilms Tumor in individuals with <b>aniridia</b> has been established, due to deletions in the p13 band on chromosome 11.|$|E
5000|$|The Boston KPro is a {{treatment}} option for corneal disorders not amenable to standard penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplantation) or corneal transplant. The Boston KPro is a proven primary treatment option for repeat graft failure, herpetic keratitis, <b>aniridia</b> [...] and many pediatric congenital corneal opacities including Peter's anomaly. The device {{is also used}} to treat [...] conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome [...] and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, and also ocular burns.|$|E
50|$|Zamzam-Sheriff-Phillips {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive congenital disorder. It is characterized by <b>aniridia,</b> ectopia lentis, abnormal upper incisors and intellectual disability. Not {{a lot of research}} has been undertaken of this particular disease so thus far there is no known gene that affects this condition. However it has been hypothesised that the symptoms described are found at a particular gene, though intellectual disability is believed to be due to a different genetic cause.|$|E
5000|$|WAGR {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} WAGR complex, Wilms tumour-aniridia syndrome, aniridia-Wilms tumour syndrome) {{is a rare}} genetic syndrome in which affected children are predisposed to develop Wilms tumour (a tumour of the kidneys), <b>Aniridia</b> (absence of the coloured part of the eye, the iris), Genitourinary anomalies, and Retardation. [...] The G is sometimes instead given as [...] "gonadoblastoma," [...] since the genitourinary anomalies can include tumours of the gonads (testes or ovaries).|$|E
5000|$|More recently, another {{condition}} called <b>aniridia</b> {{has been treated}} with reconstructive surgery using the membrane from the amniotic sac that surrounds a fetus combined with stem cell transplantation into the eye.In 2003, three people were successfully implanted with a permanent [...] "retinal prosthesis" [...] {{by researchers at the}} University of Southern California. Each patient wore spectacles with miniature video cameras that transmitted signals to a 4-mm-by-5-mm retinal implant via a wireless receiver embedded behind the ear.|$|E
5000|$|The corneal limbus is {{the border}} of the cornea and the sclera (the white of the eye). The limbus is a common site for the {{occurrence}} of corneal epithelial neoplasm.The limbus contains radially-oriented fibrovascular ridges known as the palisades of Vogt that may harbour a stem cell population. The palisades of Vogt are more common in the superior and inferior quadrants around the eye. [...] <b>Aniridia,</b> a developmental anomaly of the iris, disrupts the normal barrier of the cornea to the conjunctival epithelial cells at the limbus.|$|E
50|$|Scleral lenses {{may be used}} {{to improve}} vision and reduce pain and light {{sensitivity}} for people suffering from a growing number of disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome, microphthalmia, keratoconus, corneal ectasia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, <b>aniridia,</b> neurotrophic keratitis (aneasthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, higher order Aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated by the use of scleral lenses.|$|E
50|$|Hemeralopia {{is known}} to occur in several ocular conditions. Cone {{dystrophy}} and achromatopsia, affecting the cones in the retina, and the anti-epileptic drug Trimethadione are typical causes. Adie's pupil which fails to constrict in response to light; <b>Aniridia,</b> which is absence of the iris; Albinism where the iris is defectively pigmented may also cause this. Central Cataracts, due to the lens clouding, disperses the light before it can reach the retina, is a common cause of hemeralopia and photoaversion in elderly. C.A.R (Cancer Associated Retinopathy) seen when certain cancers incite the production of deleterious antibodies against retinal components, may cause hemeralopia.|$|E
