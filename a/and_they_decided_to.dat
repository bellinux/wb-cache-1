5|$|The artwork's {{concept was}} {{originated}} by Ramones fan Gus MacDonald, who illustrated the members performing with a lobster claw {{coming out of}} an amplifier and a snake around their feet. Following the drawing's completion, MacDonald sent it to the band <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> make it their Road to Ruin album cover. This sketch did, however, include original drummer Tommy, so the drawing had to be modified to depict Marky instead. This alteration was undergone by artist John Holmstrom, a Punk magazine associate and designer.|$|E
5|$|Digging for Fire {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} in which Jake Johnson and his wife dug up a bone and a gun in the garden of a house they had rented. Over a couple of weeks, he and a group of his friends dug up various objects before deciding to bury them again. Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> make a film about it. They wrote a two-and-a-half–page outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions. Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them to make choices about their characters: for instance, Orlando Bloom decided that his character would ride a motorcycle, Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked, and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, {{the team}} {{wanted to make}} a grand RPG, but were {{restricted}} by their budget and schedule. They were reluctant to cut any content such as one of the time periods or the multiplayer aspect, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> postpone the original release date from March 2000 to June the same year. They also scaled back the scope of their multiplayer testing and canceled the planned release of an interactive pre-launch demo. The delay allowed Nihilistic to retain most of the intended design but they were forced to remove the ability to play the entire single-player campaign as a team online, compensating for this by adding two multiplayer scenarios built using levels from the single-player game. Huebner said they did not plan appropriately for multiplayer when building the Java scripts for the single-player game, meaning the scripts did not work effectively in multiplayer mode.|$|E

5|$|Hurdt {{wanted to}} attack Trunajaya's stronghold Kediri from Surabaya in coastal East Java, {{which would be}} the {{shortest}} route. However, Amangkurat II proposed that the troops be divided into columns and march along a lengthy overland route. He wanted the VOC-Mataram forces to march slowly through more areas in order to impress factions that were wavering over which side to take. This argument convinced Hurdt, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> split the army into three different columns travelling via different overland routes from coastal Central Java to Kediri in inland East Java. In addition, a VOC merchant, Willem Bastinck, was to go to Surabaya to seek out Karaeng Galesonga former Trunajaya ally, whose allegiance was wavering, and whose help Mataram and the VOC hoped to enlistand his followers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> abandon it. The {{remaining}} supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent {{and most of the}} food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.|$|E
5|$|Following the annulment, Cromwell was {{executed}} on 28 July. Cranmer now {{found himself in}} a politically prominent position, with no-one else to shoulder the burden. Throughout the rest of Henry's reign, he clung to Henry's authority. The king had total trust in him and in return, Cranmer could not conceal anything from the king. At the end of June 1541, Henry with his new wife, Catherine Howard, left for his first visit to the north of England. Cranmer was left in London {{as a member of a}} council taking care of matters for the king in his absence. His colleagues were Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley and Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford. This was Cranmer's first major piece of responsibility outside the Church. In October, while the king and queen were away, a reformer named John Lascelles revealed to Cranmer that Catherine engaged in extramarital affairs. Cranmer gave the information to Audley and Seymour <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> wait until Henry's return. Afraid of angering the king, Audley and Seymour suggested that Cranmer inform Henry. Cranmer slipped a message to Henry during mass on All Saints Day. An investigation revealed the truth of the marital indiscretions and Catherine {{was executed}} in February 1542.|$|E

5|$|In late 1940, an {{engineer}} had created some military inventions which Gjems-Onstad's group {{wanted to bring}} to the Allied forces. It was decided that one of them was to travel to the UK, while Gjems-Onstad was to travel to Stockholm. Gjems-Onstad was joined by three others, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> let themselves be arrested in Östmark in Sweden. They were transported to Stockholm, but the Norwegian legation was not interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was later tipped to contact the British military attaché. He got in contact with Major Malcolm Munthe, who in turn was interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was arrested by Swedish police in Stockholm on 25 March 1941, as parts of Munthe's organisation had been exposed. Gjems-Onstad was imprisoned at the Stockholm police station for 13 days, and then for 59 days in the Stockholm Remand Prison. On 23 May 1941 the government decided that he was to be expelled and banned from entering Sweden (the ban was repealed after the war). He was originally scheduled to be deported to Canada via Moscow and China, but the plans were halted due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was instead sent to the Norwegian refugee camp in Öreryd. He was ordered by the British to escape from Öreryd in October 1941 and travel to Norway. He was captured by the Swedish Home Guard close to the Norwegian border, but was sent by plane to the UK by Swedish authorities in December.|$|E

25|$|The {{destruction}} {{of people and}} the village at Mistick Fort and losing even more warriors during the withdrawal pursuit broke the Pequot spirit, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> abandon their villages and flee westward to seek refuge with the Mohawk tribe. Sassacus led roughly 400 warriors along the coast; when they crossed the Connecticut River, the Pequots killed three men whom they encountered near Fort Saybrook.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Matt’s departure, local drummer Tim Olsen {{was brought}} in as a replacement. Also around that time, Marc-André Mongeon was brought as a bassist (the first since Shomir had left the band in 2001). As a five-piece, the band toured {{throughout}} the summer of 2004 across Canada. By the time mid-2005 came around, the constant touring proved {{to be too much}} for Marc and Dave <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> step down.|$|E

They departed on the Italian liner Semiramisa bound for Venice on 3 March 1920. Grand Duke Andrei and his mother were the last Romanovs to leave Russia for exile.|$|E

25|$|Attenborough's {{association}} with natural history programmes {{began when he}} produced and presented the three-part series Animal Patterns. The studio-bound programme featured animals from London Zoo, with the naturalist Julian Huxley discussing their use of camouflage, aposematism and courtship displays. Through this programme, Attenborough met Jack Lester, the curator of the zoo's reptile house, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> make a series about an animal-collecting expedition. The result was Zoo Quest, first broadcast in 1954, where Attenborough became the presenter at short notice due to Lester being taken ill.|$|E
25|$|During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, {{by the end}} of 1942, the Jews {{trapped in}} the Warsaw Ghetto learned that the deportations were part of an {{extermination}} process, as the deportees were sent to death camps. Many of the remaining Jews decided to revolt. The first armed resistance in the ghetto occurred in January 1943. On 19 April 1943, Passover eve, the Germans entered the ghetto.

25|$|The canal {{connects to}} an un-navigable {{part of the}} River Severn, {{separated}} from the main channel by weirs at Maisemore and Llanthony, {{both of which have}} derelict locks associated with them. Maisemore was sold by British Waterways some years ago, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> dispose of Llanthony in 2007. The Canal Trust used a legacy to purchase the site, which includes two cottages, some land, and a small section of the River Severn as well as Llanthony lock. The lock is bigger than that at Maisemore, and access to the entrance lock at Over is easier because boats are travelling against the flow of the river as they approach it.|$|E
25|$|The {{distress}} call was {{received by the}} crew at Bjørnøya Radio <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> send two men, Einar Strand and Alv Alvær, {{to look for the}} aircraft on the island.

Strand and Alvær attempted to drag the survivor with them, but this proved too strenuous. Instead Alvær went back to the station and Strand stayed with Olsen. On the return trip Alvær got lost at one time, but finally managed to reach the station. Bjørnøya Radio contacted Skattøra at 21:45 reporting that the wreck had been found.|$|E
