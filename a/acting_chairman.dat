25|$|Rieve's {{tenure as}} <b>acting</b> <b>chairman</b> saw the {{beginning}} of events which would seriously affect the union in the 1950s.

Rather than stay silent and acquiesce in the wage cut, the council formally approved the wage reduction.

The Missouri congressman also included his report in the Congressional Record.|$|E
