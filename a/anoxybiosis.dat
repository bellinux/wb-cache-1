50|$|In {{situations}} lacking oxygen (a.k.a., anoxia), many cryptobionts (such as M. tardigradum) take {{in water}} and become turgid and immobile, but can still survive for prolonged periods of time just as with other cryptobiological processes. While survival rate studies of organisms during supposed <b>anoxybiosis</b> in anoxia have historically given some conflicting results, the current consensus is that certain ectothermic vertebrates and some invertebrates (for example, brine shrimp (Clegg et al. 1999), copepods (Marcus et al., 1994), nematodes (Crowe and Cooper, 1971), and sponge gemmules (Reiswig and Miller, 1998)) are capable of successfully surviving in a seemingly inactive state during anoxic conditions for periods of time ranging from months to decades. Studies of the metabolic activity of these idling organisms during anoxia have been mostly inconclusive, primarily due to the technical difficulty of measuring very small degrees of metabolic activity with enough reliability to conclusively prove a cryptobiotic state is occurring rather than just an extreme case of the metabolic rate depression (MRD) phenomenon exhibited by all aerobic organisms to some degree (typically 1-10% of aerobic levels) when exposed to anoxia. Thus, <b>anoxybiosis</b> is not considered a legitimate form of naturally occurring cryptobiosis by some comparative biologists because of these inconclusive and conflicting experimental results regarding whether a truly complete metabolic standstill actually occurs in cryptobionts during anoxic conditions, or if the metabolism is merely such {{a tiny fraction of}} the aerobic metabolic rate that it falls below the limits of detection. Also, many experts are skeptical of the biological feasibility of <b>anoxybiosis,</b> because any preservation of biological structures during anoxic conditions would imply that a seemingly impossible situation is occurring, wherein the organism is managing to prevent damage to its cellular structures from the environmental negative free energy despite being both surrounded by plenty of water and thermal energy and, most remarkably, it does so without using any free energy of its own. However (as summarized by Professor James Clegg of the UC Davis Bodega Marine laboratory in a 2001 review article), while many studies have failed to find measurable quantities of metabolic activity in potential anoxybiotic organisms, and there is also some evidence that the stress-induced protein p26 may act as a protein chaperone that requires no energy in cystic Artemia franciscana embryos, more recent data suggest that most likely an extremely specialized and slow guanine polynucleotide pathway continues to provide metabolic free energy to the Artemia franciscana embryos during anoxic conditions. Although it is inherently difficult to prove that not a single organism in existence anywhere is capable of entering a truly anoxybiotic state, it seems to clearly be the case that most likely at least A. franciscana (a.k.a. sea monkeys, a well-known and commonly studied cryptobiont) is only capable of approaching, but not reaching, the above-mentioned implied violation of the usual biological conversion of environmental negative free energy into the negative entropy of cellular structures via metabolic processes.|$|E
5000|$|Tardigrades {{are one of}} the few {{groups of}} species that are capable of {{suspending}} their metabolism (see cryptobiosis). Many species of tardigrade can survive in a dehydrated state up to five years, or in exceptional cases longer. Depending on the environment, they may enter this state via anhydrobiosis, cryobiosis, osmobiosis, or <b>anoxybiosis.</b> While in this state, their metabolism lowers to less than 0.01% of normal and their water content can drop to 1% of normal. Their ability to remain desiccated for such long periods was thought to be largely dependent on the high levels of the nonreducing sugar trehalose, which protects their membranes, though recent research suggests that tardigrades have a unique type of disordered protein that serves a similar purpose: It replaces water in the cells and adopts a glassy, vitrified state when the animals dry out. [...] Their DNA is further protected from radiation by a protein called [...] "Dsup" [...] (short for damage suppressor). In this cryptobiotic state, the tardigrade is known as a tun.|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. The Tardigrada are bilaterally {{symmetrical}} micrometazoans {{with four}} pairs of lobopod legs terminating in claws or sucking disks. They occupy {{a diversity of}} niches in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments throughout the world. Some have a cosmopolitan distribution, while others are endemic. About 900 species have been described thus far, but many more species are expected as additional habitats are investigated. Most are less than 1 mm in body length and are opaque or translucent, exhibiting colors such as brown, green, orange, yellow, red, or pink in the cuticle and/or gut. Marine species are more variable in body shape and overall appearance and generally exhibit low population density with high species diversity. Reproductive modes include sexual reproduction and parthenogenesis, but {{much remains to be}} known about development. Tardigrades have a hemocoel-type of fluid-filled body cavity, a complete digestive tract, and a lobed dorsal brain with a ventral nerve cord with fused ganglia. Recent molecular analyses and additional morphological studies of the nervous system have confirmed the phylogenetic position of tardigrades as a sister group of the arthropods. The ability of tardigrades to undergo cryptobiosis has long intrigued scien-tists. Although tardigrades are active only when surrounded by a film of water, they can enter latent states in response to desiccation (anhydrobiosis), temperature (cryobiosis), low oxygen (<b>anoxybiosis),</b> and salinity changes (osmobiosis). Cryptobiotic states aid in dispersal...|$|E
40|$|Tardigrades often {{colonise}} extreme habitats, {{in which}} they survive using both types of dormancy: quiescence and diapause. To-gether with nematodes and bdelloid rotifers, tardigrades are known to enter quiescence (with several forms of cryptobiosis: anhy-drobiosis, cryobiosis, <b>anoxybiosis,</b> osmobiosis) at any stage of their life cycle, from egg to adult. Entering anhydrobiosis, tardigrades contract their body into a so-called tun, loosing most of their free and bound water (> 95 %), synthesizing cell protectants (e. g., tre-halose, glycerol, heat shock proteins) and strongly reducing or suspending their metabolism. Our research on cryptobiosis focused on some ecological and evolutionary aspects. We evaluated: i) the long-term anhydrobiotic survival by comparing quantitative data on recovery from naturally induced desiccation in several species of tardigrades; ii) differences in survival patterns between species and populations by experimentally inducing anhydrobiosis and cryobiosis; iii) phenotypic factors affecting anhydrobiotic survival. As regards diapause, we considered encystment and eggs. Encystment involves at least the synthesis of new cuticular structures. Morphological changes during cyst formation are more complex than those involved in tun formation. We analyzed more in detail encystment processes, comparing a semiterrestrial with a limnic species. Several inter-specific differences have been identified, other than the production of two types of cysts in the semiterrestrial species. Our analysis of life history traits of a laboratory reared strain of a soil tardigrade revealed a particular hatching phenology that involved the production of both subitaneous and resting eggs. The latter need a cue to hatch (dehydration followed by re-hydration). In addition, the evolutionary meaning of dormancy in tardigrade...|$|E
40|$|Cryptobiosis is a {{reversible}} {{biological process}} that allows some organisms to arrest their metabolic activity under adverse environmental conditions, favoring their survival (Keilin, 1959). Activity is resumed when favorable environmental conditions return. The process {{is complex and}} requires coordinated regulation of the arrest and subsequent activation of many cellular activities such as energetic metabolism, protein synthesis, DNA replication and transcription (Clegg, 2001). Despite the fact that cryptobiosis is a vital process for many important biological systems, such as plant seeds, the molecular bases of cryptobiosis are largely unknown. The branchiopodan crustacean Artemia franciscana is {{a model system that}} has frequently been used to study this phenomenon (Browne et al., 1991). Embryos of these animals can enter cryptobiosis at the gastrula stage and remain viable for years. The process involves complete dehydration of the embryos (anhydrobiosis), which are surrounded by a hard shell and are known as cysts (Drinkwater and Clegg, 1991). Reversion of cryptobiosis requires hydration of the embryos but also additional activation steps. For example, hydrated embryos can continue under cryptobiosis for several years under anoxia (anoxybiosis; Clegg, 1997). Subsequently, development continues through the formation of a swimming nauplius, which hatches from the cyst shell in approximately 24 ·h. Artemia cysts present undetectable metabolic activity under anhydrobiosis. Even in <b>anoxybiosis,</b> only a metabolic rate 50 · 000 times slower than the aerobic rate could be detected (Clegg, 1997). Several studies have demonstrated that intermediary metabolism and protein synthesis are reinitiated within minutes of cyst activation (Tate and Marshall, 1991). In these early stages of reactivation, protein synthesis is dependent on the existence of a large pool of stored mRNA (Amaldi et al., 1977). Reinitiation of protein synthesis is also possible because of the existence of large pools of stored ribosomes and accessory molecules, such as initiation and elongation factors (Sierra et al., 1974). In vitro experiments have shown that cyst extracts are not competent for protein synthesis, despite the presence of most of the necessary components, as mentioned above, and several activatio...|$|E
