40|$|Scope: <b>Arabinoxylan</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} consumed dietary fiber. Immunomodulation by <b>arabinoxylan</b> is documented but the mechanisms by which these immune-effects are accomplished are unknown. Methods and results: By applying reporter cell lines for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Dectin- 1, we demonstrated that <b>arabinoxylan</b> interacts with Dectin- 1 receptors and not with TLRs. <b>Arabinoxylan</b> activates Dectin- 1 to a similar magnitude as soluble β-glucans. Soluble β-glucans are known to inhibit the particulate β-glucan-induced activation of Dectin- 1. As <b>arabinoxylan</b> is also soluble, the inhibiting capacity of <b>arabinoxylan</b> on particulate β-glucan-activated Dectin- 1 cell lines was studied. It was found that this inhibition was similar to that of soluble β-glucan and was caused predominantly by inhibition of the Dectin- 1 A transcript variant. The Dectin- 1 inhibitory function of <b>arabinoxylan</b> was further confirmed in human dendritic cells that demonstrated reduced production of IL- 10 and TNF-α. The production of the antifungal cytokines IL- 4 and IL- 23 were increased in dendritic cells stimulated with <b>arabinoxylan</b> and particulate β-glucan. In contrast to soluble β-glucan, <b>arabinoxylan</b> did not enhance production of IL- 10, TNF-α, and IL- 23. Conclusion: <b>Arabinoxylan</b> activates Dectin- 1 and supports antifungal immune responses in human dendritic cells.

50|$|Laccases {{have the}} {{potential}} to cross link food polymers such as proteins and nonstarch polysaccharides in dough. In non starch polysaccharides, such as <b>arabinoxylans</b> (AX), laccase catalyzes the oxidative gelation of feruloylated <b>arabinoxylans</b> by dimerization of their ferulic esters. These cross links have been found to greatly increased the maximum resistance and decreased extensibility of the dough. The resistance was increased due to the crosslinking of AX via ferulic acid and resulting in a strong AX and gluten network. Although laccase is known to cross link AX, under the microscope {{it was found that the}} laccase also acted on the flour proteins. Oxidation of the ferulic acid on AX to form ferulic acid radicals increased the oxidation rate of free SH groups on the gluten proteins and thus influenced the formation of S-S bonds between gluten polymers. Laccase is also able to oxidize peptide bound tyrosine, but very poorly. Because of the increased strength of the dough, it showed irregular bubble formation during proofing. This was a result of the gas (carbon dioxide) becoming trapped within the crust and could not diffuse out (like it would have normally) and causing abnormal pore size. Resistance and extensibility was a function of dosage, but at very high dosage the dough showed contradictory results: maximum resistance was reduced drastically. The high dosage may have caused extreme changes in structure of dough, resulting in incomplete gluten formation. Another reason is that it may mimic overmixing, causing negative effects on gluten structure. Laccase treated dough had low stability over prolonged storage. The dough became softer and this is related to laccase mediation. The laccase mediated radical mechanism creates secondary reactions of FA-dervived radicals that result in breaking of covalent linkages in AX and weakening of the AX gel.|$|E

Oligosaccharide fragments released from plant and microbial polysaccharides, known as "oligosaccharins" (Albersheim and Darvill 1985), appear to regulate various biological functions in plants (see review by Darvill and Albersheim 1984). They elicit the accumulation of phyto-alexin in plant tissues, and they also display a hormone-like activity (Tran Thanh Van et al. 1985, Eberhard et al. 1989). For example, York et al. (1984) showed that a nonasaccharide (Glc 4 Xyl 3 GalFuc) from sycamore xylo-glucan effectively inhibited the auxin-induced growth of pea segments. The corresponding heptasaccharide (Glc 4 -Xyl 3), without the galactose and fucose residues, had no effect on growth. McDougall and Fry (1988) independ-ently confirmed this specific anti-auxin effect of the xyloglu-can nonasaccharide. Graminaceous monocot plants contain a small amount of xyloglucan, usually about 2 % by weight (see review by Dey and Brinson 1984). <b>Arabinoxylan</b> is the predominant hemicellulosic polysaccharide in cell walls of graminaceous monocots.

The acquired data revealed a closed pan-genome for this bifidobacterial species and furthermore facilitated {{the definition of}} the B. longum core genome. The comparative analysis also highlights differences in the potential metabolic abilities of all three sub-species. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis of the B. longum core genome indicated the existence of a novel B. longum subspecies. Characterisation of restriction-modification systems from two B. longum subsp. longum strains is described in Chapter 3. These defence mechanisms limit the uptake of genetic material, which was successfully demonstrated for some of the identified systems. When these systems were by-passed by methylation of DNA prior to the transformation procedure, the resulting transformation efficiency of both B. longum subsp. longum strains was increased to a level that allowed for the generation of mutants via homologous recombination. <b>Arabinoxylan</b> metabolism by B. longum subsp. longum NCIMB 8809 was investigated in Chapter 4 of this thesis. Transcriptome analysis allowed the identification of a number of genes involved in the degradation, uptake and utilisation of <b>arabinoxylan.</b> Biochemical analysis revealed that three of the identified genes encode arabinofuranosidase activity. Phenotypic assessment of a number of insertion mutants in genes identified by the transcriptome analysis revealed the essential role of two of these enzymes in <b>arabinoxylan</b> metabolism, and a third enzyme in the metabolism of debranched arabinan. Furthermore, this investigation revealed that B. longum subsp. longum NCIMB 8809 does not completely degrade <b>arabinoxylan,</b> but utilises the arabinose substitutions only, while leaving the xylan backbone untouched.

The non-cellulosic glucose was derived from residual starch-derived products persisting in BSG after mashing. The proteases did not cleave the hydroxycinnamate ester linkages present on the <b>arabinoxylan</b> backbone, and thus do not behave as feruloyl esterases. However, the material solubilised from spent grain by the proteases contained up to 198 µg bound ferulic acid/g extract, which represented 8. 6 % of the total ferulic acid present in BSG. These results suggest that a portion of water-extractable feruloylated <b>arabinoxylan</b> and starch is trapped within the BSG matrix by a proteinaceous barrier...|$|R
