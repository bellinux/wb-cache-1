40|$|Currently, {{a lot of}} {{research}} is devoted to system design, and little work is done on requirements analysis. Besides going from specification to design, one of our main objectives is to show how an <b>application</b> <b>problem</b> can be transformed into specifications. Working from the hardwaresoftware codesign perspective, a system is designed starting from an <b>application</b> <b>problem</b> itself, rather than the detailed behavioral specifications. Given an <b>application</b> <b>problem</b> specified as a directed acyclic graph of elementary problems, a hardware-software solution is derived such that the synthesized software, a parallel pseudoprogram, can be scheduled and executed on the synthesized hardware, a set of system-level parallel computer specifications, with heuristically optimal performance. This is known as system-level cosynthesis of application-oriented general-purpose parallel systems for which a novel methodology called Cosynthesis Methodology for Application-Oriented Parallel Systems (CMAPS), is presented. Since parallel programs and multiprocessor architectures are largely interdependent, CMAPS explores the relationship between hardware designs and software algorithms by interleaving the modeling phases and the synthesis phases of both hardware and software.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of location-aware devices has led to {{an increasing}} availability of trajectory data. As a result, researchers devoted their efforts to developing analysis methods including different data mining methods for trajectories. However, the research in this direction has so far produced mostly isolated studies and we still lack an integrated view of <b>problems</b> in <b>applications</b> of trajectory mining that were solved, the methods used to solve them, and applications using the obtained solutions. In this paper, we first discuss generic methods of trajectory mining and the relationships between them. Then, we discuss and classify <b>application</b> <b>problems</b> that were solved using trajectory data and relate them to the generic mining methods that were used and real world applications based on them. We classify trajectory-mining <b>application</b> <b>problems</b> under major problem groups based on how they are related. This classification of problems can guide researchers in identifying new <b>application</b> <b>problems.</b> The relationships between the methods together with the association between the <b>application</b> <b>problems</b> and mining methods can help researchers in identifying gaps between methods and inspire them to develop new methods.
