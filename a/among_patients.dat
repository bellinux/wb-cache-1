5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} <b>among</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing {{hyperbaric oxygen therapy}} is rare, and is influenced {{by a number of}} a factors: individual sensitivity and treatment protocol; and probably therapy indication and equipment used. A study by Welslau in 1996 reported 16 incidents out of a population of 107,264 patients (0.015%), while Hampson and Atik in 2003 found a rate of 0.03%. Yildiz, Ay and Qyrdedi, in a summary of 36,500 patient treatments between 1996 and 2003, reported only 3 oxygen toxicity incidents, giving a rate of 0.008%. A later review of over 80,000 patient treatments revealed an even lower rate: 0.0024%. The reduction in incidence may be partly due to use of a mask (rather than a hood) to deliver oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that <b>among</b> <b>patients</b> with congenital heart disease, women {{were less likely to be}} operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E

40|$|Most {{previous}} studies of mortality <b>among</b> mental <b>patients</b> dealt only with an in-patient population or with in-patient and out-patient populations of a mental hospital. A communitybased study was performed to analyze the mortality <b>among</b> mental <b>patients</b> in Kochi Prefecture. Schizophrenics and alcoholics were selected out of all mental patients for analysis. The relative risk of death among male and female schizophrenics and male alcoholics were {{two or three times}} higher than that among the general population. Especially, a younger group (30 - 49 years old) had higher relative risk than an older group (50 - 79 years old) <b>among</b> both <b>patients.</b> Therefore, to decrease the mortality <b>among</b> the mental <b>patients,</b> it is important to provide adequate health and medical care to younger <b>patients.</b> <b>Among</b> male and female schizophrenics, high relative risks were found for suicide, heart disease and accidents. The relative risk of death <b>among</b> the female <b>patients</b> was higher than that <b>among</b> the male <b>patients.</b> <b>Among</b> male alcoholics, high relative risks of death were observed for liver cirrhosis, suicide, heart disease, accidents, pneumonia and cerebral vascular diseases. In conclusion, the development of a community mental health care system, as well as rapid progress in psychiatric pharmaco-therapy, is necessary to decrease the mortality <b>among</b> mental <b>patients...</b>|$|R
