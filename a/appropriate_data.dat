However, it is possible to construct an entire separator hierarchy in linear time, by using the Lipton–Tarjan breadth-first layering approach and by using <b>appropriate</b> <b>data</b> structures to perform each partition step in sublinear time.|$|E

25|$|The Internet {{standards}} {{describe a}} framework {{known as the}} Internet protocol suite. This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols, originally documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123. The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the application layer, space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the client-server application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a peer-to-peer paradigm. Below this top layer, the transport layer connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with <b>appropriate</b> <b>data</b> exchange methods.|$|E
25|$|Sentinel node may simplify certain list operations, by {{ensuring}} that the next or previous nodes exist for every element, and that even empty lists {{have at least one}} node. One may also use a sentinel node {{at the end of the}} list, with an <b>appropriate</b> <b>data</b> field, to eliminate some end-of-list tests. For example, when scanning the list looking for a node with a given value x, setting the sentinel's data field to x makes it unnecessary to test for end-of-list inside the loop. Another example is the merging two sorted lists: if their sentinels have data fields set to +∞, the choice of the next output node does not need special handling for empty lists.|$|E
25|$|Bloomfield's work in Indo-European {{beyond his}} {{dissertation}} {{was limited to}} an article on palatal consonants in Sanskrit and one article on the Sanskrit grammatical tradition associated with Pāṇini, {{in addition to a}} number of book reviews. Bloomfield made extensive use of Indo-European materials to explain historical and comparative principles in both of his textbooks, An introduction to language (1914), and his seminal Language (1933). In his textbooks he selected Indo-European examples that supported the key Neogrammarian hypothesis of the regularity of sound change, and emphasized a sequence of steps essential to success in comparative work: (a) <b>appropriate</b> <b>data</b> in the form of texts which must be studied intensively and analysed; (b) application of the comparative method; (c) reconstruction of proto-forms. He further emphasized the importance of dialect studies where appropriate, and noted the significance of sociological factors such as prestige, and the impact of meaning. In addition to regular linguistic change, Bloomfield also allowed for borrowing and analogy.|$|E

They also discover that the data packet they retrieved from the Citadel contains codes {{that can be used to}} close the portal, and so traverse the countryside to deliver the packet to the resistance headquarters at White Forest. As they progress, it becomes evident that the Combine Advisors escaped the Citadel's destruction, and that remaining Combine forces are regrouping, albeit under occasional attacks by Vortigaunts. Aware of the resistance's plans to close the super portal, the Combine attack White Forest in force, but are repelled. The super portal is destroyed after the resistance launch a satellite containing the <b>appropriate</b> <b>data.</b> However, in the game's closing scenes, two Advisors attack Freeman, Alyx and Eli Vance, and kill Eli before being driven off by Dog.|$|E
500|$|Even et al. did not {{describe}} in detail how to implement this algorithm efficiently. They state only that by [...] "using <b>appropriate</b> <b>data</b> structures {{in order to}} find the implications of any decision", each step of the algorithm (other than the backtracking) can be performed quickly. However, some inputs may cause the algorithm to backtrack many times, each time performing many steps before backtracking, so its overall complexity may be nonlinear. To avoid this problem, they modify the algorithm so that, after reaching each choice point, it begins simultaneously testing both of the two assignments for the variable set at the choice point, spending equal numbers of steps on each of the two assignments. As soon as the test for one of these two assignments would create another choice point, the other test is stopped, so that at any stage of the algorithm there are only two branches of the backtracking tree that are still being tested. In this way, the total time spent performing the two tests for any variable is proportional to the number of variables and clauses of the input formula whose values are permanently assigned. As a result, the algorithm takes linear time in total.|$|E

2500|$|Numbers uses {{a hybrid}} {{approach}} {{to the creation of}} formulas, supporting the use of named data like Improv, but implementing them in-sheet like Excel. In basic operation, Numbers can be used just like Excel; data can be typed anywhere and formulas can be created by referring to the data by its cell. However, if the user types a header into the table, something one normally does as a matter of course, Numbers uses this to automatically construct a named range for the cells on that row or column. For instance, if the user types [...] "month" [...] into A1, and then types the names [...] "January", [...] "February", etc. into the cells below it, Numbers constructs a named range for the cells A2 through A13 and gives it the name [...] "month". The same is true when the user types in the figures for [...] "sales" [...] and [...] "income". The user can then write the averaging formula in a category-like text format, = total income / cars sold. The formula will find the <b>appropriate</b> <b>data</b> and calculate the results independent of the row. Like Improv, this formula does not refer to the physical location of the data in the sheet, so the sheet can be dramatically modified without causing the formula to fail.|$|E
