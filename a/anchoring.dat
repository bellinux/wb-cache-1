5|$|From {{this point}} Fort Glanville's {{significance}} declined rapidly. Fort Largs was equipped in 1889 with two 6inch breech-loading disappearing guns which outranged Glanville's armament. The decline was also linked {{to changes in}} Port Adelaide's maritime facilities and the consequent northward movement of anchored and berthed vessels. During the 1880s the Port River was deepened enabling large ships to sail up and berth, rather than the former practice of <b>anchoring</b> off-shore.|$|E

5|$|They did, however, {{have certain}} traits {{separating}} them from cartilaginous fishes, traits {{that would become}} pivotal {{in the evolution of}} terrestrial forms. With the exception of a pair of spiracles, the gills did not open singly to the exterior as they do in sharks; rather, they were encased in a gill chamber stiffened by membrane bones and covered by a bony operculum, with a single opening to the exterior. The cleithrum bone, forming the posterior margin of the gill chamber, also functioned as <b>anchoring</b> for the pectoral fins. The cartilaginous fishes do not have such an <b>anchoring</b> for the pectoral fins. This allowed for a movable joint {{at the base of the}} fins in the early bony fishes, and would later function in a weight bearing structure in tetrapods. As part of the overall armour of rhomboid cosmin scales, the skull had a full cover of dermal bone, constituting a skull roof over the otherwise shark-like cartilaginous inner cranium. Importantly, they also had a swim bladder/lung, a feature lacking in sharks and rays.|$|E

5|$|<b>Anchoring</b> near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet.

5|$|By late 2004, Brokaw {{had retired}} from his <b>anchoring</b> duties at NBC, ceding the reins to Brian Williams; Rather planned {{to step down}} in March 2005.

However, despite having almost always reported {{from the scene of}} any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.|$|E
30|$|Longitudinal spacing of <b>anchors</b> or <b>anchor</b> {{groups may}} have two effects {{depending}} on the distance between centerlines of <b>anchors.</b> For <b>anchors</b> that have a large longitudinal spacing, the strains in the sheet behind the first row of <b>anchors</b> dropped significantly. The second row of <b>anchors</b> did not contribute to force development in the FRP sheet until the debonding front had passed beyond the first row of <b>anchors.</b> At this point, the force in the sheet {{was developed by the}} first row of <b>anchors</b> and a combination of <b>anchor</b> and bond in the region surrounding the second row of <b>anchors.</b> The effect of <b>anchors</b> spaced widely apart in the longitudinal direction was to increase the ductility of the system without affecting the strength of the system significantly.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of minimum swing {{is related to}} non-extension. The main <b>anchor</b> point in a well constructed load-sharing <b>anchor</b> will neither extend nor swing {{in the event of}} an individual <b>anchor</b> failure. Reducing swing can be accomplished by minimizing the inner angle between individual <b>anchors,</b> and by increasing the number of individual <b>anchors.</b> An additional technique is to place a directional <b>anchor</b> a short distance below the main <b>anchor</b> point.|$|R

5|$|CPG is {{commonly}} defined by its pore size.

To make native CPG suitable for further processing, {{the surface of the}} material is treated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to give aminopropyl CPG. The aminopropyl arm may be further extended to result in long chain aminoalkyl (LCAA) CPG. The amino group is then used as an <b>anchoring</b> point for linkers suitable for oligonucleotide synthesis (see below).|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the evolution of the tetrapod limb from fins in lobe-finned fishes is related to expression of the HOXD13 gene or the loss of the proteins actinodin 1 and actinodin 2, which are involved in fish fin development.

5|$|The Arab fleet under Sulayman (often {{confused}} with the Caliph himself in the medieval sources) arrived on 1 September, <b>anchoring</b> at first near the Hebdomon. Two days later, Sulayman led his fleet into the Bosphorus and the various squadrons began <b>anchoring</b> by the European and Asian suburbs of the city: one part sailed south of Chalcedon to the harbours of Eutropios and Anthemios to watch over the southern entrance of the Bosporus, {{while the rest of}} the fleet sailed into the strait, passed by Constantinople and began making landfall on the coasts between Galata and Kleidion, cutting the Byzantine capital's communication with the Black Sea. But as the Arab fleet's rearguard, twenty heavy ships with 2,000 marines, was passing the city, the southerly wind stopped and then reversed, drifting them towards the city walls, where a Byzantine squadron attacked them with Greek fire. Theophanes reported that some went down with all hands, while others, burning, sailed down to the Princes' Islands of Oxeia and Plateia. The victory encouraged the Byzantines and dejected the Arabs, who, according to Theophanes, had originally intended to sail to the sea walls during the night and try to scale them using the ships' steering paddles. The same night, Leo drew up the chain between the city and Galata, closing the entrance to the Golden Horn. The Arab fleet became reluctant to engage the Byzantines, and withdrew to the safe harbour of Sosthenion further north on the European shore of the Bosporus.|$|E
