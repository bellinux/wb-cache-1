Drugs which have high membrane-permeability can readily 'leak' from the carrier, while optimization of in vivo stability can cause drug release by diffusion to be a slow and inefficient process.

This study reports on the flow topology inside w/o/w cores determined by means of micro-particle image velocimetry (μPIV) and compares it to the flow in single water-in-oil (w/o) microdroplets with equal sizes moving in a rectangular microchannel. The multiphase flow system employed in the study had a viscosity ratio, λ, between oil and aqueous phase of the order of unity (λ = 0. 8) and both single and compound droplets filled the channels. This configuration resulted in a weak recirculating flow inside the w/o single droplet: the measured flow field exhibited a uniform low velocity flow field in the central region surrounded by small regions of reversed flow near the channel walls. This flow topology was maintained in the inner cores of w/o/w double emulsions for intermediate capillary numbers (Ca) ranging from 10 - 3 to 10 - 2, and core morphologies varying from large plug to pancake cores. The core morphology affected the magnitude and distribution of the velocity in the droplets. The similarity in the flow pattern results from the fact that inner cores were located {{at the back of the}} outer droplet in such a way that inner and outer interfaces were in contact for half of core surface area and separated by a thin lubricating film...|$|R

40|$|Liposomes were {{prepared}} to incorporate large amounts of amphotericin B. BALB/c mice were challenged with Cryptococcus neoformans and given liposome-associated amphotericin B (AMBL) or amphotericin B-deoxycholate (AMBD) intravenously. Mice that were treated with AMBL survived longer and had lower tissue counts of cryptococ-ci than mice treated with AMBD or untreated control mice. The reduced acute toxicity of AMBL permitted much larger doses of amphotericin B to be given than were possible with AMBD. AMBL is a novel vehicle of administration that reduces toxicity and con-centrates the drug in the appropriate target organs. At present, the mortality from cryptoccal menin-gitis exceeds 20070, even when amphotericin B is administered with flucytosine [1 - 3]. Higher doses of either drug might better control the infection. However, drug toxicity prevents doses much above those presently recommended [2 - 5].

In particular, they are composed by phospholipid closed bilayers (lamellae), where the hydrophobic lipid chains are closed between two hydrophilic headgroups layers. The closed bilayer surrounds an <b>aqueous</b> <b>core,</b> thus allowing for the localization of lipophilic or hydrophilic drugs respectively [4, 5].|$|E
30|$|Another way {{to build}} Au NP-liposome complex is to place {{hydrophilic}} Au NPs within the <b>aqueous</b> <b>core</b> of liposomes. The lipids are first dissolved in organic solvent such as chloroform or methanol and form a thin lipid layer by a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. The lipid film is then reconstituted in an aqueous medium at temperature higher than the phase transition temperature of the phospholipid to form the liposomes. Hydrophilic Au NPs dispersed in the aqueous medium are passively encapsulated within the <b>aqueous</b> <b>core.</b> For example, we encapsulated citrate-coated 5  nm Au NPs within liposomes made of DPPC/MPPC/DSPE-PEG- 2000 [15]. Under cryo-TEM, most of Au NPs were either associated with the surface of liposomes or encapsulated within liposomes. By using Nd:YAG pulse laser with a pulse duration of 6  ns and an instantaneous power density approximately equals to 166.67  kW cm− 2 in each pulse duration, we exposed liposomes with a varying number of pulses in which the pulse frequency was fixed at 1  Hz. Liposomes with Au NPs released the entire drugs within minutes, while less than 40 % release was observed in the liposomes without Au NPs under the same conditions.|$|E
50|$|A {{liposome}} has an <b>aqueous</b> solution <b>core</b> {{surrounded by}} a hydrophobic membrane, {{in the form of}} a lipid bilayer; hydrophilic solutes dissolved in the core cannot readily pass through the bilayer. Hydrophobic chemicals associate with the bilayer. A liposome can be hence loaded with hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic molecules. To deliver the molecules to a site of action, the lipid bilayer can fuse with other bilayers such as the cell membrane, thus delivering the liposome contents; this is a complex and non-spontaneous event, however. By preparing liposomes in a solution of DNA or drugs (which would normally be unable to diffuse through the membrane) they can be (indiscriminately) delivered past the lipid bilayer, but are then typically distributed non-homogeneously.|$|R

Growth of metal particles is simulated to occur through intramicellar attachment of free metal atoms from an instantaneous reduction reaction and as well as by transfer and attachment through intermicellar exchange. Simulation results predict increase in particle size with <b>aqueous</b> <b>core</b> size and total aqueous phase volume, increase in particle number density with surfactant concentration at fixed aqueous phase to surfactant molar ratio, a minimum in average particle size as a function of salt concentration, and increase in particle size polydispersity with salt concentration and <b>aqueous</b> <b>core</b> size. Low values of the order of 10 (- 1) are found for the number ratio of particles to micelles. All these effects have been observed experimentally.

Alamethicin induces excitability phenomena in model membranes and has served as an excellent model for the study of voltage sensitive transmembrane channels. This review summarizes various aspects of the structural chemistry and membrane modifying properties of alamethicin and related Alb containing peptides. The presence of Aib residues in these sequences, constrains the polypeptides to 310 or agr-helical conformations.

40|$|A facile {{route for}} the {{preparation}} of water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double emulsions is described for three model oils, namely, n-dodecane, isopropyl myristate, and isononyl isononanoate, using fumed silica particles coated with poly(ethylene imine) (PEI). The surface wettability of such hybrid PEI/silica particles can be systematically adjusted by (i) increasing the adsorbed amount of PEI and (ii) addition of 1 -undecanal to the oil phase prior to homogenization. In the absence of this long-chain aldehyde, PEI/silica hybrid particles (PEI/silica mass ratio = 0. 50) produce o/w Pickering emulsions in all cases. In the presence of 1 -undecanal, this reagent reacts with the primary and secondary amine groups on the PEI chains via Schiff base chemistry, which can render the PEI/silica hybrid particles sufficiently hydrophobic to stabilize w/o Pickering emulsions at 20 °C. Gas chromatography, 1 H NMR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy provide compelling experimental evidence for this in situ surface reaction, while {{a significant increase in}} the water contact angle indicates markedly greater hydrophobic character for the PEI/silica hybrid particles. However, when PEI/silica hybrid particles are prepared using a relatively low adsorbed amount of PEI (PEI/silica mass ratio = 0. 075) only o/w Pickering emulsions are obtained, since the extent of surface modification achieved using this Schiff base chemistry is insufficient. Fluorescence microscopy and laser diffraction studies confirm that highly stable w/o/w double emulsions can be achieved for all three model oils. This is achieved by first homogenizing the relatively hydrophobic PEI/silica hybrid particles (PEI/silica mass ratio = 0. 50) with an oil containing 3 % 1 -undecanal to form an initial w/o emulsion, followed by further homogenization using an aqueous dispersion of relatively hydrophilic PEI/silica particles (PEI/silica mass ratio = 0. 075). Dye release from the internal <b>aqueous</b> <b>cores</b> into the <b>aqueous</b> continuous phase was monitored by visible absorption spectroscopy.
