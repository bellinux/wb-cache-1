Nearly half the women from Oughton's college senior class had gone on to graduate school. Oughton was assigned to Chichicastenango, at that time an isolated Indian market town. Oughton went to Guatemala as a liberal, believing that the problems could be identified and solutions devised and carried out. Eventually, she became a radical, and began to feel <b>an</b> <b>urgency</b> to change everything at once. While there, Oughton worked with young adults and older indigenous people to teach them to read. She helped local Catholic priests implement nutritional programs and edited a left-wing Guatemalan newspaper. Oughton lived in a small house with a dirt floor and a little outhouse. During this time, the questions with which she had struggled with came to a head. Oughton questioned what to do about poverty, social injustice, and revolution in the world.

A slump in sales in the Japanese market had begun at the end of the 1990s and continued into the early 2000s. Competition between Nintendo and Sony resulted in increasingly hardware-heavy consoles; however, the Nintendo 64 proved to be too cumbersome for developers and software suffered severely. After a year-long analysis conducted at Iwata's behest, Nintendo concluded that pushing hardware was not the most effective way to promote video games and decided to focus on software. A major internal reorganization of Nintendo took place in 2004, with Iwata consolidating various departments established under Yamauchi. He sought to promote collaborative work throughout the company. He later established a [...] "User Expansion Project" [...] in 2005 whereby employees normally not associated with game development would submit ideas for new games.|$|E

The pair formed a production company, Runway Films, and in January 2001 applied to Ireland's film board, Bord Scannán na hÉireann (BSÉ), for a development grant. Bartley and ÓBriain proposed a fly-on-the-wall documentary, a [...] "personal profile and intimate portrait" [...] of Chávez that would be [...] "broadly supportive" [...] of him. During their 2000 visit, the filmmakers had sensed that [...] "something genuinely was happening" [...] in Caracas, and felt <b>an</b> <b>urgency</b> to get the project underway; even so, it wasn't until April 2001 that BSÉ approved the £6000 (€9500) grant.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, Strange Days {{polarized}} film critics. Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and described it as [...] "a technical tour de force... The pacing is relentless, and the editing, by Howard Smith, creates <b>an</b> <b>urgency</b> and desperation". He also highlighted the film's astute use of SQUID technology, stating that [...] "Bigelow is able to exploit the idea of what is happening; she forces her audience {{to deal with the}} screen reality, instead of allowing us to process it as routine 'action.'" [...] In a mixed review, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] rating, concluding that Strange Days [...] "has a dazzling atmosphere of grunge futurism, but beneath its dark satire of audiovisual decadence lurks a naggingly conventional underworld thriller." [...] Edward Guthmann of San Francisco Chronicle criticized the film for failing to commentate its violence, saying that [...] "Bigelow's style is so visceral [...] that her movie reminds us of a snuff film, rather than a well-reasoned cautionary tale about our animal instincts." [...] New York magazine writer David Denby stated similar cons and called the rape scene [...] "the sickest sequence in modern movies".|$|E

Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because [...] "when you put a scene on the move, it's a... way of creating <b>an</b> <b>urgency</b> and an intensity". She noted the significance of [...] "the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6'2" [...] and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker described the show's [...] "cool, Fantastic Voyage–like special effects of patients' innards. I'll bet you didn't know that when your kidneys shut down they sound like bubble wrap popping." [...] "Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat" [...] of one patient, another critic observed, [...] "but up her nose and inside her brain and leg". Instead of relying primarily on computer-generated imagery, the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography. Many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow Laurie to physically improvise, revealing aspects of his character and the story.|$|E
