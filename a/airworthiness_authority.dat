50|$|The {{wing spar}} of the Model 18 was {{fabricated}} by welding an assembly of tubular steel. The {{configuration of the}} tubes in combination with drilled holes from aftermarket STC modifications {{on some of these}} aircraft have allowed the spar to become susceptible to corrosion and cracking while in service. This prompted the FAA to issue an Airworthiness Directive in 1975, mandating the fitting of a spar strap to some Model 18s. This led, in turn, to the retirement {{of a large number of}} STC-modified Model 18s when owners determined the aircraft were worth less than the cost of the modifications. The corrosion on unmodified spars was not a problem, and occurred due to the additional exposed surface area created through the STC hole-drilling process. Further requirements have been mandated by the FAA and other national airworthiness authorities, including regular removal of the spar strap to allow the strap to be checked for cracks and corrosion and the spar to be X-rayed. In Australia, the <b>airworthiness</b> <b>authority</b> has placed a life limit on the airframe, beyond which aircraft are not allowed to fly.|$|E

40|$|The <b>airworthiness</b> <b>authorities</b> (FAA, JAA, Transport Canada) will be {{releasing}} a draft {{rule in the}} 2006 timeframe concerning the operation of aircraft in a Supercooled Large Droplet (SLD) environment aloft. The draft rule will require aircraft manufacturers to demonstrate that their aircraft can operate safely in an SLD environment {{for a period of}} time to facilitate a safe exit from the condition. It is anticipated that aircraft manufacturers will require a capability to demonstrate compliance with this rule via experimental means (icing tunnels or tankers) and by analytical means (ice prediction codes). Since existing icing research facilities and analytical codes were not developed to account for SLD conditions, current engineering tools are not adequate to support compliance activities in SLD conditions. Therefore, existing capabilities need to be augmented to include SLD conditions. In response to this need, NASA and its partners conceived a strategy or Roadmap for developing experimental and analytical SLD simulation tools. Following review and refinement by the <b>airworthiness</b> <b>authorities</b> and other international research partners, this technical strategy has been crystallized into a project plan to guide the SLD Engineering Tool Development effort. This paper will provide a brief overview of the latest version of the project plan and technical rationale, and provide a status of selected SLD Engineering Tool Development research tasks which are currently underway...|$|R

Through the comparison of impingement results with the SLD experiment and LEWICE, it could be found that the empirical SLD model can deal with SLD impingement but still need many improvements...|$|E
40|$|The Air and Space Interoperability Council (ASIC) {{has adopted}} the European Defence Agency (EDA) process for interregulatory {{military}} <b>airworthiness</b> <b>authority</b> recognition. However, there are {{gaps in the}} application of this process to nations outside of the European Union. This paper proposes a model that can effectively map diverse technical airworthiness regulatory frameworks. This model, referred to as the Product-Behaviour-Process (PBP) Bow-Tie model, provides the systematic structure needed to represent and compare regulatory frameworks. The PBP Bow-Tie model identifies key points of difference that need to be addressed, during inter-agency recognition between the two regulatory authorities. With the intention to adopt global use of the EDA process, the proposed PBP Bow-Tie model {{can be used as a}} basis for the successful recognition of regulatory frameworks outside of the European Union. Iris plots produced from the implementation of this model are presented, and proposed as a suitable means of illustrating the outcome of an assessment, and of supporting the comparisons of results. A comparative analysis of the Australian Defence Force and New Zealand Defence Force airworthiness regulatory frameworks is used as a case study. The case study clearly illustrates the effectiveness of the model in discerning regulatory framework differences; moreover, it has offered an opportunity to explore the limitations of the Iris plot...|$|E
40|$|A {{framework}} {{supporting the}} systematic development of safety cases for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations {{in a broad}} range of civil and commercial applications is presented. The case study application is the use of UAS for disaster response. In those States where regulations do not preclude UAS operations altogether, approvals for UAS operations can be granted on a case-by-case basis contingent on the provision of a safety case acceptable to the relevant National <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Authority</b> (NAA). A safety case for UAS operations must show how the risks associated with the hazards have been managed to an acceptable level. The foundational components necessary for structuring and assessing these safety cases have not yet been proposed. Barrier-bow-tie models are used in this paper to structure the safety case for the two primary hazards of 1) a ground impact, and 2) a Mid-Air Collision (MAC). The models establish the set of Risk Control Variables (RCVs) available to reduce the risk. For the ground-impact risk model, seven RCVs are identified which in combination govern the probability of an accident. Similarly, ten RCVs are identified within the MAC model. The effectiveness of the RCVs and how they can implemented in terms of processes, policies, devices, practices, or other actions for each of the case-study applications are discussed. The framework presented can provide for the more systematic and consistent regulation of UAS through a "safety target" approach...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the flight deck and cabin fire and smoke incidents reported to the Canadian <b>airworthiness</b> <b>authorities</b> over a ten year span. The fire and smoke related diversions are categorized to identify areas where efforts could be increased to improve safety. The costs of diversions are estimated to identify areas where operators could reduce costs by seeking technologies {{to reduce the number of}} diversions without any impact on safety. Only twenty-eight investigation reports into fire and smoke incidents onboard aircraft have been published over the past three decades. These reports are not sufficient to identify areas where operators can reduce their operating costs. The Canadian <b>airworthiness</b> <b>authorities</b> received over 1, 000 smoke and fire incidents from the years 2001 to 2010, of which, over 680 reported fire and smoke in the flight deck and cabin compartments for various makes and models of aircraft. Some of these flight deck and cabin incidents were related to in-flight entertainment or galley systems that were remedied while in-flight and did not require a diversion in most cases. The remaining incidents were found to be related to ingestion of oil, de-icing fluids and equipment and electrical failures that, in many cases, prompted the pilots to declare an emergency and divert. This paper categorizes the flight deck and cabin related fire and smoke incidents to suggest specific areas for airframers and operators to focus their efforts in reducing flight diversions that will not only reduce costs, but improve safety.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{circumstance}} of rapid progress of Chinese aviation industry and ambitious development of aeronautical manufacturing projects, the current airworthiness certification system of Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), {{which includes the}} legislation frame, airworthiness regulations and organization chart, is introduced. Now the CAAC airworthiness certification system still faces {{the challenges of the}} industry progress. The vision of CAAC airworthiness certification system and the key elements of the system improvement are discussed. The main concern is how can the industry's resources be used for the <b>airworthiness</b> <b>authority</b> to fully take authority's responsibilities during certification. The traditional way to use industry's resources is implementing delegation system. With delegation system, the authority can directly use industry's resources. Considering that the delegation system depends on the individual decision-making, different behaviors of individuals as a designee and in organization are studied from the viewpoint of the organizational behavior. Requiring design organization to implement the design assurance system (DAS) is selected as another option, and the idea of organization certification is presented. After carefully comparing the advantages and disadvantages between product certification and organization certification, and also between designee system and design organization respectively, the methodology of using designee system and requiring design organization to implement the design assurance system (DAS), as the way of transferring from the solely aviation product certification to the certification of product and organization, is proposed. And the core requirements of DAS are concluded. Following the vision, key elements, and clear development methodology of CAAC airworthiness certification system, detailed actions to achieve the final goal are presented as well...|$|E
40|$|All {{civil and}} private {{aircraft}} {{are required to}} comply with the airworthiness standards set by their national <b>airworthiness</b> <b>authority</b> and throughout their operational life must be in a condition of safe operation. Aviation accident data shows that over 20 % of all fatal accidents in aviation are due to airworthiness issues, specifically aircraft mechanical failures. Ultimately {{it is the responsibility of}} each registered operator to ensure that their aircraft remain in a condition of safe operation, and this is done through both effective management of airworthiness activities and the effective programme governance of safety outcomes. Typically, the projects within these airworthiness management programmes are focused on acquiring, modifying and maintaining the aircraft as a capability supporting the business. Programme governance provides the structure through which the goals and objectives of airworthiness programmes are set along with the means of attaining them. Whilst the principal causes of failures in many programmes can be traced to inadequate programme governance, many of the failures in large-scale projects can have their root causes in the organizational culture and more specifically in the organizational processes related to decision-making. This paper examines the primary theme of project and programme-based enterprises, and introduces a model for measuring organizational culture in airworthiness management programmes using measures drawn from 211 respondents in Australian airline programmes. The paper describes the theoretical perspectives applied to modifying an original model to specifically focus it on measuring the organizational culture of programmes for managing airworthiness; identifying the most important factors needed to explain the relationship between the measures collected, and providing a description of the nature of these factors. The paper concludes by identifying a model that best describes the organizational culture data collected from seven airworthiness management programmes...|$|E
