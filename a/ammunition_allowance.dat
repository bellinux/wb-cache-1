500|$|The Webley Mk VI (.455) and Mk IV (.38/200) revolvers {{were still}} issued to British and Commonwealth Forces after the Second World War; {{there were now}} {{extensive}} stockpiles of the revolvers in military stores. An armourer stationed in West Germany recalled (admittedly tongue-in-cheek) {{that by the time}} they were officially retired in 1963, the <b>ammunition</b> <b>allowance</b> was [...] "two cartridges per man, per year." [...] This lack of ammunition was instrumental in keeping the Enfield and Webley revolvers in use so long: they were not wearing out because they were not being used.|$|E
50|$|This was the {{standard}} deck gun mounted {{forward of the}} conning tower in Type VII boats, although a few substituted a high-angle 8.8 cm SK C/30 naval gun for anti-aircraft defense. The SK C/35 was designed for the prototype VIIA boats of 1935 with a nominal <b>ammunition</b> <b>allowance</b> of 220 rounds. During the early war years, these guns were used to encourage surrender of independently routed merchant ships or to sink ships damaged by torpedoes. Some of these guns were later removed from U-boats for mounting aboard minesweepers and submarine chasers after unshielded deck guns proved impractical in action against Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships and escorted trade convoys.|$|E
40|$|Due to declining {{budgets and}} {{decreases}} in <b>ammunition</b> <b>allowances,</b> {{the opportunity to}} conduct live fire artillery training has been greatly reduced. The available simulation trainers are either outdated, require specialize contractor support, or are not deployable. FOPCSim was developed at no cost, is freely available, takes advantages of modern 3 D graphics, eliminates costly contractor support, and will run on laptops in support of deploying units. The simulator provides users with real-time performance feedback based on the Marine Corps Training and Readiness standards and was designed according to a cognitive task analysis of the call for fire procedures. To evaluate how well FOPCSim trains the call for fire procedures, an experiment was conducted at The Basic School in Quantico, Virginia. FOPCSim was used {{in place of the}} current simulation: Training Set, Fire Observation (TSFO) to evaluate its training effectiveness. By eliminating the overhead associated with most simulators, FOPCSim allows users to perform the call for fire procedures {{with a high degree of}} repetitiveness which is needed to train this type of task...|$|R
50|$|Both {{youth and}} adult {{shooters}} compete locally in the yearly National Open, {{a series of}} monthly shooting events. The top performing shooters are chosen for the National Training Pool which receives support like <b>ammunition,</b> an <b>allowance</b> or both. This is followed by monthly competitions, where shooters strive to achieve their event's Minimum Qualification Scores (MQS), currently pegged as the bronze score from the last Asian Games for selection to compete in international shooting events, starting with regional level {{events leading up to}} the Olympic Games.|$|R
25|$|Marcinko was {{the first}} {{commanding}} officer of this new unit. At the time there were two SEAL teams. Marcinko named the unit SEAL Team Six in order to confuse Soviet intelligence as {{to the number of}} actual SEAL teams in existence. The unit's plankowners (founding members) were hand-picked by Marcinko from throughout the UDT/SEAL community. SEAL Team Six became the U.S. Navy's premier counter-terrorist unit. It has been compared to the U.S. Army's Delta Force. Marcinko held the command of SEAL Team Six for three years, from 1980 to 1983, instead of the typical two-year command in the Navy at the time. SEAL Team Six was formally created in October 1980, and an intense, progressive work-up training program made the unit mission-ready just six months later. SEAL Team Six started with 75 shooters. According to Marcinko, the annual <b>ammunition</b> training <b>allowance</b> for the command was larger than that of the entire U.S. Marine Corps. The unit has virtually unlimited resources at its disposal.|$|R
5000|$|The Chitral Scouts {{were raised}} in 1903 in the princely state of Chitral on an {{initiative}} by the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon of Kedleston. The word Scouts meant that the force was a militia, {{not part of the}} British Indian Army, and it was under the command of a Chief of Chitral, but with a British attached officer. The objective of the force was to provide soldiers for the defense of India's North-West Frontier in case of invasion. The corps had an initial strength of 1,200 men [...] and aimed to recruit the trained cragsmen of Chitral, that is, experienced mountaineers. They were provided with Martini-Henry and Snider-Enfield rifels, ten rounds per rifle per Scout was the first line of <b>ammunition.</b> Pay and <b>allowances</b> of the Scouts were shared by the Political Agent and the Mehtar of Chitral Shuja ul-Mulk, who was also installed as the Honorary Commandant.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} DEVGRU are in SEAL Team Six, a unit {{created in the}} {{aftermath}} of Operation Eagle Claw. During the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, Richard Marcinko was one of two U.S. Navy representatives for a Joint Chiefs of Staff task force known as the TAT (Terrorist Action Team). The purpose of the TAT was to develop a plan to free the American hostages held in Iran. In the wake of the disaster at the Desert One base in Iran, the Navy saw the need for a full-time counter-terrorist unit, and tasked Marcinko with its design and development.Marcinko was the first commanding officer of this new unit.
