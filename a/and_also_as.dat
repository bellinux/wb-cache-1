These devices functioned as timekeeping devices <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> calendars.|$|E

5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E
5|$|He {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{publicly}} known judges thanks to his report on the Profumo Affair. He was noted for his bold judgments running counter to the law at the time.

Although appreciated for his role as 'the people's judge' and his support for the individual, Denning was also controversial for his campaign against the common law principle of precedent, and for comments he made regarding the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> Master of the Rolls for his conflict with the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|In 1559 {{shortly after}} he was {{appointed}} as archbishop, Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, named Joscelyn to a chaplainacy, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> his Latin language secretary. The following year Parker gave Joscelyn a prebend in Hereford, held until 1577. Unusually for the time, besides Greek and Latin Joscelyn was a scholar of Hebrew. From Parker's interest {{in the history of}} early Christianity, and to discover more information about the growth of papal power in the Middle Ages, Joscelyn also began to study Old English (a topic of interest to Parker), and helped the archbishop in his studies of the English pre-Norman Conquest church. Joscelyn helped discover lost manuscripts, obtained them for Parker, and prepared them for publication. Joscelyn also acquired manuscripts for himself, 40of which were written in Old English.|$|E
