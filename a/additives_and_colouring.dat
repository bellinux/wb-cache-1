40|$|In {{last few}} years, {{all over the}} world, food {{preservatives}} <b>and</b> favorable food <b>colour</b> are used in wide scale. However, their use in food still controversial. It causes and will cause severe tension to the consumers as the sensitivity of people to general health increases. This work was carried out to study the possible toxic effect of the interaction of one of food preservatives (sod. nitrite) {{and one of the}} most favorable food colour (sun-set yellow) on rates. To study the effect of this interaction, a mixture of 1 / 10 of the limited dose of Na No 3 and sun-set yellow was daily administered to rats. Other group was supplemented with royal jelly in combination with the mixture to evaluate its possible protective role during the course of experiment. Treatments were continued to 30 days, then half of the animals were sacrificed, the other half was left for 15 days after the last dose without any additional treatment (as a recovery period). The result can be summarized as follows: 1. Administration of sod. nitrite and sun-set yellow produced a significant decrease in percentage of body weigh, W. B. Cs, R. B. Cs, Hb, Hct, inorganic phosphorus, serum protein and serum albumin of rats. 2. A marked increase in respiration rate, serum glucose, T 3, T 4, calcium, -GT, LDH, CPK, alk. ph., serum cholesterol and (brain, liver and heart cholesterol) was recorded during treatment with the mixture. 3. Insignificant change in organ / b. wt., heart beat, rectal temperature, serum and tissue AST and ALT, serum acid phosphates, tissue proteins, serum and tissue total lipids muscle and kidney cholesterol and serum triglycerides was determined. 4. Administration of royal jelly and to some extent a recovery period ameliorated many hazards produced by using food additives. So, this study threw light on the bad behavior and its hazards of using food <b>additives</b> <b>and</b> food <b>colour</b> in the same time by our kids. It is also clear that royal jelly as a natural product nearly ameliorate these damage. So, it's advisable to administered royal jelly to children and prevent if possible the using of <b>additive</b> <b>and</b> synthetic <b>colour</b> in their food...|$|R
40|$|The colour {{fields that}} {{comprise}} New Ratio involve a tense {{relationship with the}} edge of the screen. The piece explores the move from the 4 : 3 screen ratio to 16 : 9, which is now effectively the standard for broadcast television and video. In the construction of New Ratio each colour was assigned a particular tone: white was attributed a standard 1 KHz test tone; the pitch of the tone attributed to blue was half that of the test tone; and each of the colours in between (in descending order of luminance) were attributed tones at intervals between these values. The video comprises two simple repeating sequences, which are fundamentally the same duration. However, one sequence includes an additional frame of black that throws them out of synch causing a phasing that effects different mixtures of <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> a range of tone combinations. In commenting on this piece Sean Cubitt has suggested that the equal mixture of <b>additive</b> <b>and</b> subtractive <b>colours</b> is effectively a 'democratisation of colour'...|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Albers' book [...] "Interaction of Color" [...] {{is widely}} {{influential}} but, according to Lee, {{has not received}} close critical attention. Lee undertakes to refute Albers' general claims about colour experience (that <b>colour</b> deceives continually) <b>and</b> to show that Albers' system of perceptual education is fundamentally misleading (Albers 'places practice before theory'). Four topics in Albers' account of colour are examined critically: <b>additive</b> <b>and</b> subtractive <b>colour</b> mixture, the tonal relations of colours, the Weber-Fechner Law and simultaneous contrast. In each case Albers is shown to have made fundamental errors with serious consequences for his general claims about <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> his pedagogical method. It is suggested that Albers' belief {{in the importance of}} colour deception is related to a misconception about aesthetic appreciation (that it depends upon some kind of confusion about visual perception). It is suggested that the scientific colour hypothesis of Edwin H. Land should be considered in lieu of the concepts held by Albers. Finally, there are implications for a reassessment of Albers' artworks that might follow a loss of faith in his colour concepts that seem to have been their foundation.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of the possible role of food <b>additives,</b> <b>and</b> specifically food <b>colours,</b> in elevating hyperactive behaviour in children has been long debated. There is now replicated evidence that the removal of food colours from the diet can make a small improvement in the behaviour of some children with ADHD. However, as yet the characteristics of those who benefit from this dietary change are unknown. Two studies from a research group at Southampton have extended this work to show that some children {{from the general population}} without ADHD show a similar benefit. The implications of these findings for those in CAMH services are discussed. They are considered alongside other forms of dietary treatment for ADHD {{such as the use of}} ‘few foods’ diet and omega- 3 fatty acids. <br/...|$|R

A variety of aluminium compounds are produced and used for different purposes, such as in water treatment, papermaking, fire retardant, fillers, food <b>additives,</b> <b>colours</b> <b>and</b> pharmaceuticals. Aluminium metal, mainly in the form of alloys with other metals, has many uses including in consumer appliances, food packaging and cookware.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} speculative {{avenues for}} constructing 3 -D ice models at various scales using traditional fabricating methods and modern CNC and rapid-prototyping techniques. Canada {{has a long}} history of using ice and snow for the construction of houses (igloo), ice palaces, and ice roads, in some cases dating back thousands of years. These techniques will be reviewed and evaluated for their suitability in modern uses. Computer-driven ice imaging and production methods present many opportunities and challenges. On the software side, we will speculate on how to use parametric software for form-finding, on the hardware side, we will reflect on how to translate these models into task planning for ice-building machines. Initially, these machines will be off-the-shelf robots and rapid prototyping machines, but we envision using specially constructed “cold irons,” “re-icing” robots, and automatic “ice bricklaying” machines. Vapour deposition on a substrate is envisioned as well. An overview of the design and adaptation of water delivery systems, through drip or spray nozzles, as well as methods of cooling water through natural or artificial means will be given.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} the {{importance}} of colour as a design, marketing and sales tool for industry is outlined {{to substantiate the need}} for a strong knowledge of <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> the need to work confidently <b>and</b> proficiently with <b>colour.</b> The chapter is designed in a manner that promotes knowledge development and inspiration, and for the more proactive reader a rich experience of colour can be gained by working through the chapter activities, initially at a computer and later with pigments (paints, dyes), which is highly encouraged and recommended. This workshop approach enables you to experiment with <b>colour</b> mixing <b>and</b> <b>colour</b> schemes to better appreciate <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> its application, without which the theories become just a concept; there really is little substitute for experimentation. A short history of colour is given that focuses on the building of the scientific underpinning of the most predominant theories of colour used today in relation to textile-based products (fashion).

These two sets {{are referred to as}} the CE and QM sets, where the CE set was designed for large numbers of markers and the QM set was designed for large numbers of individuals.
