40|$|The {{analysis}} of shear strength of only longitudinally reinforced concrete beams, {{in which a}} constant shear force acts throughout the shear span, has lead to a shear strength formula predicting the experimental behavior in a more accurate and uniform way than other Codes or authors expressions. On {{the basis of the}} shear strength expression found for beams without stirrups, a formula able to predict the shear strength of NSC and HSC beams with transverse reinforcement is here proposed. It is obtained by adding the resisting contribution provided by concrete to that provided by stirrups. The shear strength contribution due to stirrups inclusion takes into account not only the truss mechanism, but also the interaction between the truss action and the beam action. The mutual influence of the truss action on beam and <b>arch</b> <b>strength</b> contribution is here considered. The reliability of the proposed formula has been verified using 1326 experimental results found in the literature. The here provided expression has found to predict the experimental shear behavior in a more accurate and uniform way than other Codes formulas or analytical expressions recently proposed by other authors...|$|E
40|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of discrete solids is {{their ability to}} form arches. These mechanically stable structures alter the isotropy of granular packings and can arrest the motion of grains when, for example, they ﬂow through a bottleneck. Breaking arches {{can be achieved by}} means of an external vibration, which effectively eliminates clogging. Indeed, these phenomena and procedures are quite common in industrial applications. Nevertheless, there are not rigorous, well founded criteria to determine the most efﬁcient way to break arches and restore the ﬂow of grains. This happens in part because it is not known which are the relevant characteristics that boost the <b>arch</b> <b>strength.</b> In the experiment presented here, we have carried out a statistical analysis of the arches that block the exit oriﬁce {{at the bottom of a}} two dimensional silo, and described their geometrical properties. We then submit the silo to an external vibration. We ﬁnd that the larger the outlet size, the weaker the arches that clog it. This dependence is just the outcome of a more complicated process that involves geometrical defects inthe arch. The defects a are quantitatively deﬁned in terms of contact angles and we show that this is a key factor regarding the endurance of arches...|$|E

Research object of the final thesis is the Public Library of Druskininkai municipality, since the building is designed by using glued wood arch constructional elements. The aim of Master’s thesis is to evaluate the strength of constructional element (half arch) of the Public Library of Druskininkai municipality and to assess possible solutions to increase the strength indicator. Final thesis describes the purpose and usability of three-hinged arch, constructional analysis of Public Library as a separate building and methodology of <b>arch</b> <b>strength.</b> After analytical research the followings tasks were carried out: analyzed possible solutions of how to evenly spread the tension {{according to the length}} of constructional element (half arch), defined impact of thickness and modulus of elasticity of constructional elements towards the rigidity and strength of beam, evaluated and selected appropriate measurements of reinforcements in order to have more even spread of tension, calculated bearing capacity of reinforced constructional element.

40|$|Canadian {{hard rock}} mine {{extraction}} practices have commonly created shallow stopes, 12 % {{of which have}} caved to surface, from instabilities originating from stope hangingwalls, crowns or footwalls. To date, however, mine operators have applied few of the available data gathering and design tools {{to strike a balance}} between maximum economic excavation dimension and stope viability. The preference has been to use personal mining experience. Several common rock mass environments are surveyed as well as the various ways in which shallow stopes have failed. It has been found that these rock masses develop gravity-induced movement in the form of plug failures, ravelling of rock blocks, strata failures, chimneying disintegration, and rock mass block caving. New failure-specific analytical equations are developed here for these common failure mechanisms. They address the mechanics of the failure process and incorporate the capability to arrive at the ultimate failure outline, for comparison to the location of the bedrock surface. This research has shown that: plug failures occur along steep, uninterrupted discontinuities bounding large blocks. Plug failure potential reduces substantially with confining compressive stress, discontinuity inclination, the absence of low friction surfaces and shearing of intact rock interrupting the discontinuity. Ravelling requires little peripheral confining stress for stabilization and prevention of block falls or slides. However, inherent conditions such as shallow dipping or vertically dipping joints can cause block falls to develop to surface. Low confining stresses, resulting from multiple stope extraction in orthogonal horizontal directions, would offer conditions suitable for plug and ravelling failures. Strata failures are caused by excessive stope spans, but the limited loading received from above strata is such, that the failure cavity created is of limited vertical extent, some 25 % of the stope width. Chimneying disintegration occurs in weak rock masses with low cohesion, over narrow openings that can be as deep as 275 m. The onset of chimneying disintegration can be created by compressive stresses, but develops as a result of mobilization of the rock mass by gravity in active shear. Block caving requires large spans to develop, and stabilizing could be overcome from arching stresses overcoming bulk <b>arching</b> <b>strength.</b> Controlling instability elements are tabulated for these failure mechanisms. A limit equilibrium correlation between span and cohesion for chimneying disintegration is presented, and the controlling limits between the occurrence of chimneying disintegration and block caving is discussed. Ravelling and chimneying disintegration are the most expected failure mechanisms for shallow stopes of hard rock mines. Although failure of the shallow stope may start around its periphery, stope failure to surface would likely occur in or close to the surface crown pillar. Although the analytical equations developed require input of in situ stresses defined by numerical modelling in order to yield a precise answer, conventional numerical modelling or empirical methods are shown to be unable to predict stope failures as the analytical equations have. A step-by-step stability analysis procedure is presented, incorporating rockmass environment, expected failure mechanism(s), and applicable data gathering and anlytical methods.

30|$|Since {{the time}} bolting was {{determined}} to be an effective method for securing rocks surrounding a roadway, a number of studies examined the performance of rock bolts both in the laboratory and in the field (Aydan 1989; Farmer 1975; Peng and Tang 1984; Stille et al. 1989; Sun 1984; Kang et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015). Analytical studies were also conducted to examine the influence of relevant parameters and to understand the interaction between the rock and the bolt (Dight 1982; Indraratna and Kaiser 1990; Holmberg 1991; Li and Stillborg 1999; Bobet 2002; Cai et al. 2004; Carranza-Torres 2009; Bobet and Einstein 2011). And there have been many investigations on bolting mechanisms, ranging from the initial suspension theory to the subsequent composite beam theory, compound <b>arch</b> theory, <b>strength</b> hardening theory and maximum horizontal principal stress theory (Hou and Gou 2000; Mark et al. 2007), and loosing-circle theory of surrounding rocks (Dong et al. 1994). The conclusion that bolting improves the load-bearing capability of the surrounding rock has been stated and confirmed in many studies. For roadways supported by bolts in the rock, different support structures for the surrounding rock have been suggested: e.g., the surrounding rock bearing circle proposed by Kang (1996, 1997), the internal and external bearing circle proposed by Li (2008), the support structure inside the roadway’s coal roof proposed by Zhang and Li (1999), the compound arch bearing structure by Yu et al. (2010), and reinforced rock by Song and Mu (1997), among others (Wu and Chai 1997; Zhu et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2015; Cheng et al. 2015).However, few studies have investigated the load-bearing characteristics of a structure formed from both bolts and the surrounding rocks and the effect of the structure on the overall load-bearing capacity of the surrounding rocks. There are even fewer studies considering the effect of the bolt parameters on the load-bearing characteristics of such a structure.|$|R

However, {{there is little evidence}} from investigation of the possible correlation of arch height with ankle muscle strength and physical performance measures. Sixty-seven participants took part in this study. Arch height index (AHI) was assessed and categorized using a 3 -dimension foot scanner. Ankle muscle strength was measured employing a dynamometer. Physical performance measures including agility, force and proprioception were randomly tested. Compared to the medium AHI, the high AHI had lower plantarflexion and inversion peak torque. The high AHI also had lower peak torque per body weight value for plantarflexion and inversion at 120 °/s (P = 0. 026 and 0. 006, respectively), and dorsiflexion at 30 °/s (P = 0. 042). No significant ankle muscle strength difference was observed between the low and medium AHI. Additionally, AHI was negatively correlated with eversion and inversion peak torque at 120 °/s, and negatively associated with plantarflexion, eversion and inversion peak torque per body weight at both 30 °/s and 120 °/s (r ranged from - 0. 26 to - 0. 36, P values < 0. 050). However, no significant relationship was found between arch height and physical performance measures. The results showed that high arches had lower ankle muscle <b>strength</b> while low <b>arches</b> exhibited greater ankle muscle <b>strength.</b> <b>Arch</b> height was negatively associated with ankle muscle strength but not related to physical performance.

To date, there has been no comprehensive assessment of foot structure and function in these highly active and HB children/adolescents and link with overuse injuries. PURPOSE: The aim of this research is to assess foot structure, foot function, injury and physical activity levels in Kenyan children and adolescents who are HB compared with those who were habitually shod (HS). METHODS: Foot structure, function, injury prevalence, and physical activity levels were studied using two studies with equal numbers of HS and HB. HS and HB children and adolescents were matched for age, sex, and body mass. Foot <b>arch</b> characteristics, foot <b>strength,</b> and lower-limb injury prevalence were investigated in Study 1 (n = 76). Heel bone stiffness, Achilles tendon moment arm length and physical activity levels in Study 2 (n= 62). Foot muscle strength was measured using a strength device TKK 3360 and heel bone stiffness by bone ultrasonometry. The moment arm length of the Achilles tendon was estimated from photographs and physical activity was assessed using questionnaires and accelerometers. RESULTS: Foot shortening strength was greater in HB (4. 8 ± 1. 9 kg vs 3. 5 ± 1. 8 kg, P < 0. 01). Navicular drop was greater in HB (0. 53 ± 0. 32 cm vs 0. 39 ± 0. 19 cm, P < 0. 05). Calcaneus stiffness index was greater (right 113. 5 ± 17. 1 vs 100. 5 ± 116. 8, P < 0. 01 left 109. 8 ± 15. 7 vs 101. 7 ± 18. 7, P < 0. 05) and Achilles tendon moment arm shorter in HB (right, 3. 4 ± 0. 4 vs 3. 6 ± 0. 4 cm, P < 0. 05; left, 3. 4 ± 0. 5 vs 3. 7 ± 0. 4 cm, P < 0. 01). Lower-limb injury prevalence was 8 % in HB and 61 % in HS. HB subjects spent more time engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity (60 ± 26 min·d vs 31 ± 13 min·d; P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences observed in foot parameters, injury prevalence and general foot health between HB and HS suggest that footwear conditions may impact on foot structure and function and general foot health.
