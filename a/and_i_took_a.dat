2500|$|The {{incident}} received {{criticism from}} many boxing experts, with some {{comparing it to}} the controversial Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson bout from 1996 and the Western Australian Professional Combat Sports Commission (WAPCSC) launched an enquiry into the fight. Green contributed extensively to the enquiry, and sat with the commission for three hours. The outcome of the WAPCSC investigation labelled the fight a [...] "sham", fined Briggs , and cleared Green of any wrongdoing. In March 2012 Briggs stated (via Facebook): [...] "In my appeal against the decision that my fight with Danny Green was fixed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> dive (the decision) has been OVERTURNED {{in a court of}} law by three High Court judges." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{for many}} years Mona had made it a {{practice}} to enroll in occasional college-level courses, {{it was in the}} mid 1960s that she completed both a bachelor’s and a master's degree from Queens College. [...] She then taught remedial reading at two Queens elementary schools for eight years. [...] As she recalled, “Every time I would feel mentally stagnant, I would just go take a course at Hunter or [...] [...] [...] any school downtown. And I loved anthropology, I took a lot of courses in that; I loved psychology <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> lot of courses in that; anything that I felt like that I wanted to do. So it was not until later years that one of the teachers at Queens College talked me into matriculating. And I’m glad he did because when I did graduate, I graduated magna cum laude.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Firing and {{fighting}} began April 14 between Moslems and Armenians, {{which resulted in}} a number of casualties on both sides... the next morning April 15, a fresh outburst of smoke near the girls' school showed that we were threatened by fire...Mr. Maurer <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> crowbar and an axe to the destroy the wooden porches, shutters and stairways of the houses between the fires and the girls' school...When I first climbed to the roofs near the flames armed Moslems appeared...When they understood that I was not firing on them, but had come to work against the flames, they lowered their rifles and assured me with many pledges that I might go unmolested...we repeatedly begged some Armenian young men who were lurking around the street corners shielded from the Moslem fire to put away their arms and come and save the school building... we came back to the school and asked for volunteers, Mr. Rogers came at once... We had thus worked a considerable time without being harmed by the Moslems when the Armenians {{on the other end of}} the street commenced firing on the houses where the looters were at work. Suddenly two shots rang out not more than eight yards from where we were working. Mr. Rogers...was mortally wounded...The other bullet hit Mr. Maurer...Immediately after these two shots several other bullets from the Moslems, who had fired them, whizzed past me...Both men passed peacefully away. They died as good soldiers of Jesus Christ.|$|E

"Around 1980, I {{think it}} was, NIST NBS really {{decided it was}} {{focusing}} more on support for industry and not astrophysics[...] [...]I didn’t see that my career was going to thrive <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to come NBS headquarters in Gaithersburg, Maryland" ...|$|R

60|$|I now open'd {{a little}} stationer's shop. I had in it blanks of all sorts, the correctest that ever appear'd among us, being {{assisted}} in that by my friend Breintnal.

60|$|To him I was <b>a</b> man established, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> absurd {{pleasure}} in playing {{the part of}} Successful Author.

6000|$|... "Just {{come down}} on the train," [...] he replied, in answer to my question. [...] "Been making a call on Massanet & Dare, the stationers and booksellers.

5000|$|During {{a tour of}} {{southern}} Utah Brigham Young, along with some 60 other Saints visited the massacre site in May 1861. After viewing the inscription on the cross, Wilford Woodruff recorded President Young as saying “it should be vengeance is mine <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> little.” The cross was then torn down and the rocks of the cairn were dismantled, leaving little of the original marker. Sally Denton, in her book, records Young as saying [...] "Vengeance is mine, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> little" [...] before having the monument torn down.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah, I {{could do}} that a {{thousand}} times in succession," [...] answered the youth given to exaggeration, coolly. [...] "Why, don't you know that one day there were six Tom cats on a fence <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> snowball and hit 'em all?" ...|$|E
60|$|I reflected. I had {{a letter}} in my pocket to Monsieur de Saint-Gre, the sum was not large, and the act of Monsieur Auguste de Saint-Gre in every light was detestable. A rising anger decided me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> wallet from my pocket.|$|E
