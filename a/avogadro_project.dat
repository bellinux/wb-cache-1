5|$|When {{the scale}} of the {{divergence}} between the IPK and national kilogram prototypes was reported in 2005, a debate arose on how best to redefine the kilogram – should the kilogram be defined in terms of the mass of the silicon-28 atom or should it be determined using the watt balance? The mass of a silicon atom could be determined using the <b>Avogadro</b> <b>project</b> and using Avogadro's number be linked directly to the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's <b>Avogadro</b> <b>project,</b> would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E
500|$|Independently of this drift {{having been}} identified, the <b>Avogadro</b> <b>project</b> and {{development}} of the Watt balance promised methods of indirectly measuring mass with a very high precision. [...] These projects provided tools that would enable alternative means of redefining the kilogram.|$|E
500|$|Experiments {{are being}} {{performed}} on the <b>Avogadro</b> <b>Project's</b> silicon spheres to determine whether their masses are most stable when stored in a vacuum, a partial vacuum, or ambient pressure. However, no technical means currently exist to prove a long-term stability any better {{than that of the}} IPK's because the most sensitive and accurate measurements of mass are made with dual-pan balances like the BIPM's FB2 flexure-strip balance (see External links, below). Balances can only compare the mass of a silicon sphere to that of a reference mass. Given the latest understanding of the lack of long-term mass stability with the IPK and its replicas, there is no known, perfectly stable mass artifact to compare against. Single-pan scales, which measure weight relative to an invariant of nature, are not precise to the necessary long-term uncertainty of [...] parts per billion. Another issue to be overcome is that silicon oxidizes and forms a thin layer (equivalent to [...] silicon atoms) of silicon dioxide (quartz) and silicon monoxide. This layer slightly increases the mass of the sphere, an effect that must be accounted for when polishing the sphere to its finished dimension. Oxidation is not an issue with platinum and iridium, both of which are noble metals that are roughly as cathodic as oxygen and therefore don't oxidize unless coaxed {{to do so in the}} laboratory. The presence of the thin oxide layer on a silicon-sphere mass prototype places additional restrictions on the procedures that might be suitable to clean it to avoid changing the layer's thickness or oxide stoichiometry.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the {{framework}} of the <b>Avogadro</b> <b>project,</b> isotopically enriched 28 Si spheres had been manufactured as artifacts for the assessment of various physical quantities including the sphere volume which finally leads to a very accurate determination of the Avogadro constant NA. The Avogadro constant is an important input datum for the redefinition of the unit of mass, the kilogram, on the basis of fundamental physical constants. During the recent measurement campaign, it has turned out that one of the main contributions to the overall uncertainty of NA is the sphericity error and consequently the interferometric volume measurement. Since chemical–mechanical polishing has reached its limits with respect to form accuracy due to the sensitivity of material removal rate to crystal orientation, it has been proposed to use ion beam figuring for further reduction of sphericity error from currently 50 nm PV to values < 10 nm PV. In this paper, a new concept and realization of a multi-axis ion beam figuring machine dedicated for deterministic correction of silicon spheres is presented. Aspects of long term tool stability and alignment procedures in order to relate the ion beam footprint to the sphere surface are covered. Furthermore, a process dwell time calculation and tool path generation method dedicated for spheres manufacturing will be presented and discussed...|$|E
