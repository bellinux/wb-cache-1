40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> flower {{extracts}} of Calendula officinalis on total protein and total carbohydrate {{contents of the}} hemolymph, midgut and midgut content of Spodoptera litura larvae were studied. Among the <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> flower extracts tested in the hemolymph, the highest reduction in protein content of the larvae was caused by chloroform <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> benzene flower extracts whereas in the midgut, chloroform <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> petroleum ether flower extracts reduced the protein to the maximum. Aqueous <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> flower extracts had least activity in both hemolymph and midgut. However, in the midgut content, methanol <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> chloroform flower showed maximum reduction in protein content <b>and</b> petroleum ether <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> methanol flower showed least reduction. Total carbohydrate content was reduced by chloroform <b>leaf,</b> <b>and</b> petroleum ether flower extracts in hemolymph with least reduction in benzene <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> flower extracts treated larvae. In the midgut, chloroform <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> flower extract caused maximum reduction whereas in the midgut content, methanol <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> petroleum ether flower extracts showed reduction in carbohydrate content, while aqueous <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> flower extracts showed an increase in carbohydrate content in midgut content contrary to midgut. However, when compared to control, the protein and carbohydrate content were reduced in all the tissues of treated larvae irrespective of the extracts tested. These results suggest that Calendula extracts affect the nutritional status of Spodoptera litura larvae. Â© JBiopest...|$|R

5|$|As some {{scientists}} such as Dlussky believed Sphecomyrma {{was not an}} ant, {{they thought it was}} solitary and semi-communal. Further statements include that the morphology of sphecomyrmines would prevent workers from transporting larvae or engaging in trophallaxis (transfer of food between two nestmates) with them. However, wasps with antennal proportions similar to sphecomyrmines are able to feed their own larvae. The presence of the metapleural gland also shows that Sphecomyrma was a eusocial (the highest level of organisation of animal sociality) insect and lived in colonies, as this gland possibly acts as a disinfectant in order to nest in soil <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> litter without infecting the colony's nestmates and brood. The large eyes, long appendages and thin exoskeleton suggests that workers were epigaeic, where they foraged above ground and out in the open. Fossil evidence further suggests that they foraged socially with other worker ants.|$|E

5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by auxins, or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} tropism of plant growth, induces the targeting of a class of transcription factor repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E
5|$|Records {{of visits}} by pollinators exist {{for only a}} few species, but most of these suggest that the species are pollinated by insects. Flowers of A.chiribogensis produce small {{quantities}} of nectar, but lack a scent. Fruit flies (Drosophilidae), fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae, Sciaridae), midges (Cecidomyiidae, Ceratopogonidae) and micromoths (Lepidoptera) were recorded visiting these flowers, but bees and hover flies were not. Aiphanes eggersii was thought to be pollinated by bees and possibly by wind. Fruit flies (Drosophilidae), hover flies (Syrphidae), biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> beetles (Chrysomelidae) were recorded visiting the flowers of A.erinacea, but bees were not. Aiphanes horrida was reportedly pollinated by wind, bees (Meliponidae), weevils (Curculionidae) and bugs (Hemiptera). Flies and weevils were observed on the flowers of A.simplex.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: dyslipidemia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} risk factors that cause arteriosclerosis in the coronary artery. The aim of this study was to investigate olive <b>and</b> mulberry <b>leaf,</b> fenugreek seed– dyethylether extract on plasma lipid levels and arteriosclerosis plaques. Materials & Methods: 45 white male rabbits divided into nine groups of five at 22 ± 1 C. The first and second group were given regular and high cholesterol (% 1) diet respectively. The seven remaining groups were given cholesterol diet as well as olive <b>and</b> mulberry <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> fenugreek seed extract (in the form of single and compound) during 60 days. Before and after two months plasma lipid levels and direct blood pressure were measured, and also the wall of aorta was studied from view point of presence and absence of arteriosclerosis plaques). Findings: Results showed that olive <b>and</b> mulberry <b>leaf</b> extract significantly decreased total cholesterol and LDL, but fenugreek seed extract had no effect. However, fenugreek seed extract together with olive <b>and</b> mulberry <b>leaf</b> extract potentate their effects on the total cholesterol <b>and</b> LDL. Olive <b>leaf</b> extract enhanced HDL-c and decreased triglycerid, but mulberry <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> fenugreek seed extract had no effect. Also olive <b>and</b> mulberry <b>leaf</b> seed extract prevented rapid from arteriosclerosis plaques and their effects all together was a little potent. None of the extracts influenced the normal blood pressure. Conclusion: According to the results adjunct use of olive <b>and</b> mulberry <b>leaf</b> extract has hypocholesterolemic and antiatherosclerosis properties, but no effect on the normal blood pressure...|$|R

A bird that was being harassed by three scarlet robins (Petroica boodang) was seen to suddenly turn on them and catch and eat one.

5|$|The first {{reaction}} of the host tree is traced to the adult wasp and occurs after 10 to 14 days. A phytotoxic secretion of the wasp impairs metabolism in the shoots and needles, causing loss of water balance. The result is brown coloration of the needles <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> drop. As with many other wood pests, fine resin drops in wasp boreholes {{are found in the}} central trunk. Attacked pines tend to develop flagging. Tip dieback begins with the needles becoming chlorotic and changing from green to yellowish-red, finally turning completely brown over a three- to six-month period. The wasp bores 1/8- to 3/8-inch-diameter holes in the tree. Unstressed trees may be attacked uniformly along the main stem, while trees with low osmotic phloem pressure are preferentially attacked, with denser clusters of boreholes.|$|E
