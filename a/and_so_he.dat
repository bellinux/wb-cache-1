5|$|His new {{alphabet}} closely resembled an 1853 {{publication of}} Isaac Pitman, containing only 33 letters. However, at this point, Young was still enamored {{with the original}} Deseret alphabet, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> rejected the proposal and Watt continued to publicly promote the alphabet {{as part of his}} job despite his reservations.|$|E
5|$|Mourn for {{the loss}} of a king, {{descendant}} of great Heracles.Herodotus tells us that Leonidas, in line with the prophecy, was convinced he was going to certain death since his forces were not adequate for a victory, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> selected only Spartans with living sons.|$|E

5|$|A New Zealander, Aaron Saxton's {{parents were}} Scientologists. Saxton's father {{committed}} suicide {{when he was}} 14, and this {{had a significant impact}} on him. At age 15 he joined the Scientology group called the Sea Org, an elite unit within the organisation. After joining Scientology staff, Saxton moved to work with the organisation in Sydney, Australia. Saxton's mother signed over guardianship of her son to Scientology when he was 16 years old. Saxton was assigned to become a security officer for the organisation. According to Saxton staff in Scientology were not given sufficient drugs or medical attention, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> removed his own teeth without usage of medication for pain.|$|E
5|$|Although {{supplies}} {{had been}} left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there were not the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed {{up the hill to}} meet him.|$|E
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 15 December, {{the main body of}} the High Seas Fleet {{encountered}} British destroyers. Fearing the prospect of a nighttime torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat. Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's reversal, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> continued with the bombardment. Upon reaching the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into two groups. Derfflinger and Von der Tann went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby while Seydlitz, Moltke, and Blücher went north to shell Hartlepool. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward.|$|E
5|$|However, the Treaty of Versailles {{is signed}} {{the very day}} he prepares to leave, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> is forced to abort his mission, much to his dismay. He returns to the United States and works {{in a number of}} professions — steel mill worker, bank teller, farm hand, and {{disarmament}} lobbyist — but his unique stature among mortal men forever brings him grief. He eventually offers his services to a noted history professor preparing a Mayan archaeological dig and travels with the group to the Yucatan Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is {{attributed}} {{with the power}} of working miracles. In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life. While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman whose husband is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true. Tulsidas said that the word has passed his lips <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to close their eyes and uttered the name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.|$|E
60|$|After all, Edgar Caswall was {{a gentleman}} by custom <b>and</b> habit, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> rose to the occasion.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Vice Admiral Friedrich von Pöck, {{the head of}} the Marinesektion (Admiralty), ordered four torpedo cruisers. Pöck was unable to secure funding for new ironclads, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> turned to less {{expensive}} vessels to modernize the fleet. The ships would fill several roles, including scouting for the ironclad fleet and leading flotillas of torpedo boats. The first three of the new vesselsthe were built to the same basic design.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1912, he started {{training}} for the Olympics. He had confined his efforts to jumps, hurdles and shot-puts, but now added pole vaulting, javelin, discus, hammer and 56lb weight. In the Olympic trials held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability stood out in all these events <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> riveted a claim to {{a place on the}} team that went to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Kashyapa married Manasa to sage Jaratkaru, {{who agreed}} to marry her on the {{condition}} that he would leave her if she disobeyed him. Once, when Jaratkaru was awakened by Manasa, he became upset with her because she awakened him too late for worship, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> deserted her. On the request of the great Hindu gods, Jaratkaru returned to Manasa and she gave birth to Astika, their son.|$|E

5|$|On 6 July 1553, {{at the age}} of 15, Edward VI {{died from}} a lung infection, {{possibly}} tuberculosis. He did not want the crown to go to Mary, because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his reforms {{as well as those of}} Henry VIII, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> planned to exclude her from the line of succession. His advisers, however, told him that he could not disinherit only one of his sisters: He would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she was a Protestant. Guided by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and perhaps others, Edward excluded both of his sisters from the line of succession in his will.|$|E
5|$|Once {{production}} began {{it became}} apparent that Part One and Part Two were under-running so more dialogue was written to fill in the time. It was originally intended that the character of Jackson would not reappear after the second episode, but during filming Saward became concerned that it appeared that he had been executed <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> and Clegg rewrote Part Three to include him. Part Three also looked to be under running so scenes from Part Four were brought forward and the final scenes with the Guardians were extended to compensate.|$|E
5|$|Only 48, he was {{not willing}} to retire. He had always been {{interested}} in history <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> joined the Historic Sites Department of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. He became an area superintendent and served for five years. In December 1973 he experienced a sudden onset of headaches and complained of nausea. He was submitted to hospital but his health declined rapidly. Bob Braham died from a brain tumour on 7 February 1974 at the age of 53.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the 1870s, {{following}} the Italian fleet's defeat at the Battle of Lissa, the Italians began a large naval expansion program, at first aimed at countering the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The Italias were the second {{class of the}} programme, which also included the , designed in the mid-1870s by Insp Eng Benedetto Brin. The ships were authorized in 1875, with funding allocated to begin construction the following year. They were faster and more seaworthy than the preceding Caio Duilio class, owing to their higher freeboard. Brin intended them {{to be capable of}} fighting successfully against any foreign warship in service, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> opted for very large guns for the main battery.|$|E
5|$|Tapp is {{beginning}} to learn that these people all have a dark connection to him. He proceeds to {{the offices of the}} building and finds Oswald McGullicuty in the next Jigsaw trap. Jigsaw felt that Oswald was perverting his message, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> was placed into a Folding Table Trap, which would snap his body in half if Tapp failed to save him. Tapp saves Oswald, but he is swiftly killed by a compacting metal slab before either have a chance to react.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of Weston's new colony was profit, rather than the {{religious}} reasons of the Plymouth settlers, and this dictated how the colony would be assembled. Weston believed that families were a detriment to a well-run plantation <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> selected able-bodied men only but not men experienced in colonial life. In total, there were several advanced scouts and fifty to sixty other colonists. The final complement also included one surgeon and one lawyer. The party was outfitted with enough supplies to last the winter.|$|E
