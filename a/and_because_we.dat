And yet of the two forces {{the second is the}} greater; we do this because we choose to do it. By the {{sovereign}} Will and force of arms the Draka will rule the Earth, and in so doing remake themselves. We shall conquer and beat the Nations of the Earth into the dust and reforge them in our self wrought Image; the Final Society without weakness or mercy, hard and pure. Our descendants will walk the hillside of that future, innocent beneath the stars, with no more between them and their naked will than a wolf has. THEN there will be Gods in the Earth.|$|E

500|$|Visual effects {{supervisor}} Jay Worth found {{inspiration for}} the ash storyline from holding his grandmother-in-law's hands while at her funeral. He noted during production, [...] "The Ash Man definitely had {{its own set of}} challenges, because we wanted to utilize a lot of real elements, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> didn't have the time to do all the simulation and particle work needed to make it look real. The thing that sold The Ash Man more than anything was the aftermath shot: This half-disintegrated body with a pile of ash for the head on the ground. It ended up being a layering, compositing, tweaking challenge beyond belief. I got to shoot the elements myself and had more control over them." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the game}} had a heavy anime style and Joanna Dark {{received}} many alterations throughout the development process. Lead Art Director Wil Overton {{explained that they}} [...] "wanted {{to bring her back}} in line with the way Rare do things. [...] We sorta wanted to stylize her up a bit and make her more iconic." [...] However, the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit. The Xbox 360 gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted and allowed them to create the game's co-operative mode, {{which was one of the}} first that could be played via Xbox Live. Designing the co-operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers. According to Duncan Botwood, who was responsible for most of the multiplayer, [...] "It was quite an effort to put it in, to be honest. You have to cater for a number of eventualities you just don't get normally. We think we pulled it off, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> pulled it off, other people might feel inspired to put the effort in, and we think that's a good thing." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} this time, {{the heyday of the}} French Revolution, that Barbauld {{published}} her most radical political pieces. From 1787 to 1790, Charles James Fox attempted to convince the House of Commons to pass a law granting Dissenters full citizenship rights. When this bill was defeated for the third time, Barbauld wrote one of her most passionate pamphlets, An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts. Readers were shocked to discover that such a well-reasoned argument should come from a woman. In 1791, after William Wilberforce's attempt to outlaw the slave trade failed, Barbauld published her Epistle to William Wilberforce Esq. On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade, which not only lamented the fate of the slaves, but also warned of the cultural and social degeneration the British could expect if they did not abandon slavery. In 1792, she continued this theme of national responsibility in an anti-war sermon entitled Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation which argued that each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation: [...] "We are called upon to repent of national sins, because we can help them, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> ought to help them." ...|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{recorded}} {{their first}} win of the pre-season against Austria Wien. Bergkamp capped off a [...] "superb individual display" [...] by scoring the first goal {{and setting up}} the second for Jeffers. The final match of the tour was against Beşiktaş, which required tightened security given the history between English and Turkish football supporters. Bergkamp scored the only goal of the match in the second half, [...] "a cheeky effort through keeper Óscar Córdoba's legs". An Arsenal XI in England two days later faced St Albans City, where they won 3–1. The main squad then travelled to Scotland to play Celtic on 2 August 2003. Both goals in the one-all draw came in the second half; the match marked the return of Vieira after three months out with a knee problem. Wenger revealed afterwards {{that he intended to}} use the pre-season as an experiment for his defence. He partnered centre back Campbell with Touré, who for much of last season played in midfield. Wenger was pleased with Touré's performance against Celtic and said: [...] "He has quality. He was originally a central defender <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have kept a few clean sheets recently and he's played well, I thought we'd keep him there." [...] An Arsenal XI travelled to Belgium for a game against Beveren and conceded two goals in the final five minutes to draw the match 2–2. Arsenal rounded off their pre-season preparations with a 3–0 win against Rangers on 5 August 2003.|$|E
500|$|La Dispute {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} Wildlife in pieces to accommodate their intense tour schedule. The album was recorded at two different studios with recording engineers Andrew Everding and Joe Pedulla. They {{started with the}} instrumentation of six tracks at Drasik Studios in Chicago; this recording process took place over two weeks. The songwriting featured on the album is distinct from La Dispute's previous releases. Dreyer wrote the stories or the concepts behind each song, and then the band adapted these stories into lyrics and created music to revolve around them. In an interview, Dreyer was asked how the songwriting differs; {{he said that the}} lyrics were written before the music was composed. He was quoted as saying: [...] "This time around, we switched the process up entirely. Previous to Wildlife, we'd always start music first and add vocals later based on the way the song felt. This time around, because we had a more concrete concept going into it, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> wanted to work even more as a single unit [...] " [...] Dreyer and the rest of La Dispute had expressed interest in writing a conceptual record, but with ambiguity so it would not limit the listener's experience. [...] "Oftentimes, I think records with a linear narrative narrow the ways in which a person can enjoy it, and not everyone wants to sit down and listen to something front to back." [...] When they returned from their touring in Australia in February 2011 they [...] "dropped {{off the face of the}} earth" [...] for two months, during which their writing sessions lasted twelve to fourteen hours a day.|$|E

[...] The singer slept little during its making, commenting [...] "See, Bowie's a hell of a fast guy... I realized I had to be quicker than him, otherwise whose album was it gonna be?"

The result was the 2004 release, Faith, Folk and Anarchy, {{as well as an}} eventual live accompaniment, Faith, Folk & Anarchy Live. [...] The next year brought three more releases from Joseph. [...] In the midst of the controversial war in Iraq, Joseph's next album, Deep Blue, featured the highly political tracks [...] "Yet Still This Will Not Be" [...] and [...] "How Did We End Up Here".

2500|$|The unfinalized {{status of}} East Jerusalem has caused issues when {{attempting}} to market Jerusalem to international tourists. In 2009, 2010, and again in 2015, the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled against a series of Israeli Ministry of Tourism advertising campaigns that displayed images and information about tourist sites located in East Jerusalem. The advertising authority wrote in its ruling that [...] "the status of the occupied territory of the West Bank {{was the subject of}} much international dispute, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> considered that the ad implied that the part of East Jerusalem featured in the image was part of the state of Israel, we concluded that the ad was likely to mislead." [...] Israel rejected the ruling, with the Ministry of Tourism releasing a statement that said the ad provided [...] "basic, accurate information to a prospective UK visitor". The ruling from 2009 also included criticism about Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights being shown as part of Israel.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Muqata blog on Jewish Press {{removal of}} the book was hypocritical as Amazon {{continues}} to sell The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and other materials calling for the erasure of Israel, including those that amount to calls for genocide. [...] "Legal Insurrection", a conservative law blog, also said that banning {{the sale of the}} book wasn't justified, particularly since Amazon continues to sell other blank titles, Mein Kampf, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and [...] "Free Palestine" [...] merchandise. Conversely Tom Suarez on Mondoweiss wrote whereas the Protocols claim is correct and that one could argue that Amazon is in fact a [...] "common utility", but that [...] " [...] History of the Palestinian People is explicitly intended to reinforce the dehumanization of an entire people in order to grease the machinery of subjugation and ethnic cleansing". Responding to the continuing sale of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion Amazon said [...] "Amazon strongly believes that providing open access to written speech, no matter how hateful or ugly, {{is one of the most}} important things we do. <b>And</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> think the best remedy for offensive speech is more speech, we also make available to readers the ability to make their own voices heard and express their views about this and all our titles in reviews and ratings".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, Timberlake {{released}} his second studio album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Critically and commercially acclaimed, the album spawned six singles, including the worldwide hits [...] "SexyBack", [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". After wrapping up a worldwide concert tour {{in support of}} the album in 2007, Timberlake took a break from his music career to focus on acting. In 2010, Timberlake's manager, Johnny Wright, began conversations with the singer about working on new music. The two had general decisions about ways to release new music, because according to Wright, [...] "a lot of the physical record sellers were gone, by the time we've got music again we need to think about different ways to deliver it". Wright proposed a promotion based on an application or releasing a new song every month. Timberlake, however, was not interested in going back into music and instead continued to focus on his film career. Around the [...] "late part of May/first week in June" [...] 2012, Timberlake asked Wright to dinner and revealed to him that he had spent the last couple of nights in studio with Timbaland working on new material. Wright was shocked at the revelation, telling Billboard magazine that he [...] "wasn't prepared for that." [...] The two immediately began marketing plans for how the album should be promoted and when it should be released. Ultimately, they agreed [...] "to do this in a shorter period of time, so let's put the single out and [...] seven or eight weeks after that– make it a short window, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have such a short window, we have to make a big impact." ...|$|E
