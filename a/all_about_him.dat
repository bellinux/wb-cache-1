I'm glad that I can represent that kind of life on television so millions of people see it every week. And the whole point of it is to show that Artie can still do everything everyone else can that matters." ...|$|E

One day, Aravind's family see Subha and clearly remember that she visited them a year before to find Aravind and know <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> for the Bodhidharma research. Saving herself, she lies by saying {{that she does not}} know them. Later that night, Aravind's uncle (Ilavarasu) explains all what happened one year before when they met Subha. Aravind goes and meets Subha, and is enraged upon realising the truth. However the next day, he reconciles with Subha in a love failure mood and agrees to contribute to the research and hence save the country. The research begins of giving life to Bodhidharma and to end Operation Red.

2500|$|Film {{critics have}} mostly-positive reviews on the documentary, with a 71% grade from review {{aggregator}} Rotten Tomatoes and 72% from Metacritic. [...] Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York rated the documentary with 4 stars, calling it [...] "strange and sad". Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe gave Paper Dolls 3½ out of 4 stars, lauding that the documentary does not center on drag culture but on [...] "the {{discrepancy between the}} (subjects') self-image and their neighbors' failure {{to see them as}} more than freaks and foreigners". [...] Ken Fox of TV Guide rated the documentary a 3 out of 4 stars, commenting that although [...] "Heymann has a flair for drama and a way of making every scene he appears in <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>him...</b> the Paper Dolls themselves are funny and touching and their plight is relevant to any discussion about foreign workers." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times stated that Paper Dolls [...] "seeks to illuminate a subculture without allowing its curiosity to become exploitative or prurient". Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave it a 2½ star-rating out of 4, saying that the documentary underscores the subjects' role as [...] "eternal outsiders". [...] David Noh of Film Journal International stated that [...] "despite Heymann's often clumsy technique and sometimes baldly opportunistic approach, a real human story emerges", and that the audience [...] "sincerely root for these unlikely, uncomely souls". [...] Kevin Thomas of Los Angeles Times writes that Heymann does not only bring an engaging poignancy and depth in Paper Dolls, but also a powerful universality.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1951, a young cyclist named Jeffrey O'Brien {{would become}} {{arguably the most}} {{dominant}} champion ever. He joined Gill as a four-time champion from 1951 to 1955. His chance at making that total five {{was interrupted by a}} most unusual race in 1953. The story goes that Cycling Association officials felt O'Brien was too dominant and might affect the sport's development. They planned a stratagem involving four junior riders (under eighteen) who would receive a half-hour headstart on the seniors. O'Brien and the peloton caught all but one, the eventual winner, Clinton Castillo. The incident has become a treasured part of Belizean cycling lore. O'Brien would retire in 1955 and never race again. But a new dynasty was to emerge, featuring a team of cycling brothers, the Miguels. Edward, Arthur, John and Rudy would share 11 of the next 13 Classics between them, though not without some controversy. In 1958, John Miguel's finish with contender Duncan Vernon was ruled a dead heat, the only one in Classic history. In 1961, brother Edward thought he had the race won and raised his hands in the air accordingly, only to be disqualified in favour of Vernon and Arthur Miguel. John won the most titles of the quartet with four, followed by Edward's three, and Arthur and Rudy with two each. Other winners during the period were Clinton Castillo in 1967 and Kenneth Sutherland. In 1971, an international participant won for the first time, Mexico's Pablo Calderon, but he won on the Northern Highway, where Cross Countries have occasionally been held. In 1972, Cayo's Anthony Hutchinson, nicknamed [...] "The Tank", demolished Calderon and the Miguels for his first title on the Western Highway, then repeated in 1973 ahead of Kenrick Halliday, then an unknown. But Belizeans were soon to know <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> (Cycling Association retrospective) ...|$|E
