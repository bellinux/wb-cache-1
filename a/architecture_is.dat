5|$|Cluj-Napoca's salient <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> {{primarily}} Renaissance, Baroque and Gothic. The {{modern era}} has also produced a remarkable set of buildings from the mid-century style. The mostly utilitarian Communist-era <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> also present, although {{only to a}} certain extent, as Cluj-Napoca never faced a large systematisation programme. Of late, the city has seen significant growth in contemporary structures such as skyscrapers and office buildings, mainly constructed after 2000.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{exterior}} <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> Neoclassical, {{while its}} interior is mostly colonial and Gothic.|$|E
5|$|The central Petén {{style of}} <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> {{modelled}} {{after the great}} city of Tikal. The style is characterized by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb, and accessed by a single doorway. Additional features are the use of stela-altar pairings, and the decoration of architectural façades, lintels, and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods. One of the finest examples of Central Petén style <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> Tikal Temple I. Examples of sites in the Central Petén style include Altun Ha, Calakmul, Holmul, Ixkun, Nakum, Naranjo, and Yaxhá.|$|E

40|$|Two basic <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> deduced from 1 -D {{multistage}} architectures with nearest-neighbour (NN) interconnection of {{switches and}} extended into 2 -D architectures by a mathematical transformation. These two <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> the Spanke-Benes (SE) {{network and the}} NN multistage interconnection network of switches (NN-MIN). The properties and applications of the two 2 -D <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> described...|$|R
5|$|What the Getty Villa achieves, {{first by}} seclusion, then by control of access, and {{ultimately}} through the <b>architecture,</b> <b>is</b> {{a sense of}} detachment from its immediate environment.|$|E
5|$|While also {{consciously}} {{adhering to}} Abbasid architectural concepts, the <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> more influenced by Mediterranean cultures and less by Iranian.|$|E
5|$|Adders execute integer {{addition}} {{in electronic}} digital computers, usually using binary arithmetic. The simplest <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> the ripple carry adder, which follows the standard multi-digit algorithm. One slight improvement is the carry skip design, again following human intuition; {{one does not}} perform all the carries in computing , but one bypasses the group of 9s and skips to the answer.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{register}} memory <b>architecture</b> <b>are</b> IBM System/360, its successors, and Intel x86. Examples of register plus memory <b>architecture</b> <b>are</b> VAX and the Motorola 68000 family.|$|R
40|$|Mission {{scenarios}} {{and space}} station <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> discussed. Electrical power subsystems (EPS), environmental control and life support, subsystems (ECLSS), and reaction control subsystem (RCS) <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> addressed.

50|$|In 1893, the nation's first {{professional}} course in landscape <b>architecture</b> <b>was</b> offered at Harvard University. In 1900, the world's first landscape <b>architecture</b> program <b>was</b> established by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. and Arthur A. Shurcliff. The School of Landscape <b>Architecture</b> <b>was</b> established in 1913.|$|R
5|$|Another {{trend in}} {{contemporary}} Danish <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> {{the emergence of}} a new generation of successful young practices, inspired more by international trends than by the modernist tradition in Scandinavia. The generation is spearheaded by Bjarke Ingels whose firm BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group) founded in 2006 has made an unusually rapid transition into a well-established firm.|$|E
5|$|Baroque <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> a European {{phenomenon}} {{originating in}} 17th-century Italy; it is flamboyant and theatrical, and richly ornamented by sculpture and an effect known as chiaroscuro, the strategic use {{of light and}} shade on a building created by mass and shadow.|$|E
5|$|National Schools of Art, Cubanacán: The National Schools of Art was {{established}} in 1962 to train artists in plastic arts, music, ballet, drama, modern and folkloric dancing.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel networking strategy for RAM-based Neurons which significantly improves {{the training and}} recognition performance of such networks whilst maintaining the generalisation capabilities achieved in previous network configurations. A number of different <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> introduced each using the same underlying principles. Initially, features which are common to all <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> described illustrating {{the basis of the}} underlying paradigm. Three <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> then introduced illustrating different techniques for employing the paradigm to meet differing performance specifications. The <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> described in terms {{of the structure of the}} neurons they employ. Greater detail of the various training and recognition algorithms employed by the <b>architectures</b> may <b>be</b> found in the referenced papers...|$|R
5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of a revival in Gothic <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> from Scotland. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots Baronial style.|$|E
5|$|The <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} a number of groups and subgroups, {{labelled}} by archaeologists as Groups A through to L; those subgroups belonging to Groups A, B, C and E that fall outside the city walls are indicated with the addition of an X or an apostrophe after the group name, to give Group A-X, Group B-X, Group C' and Group E'.|$|E
5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> not entirely a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the {{placement}} {{and style of}} the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, {{a hallmark of the}} Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E
50|$|Native <b>architecture</b> <b>was</b> arguably more {{influenced}} by the new European ideas than colonial <b>architecture</b> <b>was</b> {{influenced by}} Indonesian styles; and these Western elements {{continue to be a}} dominant influence on Indonesia's built environment today.|$|R
50|$|<b>Architecture</b> <b>was</b> first {{taught at}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1868. <b>Architecture</b> <b>was</b> the 4th course of study {{in the history of}} the university. In 1932, when the {{president}} of MIT, Karl T. Compton, reorganized the Institute's academic structure, the School of <b>Architecture</b> <b>was</b> established, incorporating the Department of Architecture. The head of the Department of Architecture, William Emerson, became the first dean of the School of Architecture.|$|R

Finally the utilisation of WDM networks in coarse-grain architectures like cluster computing systems is discussed. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{focus of}} a temple is the centre or sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha) where {{the image of the}} deity resides, so temple <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> {{designed}} to move the devotee from outside to the garbhagriha through ambulatory passageways for circumambulation and halls or chambers (mantapas) that become increasingly sacred as the deity is approached.|$|E
5|$|The new library {{opened in}} December 2014 {{and has become}} a highly popular {{gathering}} place. In addition to a book collection significantly larger than that of the former library, the new building houses a wide range of amenities including cafés, an auditorium, and community rooms. The striking <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> characterised by the fifth floor's cantilever over the entrance plaza, a central atrium criss-crossed by staircases, and the building's transparency and relationship to the urban context.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} purpose {{of much of}} Bath's <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era {{before the advent of}} the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, a floor, or (according to their means) an entire house for the duration of their visit, and be waited on by the house's communal servants.|$|E
50|$|As an {{emerging}} field, classifications of reconfigurable <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> still being developed and refined as new <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> developed; no unifying taxonomy {{has been suggested}} to date. However, several recurring parameters {{can be used to}} classify these systems.|$|R
50|$|NRENs {{are usually}} the places where new Internet {{protocols}} and <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> introduced before deployment within the Public Internet. Two examples of these protocols are IPv6 and IP multicast. Two examples of <b>architecture</b> <b>are</b> client/server and Cloud computing.|$|R
50|$|During {{the third}} {{millennium}} B.C, prehistoric Armenian <b>architecture</b> <b>was</b> already distinctive. The most common feature of this form of <b>architecture</b> <b>was</b> its groundwork, which incorporated many geometrical shapes, ultimately forming a cell shape. An example of such <b>architecture</b> can <b>be</b> found in Nakichevan's Gyul-Tepe. These buildings were approximately 6-7 metres wide and 5 or so high.|$|R
5|$|The synagogue {{was built}} in 1890. Its <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> typical of the region, with a square shape and {{discreet}} neo-romanesque ornaments. Its cupola was destroyed in 1940 by the Nazis and never rebuilt. The Jewish cemetery, located outside the old town, was opened in 1622. It has several 18th century gravestones showing a Christian artistic influence.|$|E
5|$|Userkaf's {{mortuary}} temple {{layout and}} <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> difficult to establish with certainty. Not {{only was it}} extensively quarried for stone throughout the millennia, but a large Saite period shaft tomb was also dug in its midst, damaging it.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bristol's <b>architecture</b> <b>is</b> the Bristol Byzantine style. Characterised by {{complicated}} polychrome brick and decorative arches, this style {{was used in}} the construction of factories, warehouses and municipal buildings built in the Victorian era. Surviving examples include the Colston Hall, the Granary on Welsh Back, and the Gloucester Road Carriage Works, along with some of the buildings around Victoria Street. Several of the warehouses around the harbour have also survived, including the Arnolfini, which now houses an art gallery. Clarks Wood Company warehouse, the St Vincent's Works in Silverthorne Lane, and the Wool Hall in St Thomas Street, are other survivors from the 19th century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{software}} architectures and <b>architecture</b> styles <b>are</b> modeled with attributed typed graphs and graph grammars respectively. Accordingly, dynamic reconfigurations {{of software}} <b>architectures</b> <b>are</b> modeled with graph transformations. Based {{on such a}} modeling, a supporting environment is constructed twofold. Firstly, the visual manipulation of the graphical representation of software <b>architectures</b> <b>is</b> supported with a graph grammar-enabled editor. Secondly, the graphical <b>architecture</b> model <b>is</b> reified as a runtime software architecture object built into the physical running system, through which graph transformations of the <b>architecture</b> model <b>is</b> then naturally reflected as dynamic reconfigurations of the running system...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} meaning of Modernism and Post-Modernism in {{landscape}} architecture and asks if contemporary landscape <b>architecture</b> can <b>be</b> classified as Post-Modern. Art, architecture, and landscape <b>architecture</b> <b>were</b> examined during the Industrial and Post-Industrial Eras {{to see if there}} is a correlation between each discipline's stylistic movements. Arguments both for and against the existence of a Post-Modern Movement in landscape <b>architecture</b> <b>are</b> presented. It is concluded that art and <b>architecture</b> <b>are</b> the current leaders in creating innovative, historically memorable landscape designs, and that there is need for further exploration, teaching, and debate about contemporary design history and theory...|$|R
