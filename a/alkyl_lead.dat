About 130 samples were collected in winter 2001 and spring 2002 during Nutrigas and Gasprod campaigns (Programme PNEC-Golfe de Gascogne, RV Thalassa) and metal measurements were conducted on board by Potentiometric Stripping Analysis. In the Loire estuary, levels of dissolved lead ranged from 0. 15 to 0. 24 nM and from 0. 04 to 0. 26 nM in winter and spring, respectively. Compared to the concentrations reported in 1987 and 1990 (0. 4 – 1. 7 nM; Boutier, B., Chiffoleau, J. F., Auger, D., Truquet, I., 1993.

On the continental shelf, levels of dissolved lead varied within 0. 06 and 0. 27 nM in winter (0. 15 ± 0. 06 nM, sd = 1. 96, n = 49), whereas concentrations measured in spring were in the range 0. 06 – 0. 17 nM (0. 09 ± 0. 03 nM, sd = 1. 96, n = 60). This difference in metal concentration was related to the amounts of rainfall that have fallen over the continental shelf: estimations of inputs by this way (74 and 32 kg day− 1 in winter and spring, respectively) appeared to be significantly higher than inputs from the Loire river (7. 5 and 1. 9 kg day− 1 in winter and spring, respectively). The distributions of dissolved metal in the surface waters highlighted the role of suspended particular matter (SPM) for a rapid “trapping” of lead near the mouth of the estuary.

Moreover, aromatic compounds are added to gas-oline {{as a substitute for}} <b>alkyl</b> <b>lead</b> compounds. Al-though atmospheric lead pollution is reduced, the concentration of benzene released into the air is increased. Because benzene is widely used in indus-try, exposure of workers to benzene is a health concern that deserves attention. 1, 2 During the late 19 th century, it was found that continuous exposure to benzene can lead to aplastic anemia and leukemia. There were also cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia reported during this period. 3 This association brought attention to the toxicity of benzene to the bone marrow. Additional studies in Italy and Turkey showed that the stan-dardized mortality ratio of leukemia among work-ers exposed to benzene is higher than that of non-exposed civilians. 4 The threshold limit values for benzene have become more stringent. Threshold limit values refer to airborne concentrations of sub-stances and represent conditions under which it is believed that nearly all workers may be exposed on a daily basis without adverse health effects. The Department of Occupational Disease in Tri-Service General Hospital was established in 1994.

By monitoring sentinel vertebrate species, the PBMS aims to detect and quantify current and emerging chemical threats {{to the environment and}} in particular to vertebrate wildlife. Lead (Pb) is a highly toxic metal that acts as a non-specific poison affecting all body systems and has no known biological requirement. Sources of Pb in the environment include lead mining, the refining and smelting of lead and other metals, the manufacture and use of <b>alkyl</b> <b>lead</b> fuel additives, and the use of lead ammunition. The present study is {{the first two years of}} a PBMS monitoring programme to quantify the scale of exposure to [and associated risk from] Pb in predatory birds. The aim is to quantify the extent of exposure to lead [as assessed from liver residues] in two predatory bird species, the red kite (Mivus milvus) and the sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus). The red kite is a scavenger and, as such, is particularly at risk from consumption of Pb ammunition in unretrieved game. Sparrowhawks prey predominantly upon live passerine birds that are unlikely to be shot in the UK; likely sources of exposure are diffuse Pb contamination although some individuals may also be exposed to Pb particles ingested by their prey. We also examined the liver Pb isotope ratios in to explore whether they can be used to ascribe likely sources of any Pb detected in the birds. Red kites had significantly higher Pb concentration than those measured in sparrowhawks but the majority of sparrowhawks and all the red kites had liver Pb concentrations below those thought to cause clinical and sub-clinical adverse effects in Falconiforme species. There was overlap in the liver Pb isotope ratios of red kites and sparrowhawks yet there was evidence of separation between the two species. There was also evidence of overlap with the isotope signature for coal and for Pb shot but the isotope signatures in the bird livers were distinct from that of petrol Pb.

40|$|Abstract Organic {{derivatives}} of tin, lead, mercury are {{the most}} widely distributed organometallic ecotoxicants in the environment. While some of these organometallic compounds exist in the environment {{as a result of}} direct discharge, anthropogenic emissions alone cannot explain the ubiquity, for example, of the organomercury and organolead compounds in marine and fresh waters, sediments and biota. It is known that some organometallic compounds are formed via a bioconversion from the inorganic contaminants. Depending on the source, they can enter the environment in varied forms inorganic species of different stability. These can be bio-converted further by environmental biota; for instance metals such as tin and lead can be discharged into the environment in the form of organometallic species which can undergo further transformation. Determination of organometallics in environmental and biological samples is difficult due to matrix effect and their low concentrations. Separation and preconcentration is necessary to enhance final determination. Speciation studies are even more complicated. Speciation is an important aspect and gives information about bioavailability of the metal thus their toxicity. This work focused on the development of a method for speciation of organospecies of tin, lead and mercury. A new derivatisation agent has been synthesised and used successfully. SLM probe extraction has been exposed to a new matrix. Different environmental samples have been analysed for organo-species of tin and lead and their pathways predicted. The SLM probe extraction gives the advantage of carrying out several extractions, reduction of the amount of solvent used and avoidance of emulsion problems. A simple system has been developed and applied successfully on organotin and organolead extraction from aqueous environmental sample. For reproducibility of the results, pH, salinity, stirring rate and extraction time were optimized. An analytical method for simultaneous in situ ethylation, using new derivatisation agent bromomagnesium tetraethylborate (Et 4 BMgBr), of organotin and organomercury compounds in sediment samples was developed. The determination of mercury and tin compounds is achieved by species-specific isotope dilution, derivatisation and gas chromatography – inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GC-ICP-MS). In derivatisation, pH and the amount of derivatisation agent were studied. Percentage recovery and accuracy of the method was confirmed by comparison of experimental results with sediment and plant certified reference material (IAEA 405 for sediment and CRM 279 for plant). Although organolead compounds as a gasoline additive are banned in most countries, in some regions, lead is still added to gasoline in varying proportions of different tetraalkyllead compounds and contamination by organolead compounds is still present at different places, e. g. : lead alkyl manufactures The use of both tetraalkyllead and butyltin is banned (tetraalkyllead as gasoline additive and butyltin in antifouling pints and PVC materials). This work focussed on their conversion in water and soil. This should provide an insight into their presence in the environment and an understanding of their degradation in the environment. A method for full speciation and determination of <b>alkyl</b> <b>lead</b> and inorganic lead (II) after the tetramethyllead degradation in aqueous samples has been developed. This was accomplished by in situ derivatisation with sodium tetraphenyllead borate NaB(Ph) 4 derivative. The derivatisation was carried out directly in the aqueous sample and the derivatives were extracted using the supported liquid membrane probe extraction (SLMPE). The extracted analytes were then transferred to a GC/MS for separation and detection. This study focused on the transformation of tetramethyllead in aqueous media, at different concentration of major elements, K+,Na+,Ca++, Mg++,Cl-,SO 4 [...] . Adsorption / desorption on soil of ionic organolead and organotin were also studied. As South Africa is one of the world’s major producers of coal, mercury should be monitored as it is a side product in coal combustion.

The morphology of the fibres also depends on the flexibility at the chain ends of the amphiphilic components, as there is not such an apparently persistent helical morphology for the dihydrocitronellyl derivative as for that prepared from citronellyl chains...|$|R
5000|$|Of {{academic}} interest, SO2 {{acts like}} a Lewis acid towards the alkyl ligand. The pathway for the insertion of SO2 into metal alkyl bond begins with attack of the alkyl nucleophile on the sulfur centre in SO2. The [...] "insertion" [...] proceed the sulfur dioxide between the metal and the <b>alkyl</b> ligand <b>leads</b> to the O, O'-sulphinate. Alternatively an O-sulphinate can arise. Both of these intermediates commonly convert to an S-sulphinate. [...] S-sulphinate has sulfur - oxygen stretching frequencies from 1250-1000 cm−1 and 1100-1000 cm−1. The O, O'-sulphinate and O-sulphinate are difficult to distinguish as they have stretching frequencies from 1085-1050 cm−1 and 1000-820 cm−1 or lower. The pathway involving the O, O' sulphinate can generally be ruled out if the original metal complex fulfilled the 18-electron rule because the two metal - oxygen bonds would exceed the 18 electron rule. [...] The pathway by which SO2 inserts into a square planar alkyl complexes involves {{the formation of an}} adduct. Thereafter, the alkyl ligand migrates to the SO2.|$|R
30|$|Ammonium salts {{have been}} used to {{generate}} alkyl cations via protonolysis of M–R bonds; an example of this is the generation of [Cp 2 TiMe(NH 3)][PF 6] from Cp 2 TiMe 2 and [NH 4][PF 6] reported by Bochmann et al. [106]. Other ammonium salts {{have been used}} to this effect such as [PhNMe 2 H]+ and [nBu 3 NH]+. Treatment of Cp 2 ZrMe 2 with [PhNMe 2 H][BF 20] ([BF 20]− = [B(C 6 F 5) 4]−) produces the cation [Cp 2 ZrMe]+ with a [BF 20]− counterion [97, 108]. Using protonolysis to generate the <b>alkyl</b> cation <b>leads</b> to the generation of a Lewis base side product which can bind to the cation. The Lewis base must be removed from the cation to allow binding of the olefin for polymerisation, and therefore the presence of Lewis bases reduces catalytic activity. As an alternative to ammonium salts, phosphonium salts can be used in the same vein [109]. If one employs bulky phosphonium ions such as [Cy 3 PH]+ and [Mes 3 PH]+, the resulting phosphine does not coordinate to the generated cation which then leads to a productive catalytic system [109].|$|R
40|$|The Norrish type II {{processes}} of methyl- 2, 2 -dimethyl- cyclopropyl ketone, alpha-alkoxy acetones and alkyl pyruvates {{have been examined}} using the AM 1 semi-empirical molecular orbital method with complete geometry optimization at the partial configuration interaction level in the restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) frame. The results reveal that the methyl-substituted cyclopropyl ketone has a constrained geometry favourable for hydrogen abstraction from the gamma-position relative to the carbonyl group in the excited singlet state. The presence of the ether oxygen atom in the beta-position relative to the carbonyl group in alkoxy acetones and <b>alkyl</b> pyruvates <b>leads</b> to increased reactivity relative to alkyl monoketones and diketones respectively. The cyclization of 1 : 4 biradicals has been studied in the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) frame, and the results reveal that the 1 : 4 biradical derived from alkoxy acetones readily cyclizes to form oxetanols. On the other hand, in the 1 : 4 biradicals derived from methyl-substituted cyclopropyl ketone, the three-membered ring breaks readily to form an enol intermediate. Delocalization of an odd electron in 1 : 4 biradicals derived from alkyl pyruvates is thought to make cyclization difficult...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the Greenland ice core {{covering}} {{the period from}} 3000 to 500 years ago-the Greek, Roman, Medieval and Renaissance times-shows that lead is present at concentrations four times as great as natural values from about 2500 to 1700 years ago (500 B. C. to 300 A. D.). These results show that Greek and Roman lead and silver mining and smelting activities polluted the middle troposphere of the Northern Hemisphere on a hemispheric scale two millennia ago, long before the Industrial Revolution. Cumulative lead fallout to the Greenland Ice Sheet during these eight centuries was as high as 15 percent of that caused by the massive use of <b>lead</b> <b>alkyl</b> additives in gasoline since the 1930 s. Pronounced lead pollution is also observed during Medieval and Renaissance times...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{approaches}} for the enantiodivergent synthesis of P-chirogenic mono- and diphosphines are described, using ephedrine methodology and phosphine borane chemistry. Firstly, both enantiomers of a tertiary phosphine {{can be obtained}} starting from the same oxazaphospholidine borane complex, prepared from (+) -ephedrine, when changing {{the order of addition}} of the organolithium reagents during the synthetic pathway. The second approach is based on the chlorophosphine boranes, which react with an organolithium reagent, to afford the corresponding phosphines with inversion of configuration. In the case where the chlorophosphine borane reacts with the t-butyl lithium reagent, a metal-halogen exchange occurs to afford the corresponding phosphide borane with retention of the configuration. The reaction of the phosphide borane with an <b>alkyl</b> halide <b>leads</b> to the same phosphine, but with the opposite configuration. Another approach depends on the diastereoselective preparation of the starting oxazaphospholidine borane complex from (−) -ephedrine, which leads according the case, to either one or the other enantiomer of a phosphine. Finally, the synthesis of (R,R) - and (S,S) - 1, 2 -bis(methylphenylphosphino) ethane is also demonstrated using both enantiomers of the P-chirogenic diphosphinite diborane, which simultaneously allows the introduction of alkyl- or aryl substituents on the phosphorus atoms. In summary, these approaches show the great efficiency of the "ephedrine methodology" for the enantiodivergent synthesis of P-chirogenic mono- and diphosphines, and bearing alkyl or aryl substituents...|$|R
