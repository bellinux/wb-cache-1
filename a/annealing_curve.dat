40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to selectively characterize the traps involved in the pumping procedure of diamond films. The pumping process strongly reduces the concentration of active carrier trapping centers, leading to an enhancement of electronic properties of such material, and is obtained by irradiating the diamond films with ionizing radiation. Since the improved transport properties lead to an increased efficiency when diamond films are used as radiation detectors, valuable information on this process {{can be obtained by}} analyzing the response of diamond based particle detectors. For this purpose a high-quality diamond film was grown by microwave chemical vapor deposition and a particle detector was realized. Its response to a 5. 5 -MeV 241 Am α-particles was measured after successive annealing steps performed at different temperatures in the 180 - 228 °C range. Before each <b>annealing</b> <b>curve</b> at a given temperature, the detector was driven to the pumped state through β-particle irradiation. The efficiency versus annealing time curves evidence a thermally induced detrapping, confirming the pumping mechanism as a filling and consequent passivation of defects.

A comparison between samples of the same geometry built on and substrates with different resistivity has been carried out. The samples were irradiated at 4 different fluences up to 1 X 10 (14) p/cm(2). After the irradiation the measurements were performed at room temperature and after heating the samples at 60 degreesC, 80 degreesC and 120 degreesC to cover the complete <b>annealing</b> <b>curve.</b> The leakage current shows the same annealing behaviour typical of a simple diode. The interstrip resistance measured at full depletion voltage (V-dep) decreases in all structures, going down to few tens of MOmega at the highest fluence. It remains practically constant during the annealing period. The interstrip capacitance (at V-dep) varies during the annealing period with the same behaviour in both substrates {{and for all the}} fluence values: it decreases during the annealing at room temperature, reaching a minimum value, and increases after each heat treatment.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-Raman spectroscopy measurements showed unambiguously that a transition to the 'metastable' tetragonal phase (beta-ZrO 2) occurred at a fluence of 6. 5 x 10 ^ 12 cm- 2 for a large electronic stopping power value (approx 32. 5 MeV μm- 1). At a lower fluence of 1. 0 x 10 ^ 12 cm- 2, no such phase transformation was detected. The back-transformation from beta- to alpha-ZrO 2 induced by isothermal or isochronal thermal annealing was followed by XRD analysis. The back-transformation started at an onset temperature around 500 K and was completed by 973 K. Plots of the residual tetragonal phase fraction deduced from XRD measurements versus annealing temperature or time are analyzed with first- or second-order kinetic models. An activation energy close to 1 eV for the back-transformation process is derived either from isothermal annealing curves, using the so-called "cross-cut" method, or from the isochronal <b>annealing</b> <b>curve,</b> using a second-order kinetic law.

There are two phases, localized and delocalized, depending on the inverse temperature and on the disorder bias. Using quenched and annealed large deviation principles for the empirical process of words drawn from a random letter sequence according to a random renewal process (Birkner, Greven and den Hollander [6]), we derive variational formulas for the quenched, respectively, <b>annealed</b> critical <b>curve</b> separating the two phases. These variational formulas are used to obtain a necessary and sufficient criterion, stated in terms of relative entropies, for the two critical curves to be different at a given inverse temperature, a property referred to as relevance of the disorder. This criterion in turn is used to show that the regimes of relevant and irrelevant disorder are separated by a unique inverse critical temperature. Subsequently, upper and lower bounds are derived for the inverse critical temperature, from which sufficient conditions under which it is strictly positive, respectively, finite are obtained. The former condition is believed to be necessary as well, a problem that we will address in a forthcoming paper. Random pinning has been studied extensively in the literature.

Single crystals were irradiated with 1 or 2 -MeV electrons, and 200 -MeV 127 I, or 200 -MeV 197 Au ions. Electron and ion beams produce the same colour centres: namely i) an F+-like centre, ii) the so-called T-centre (Zr 3 + in a trigonal oxygen local environment), and iii) a hole center. Isochronal annealing was performed up to 973 K. Isothermal annealing was performed at various temperatures on samples irradiated with 2 -MeV electrons. The stability of paramagnetic centres increases with fluence and with a TCR treatment at 1373 K under vacuum prior to the irradiations. Two distinct recovery processes are observed depending on fluence and/or thermal treatment.

New work on four EPR centres namely W 33, W 37, W 46 and W 47 has been made. Their spin Hamiltonian parameters have been determined and have shown that their structural symmetries are very close to. Of the centres W 33, W 46 and W 47 have effective spins S= 1 whereas W 37 has an unusually large effective spin S= 2. From the annealing behaviour and the spin Hamiltonian parameters, their structural models have been proposed. The effective spin S= 3 / 2 for the W 11, W 12, W 13 and W 14 EPR centres have been verified in this work by employing EPR 2 s Dm = transitions. The <b>annealing</b> <b>curves</b> for the centres suggest that the nitrogen may not be directly involved but donates electrons necessary for the formation of the centres. The W 29 is an EPR centre that was found to have many similarities with R 4 /W 6, the neutral divacancy centre in diamond. Their symmetries are both close to; they have a large D-values and E-terms. In addition their g-tensors are isotropic and very close to free spin value. We have proposed that the W 29 is a negative divacancy. The linewidths of the centres W 29 and R 4 /W 6 have been measured in the temperature range 6 - 300 K; large variations in this range were found i. e 2 - 7 G for W 29 and 1. 8 - 14 G for the R 4 /W 6 centre. The spin lattice relaxation times T 1 for the R 4 /W 6 and the W 29 centres in neutronirradiated type Ib diamond have been made using the CW saturation methods. The dominant relaxation mechanism at very low temperatures (below 50 K for R 4 /W 6 and below 70 for W 29 centre) is the direct process. The Orbach process is dominant in the higher temperature regions for both centres. The results suggest excited states 15. 5 meV and 25. 8 meV for W 29 and R 4 /W 6, respectively...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the pinning model with {{correlated}} Gaussian disorder. The presence of correlations makes the annealed model more involved {{than the usual}} homogeneous model, which is fully solvable. We prove however that if the disorder correlations decay fast enough then the annealed critical behaviour {{is the same as}} the homogeneous one. Our result is sharper if the decay is exponential. The approach we propose relies on the spectral properties of a transfer or Ruelle-Perron Frobenius operator related to the model. We use results on these operators that were obtained in the framework of the thermodynamic formalism for countable Markov shifts. We also provide large-temperature asymptotics of the <b>annealed</b> critical <b>curve</b> under weaker assumptions...|$|R
