40|$|<b>Agronomie</b> {{selection}} generates {{and maintains}} agrobiodiversity {{which can be}} regarded as an essential resource. To describe phenotypic diversity, genotypes as well as their chemical expression, chemotypes, have been widely used. Tropical root and tuber crops are vegetatively propagated and their genetic bases are often narrow. Therefore, unveiling the impressive phenotypic diversity is still rather difficult through genotyping alone, whereas chemotype studies are very informative. Tropical root crops are staples and represent a good source of compounds related to health benefits and used in food and pharmaceutical indu stries. Those crops have keyroles to play in food security for developing countries and so plant breeding cannot be neglected. Biofortification is effective and does not imply change of dietary behaviours. Analysing, computing and compiling data bases for chernical data on diversity of neglected crops are still needed. Biofortification involving mass selection and profiling of numerous accessions is, however, time-consuming. Thus, efficient protocols and tools facilitating this process are required. Chemotypic variability within Vanuatu germplasm was characterised through core samples from different species and relationships between primary compounds, secondary metabolites and local preferences have been studied. Useful correlations were shown, thus clarifying traditional selection process. This process has permitted the definition of ideotypes that will be interesting for the management of breeding programmes. At least for the two most important species in Vanuatu - taro Colocasia esculenta and the greater yam Dioscorea alata - our work is the fust broad screening of germplasm. The study of carotenoid and anthocyanin content indicates that sorne cultivars show potential for commercial exploitation.

40|$|The {{research}} {{performed a}} sustainability assessment of supply chains of the anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) in Peru. The corresponding fisheries lands 6. 5 million t per year, of which < 2 % is rendered into products for {{direct human consumption}} (DHC) and 98 % reduced into feed ingredients (fishmeal and fish oil, FMFO), for export. Several industries compete for the anchoveta resources, generating local and global impacts. The need for understanding these dynamics, towards sustainability-improving management and policy recommendations, determined {{the development of a}} sustainability assessment framework: 1) characterisation and modelling of the systems under study (with Life Cycle Assessment and other tools) including local aquaculture, 2) calculation of sustainability indicators (i. e. energy efficiency, nutritional value, socio-economic performances), and 3) sustainability comparison of supply chains; definition and comparison of alternative exploitation scenarios. Future exploitation scenarios were defined by combining an ecosystem and a material flow models: continuation of the status quo (Scenario 1), shift towards increased proportion of DHC production (Scenario 2), and radical reduction of the anchoveta harvest in order for other fish stocks to recover and be exploited for DHC (Scenario 3). Scenario 2 was identified as the most sustainable. Management and policy recommendations include improving of: controls for compliance with management measures, sanitary conditions for DHC, landing infrastructure for small- and medium-scale (SMS) fisheries; the development of a national refrigerated distribution chain; and the assignation of flexible tolerances for discards from different DHC processes.

Long-term {{impacts of}} {{extensification}} of grassland management on biodiversity and productivity in upland areas. A review. <b>Agronomie,</b> 24, (8), 447 - 462. Modern rural policies that incorporate agricultural and environmental aims within the broader framework of sustainable rural development are being formulated {{to address the}} problem of declines in grassland biodiversity and the destruction of sensitive landscapes and habitats in Europe. Extensification is the process of reducing fertiliser inputs, management intensity and stocking rates, and is central to these sustainable rural policies. However, research in the Less Favoured Areas of Europe has been fragmented and highly variable reflecting the different uses and requirements of our upland areas. Information is needed to determine the nature and timescale of changes in such systems, and whether extensive management is sustainable in the long-term. This paper presents results from a range of grassland extensification experiments across Europe, mainly within the European Union, over the past 30 years that quantify the impacts on soil, plant and animal components of the system. All have the common theme of changing the focus of land management from solely the agricultural product to include a broader range of ecological and environmental objectives. Beneficial changes in biodiversity resulted from more extensive management treatments, but at the cost of reductions in total animal output, and in some cases a reduction in individual animal performance. However, it is clear that it is a long-term process to achieve many of these changes in biodiversity, and this must be recognised by policy makers. We recommend that future extensification studies adopt an approach that will allow their results to be applied throughout Europe. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Ancient Agronomy and Medieval Elaboration : From Palladius to the Préceptes cisterciens d'économie rurale - The paper {{presented}} here {{contributes to a}} fuller knowledge of the agronomic and economic culture of the Cistercian order in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It has been noted that Palladius' Opus agriculturae, an agronomic treatise written {{near the end of}} Antiquity, was present in the librairies of several Cistercian monasteries in the twelfth century. The White Monks also {{played an important role in}} the diffusion of the text in Italy during the thirteenth century. At Clairvaux, an anonymous author had completed a manuscript of the Opus agriculturae (Troyes, B. M. 1369) by recording four short Préceptes cisterciens d'économie rurale. This text (edited and translated in the annex) establishes the quantity of wool necessary for monastic habits, fixes the ration of oats for plough horses, gives advice on how to cultivate the gourd (cugurta), and enumerates the elementary rules for sheep raising. The Préceptes reveal judicous garden and breeding techniques well adapted to northern France. They also show concern for the efficient management of ressources. By way of hypothesis, we may ask whether the Préceptes — which constitute a sort of memoranda — were destined to help the masters of the grain storehouses, and, through them, the laymen. The interest for domestic economy thus took contrasting but complementary courses : a knowledge of ancient and partly antiquated agronomy, but nevertheless considered as indispensable, and an elaboration of empiric wisdom — of which we have found new evidence — arising from the accumulated experience of the Cistercian monasteries and storerooms.

40|$|The current {{restrictions}} {{on the use of}} chemical nematicides have contributed to increase rootknot nematode problems in horticultural crops. ln this context, plant resistance appears as the most effective method of control, but the possible occurrence of virulent nematodes able to reproduce on R-plants may constitute a severe threat to this control strategy. ln Capsicum annuum, resistance to RKN is controlled by several dominant genes - the N and Me genes. To implement a rational management of the R-lines increasing the durability of the R-genes, we tested several R-gene deployment strategies. Experiments were conducted in climate-controlled roorns, in greenhouses, and under 3 -years-field <b>agronomie</b> conditions to compare i) the succession of the same R-genes every year, when introgressed in a partially resistant vs. a susceptible genetic background, ii) the alternance, ii) the mixed cultivation and iv) the pyramiding of two R-genes with different modes of action in a single genotype. At the plant level, we previously showed that the choice of the R-genes and the genetic backgrounds in which they are introgressed can lower the frequency of resistance breakdown, and that the pyramiding of two different R-genes in one genotype totally suppressed the emergence of virulent isolates. Here, at the field and rotation level, we confirmed these results and showed that i) alternating different R-genes in rotation is efficient to reduce the selection pressure of R-genes on the pathogens and allows to recycle broken R-genes, and ii) optimal cultivation practices of R-plants increase their "trap" effect and may decrease the amount of pathogens in the soil, below their damage threshold. These results are in good agreement with concepts recently developed from the analysis of other plant-pathogen interactions. The root-knot nematode model could thus contribute to generalize strategies for the breeding and management of R-cultivars strengthening and increasing the durability of qualitative resistance...|$|E

In order to study on the effects of salinity and wild oat density on yield and yield components of wheat (Var. Roushan) a field experiment was conducted during the 2000 and 2001 growing season in the Agricultural Research Station of Birjand University. Experimental design was split plot with three replications. Treatments were: Salinity of irrigation water with four levels (1. 5, 4. 2, 5. 5, and 10. 5 dS/m in the first year and 1. 5, 5. 5, 7. 5 and 10. 5 dS/m in the second year) and five wild oat density (0, 20, 40, 80 and 160 plants /m 2). Wheat density was 400 p/m 2. Results showed that grain weight, grain yield and relative grain yield decreased significantly by salinity. However, number of spike /m 2, number of grain in spike and harvest index were not significantly affected by salinity. Grain weight in the second year, grain yield and relative grain yield decreased significantly by wild oat density. Nevertheless, number of spike/m 2, number of grain /spike, grain weight in the first year and harvest index were not affected significantly by wild oat density.

40|$|In {{this paper}} two models are {{presented}} for calculating the hourly evapotranspiration lambda E (W m(- 2)) using the Penman-Monteith equation. These models were tested on four irrigated crops (grass, soya bean, sweet sorghum and vineyard), with heights between 0. 1 and 2. 2 m at the adult growth stage. In {{the first model}} (Katerji N, Perrier A. 1983. Modelisation de l'evapotranspiration reelle ETR d'une parcelle de luzerne : role d'un coefficient cultural. <b>Agronomie</b> 3 (6) : 513 - 521, KP model), the canopy resistance r(c) is parameterized by a semi-empirical approach. In the second model (Todorovic M. 1999. Single-layer evapotranspiration model with variable canopy resistance. Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering-ASCE 125 : 235 - 245, TD model), the resistance r(c) is parameterized by a mechanistic model. These two approaches are critically analysed {{with respect to the}} underlying hypotheses and the limitations of their practical application. In the case of the KP model, the mean slope between measured and calculated values of lambda E was 1. 01 +/- 0. 6 and the relative correlation coefficients r(2) ranged between 0. 8 and 0. 93. The observed differences in slopes, between 0. 96 and 1. 07, were not associated with the crop height. This model seemed to be applicable to all the crops examined. In the case of the TD model, the observed slope between measured and calculated values of lambda E for the grass canopy was 0. 79. For the other crops, it varied between 1. 24 and 1. 34. In all the situations examined, the values of r(2) ranged between 0. 73 and 0. 92. The TD model underestimated lambda E in the case of grass and overestimated it in the cases of the other three crops. The under- or overestimation of lambda E in the TD model were due: (i) to some inaccuracies in the theory of this model, (ii) to not taking into account the effect of aerodynamic resistance r(a) in the canopy resistance modelling. Therefore, the values of r(c) were under-or overestimated in consequence of mismatching the crop height. The high value of air vapour pressure deficit also contributed to the overestimation of lambda E, mainly for the tallest crop. The results clarify aspects of the scientific controversy in the literature about the mechanistic and semi-empirical approaches for estimating lambda E. From the practical point of view the results also present ways for identifying the most appropriate approach for the experimental situations encountered...|$|E

During evolution, pathogens have developed a variety of strategies to suppress plant-triggered mmunity and promote successful infection. In Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacteria, the so- alled type III protein secretion system works as a molecular syringe to inject type III effectors (T 3 Es) into plant cells. The XopD T 3 E from the strain 85 - 10 of Xanthomonas campestris pathovar vesicatoria (Xcv) delays the onset of symptom development and alters basal defence responses to promote pathogen growth in infected tomato leaves. XopD was previously described as a modular protein that contains (i) an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD), (II) two tandemly repeated EAR (ERF-associated amphiphillic repression) motifs involved in transcriptional repression, and (iii) a C-terminal cysteine protease domain, involved in release of SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) from SUMO-modified proteins. Here, we show that the XopD protein hat is produced and secreted by Xcv presents an additional N-terminal extension of 215 amino acids. Closer analysis of this newly identified N-terminal domain shows a low complexity region rich in lysine, alanine and glutamic acid residues (KAE-rich) with high propensity to form coiled-coil structures that confers to XopD the ability to form dimers when expressed in E. coli. The full length XopD protein identified in this study (XopD 1 - 760) displays stronger repression of the opD plant target promoter PR 1, as compared to the XopD version annotated in the public databases (XopD 216 - 760). Furthermore, the N-terminal extension of XopD, which is absent in XopD 216 - 760, is essential for XopD type III-dependent secretion and, therefore, for complementation of an Xcv mutant strain deleted from XopD in its ability to delay symptom development in tomato susceptible cultivars. The identification of the complete sequence of XopD opens new erspectives for future studies on the XopD protein and its virulence-associated functions in planta. © 2010 Canonne et al. J.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] paper examines {{a model for}} estimating canopy resistance rc and reference evapotranspiration ETo on an hourly basis. The experimental data refer to grass at two sites in Spain with semiarid and windy conditions in a typical Mediterranean climate. Measured hourly ETo values were obtained over grass during a 4 year period between 1997 and 2000 using a weighing lysimeter (Zaragoza, northeastern Spain) and an eddy covariance system (Córdoba, southern Spain). The present model {{is based on the}} Penman-Monteith (PM) approach, but incorporates a variable canopy resistance rc as an empirical function of the square root of a climatic resistance r* that depends on climatic variables. Values for the variable rc were also computed according to two other approaches: with the rc variable as a straight-line function of r* (Katerji and Perrier, 1983, <b>Agronomie</b> 3 (6) : 513 - 521) and as a mechanistic function of weather variables as proposed by Todorovic (1999, Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, ASCE 125 (5) : 235 - 245). In the proposed model, the results show that rc/ra (where ra is the aerodynamic resistance) presents a dependence on the square root of r*/ra, as the best approach with empirically derived global parameters. When estimating hourly ETo values, we compared the performance of the PM equation using those estimated variable rc values with the PM equation as proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization, with a constant rc = 70 s m- 1. The results confirmed the relative robustness of the PM method with constant rc, but also revealed a tendency to underestimate the measured values when ETo is high. Under the semiarid conditions of the two experimental sites, slightly better estimates of ETo were obtained when an estimated variable rc was used. Although the improvement was limited, the best estimates were provided by the Todorovic and the proposed methods. The proposed approach for rc {{as a function of the}} square root of r* may be considered as an alternative for modelling rc, since the results suggest that the global coefficients of this locally calibrated relationship might be generalized to other climatic regions. It may also be useful to incorporate the effects of variable canopy resistances into other climatic and hydrological models.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{operational}} model {{to estimate the}} actual evapotranspiration (ET) of crops cultivated on hilly terrains. This new model has the following three characteristics: (1) ET modelling {{is based on a}} Penman-Monteith (PM) type equation (Monteith 1965) where canopy resistance is simulated by following an approach already illustrated by Katerji and Perrier (<b>Agronomie</b> 3 (6) : 513 - 521, 1983); (2) the estimation of ET, by means of the PM equation, is made by using meteorological variables simulated on sloped sites as input; (3) these variables are simulated by using simple relationships linking the variables measured at a reference site on plane to the topographic characteristics of the site (slope, orientation, altitude as difference between reference, and sloped sites). This approach presents two advantages if compared with previously proposed models: Not only computation steps are greatly simplified but also error sources due to the simulation of climatic variables in sloped sites and the ET estimation are well distinguished. This model was validated at hourly and daily scales at four sites cultivated with wheat and oats offering a wide range of slope and orientation values: a reference site on plane, site 1 (9 A degrees sloping, NW orientation, 7 m from the reference site in plane), site 2 (6 A degrees, SE, 12 m) and site 3 (1 A degrees, SE, 18 m). At hourly scale, the new model performed well at all sites studied. The observed slope of the linear relationships between estimated and measured ET values ranged between 0. 93 and 1. 03, with coefficients of determination, r (2), between 0. 80 and 0. 98. At daily scale, the slopes of the linear relationships between measured and estimated ET for the sites on plane and the sloped sites were practically the same (0. 98 A +/- 0. 01); however, the coefficient of determination r (2) observed in the site on plane was clearly greater (0. 98) than that observed in the sloped sites (0. 83). The presented analysis does not show any significant systematic effect of topography (slope and orientation of the plots) on the good performance of the proposed model for the ET estimation. Furthermore, we observed that coefficients of determination tend to decrease with the increase in the slope of the site, which translates into increased inaccuracy of the climatic variables simulation, in particular the net radiation, as the slope of the site increases. The proposed model allows to verify the different steps for calculating the fluxes, to identify the eventual sources of error and to make the needed corrections. For this reasons, the proposed model seems to be particularly "operational", i. e. a useful tool for estimating fluxes on hilly terrains...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Organic Farming and Integrated Pest Management aim to favour and to rely {{on natural}} enemies for pest management. The ability of plant {{diversity}} to provide the orchard with natural enemies without any induced damage was studied: (1) in hedgerow lined orchards from different areas {{in order to assess}} the effect of hedgerows on the orchard arthropod community and (2) in experimental orchards, in order to test tree assemblages designed for the pear orchard, likely to supply the crop with psyllid (Cacopsylla pyri) antagonists. Materials and methods Arthropods were sampled fortnightly from April to October 1997 in eight (8) commercial pear orchards (Bartlett cultivar) and from main tree species of their lining hedgerows. For each tree species, 30 shoots (1 shoot per tree) were hit (Fauvel et al., 1981) at each sampling date. Three equal areas were delimited within each orchard: one along (one of) the hedgerow, another one {{in the middle of the}} orchard (central area) and the last one opposite (due to strong Northern wind, hedgerows are East-West oriented). For each orchard and each sampling date, 30 shoots were hit in each of these 3 areas. Using the same method, arthropods were sampled during 4 years from two experimental pear orchards (Bartlett cultivar) and from each species of the tested mixed hedgerows. All the sampled arthropods have been identified, at least at the family level, allowing to give information about the biology of each arthropod (phytophagous, predatory, parasitic, pollinating, detritiphagous,…). Results and discussion 40 095 arthropods representing 195 taxonomic families were sampled from commercial orchards and associated tree species. Sambucus nigra, Cornus sanguinea, Hedera helix and Coronilla emerus hosted a wide range of beneficial arthropods (generalist predators, parasitic insects) and did not shared major pest with the orchard, unlike Crataegus monogyna (which hosted fireblight), Rubus fructicosus, Populus nigra or Lonicera sp. (which hosted detrimental phytophagous arthropods). Beneficial diversity and numbers were lower for Alnus cordata, Cercis siliquastrum, Cupressus sp., Acer campestre and Robinia pseudacacia. Although they were generally higher in edge areas, orchard arthropod diversity and richness were not significantly different (variance analysis) between inner and edge areas. Pest management is likely to level possible differences within the orchard. The tested assemblages showed to provide psyllid antagonists (Anthocorid bugs, generalist predators) with food and shelter all year long: late flowering and indeciduous leaf species (Arbutus unedo, Hedera helix) offering wintering shelters; early flowering species (Salix capraea, Corylus avellana, Viburnum tinus) offering pollen; species offering alternate preys and/or flowers (Sambucus nigra, Cornus sanguinea, Fraxinus oxyphylla, Corylus avellana). Conclusion This study allowed to provide information about the risk and the benefit of planting different tree species in the agroecosystem. Hedgerow border effect on the orchard arthropods is most probably related to the biology and the ability to move of each arthropod species and needs a specific study; biological and microclimatic effects can therefore cumulate. Further research is needed about the effect of more complex assemblages, including tree species and grass assemblages. Different scale at the landscape level could also be considered.

40|$|In {{a rapidly}} {{changing}} world, human activities offer opportunities for many plant species to colonize new areas. Increasingly, it is recognized that colonization can be accompanied by different ecological and evolutionary processes, acting over relatively short periods of time. When populations colonize novel environments, individuals’ phenotypes will depend {{on a combination of}} different, non-exclusive processes, including phenotypic plasticity (PP), local adaptation (LA), environmental maternal effects (EME) and genetic drift (GD) (Monty and Mahy 2009 b). Despite these processes have long been studied independently, few {{attempts have been made to}} simultaneously address the importance of those processes in plant colonization. Here, we present a set of related studies aiming at disentangling the role of PP, LA, EME and GD in Senecio inaequidens (Asteraceae) in southern France, where it was introduced at a single wool-processing site in the late 19 th century. We used seeds from populations growing in contrasted climates to explore the phenotypic variation related to climate. We performed several common garden experiments (Monty et al. 2009, Monty and Mahy 2009 a, 2010), as well as a reciprocal sowing experiment with gardens under Mediterranean and Pyrenean climates (Monty et al. in revision). We analyzed climatic phenotypic variation in germination, growth, reproduction, leaf physiology and survival. We characterized genetic structure in the studied populations using AFLP. We found consistent genetic differentiation in growth traits but no home-site advantage, thus weak support for LA to climatic conditions. In contrast, genetic differentiation showed a relationship to colonization history. PP in response to climate was observed for most traits, and it played a particularly important role in leaf trait variation. EME mediated by seed mass influenced all but leaf traits under harsh climate. Heavier, earlier-germinating seeds produced larger individuals that eventually produced more flower heads throughout the growing season. However in a milder climate, EME were negligible. Our different studies suggest that phenotypic variation in response to climate depends on various ecological and evolutionary processes associated with geographical zone and life history traits. Therefore, we argue that a “local adaptation vs. phenotypic plasticity” approach, as often considered in the literature, is not sufficient to fully understand what shapes phenotypic variation and genetic architecture of colonizing populations.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{constraints}} to agricultural research in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, is access to current and relevant information {{in the form of}} primary documents, secondary services, machine-readable databases, etc. Progress is hindered or prevented by a variety of factors such as shortage of foreign exchange to purchase primary literature or photocopies, poor communication and resource sharing within national agricultural research systems, lack of awareness of existing information resources and scarcity of qualified information specialists to use information services and resources adequately, and the general low priority given to information-related activities in research budgets. To keep researchers updated on the literature available in their field of research, the target of any information service should be for each researcher or team of researchers to receive current awareness bibliographies with abstracts on a regular basis and, if they do not already have this, a retrospective bibliography in their field of research. The challenge is to make the distribution of this information as effective and efficient as possible. In recognition of the problems and requirements described, CTA launched an SDI pilot project in 1988 together with the Centre de Coop 9 ration Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le D 9 veloppement (CIRAD) in ACP countries in Africa. In 1991 it was extended to all 69 ACP countries with the additional support of CAB International (CABI). This service took off slowly because of difficulties in obtaining specific information about the latest research activities at the national level, the researchers in charge, and existing information resources. The objective of the SDI programme is to allow a researcher to keep abreast with the latest scientific and technical information relevant to his or her field of research by regularly providing information of specific interest. Each potential beneficiary fills in specially designed forms outlining his or her own research programme, a list of 'KEYWORDS' to describe the subject of interest and the subscriber's address. The service aims at providing a minimum of four personal (individual) profiles per country. In addition, ACP countries are divided into six regions and each region is targeted to receive a minimum of 100 profiles on at least 10 subjects of broad interest. As it is beyond the resources of most researchers in the ACP countries to purchase all the documents they identify, the service allows each beneficiary to receive a limited number of selected publications from the bibliographies. This acts as a starting point from which the researchers can trace the latest scientific and technical publications relevant to their work. To ensure the success of the service in terms of timeliness, appropriateness and usefulness, it is monitored continuously by means of quick-response reply cards supplied to the beneficiaries. This allows adjustment and improvement of the project in order to prepare the general evaluation which will be done in 1994. The day-to-day management of the SDI services is handled by the Centre International de Documentation en <b>Agronomie</b> des R 9 gions Chaudes (CIRARC/CIRAD) and CAB International (CABI).

40|$|Potatoes are {{commonly}} grown in rotation with cereal and forage crops. Storage trials {{were conducted in}} Prince Edward Island, Canada from 2002 to 2004 to determine whether isolates of Fusarium spp. obtained from cereals or forages were able to cause disease (dry rot) in stored potato tubers. In each year of study, tubers of the cultivars &# 39;Red Norland&# 39;, &# 39;Yukon Gold&# 39; and &# 39;Russet Burbank&# 39; were wounded and then inoculated with an agar plug containing active mycelium {{of one of the}} 30 isolates tested. Following incubation for 5 weeks in a storage facility, tubers were cut longitudinally at the point of inoculation and the depth of necrosis measured. Isolates of F. sambucinum, F. coeruleum and F. avenaceum originating from potato tubers were strongly pathogenic to inoculated potato tubers. Isolates of F. oxysporum f. sp. medicaginis sourced from alfalfa were nonpathogenic to potato tubers, however, isolates of F. avenaceum from alfalfa and clover and F. oxysporum from clover were pathogenic to potatoes. Isolates of F. poae and F. sporotrichioides sourced from cereals were nonpathogenic and weakly pathogenic, respectively, to inoculated tubers. All isolates of F. graminearum (obtained from cereal crops) that were tested were pathogenic to potato tubers. Thus, crops grown in rotation with potatoes may harbour Fusarium spp. that can act as pathogens in subsequent potato crops.
