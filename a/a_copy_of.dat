5|$|A sexy belly dancer named Princess Kashmir {{arrives at}} the party and invites Homer on stage to dance with her. On {{the way to the}} {{restaurant}} bathroom, Bart wanders into the bachelor party room and eagerly snaps a picture of Homer and Kashmir. Bart brings the picture to school and gives <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> it to Milhouse, who promptly gets requests from other students for <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the picture. It is not long before everyone in Springfield has one and Marge sees <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the picture at her aerobics class and is furious. When Homer gets home that day, Marge immediately shoves the picture in his face and demands an explanation. At that point, Bart inadvertently reveals that it was his picture, angering both his parents. After sending Bart to his room, Marge emotionally kicks Homer out of the house. Homer spends the night at Barney's apartment.|$|E
