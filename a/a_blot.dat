5|$|By 1901 Adelaide's horse trams {{were seen}} by the public as <b>a</b> <b>blot</b> on the city's image. With a {{population}} of 162,000 the slow speed of the trams, and the lines subsequent low traffic capacity, made them inadequate for public transport needs. The unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer. The 10pounds of manure each horse left behind daily, was also not well regarded. Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies. A 28 March 1906 newspaper notice announced {{that the government had}} purchased all of the city tramways for £280,000. Bill No.913, passed 22 December 1906, created the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) with the authority to build new and purchase existing tramways.|$|E

Farage and other senior UKIP figures have repeatedly spoken out against the construction of wind farms, deeming them <b>a</b> <b>blot</b> on the rural landscape. UKIP's media present renewable energy as inefficient and unaffordable, and they promote the use of fossil fuels, nuclear energy and fracking.|$|E

25|$|His first evil deed was {{the murder}} of the Norwegian petty king Vikar (Wicarus). Starkad had joined a Viking {{expedition}} with Vikar, but they found themselves stopped by a strong wind. They then had the idea that they could appease the gods by performing <b>a</b> <b>blót</b> with human blood, and decided to cast lots as to whom was to be sacrificed. Starkad made a noose of willow and put it around the king's neck in the pretense that it was only for show and not for killing. However, the knot was so strong that the king was dying, and Starkad gave him the coup de grace with his sword. Others say that the noose of willow suddenly became so strong that the king was strangled.|$|E
25|$|After {{four decades}} of prosperous trading, the missionaries started the proselytisation around 1540 and during this period, foreign missionaries also made many new {{converts}} to Christianity. Early Roman Catholic missionaries, particularly the Portuguese, led by the Jesuit St Francis Xavier (1506–1552), expanded from their bases {{on the west coast}} making many converts. The Portuguese colonial government supported the mission and the baptised Christians were given incentives like rice donations, good positions in their colonies. Hence, these Christians were dubbed Rice Christians who even practised their old religion. At the same time many New Christians from Portugal migrated to India {{as a result of the}} inquisition in Portugal. Many of them were suspected of being Crypto-Jews, converted Jews who were secretly practising their old religion. Both were considered a threat to the solidarity of Christian belief. which is considered <b>a</b> <b>blot</b> on the history of Roman Catholic Christianity in India, both by Christians and non-Christians alike.|$|E

The failure of Robert Falcon Scott to beat the Norwegian Roald Amundsen to the South Pole in 1911 was considered <b>a</b> <b>blot</b> on Britain's reputation in polar exploration. Shackleton's expedition was intended to return {{the country to the}} forefront of Antarctic endeavour. He set up his headquarters at Burlington Road in London, and was interviewing candidates for the expedition.

500|$|In 1954 the AEC was {{considering}} rescinding Oppenheimer's security clearance on suspicion {{that he was}} a Communist. Smyth was still the only scientist on the commission. Despite his personal dislike of Oppenheimer and pressure from the commission's new chairman, Lewis Strauss, Smyth was the sole commissioner to vote against stripping Oppenheimer's clearance on June 29, 1954. Smyth resigned from the AEC on September 30 of that year out of frustration with Strauss. Eulogizing Oppenheimer in 1967, Smyth said of Oppenheimer's treatment, [...] "Such a wrong can never be righted; such <b>a</b> <b>blot</b> on our history never erased.... We regret that his great work for his country was repaid so shabbily".|$|E
500|$|Mary {{was convicted}} on 25 October {{and sentenced to}} death with only one commissioner, Lord Zouche, expressing any form of dissent. Despite this, Elizabeth hesitated to order her execution, {{even in the face of}} {{pressure}} from the English Parliament to carry out the sentence. She was concerned that the killing of a queen set a discreditable precedent, and was fearful of the consequences, especially if, in retaliation, Mary's son James formed an alliance with the Catholic powers and invaded England. Elizabeth asked Paulet, Mary's final custodian, if he would contrive a clandestine way to [...] "shorten the life" [...] of Mary, which he refused to do on the grounds that he would not make [...] "a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great <b>a</b> <b>blot</b> on my poor posterity". On 1 February 1587, Elizabeth signed the death warrant, and entrusted it to William Davison, a privy councillor. On the 3rd, ten members of the Privy Council of England, having been summoned by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge, decided to carry out the sentence at once.|$|E

500|$|Sumbel {{often takes}} place {{following}} <b>a</b> <b>blót.</b> In the U.S., the sumbel commonly involves a drinking horn being filled with mead and passed among the assembled participants, who either drink from it directly, or pour some {{into their own}} drinking vessels to consume. During this process, toasts are made, as are verbal tributes to gods, heroes, and ancestors. Then, oaths and boasts (promises of future actions) might be made, {{both of which are}} considered binding on the speakers due to the sacred context of the sumbel ceremony. According to Snook, the sumbel has a strong social role, representing [...] "a game of politicking, of socializing, cementing bonds of peace and friendship and forming new relationships" [...] within the Heathen community. During her ethnographic research, Pizza observed an example of a sumbel that took place in Minnesota in 2006 with the purpose of involving Heathen children; rather than mead, the drinking horn contained apple juice, and the toasting accompanied the children taping pictures of apples to a poster of a tree that symbolized the apple tree of Iðunn from Norse mythology.|$|E
500|$|The Australian {{press and}} cricket {{officials}} immediately condemned the riot, which dominated {{the front pages}} of the local newspapers, even though the infamous bushranger Ned Kelly and his gang had raided Jerilderie on the same weekend. The local media were united in their disgust at the scenes of tumult, fearing a public relations disaster would erupt in England. [...] The Sydney Morning Herald called the riot [...] "a national humiliation", and that it [...] "would remain <b>a</b> <b>blot</b> upon the colony for some years to come". They accused those involved in gambling of inciting [...] "larrikins" [...] and [...] "roughs" [...] to storm the field and attack the Englishmen. [...] However, they also suggested that some of the blame should be put on one of the English professionals, who [...] "made use of a grossly insulting remark to the crowd about their being nothing but 'sons of convicts'". Barton defended the Englishmen and Coulthard, saying that none had done anything wrong. He claimed that Emmett and Ulyett were incapable of insulting the Australians in such a way.|$|E
500|$|Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for {{the next}} ten years. At his grandfather's wish his {{principal}} instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM. The Observer wryly commented, [...] "of the page... we will not speak", but acknowledged that Bennett sang pleasingly and to the satisfaction of the audience. The Harmonicon, however, called his performance [...] "in every way <b>a</b> <b>blot</b> on the piece".|$|E

500|$|Ruth's {{penchant for}} hitting home runs altered how {{baseball}} is played. Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games {{by getting a}} runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base, the bunt, and the hit and run. Advocates of what was dubbed [...] "inside baseball", such as Giants manager McGraw, disliked the home run, considering it <b>a</b> <b>blot</b> on {{the purity of the}} game. According to sportswriter W. A. Phelon, after the 1920 season, Ruth's breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance, [...] "settled, for all time to come, that the American public is nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching. Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth, exponent of the home run, and overshadowing star." [...] Bill James noted, [...] "When the owners discovered that the fans liked to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace , then there was no turning back." [...] While a few, such as McGraw and Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers.|$|E
500|$|Elliston leased {{the theatre}} from 1819 until he went {{bankrupt}} in 1826. An American, Stephen Price, followed (1826–1830); then {{through most of}} the remainder of the 19th century, Drury Lane passed quickly from one proprietor to another. A colonnade was added to the Russell Street frontage, in 1831, by architect Samuel Beazley. In 1833, Alfred Bunn gained control of both Drury Lane and Covent Garden, managing the former from 1833 to 1839, and again from 1843 to 1850. [...] Following the lead of the Lyceum Theatre, London, Bunn championed English opera, rather than the Italian operas that had played earlier at the theatre. [...] These included Fair Rosamond and Farinelli by John Barnett; a series of twelve operas by Michael Balfe including The Maid of Artois and The Bohemian Girl; Maritana and others by William Vincent Wallace and several by Julius Benedict. [...] In 1837, actor-manager Samuel Phelps (1804–1878) joined the company at Drury Lane, appearing with William Charles Macready, the gifted actor-manager in a number of Shakespeare plays. He also created the role of Captain Channel in Douglas Jerrold's melodrama, The Prisoner of War (1842), and of Lord Tresham in Robert Browning's <b>A</b> <b>Blot</b> in the 'Scutcheon (1843). [...] Macready was briefly manager in 1841–1843, putting significant reforms in place. Nevertheless, most productions there were financial disasters.|$|E
500|$|In Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe, {{the term}} blót {{referred}} to animal sacrifice performed {{to thank the}} deities and gain their favor. Such sacrifices have generally proved impractical for most modern practitioners, {{due to the fact}} that skills in animal slaughter are not widely taught, while the slaughter of animals is regulated by government in Western countries. In 2007 Strmiska noted that a [...] "small but growing" [...] number of Heathen practitioners in the U.S. had begun performing animal sacrifice as a part of blót. Those who do so typically follow the procedure outlined in the Heimskringla: the throat of the sacrificial animal is slashed with a sharp knife, and the blood is collected in a bowl before being sprinkled onto both participants of the rite and statues of the gods. Animals used for this purpose have included poultry as well as larger mammals like sheep and pigs, with the meat then being consumed by those attending the rite. Some practitioners have made alterations to this procedure: Strmiska noted two American Heathens who decided to use a rifle shot to the head to kill the animal swiftly, a decision made after they witnessed <b>a</b> <b>blót</b> in which the animal's throat was cut incorrectly and it slowly died in agony; they felt that such practices would have displeased the gods and accordingly brought harm upon those carrying out the sacrifice.|$|E
50|$|The Eastern blot is {{used for}} the {{detection}} of specific posttranslational modifications of proteins.

50|$|<b>A</b> dot <b>blot</b> (or slot <b>blot)</b> is <b>a</b> {{technique}} in molecular biology {{used to detect}} biomolecules, and for detecting, analyzing, and identifying proteins. It represents a simplification of the northern blot, Southern blot, or western <b>blot</b> methods. In <b>a</b> dot <b>blot</b> the biomolecules to be detected are not first separated by electrophoresis. Instead, a mixture containing the molecule to be detected is applied directly on a membrane as a dot, and then is spotted through circular templates directly onto the membrane or paper substrate. This differs from the western blot because protein samples are not separated electrophoretically. This is then followed by detection by either nucleotide probes (for <b>a</b> northern <b>blot</b> and southern blot) or antibodies (for <b>a</b> western <b>blot).</b>|$|R

500|$|A 2003 {{survey of}} {{residents}} living around Scotland's 10 existing wind farms found {{high levels of}} community acceptance and strong support for wind power, with much support from those who lived closest to the wind farms. The results of this survey support those of an earlier Scottish Executive survey 'Public attitudes to the Environment in Scotland 2002', which found that the Scottish public would prefer {{the majority of their}} electric power to come from renewables, and which rated wind power as the cleanest source of renewable energy. A survey conducted in 2005 showed that 74% of people in Scotland agree that wind farms are necessary to meet current and future energy needs. When people were asked the same question in a Scottish renewables study conducted in 2010, 78% agreed. The increase is significant as there were twice as many wind farms in 2010 as there were in 2005. The 2010 survey also showed that 52% disagreed with the statement that wind farms are [...] "ugly and <b>a</b> <b>blot</b> on the landscape". 59% agreed that wind farms were necessary and that how they looked was unimportant. Regarding tourism, query responders consider power pylons, cell phone towers, quarries and plantations more negatively than wind farms. Scotland is planning to obtain 100% of electric power from renewable sources by 2020.|$|E
500|$|During the {{presentation}} of evidence against her, Mary broke down and pointed accusingly at Walsingham saying, [...] "all {{of this is the}} work of Monsieur de Walsingham for my destruction", to which he replied, [...] "God is my witness that as a private person I have done nothing unworthy of an honest man, and as Secretary of State, nothing unbefitting my duty." [...] Mary was found guilty and the warrant for her execution was drafted, but Elizabeth hesitated to sign it, despite pressure from Walsingham. Walsingham wrote to Paulet urging him to find [...] "some way to shorten the life" [...] of Mary to relieve Elizabeth of the burden, to which Paulet replied indignantly, [...] "God forbid that I should make so foul a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great <b>a</b> <b>blot</b> to my poor posterity, to shed blood without law or warrant." [...] Walsingham made arrangements for Mary's execution; Elizabeth signed the warrant on 1 February 1587 and entrusted it to William Davison, who had been appointed as junior Secretary of State in late September 1586. Davison passed the warrant to Cecil and a privy council convened by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge agreed to carry out the sentence as soon as was practical. Within a week, Mary was beheaded. On hearing of the execution, Elizabeth claimed not to have sanctioned the action and that she had not meant Davison to part with the warrant. Davison was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Walsingham's share of Elizabeth's displeasure was small because he was absent from court, at home ill, in the weeks just before and after the execution. Davison was eventually released in October 1588, on the orders of Cecil and Walsingham.|$|E
