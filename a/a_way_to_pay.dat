When his landlady demands that he pay his bill and quit the premises, he reveals part of his invisibility to her in a fit of pique.

25|$|George Grenville became prime {{minister}} in April 1763 after {{the failure of the}} short-lived Bute Ministry, and he had to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for this large peacetime army. Raising taxes in Britain was out of the question, since there had been virulent protests in England against the Bute ministry's 1763 cider tax, with Bute being hanged in effigy. The Grenville ministry therefore decided that Parliament would raise this revenue by taxing the American colonists without their consent. This was something new; Parliament had previously passed measures to regulate trade in the colonies, but it had never before directly taxed the colonies to raise revenue.|$|E

500|$|When Colt {{returned}} to the United States in 1832, {{he went back to}} work for his father, who financed the production of two guns, a rifle and a pistol. The first completed pistol exploded when it was fired, but the rifle performed well. His father would not finance any further development, so Samuel needed to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the development of his ideas. He had learned about nitrous oxide (laughing gas) from the factory chemist in his father's textile plant, so he took a portable lab on the road and earned a living performing laughing gas demonstrations across the United States and Canada, billing himself as [...] "the Celebrated Dr. Coult of New-York, London and Calcutta". Colt conceived of himself as a man of science and thought if he could enlighten people about a new idea like nitrous oxide, he could in turn make people more receptive to his new idea concerning a revolver. He started his lectures on street corners and soon worked his way up to lecture halls and museums. As ticket sales declined, Colt realized that [...] "serious" [...] museum lectures were not what the people wanted to pay money to see and that it was dramatic stories of salvation and redemption the public craved. While visiting his brother, John, in Cincinnati, he partnered with sculptor, Hiram Powers, for his demonstrations with a theme based on The Divine Comedy. Powers made detailed wax sculptures and paintings based on demons, centaurs and mummies from Dante. Colt constructed fireworks to complete the show, which was a success. According to Colt historian Robert Lawrence Wilson, the [...] "lectures launched Colt's celebrated career as a pioneer Madison Avenue-style pitchman". His public speaking skills were so prized that he was thought to be a doctor and was pressed into service to cure an apparent cholera epidemic on board a riverboat by giving his patients a dose of nitrous oxide.|$|E

2500|$|Civilian {{labor was}} crucial to VC/NVA success, and was {{deployed}} in building fortifications, transporting supplies and equipment, prepositioning material in readiness for an operation, and general construction such as road repair. [...] Labor was recruited primarily by impressment/draft, or as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> off VC taxes, although volunteers motivated by ideology also took part. Twelve to sixteen hours of work per day were expected of laborers.

2500|$|Bannon has {{advocated}} {{reductions in}} immigration, and restrictions on free trade, particularly with China and Mexico.

He also supports significantly increasing spending on infrastructure, describing himself as [...] "the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan". Bannon is opposed to government bailouts, describing them as [...] "socialism for the very wealthy". He generally believes in reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy, declaring at the Conservative Political Action Conference he favored the [...] "deconstruction of the administrative state". However, he does support increased regulation of internet companies like Facebook and Google, which he regards as akin to utilities in the modern age. He opposed the merger between Time-Warner and AT on antitrust grounds. He was a strong opponent of the Paris climate agreement within the administration, successfully persuading the President to withdraw from it.|$|E

[...] "But at that time it was before September 11, and there was no terrorism," [...] Lynch recalls, [...] "so we were like, 'that would never happen to me.'" [...] On September 19, 2001, Lynch entered basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. [...] She later completed Advanced Individual Training for her Military Occupational Specialty as a unit supply specialist (MOS 92Y) in the Quartermaster Corps at Fort Lee, Virginia.|$|E

2500|$|There {{was also}} {{widespread}} speculation, based on Riggs' unusually poor play and {{large number of}} unforced errors, that Riggs had purposely lost the match {{in order to win}} large sums of money that he had bet against himself, as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> off his gambling debts. ESPN's Outside the Lines on August 25, 2013 featured {{a man who had been}} silent for 40 years who said he heard several members of the mafia talking about Riggs throwing the match in exchange for cancelling his gambling debt to the mob. On the other hand, the article says Riggs' close friend and estate executor Lornie Kuhle vehemently denied he was ever in debt to the mob or received a payoff from them. The article also quotes Riggs' son who claims his father felt he had made a terrible mistake and was depressed for six months following the match. Riggs wanted a rematch but not King. He considered suing her as a rematch had been part of the contract. King and Riggs would appear together spoofing their rivalry less than two months after the match on an episode of The Odd Couple (titled [...] "The Pig Who Came To Dinner") and they became good friends.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Six Flags {{partnered with}} Brash Entertainment {{to create a}} video game based on the Six Flags parks named Six Flags Fun Park. The game was first {{released}} on the Nintendo DS and PC in October 2008. The Wii version was delayed after Brash Entertainment {{went out of business}} and so the rights were taken over by Ubisoft and released the game on the Wii in March 2009. The game allows players to explore the themed areas and mini-games representative of a visit to a Six Flags park. In the game, players are tasked with quests that encourage them to explore the park's universe. After creating a unique custom character, Six Flags Fun Park patrons can win prizes, and compete with other players in 40 mini-games. Although the video game is called Six Flags Fun Park, it lacks any major reference of Six Flags outside of the names of the different areas. This caused some to speculate that the video game was created separately, then the rights to {{the name of the game}} were sold as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the game's development. When the game was released, it eventually ended up getting abysmal ratings across the board. IGN gave the Wii version a 4.5 out of 10, saying [...] "The quests are uninteresting and the game's '40 Thrilling Games' (as touted by the box) are far from entertaining." ...|$|E
