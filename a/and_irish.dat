5|$|Historically, the British <b>and</b> <b>Irish</b> Lions were {{intended}} as a representative team of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland however, when the Irish Free State {{broke away from the}} United Kingdom it was deemed inappropriate for the British <b>and</b> <b>Irish</b> Lions to use the British national anthem, God Save the Queen. As a result of this, the British <b>and</b> <b>Irish</b> Lions did not have an anthem to represent them before any of their matches until 2005.|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} aimed {{to assess the}} social, national and political identities {{of members of the}} <b>Irish</b> <b>and</b> Northern <b>Irish</b> diaspora in England.

Two hundred and fifty-one members of the <b>Irish</b> <b>and</b> Northern <b>Irish</b> diaspora in England rated themselves on a number of ethnic identity items. It was determined that there are significant differences between the social, national and political identities of the <b>Irish</b> <b>and</b> Northern <b>Irish</b> diasporic groups <b>and</b> that there are significant differences between the social, national and political identities of the Northern <b>Irish</b> Catholic <b>and</b> Protestant diasporic groups.
