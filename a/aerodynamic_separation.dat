2500|$|Aerodynamic {{enrichment}} processes include the Becker jet nozzle techniques developed by E. W. Becker and associates using the LIGA {{process and the}} vortex tube separation process. These <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>separation</b> processes depend upon diffusion driven by pressure gradients, as does the gas centrifuge. They in general have the disadvantage of requiring complex systems of cascading of individual separating elements to minimize energy consumption. In effect, aerodynamic processes {{can be considered as}} non-rotating centrifuges. Enhancement of the centrifugal forces is achieved by dilution of UF6 with hydrogen or helium as a carrier gas achieving a much higher flow velocity for the gas than could be obtained using pure uranium hexafluoride. The Uranium Enrichment Corporation of South Africa (UCOR) developed and deployed the continuous Helikon vortex separation cascade for high production rate low enrichment and the substantially different semi-batch Pelsakon low production rate high enrichment cascade both using a particular vortex tube separator design, and both embodied in industrial plant. [...] A demonstration plant was built in Brazil by NUCLEI, a consortium led by Industrias Nucleares do Brasil that used the separation nozzle process. However all methods have high energy consumption and substantial requirements for removal of waste heat; none are currently still in use.|$|E

40|$|Wind turbine {{acoustic}} noise {{has been the}} subject of significant research in recent decades due to rapid growth in the wind energy industry. Available space with a reliable wind resource and that does not reside near populated areas is becoming extremely scarce, particularly in Europe. This decline in available space then results in a heightened need for wind turbine designs to be optimized for both acoustic emission and power-performance. Due to highly variable operating conditions, wind turbine {{acoustic noise}} emission may deviate from design levels, causing irritation to local residents and requiring reduced power production of the contributing turbines. The objective of this dissertation is to investigate two parameters that contribute to this variability [...] atmospheric turbulence in the inflow field, and <b>aerodynamic</b> flow <b>separation</b> [...] such that they may be more fully understood and properly accounted for in design. Results are achieved through an extensive experimental campaign on a full-scale turbine equipped with a thorough sensor network. Several novel flow characterization methods are developed, including a method of in-situ turbulence measurement using blade-mounted accelerometers. Turbulent inflow noise is shown to dominate the low frequency portion of the emitted spectrum for normal turbine operation and increases levels by as much as 6 dB for the conditions observed at the research facility. Experimental observations are typically within 2 - 3 dB of a commonly implemented noise prediction model. Finally, a study into the effects of high angle of attack operation shows that <b>aerodynamic</b> flow <b>separation</b> [...] detected using static pressure sensors along one blade of the turbine [...] -can increase overall noise levels by more than 10 dB, thus dominating turbulent inflow noise at low frequencies.

The main {{aim of this study}} was to measure and compare the aerodynamic characteristics of these materials to provide the data and to facilitate the design and adjustment of machines that perform separation of pomegranate arils from rind and locular septa based on aerodynamic characteristics (terminal velocity, drag coefficient and Reynolds number). To achieve this objective, Ashraf variety pomegranate fruit during its maturity stages was studied. The obtained results showed that the variation in maturity stage significantly influenced the terminal velocity, drag coefficient and Reynolds number (P< 0. 05). During the fruit maturity, the terminal velocity of locular septa, rind and pomegranate aril increased from 1. 05 to 1. 16, 3. 16 to 3. 73 and 5. 89 to 6. 70 ms− 1, respectively. The corresponding value of drag coefficient of the three studied materials decreased from 0. 92 to 0. 79, 0. 75 to 0. 59 and 0. 53 to 0. 36, respectively with advancing fruit maturity. Also these ranges for Reynolds number were 403. 24 – 617. 75, 1213. 44 – 1986. 37 and 2261. 76 – 3568. 02, respectively.

40|$|Miners {{are exposed}} to silica-bearing dust {{which can lead to}} silicosis, a {{potentially}} fatal lung disease. Currently, airborne silica is measured by collecting filter samples and sending them to a laboratory for analysis. Since this may take weeks, a field method is needed to inform decisions aimed at reducing exposures. This study investigates a field-portable Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) method for end-of-shift (EOS) measurement of silica on filter samples. Since the method entails localized analyses, spatial uniformity of dust deposition can affect accuracy and repeatability. The study, therefore, assesses the influence of radial deposition uniformity on the accuracy of the method. Using laboratory-generated Minusil and coal dusts and three different types of sampling systems, multiple sets of filter samples were prepared. All samples were collected in pairs to create parallel sets for training and validation. Silica was measured by FTIR at nine locations across the face of each filter and the data analyzed using a multiple regression analysis technique that compared various models for predicting silica mass on the filters using different numbers of "analysis shots. " It was shown that deposition uniformity is independent of particle type (kaolin vs. silica), which suggests the role of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>separation</b> is negligible. Results also reflected the correlation between the location and number of shots versus the predictive accuracy of the models. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the models when predicting mass of validation samples was 4 %- 51 % depending on the number of points analyzed and the type of sampler used, which affected the uniformity of radial deposition on the filters. It was shown that using a single shot {{at the center of the}} filter yielded predictivity adequate for a field method, (93 % return, CV approximately 15 %) for samples collected with 3 -piece cassettes.

40|$|Meteors with peak {{magnitudes}} fainter than + 2 {{are typically}} called faint meteors, {{resulting from the}} atmospheric entry and ablation of meteoroids less massive than 10 - 4 kg. The processes of luminous wake formation and fragmentation, which occur during ablation, are poorly understood for faint meteors, and are important constraints for models of meteoroid structure. The goal of this work is to improve understanding of these processes through analysis of high-resolution intensified video observations, and creation of a detailed meteoroid ablation model. In {{the first part of}} this work, thirty faint meteors observed with the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) are analysed, revealing meteor trails with widths up to 100 m at heights above 110 km. These widths vary with height as the inverse of the atmospheric density, suggesting that formation of the wake is related to collisions between evaporated meteoric atoms and atmospheric molecules. Next, nine fragmenting faint meteors captured with CAMO are examined. Fragments from eight of the nine meteors are found to have transverse speeds up to 100 m s- 1. These speeds are not explained by <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>separation</b> theory typically used for brighter meteors that fragment at lower heights. Instead, fragment separation by rotational breakup of the meteoroid or electrostatic repulsion are considered, giving meteoroid strength estimates up to 1 MPa. These strengths are typical of meteorite-producing meteoroids and are larger than expected for small meteoroids. Finally, a single-body ablation model, based on modelling collisions between the meteoroid, meteoric atoms, and atmospheric molecules, is devised to explain wake formation. Synthetic meteor trail widths and lengths, as well as light curves and deceleration profiles, are compared to observations of nine meteors from {{the first part of this}} thesis. The widths of simulated meteor wakes show good agreement with observations, but simulated wake lengths are too short. This suggests that collisional de-excitation of meteoric particles is a plausible process for wake formation, but also that meteoroid fragmentation likely increases the length of the meteor wake. Compared to observations, simulated light curves are longer, and simulated meteoroids experience less deceleration, suggesting that meteoroid fragmentation should be investigated in the next iteration of the model...|$|E

As of now, these instruments are imported at a cost of several lakhs of rupees; hence an effort has been made to develop an aerodynamic particle sizer indigenously in BARC. This unit, referred to as BARC Aerodynamic Size Separator (BASS), separates aerosols into seven size classes ranging from 0. 53 mu m to 10 mu m and operates at a flow rate of 45 Ipm. Intercomparison studies between the standard Andersen Mark-II (Grasbey Andersen Inc.) impactor and BASS using nebulizer generated aerosols have consistently shown excellent performance by BASS in all respects. In particular, BASS yielded the parameters of polydisperse aerosols quite accurately. Experiments to evaluate the individual stage cut-off diameters show that these are within 8 % of their designed value for all stages except the higher two stages which indicate about 30 % lower values than the designed ones. The replotting of all the mass distribution data using the experimental cut-off diameters showed perfect lognormal fits, thereby indicating that these diameters are closer to the true stage cut-off diameters for BASS.

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the most difficult step in building a nuclear weapon is acquiring fissile material, either plutonium or highly enriched uranium (HEU). Plutonium is produced in a nuclear reactor, whereas HEU is produced using a uranium enrichment process. Enrichment {{is also an important}} step in the civil nuclear fuel cycle, in producing low enriched uranium (LEU) for use as fuel for nuclear reactors to generate electricity. However, the same equipment used to produce LEU for nuclear reactor fuel {{can also be used to}} produce HEU for weapons. Safeguards at an enrichment plant are the array of assurances and verification techniques that ensure uranium is not diverted or enriched to HEU. There are several techniques for enriching uranium. The two most prevalent are gaseous diffusion, which uses older technology and requires a lot of energy, and gas centrifuge separation, which uses more advanced technology and is more energy efficient. Gaseous diffusion plants (GDPs) provide about 40 % of current world enrichment capacity but are being phased out as newer gas centrifuge enrichment plants (GCEPs) are constructed. Estimates of current and future enrichment capacity are always approximate, due to the constant upgrades, expansions, and shutdowns occurring at enrichment plants, largely determined by economic interests. Currently, the world enrichment capacity is approximately 56 million kilogram separative work units (SWU) per year, with 22. 5 million in gaseous diffusion and more than 33 million in gas centrifuge plants. Another 34 million SWU/year of capacity is under construction or planned for the near future, almost entirely using gas centrifuge separation. Other less-efficient techniques have also been used in the past, including electromagnetic and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>separations,</b> but these are considered obsolete, at least from a commercial perspective. Laser isotope separation shows promise as a possible enrichment technique of the future but has yet to be demonstrated commercially. In the early 1980 s, six countries developing gas centrifuge technology (United States, United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, and Australia) along with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Atomic Energy Community began developing effective safeguards techniques for GCEPs. This effort was known as the Hexapartite Safeguards Project (HSP). The HSP had the goal of maximizing safeguards effectiveness while minimizing the cost to the operator and inspectorate, and adopted several recommendations, such as the acceptance of limited-frequency unannounced access inspections in cascade halls, and the use of nondestructive assay measurements and tamper-indicating seals. While only the HSP participants initially committed to implementing all the measures of the approach, it has been used as a model for the safeguards applied to GCEPs in additional states. Uranium enrichment capacity has continued to expand on all fronts in the last few years. GCEP capacity is expanding in anticipation of the eventual shutdown of the less-efficient GDPs, the termination of the U. S. -Russia HEU blend-down program slated for 2013, and the possible resurgence of nuclear reactor construction as part of an expected 'Nuclear Renaissance'. Overall, a clear trend in the world profile of uranium enrichment plant operation is the continued movement towards multinational projects driven by commercial and economic interests. Along this vein, the safeguards community is continuing to develop new safeguards techniques and technologies that are not overly burdensome to enrichment plant operators while delivering more effective and efficient results. This report provides a snapshot overview of world enrichment capacity in 2009, including profiles of the uranium enrichment programs of individual states. It is a revision of a 2007 report on the same topic; significant changes in world enrichment programs between the previous and current reports are emphasized.

40|$|In {{transonic}} flow conditions, the shock wave / {{turbulent boundary layer}} interaction and flow separations on wing upper surface of a civil aircraft, which induce flow instabilities, “buffet”, and then structure vibrations, “buffeting”, can greatly influence the aerodynamic behavior. The “buffet ” phenomenon appears when the Mach number or the angle of attack of the aircraft increases. This phenomenon limits aircraft flight envelope. The objectives {{of this study are}} to cancel or to decrease the <b>aerodynamic</b> instabilities (unsteady <b>separation,</b> shock location movement) due to this type of flow by control systems. The following actuators can be used, “Vortex Generators ” situated upstream of the shock location and a new moving part designed by ONERA and situated at the trailing edge of the wing, “Trailing Edge Deflector ” or TED. It looks like an adjustable “Divergent Trailing Edge”. It is an active actuator, it can take different deflections or be driven by dynamic motions up to 250 Hz. Tests were performed in transonic 2 D and 3 D flow with models well equipped with unsteady pressure transducers. For high lift coefficients, a selected deflection of the “Trailing Edge Deflector ” increases the wing aerodynamic performances and delays the “buffet ” onset. Furthermore, in 2 D flow “buffet ” condition, the “Trailing Edge Deflector”, driven by a closed loop active control using the measurements of the unsteady wall static pressures, can greatly reduce the “buffet”. In 3 D flow “buffeting ” conditions, the 2 D flow control principle is available but some differences must be considered. Vortex generators have a great impact on the separated flows. The separated flow instabilities are greatly reduced and the buffet is totally controlled even for strong instabilities. The aerodynamic performances of the airfoil are also greatly increased...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{background}} in the mixed compression engine inlets, the Shock wave / Turbulent Boundary Layer Interaction (STBLI) problem {{has been one of}} the concerns of the <b>aerodynamic</b> industry. Shock-induced <b>separation</b> and the corresponding interaction make the flow losing its quality and reduce inlet total pressure recovery. Various flow-control methods have been tried and investigated by lots of researchers, such as passive controls like vortex generators and active controls like bleeding. Recently, micro vortex generators (MVGs) are paid upon more and more attention as the remarkable experimental ewsults obtained by Barbinsky [1]. The MVG is different from its conventional counterpart by possessing a height of the 20 ~ 60 % width of the boundary layer, while the height of the conventional one is the same order of the width. The basic idea of MVG is to generate the counter-rotating streamwise vortices, which bring the high momentum fluid from the outer flow to the inner boundary; meanwhile the weak jets-like streamwise vortices has the ability to push away the unfavorable flow gradient. When MVGs are put before the separation region, it is possible to reduce the size of separation and make the boundary layer more “healthy ” by means of parameters like the shape factor. Because MVGs are often used in supersonic flows, MVG can produce series of disturbing waves as well. What’s more, due to the existence of a solid body in the flow, a momentum deficit region was found to be superimposed between the pair of the streamwise vortices. As mentioned by Barbinsky [1], this implies larger drag, which is unfavorable to the engineers. In order to investigate the influence of the geometry of MVG to the low momentum deficit, MVGs with different back-edge declining angle are investigated numerically in this work. Two declining angle are selected as 70 º and 45 º. The former is more vertical and similar to the shape used by Barbinsky, the latter declines relatively slowly and smoothly. The sketches of the geometry are shown as following:...|$|R
40|$|Another {{concern for}} the vehicle during its design {{trajectory}} was {{the separation of the}} first stage solid rocket booster from the upper stage component after it had depleted its solid fuel propellant. There has been some concern about the interstage of the first stage from clearing the nozzle of the J 2 -X engine. A detailed <b>separation</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> wind tunnel investigation was conducted in the AEDC VKF Tunnel A to help to investigate the interaction aerodynamic effects 5. A comparison of the separation plane details between the Ares I architecture and the Ares I-X demonstration flight architecture is shown in figure 12. The Ares I design requires a more complex separation sequence and requires better control in order to avoid contact with the nozzle of the upper stage engine. The interstage, which houses the J 2 -X engine for the Ares I vehicle, must be able to separate cleanly to avoid contact of the J 2 -X engine. There is only about approximately 18 inches of buffer inside the interstage on each size of the nozzle so this is a challenging controlled separation event. This complex experimental investigation required two separate Ares I models (upper stage and first stage with interstage attached) with independent strain gauge balances installed in each model. It also required the Captive Trajectory System (CTS) that was needed to precisely locate the components in space relative to each other to fill out the planned test matrix. The model setup in the AEDC VKF Tunnel A is shown in figure 13. The CTS remotely positioned the first stage at the required x, y, and z positions and was able to provide interactions within 0. 2 " of the upper stage. A sample of the axial force on the first stage booster is shown in figure 14. These results, as a function of separation distance between the two stages, are compared to pre-test CFD results. Since this is a very challenging, highly unsteady flow field for CFD to correctly model, the experimental results have been utilized by GN&C discipline to more accurately represent the interaction aerodynamics. In addition to the integrated forces and moments obtained from the test, flow visualization data was obtained from this test in the form of Schlieren photographs, as shown in figure 15, which show the shock structure and interaction effects after the two stages separate during flight. This separation test was crucial in the successful flight test of the Ares I-X vehicle and provided the GN&C discipline with the unpowered proximity aerodynamic effect for a separation of the Ares I vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{aerodynamic}} design {{methods have}} generally {{concentrated on the}} optimization of airfoil or wing shapes to produce a minimum drag while satisfying some basic constraints such as lift, pitching moment, or thickness. Since the minimization of drag almost always precludes the existence of separated flow, the evaluation and validation of these design methods for their robustness and accuracy when separated flow is present has not been aggressively pursued. However, two new applications for these design tools {{may be expected to}} include separated flow and the issues of aerodynamic design with this feature must be addressed. The first application of the aerodynamic design tools is the design of airfoils or wings to provide an optimal performance over a wide range of flight conditions (multipoint design). While the definition of 'optimal performance' in the multipoint setting is currently being hashed out, it is recognized that given a wide enough range of flight conditions, it will not be possible to ensure a minimum drag constraint at all conditions, and in fact some amount of separated flow (presumably small) may have to be allowed at the more demanding flight conditions. Thus a multipoint design method must be tolerant of the existence of separated flow and may include some controls upon its extent. The second application is in the design of wings with extended high speed buffet boundaries of their flight envelopes. Buffet occurs on a wing when regions of flow separation have grown to the extent that their time varying pressures induce possible destructive effects upon the wing structure or adversely effect either the aircraft controllability or the passenger comfort. A conservative approach to the expansion of the buffet flight boundary is to simply expand the flight envelope of nonseparated flow under the assumption that buffet will also thus be alleviated. However, having the ability to design a wing with separated flow and thus to control the location, extent, and severity of the separated flow regions may allow aircraft manufacturers to gain an advantage in the early design stages of an aircraft, when configuration changes are relatively inexpensive to make. Continuing the work begun last year, an airfoil design package has been modified to provide some control over the existence and extent of flow separation. This package consists of a 2 -D Navier-Stokes flow solver which is coupled to the CDISC (constrained direct/iterative surface curvature) design method. The first modification is a prediction method for determining whether separation is likely based solely upon a given pressure distribution. If separation is predicted but is undesirable, the new routines will modify the pressure distribution to alleviate the problem. This new pressure distribution is then used in the design method to generate a new <b>aerodynamic</b> shape. Since <b>separation</b> may be acceptable in some cases, particularly if the separation does not extend to the trailing edge, another added logic estimates the extent of separation based upon a correlation with calculated separated flow cases. If the flow behind a shock induced separation is not predicted to reattach before the trailing edge, the logic weakens the shock strength and otherwise alters the pressure distribution in order to promote reattachment. This later addition is as yet unreliable due to secondary separation effects, but additional work is being pursued to improve the method...|$|R
