500|$|I am a {{defeated}} {{and ruined}} war captive, that's it! The former emperor [...] treated me generously, but I betrayed him. In my present defeat, Heaven has vented its fury <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> past I {{have heard that}} Han law stipulates that executions of men be {{carried out in the}} city marketplace. When we arrive in the capital, I request to Zhaling [...] to atone for my crimes to the former emperor. This is my sincere desire.|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> half-reproachful half-affectionate {{manner of}} the kind old uncle who reasons with a headstrong nephew.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] she replied; [...] "a perfect stranger. He stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most impertinent manner. Does he {{belong to}} this place?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ariel looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> double {{intoxication}} of {{the wine}} and the triumph.|$|R

50|$|In 2010, Azizi joined Sanat Naft F.C. after {{spending}} the previous season <b>at</b> <b>Mes</b> Rafsanjan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Azadegan League.|$|R
60|$|The old man {{suddenly}} stood still, {{and looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grey twilight {{as if he}} suspected his own ears of deceiving him.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Didn't {{you ever}} hear of a bird's {{scratching}} around for something to eat, Mr. Rabbit?' he asked, cocking one eye up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> queerest kind of way.|$|E
60|$|His old simple {{character}} and good temper, and something {{of his old}} unlucky fortune also, I thought, smiled <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> smile with which he made this explanation.|$|E
50|$|Sobhani joined Saipa F.C. in 2011, {{after playing}} the {{previous}} two seasons <b>at</b> <b>Mes</b> Sarcheshmeh <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Azadegan League.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Mirtoroghi joined Sanat Naft F.C. after {{spending}} the previous seasons <b>at</b> <b>Mes</b> Kerman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Iran Pro League.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> peeringly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness; and then, {{somewhat}} harshly, ‘Well, I can’t {{leave the}} bridge, my man,’ said he.|$|R
60|$|BLY. I 'ad a bit o' trouble, but I kep' on till I see 'Aigel walkin' <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> loo-lookin' glass. Then I knew I'd got me balance.|$|E
6000|$|And {{the pool}} answered, 'But I loved Narcissus because, {{as he lay}} on my banks and looked down <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror of his eyes I saw ever my own beauty mirrored.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' {{said the}} dappled Colt once more; 'here I must stay for another year. Just kill the twelve little foals again, so that I can suck the mares this year also, {{and then come}} and look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> peeringly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness; and then, {{somewhat}} harshly, [...] "Well, I can't {{leave the}} bridge, my man," [...] said he.|$|R
60|$|I had {{anticipated}} {{that she would}} laugh <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> No! She suddenly raised {{her head as if}} she were looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> intently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark.|$|R
60|$|Unpleasant news {{always made}} the Emperor furious {{against the man}} who broke it. He railed <b>at</b> <b>me</b> now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rasping, croaking, Corsican voice which only made itself heard when {{he had lost his}} self-control.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{admitted}} Mr. Simson with generosity. [...] "It's only natural. It's a {{fight to}} the finish {{between me and the}} Bourgeois. I cover them with ridicule and contempt and they hit back <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> only way they know." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{looked up}} as I entered from the distance, looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distant {{twilight}} of the dusky room, as if I were an intruder, as if I should go away when I had seen them. But I said in German: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} it and then <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most {{singular}} fashion. 'Young man,' said he, 'it is not the letter N.' Then before I could ask further he clapped his spurs into his horses ribs and rode, stomach to earth, upon his way.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mr. Hicks,' says Mrs. Jessup, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{peculiar}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, 'if it wasn't for but one thing, I'd {{ask you to}} hike yourself {{down the}} gulch and never disresume your visits to my house.' ...|$|R
60|$|The next instant, {{the door}} was {{suddenly}} opened, and puss sprang past me, out of harm's way, closely followed by the servant, who stared breathless and aghast <b>at</b> seeing <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall. I went into the dining-room immediately.|$|R
60|$|Her waking, {{which gave}} <b>me</b> a pang <b>at</b> first, afforded <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end a still greater bliss.|$|R
60|$|His lordship's {{large face}} became dimpled {{all over with}} placid smiles, but he made no reply in words. At the same time Sir Percival turned his head, {{observed}} that I was approaching the stairs, and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most rudely angry manner possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Young man," [...] said Pumblechook, {{screwing}} {{his head}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old fashion, [...] "you air a going to Joseph. What {{does it matter}} to me, you ask me, where you air a going? I say to you, Sir, you air a going to Joseph." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{newcomer}} sprang on one side. Louis, {{disturbed by}} my cry, lost his nerve, and the blow fell upon a small side table, smashing it through, and sending splinters {{flying into the}} air. Both men looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blankest of amazement. I came out into the sitting-room.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Osprey {{stopped for}} us to {{overtake}} her. [...] "My dear!" [...] she said to Beatrice. [...] "Such a beautiful gallery!" [...] Then she stared very hard <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> puzzled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most naked fashion to understand who I might be.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I almost {{expected}} {{some such}} news as this,' she replied, {{in a tone}} of much greater indifference. 'I knew suspicion lurked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes of that young man who stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> so <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church path: I could have sworn it.' ...|$|R
50|$|Beyranvand joined Shahrdari Tabriz in 2010 {{after playing}} the {{previous}} season <b>at</b> <b>Mes</b> Rafsanjan F.C. <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Azadegan League.|$|R
60|$|Instead of {{trembling}} {{or looking}} pale, as I {{might have expected}} to see her, Waboose looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most composed manner, and with something on her lip that seemed {{to me like a}} smile of amusement. In some confusion, I thanked her for having saved my life.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll go {{anywhere}} {{so long as}} I {{can get out of}} this beastly country,' he answered wearily. 'I feel people are looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street when I go out, and they're saying to one another: there's the son of that swindling rotter who was sentenced to seven years.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see {{you have}} a great deal of eye," [...] I replied. [...] "Your cousin tells me you are {{studying}} art." [...] He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way without answering, and I went on with deliberate urbanity, [...] "I suppose you are at the studio of one of those great men." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{she looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> giving <b>me</b> <b>the</b> purse, I hoped {{there was an}} inner meaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with displeasure.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then we'd {{better hurry}} up, Oswald,' said Herbert Le Breton, 'for guides {{are the most}} tyrannical set {{of people on the}} entire face of this planet. I shall have another cup of coffee before I go, though, if the guides swear <b>at</b> <b>me</b> roundly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best Roumansch for it, anyhow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You wouldn't believe it, {{that you}} wouldn't,' replied his mother, 'but don't {{say a word}} to him, for I really don't believe he's human. Hush! Don't turn round as if I was talking of him, but he's a squinting <b>at</b> <b>me</b> now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full blaze of the coach-lamp, quite awful!' ...|$|R
