Arya refuses all of Jaqen's offers, and Jaqen tells Arya to follow him, telling her she no longer needs to live as <b>a</b> <b>beggar</b> on the streets.|$|E
5|$|One winter's night, an enchantress {{disguised}} as <b>a</b> <b>beggar</b> offers a cold-hearted prince a rose {{in exchange for}} shelter. When he refuses, she transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects. She bestows the Beast with a magic mirror before hexing the rose and warning him that, unless he learns to love another and earns their love in return {{by the time the}} last petal falls, he and his servants will lose their humanity forever.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, {{blond hair}} and blue eyes—changed radically {{over the course of}} time. As a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for <b>a</b> <b>beggar,</b> such as after the accident that caused his death.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Grameen Bank {{started a}} new program, {{different}} from its traditional group-based lending, exclusively targeted to the beggars in Bangladesh. This program is focused on distributing small loans to beggars. The loans are completely interest-free, the repayment period can be arbitrarily long, and the borrower is covered under life insurance free of cost. For example, <b>a</b> <b>beggar</b> taking a small loan of around 100 taka (about US$1.50) may pay back only 2.00 taka (about 3.4 US cents) per week.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} English {{translation}} of 1847 by Mary Howitt, the tale opens with <b>a</b> <b>beggar</b> woman giving a peasant's wife a barleycorn {{in exchange for}} food. Once planted, a tiny girl, Thumbelina (Tommelise), emerges from its flower. One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a toad who wants her as a bride for her son. With the help of friendly fish and a butterfly, Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a stag beetle who later discards her when his friends reject her company.|$|E

They find accommodation in a small house behind Gopalam's bungalow. Unaware of her true identity, Mary decides to call herself Mahalakshmi.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{director}} Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui {{for the role}} of Khan. Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised {{that for the first time}} he would not have to portray <b>a</b> <b>beggar.</b> Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas. He thought there were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role. He said that Ghosh had known him since childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} Shiva as <b>a</b> <b>beggar</b> {{is not unique}} to the Bhikshatana icon and his legends. Shiva is often {{described}} as wandering the universe as a homeless beggar-ascetic with his consort Parvati's raison d'être being to bring him back to his marital and home life. Shiva is also depicted as asking for alms from the goddess Annapurna, a form of Parvati as the goddess of food. The Satarudriya describes Shiva as gathering food through begging, evocative of his Bhikshatana form. In spite of this he is described as a sustainer of the universe and of life-sustaining food.|$|E

5|$|Thereafter Asser {{seems to}} have divided his time between Wales and Alfred's court. Asser gives no {{information}} about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the battlefield at Ashdown, Cynuit (Countisbury), and Athelney. It is evident from Asser's account that he {{spent a good deal}} of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who is not the same Eadburh who died as <b>a</b> <b>beggar</b> in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.|$|E
5|$|While {{stories of}} pig-faced women vary in detail, {{they have the}} same basic form. A {{pregnant}} noblewoman would be approached by <b>a</b> <b>beggar</b> accompanied by her children, and would dismiss the beggar, and in so doing would in some way compare the beggar's children to pigs. The beggar would curse the pregnant noblewoman, and come the birth of the child it would be a girl, healthy and perfectly formed in every respect other than having the face of a pig.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>beggar</b> woman {{enters the}} shop {{in search of}} Bamford, and Johanna hides in the trunk. The woman recognizes Todd, but upon hearing Turpin coming, Todd kills her and sends her through a {{trapdoor}} in the floor. As Turpin enters, Todd explains that Johanna had repented and is coming to him, then offers a free shave in the meantime. When Turpin finally recognizes Todd as Benjamin Barker, Todd stabs him several times, cuts his throat and sends his body down a trap door to the bakehouse, killing him. Johanna comes out of her hiding place, still in disguise, and Todd prepares to kill her as well, not recognizing her as his daughter. However, hearing Mrs. Lovett scream in horror in the basement after discovering Turpin's body, Todd lets Johanna go.|$|E

5|$|As {{soon as he}} was set free, Theodore {{returned}} to Thessalonica. Lacking any escort or followers, he disguised himself as <b>a</b> <b>beggar</b> in order to enter the city in secret. There he contacted old supporters and favourites, and organized a conspiracy that soon ousted Manuel and took over the city. As Byzantine custom barred him from re-assuming the imperial office due to his blinding, Theodore installed his son John Komnenos Doukas (r. 1237–44) as emperor (without a coronation ceremony), but remained the real ruler of the empire in his son's name. John himself appears to have been mostly interested in religion, and more inclined to enter a monastery than to become emperor. Theodore had to persuade him that being named emperor was a God-given gift, and that he was indeed the rightful Emperor of the Romans due to his imperial descent.|$|E
5|$|In linking these shots together, Hepworth {{attempted}} {{to avoid the}} confusion of earlier multi-shot films such as Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903). Three shots are used {{to set up the}} plot, that of the baby being stolen by <b>a</b> <b>beggar</b> woman. Nearly all of the following shots show Rover tracking down the child. When the dog returns home, the shots' settings are repeated in reverse as the dog travels them; they are shown again in the original order, for a third time, when the dog brings the father. A fourth repetition is, rather radically for its time, spared by showing the kidnapper's return to her room followed by a shot of the reunited family.|$|E
5|$|In the Prapancasarasara-samgraha, Dhumavati is {{described}} as having a black complexion and wearing ornaments made of snakes. Her dress is made of rags taken from cremation grounds. She holds a spear and a skull-cup (kapala) in her two hands. The spear is sometimes replaced by a sword. Another description in the same text says Dhumavati is aged with a wrinkled, angry face and cloud-like complexion. Her nose, eyes, and throat resemble a crow's. She holds a broom, a winnowing fan, a torch, and a club. She is cruel and frowning. Her hair appears dishevelled and she wears the simple clothes of <b>a</b> <b>beggar.</b> Her breasts are dry. Her hair is grey, her teeth crooked and missing, and her clothes old and worn.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan and Dio grow up {{and become}} friendlier, but Jonathan {{suspects}} ulterior motives when Dio acts very caring for George, who has been sick for an extended time. Learning that Dario had the same symptoms before he died, Jonathan suspects that Dio poisoned both of them; Dio plans to stop Jonathan from exposing this by killing him with the stone mask. When he tests the mask on <b>a</b> <b>beggar</b> beforehand, it instead turns the beggar into a vampire, who dies due to exposure to sunlight. While investigating the poison, Jonathan befriends the street thug Robert E. O. Speedwagon and learns that Dio acquired it from Wang Chan, a black market merchant. Jonathan confronts Dio, who uses George's blood and the mask to become a vampire. The Joestar estate burns to the ground during the ensuing battle, but Jonathan and Dio survive.|$|E

5|$|Prakash Raj and Ashish Vidyarthi {{were cast}} as the film's primary antagonists. Raj played a mafia kingpin and Vidyarthi played a corrupt police officer, a villain's role he finds more fun to play {{than that of a}} hero. Sayaji Shinde and Nassar played the two other {{principal}} characters in the film. Jyothi Rana played the role of the mafia kingpin's moll, marking her debut in Telugu cinema. Isai and Subbaraju portrayed negative roles as well, with the former also making his debut in Telugu cinema. Ali played the role of <b>a</b> <b>beggar</b> and shared screen-space with Brahmanandam and Venu Madhav. Jagannadh added this trio to the film to provide situational humour.
