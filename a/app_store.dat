40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{a framework for}} developing mobile apps. The framework relies heavily on <b>app</b> <b>stores</b> and, particularly, on online reviews from app users. The underlying idea is that <b>app</b> <b>stores</b> are proxies for users because they contain direct feedback from them. Such feedback includes feature requests and bug reports, which facilitate design and testing respectively. The framework is supported by MARA, a prototype system designed to automatically extract relevant information from online reviews...|$|R
5|$|A port to iOS devices {{done by the}} 2K China {{studio was}} {{released}} on August 27, 2014. The iOS version is content complete and functionally equivalent to the original Xbox 360 and Windows version, featuring either the use of touch-screen virtual gamepad controls {{or the use of}} a Bluetooth-enabled controller, and with a graphics engine optimized for iOS devices. The game was later delisted from the <b>App</b> <b>Store</b> in September 2015; the game had become unplayable for many that upgraded to iOS 8.4 on their devices, and while a patch had been discussed, a 2K representative stated that the decision to remove the game came from the developer. 2K later clarified that they will be working on resolving the issues with the game's compatibility with the new firmware and will re-release the title once that has been completed. However, by January 2017, 2K officially stated that it will no longer support the title, the game will remain on the <b>App</b> <b>Store,</b> but will not receive additional updates.|$|E
