500|$|Amrita Daityari, {{author of}} Sourav Ganguly: the fire within, {{noted that in}} ODIs, where Ganguly usually opened the innings, he {{used to try to}} take the {{advantage}} of fielding restrictions by advancing down the pitch and hitting pace bowlers over extra cover and mid-off. She commented: [...] "Ganguly was notorious for attacking left-arm spin bowlers. Due to excellent eye–hand coordination, he was noted for picking the length of the ball early, coming down the pitch and hitting the ball aerially over mid-on or midwicket, often for a six. However, he did have a weakness in running between the wickets and judging quick singles." [...] There were many instances where Ganguly's batting partner was run out due to Ganguly's calling for a run, and then sending him back while halfway down the pitch. <b>A</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> happened in an ODI against Australia where he took a single when on 99, but he coasted and did not ground his bat. Although the bat was past the crease, it was in the air and he was consequently run out. Ganguly said, [...] "I love to watch myself hit a cover drive, to watch myself hit a hundred." [...] Ganguly's relationship with former Indian coach John Wright has been well documented in contemporary media, with them denoting the relationship as a [...] "symbiotic process". They credited Wright and Ganguly with bringing out international class performers, through academic, coaching and scientific fitness regimens. According to Dubey, Ganguly and Wright, along {{with other members of the}} team like Tendulkar and Dravid, were the first to understand the importance of a foreign coach for the Indian cricket team and was convinced that the domestic coach has outlived its utility. Ganguly's aggressive style and Wright's importance on fitness ushered in the development of a better cricket team for India.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} is described that tests theoretical predictions on how C-lines incident obliquely on a surface behave on reflection. C-lines in a polarised wave are the analogues of the optical vortices carried by a complex scalar wave, {{which is the}} usual model for describing light and other electromagnetic waves. The centre of a laser beam that carries a (degenerate) C-line is shifted on reflection by the well-known Goos-Hänchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects, but the C-line itself splits into two, {{both of which are}} shifted longitudinally and laterally; their shifts are {{different from that of the}} beam centre.

40|$|Introduction. Renal {{transplantation}} {{has become}} the standard of care for patients with end stage renal disease. We present a rare case of an absent right sided iliac arterial system encountered during recipient renal transplantation. The presence of such vascular anomaly intraoperatively can present <b>a</b> technically challenging <b>situation</b> to the surgeon. Case Presentation. During a routine renal transplantation of a 34 -year-old man, we encountered a complete absence of right side iliac arterial system and a prominent branch arising from left hemipelvis and coursing to the right lower limb and the urinary bladder. The artery to the bladder was divided and anastomosed end to end to the donor renal artery. Intraoperatively the renal perfusion and the urine output were good. A posttransplant magnetic resonance angiogram done six weeks later revealed good vascular supply to the kidney and the lower limb. Conclusion. Absent iliac artery on one or both sides is a rare phenomenon. The presence of it during an unanticipated renal transplant surgery can pose a significant technical challenge to the surgeons. We advocate routine assessment of pelvic vasculature before recipient renal transplant surgery {{so as to avoid}} <b>a</b> difficult <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this...</b>|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the role of group and {{national}} identity in various types of collective actions. It features the decision to take action and asks about factors that influence that decision. Thus, our perspective is {{from the standpoint of the}} decision-maker who usually represents a collectivity (group, organization, nation). The interest is less about those decision-makers’ own identities and attachments than about various drivers and constraints on their decisions to act. People responsible for developing organizational and national policies often think in terms of futuristic scenarios. They ask about options in the form of “what … if,” and turn alternative stories around in their mind. They play out some implications of alternative futures – with regard to such problems as the stability of regimes, the mobility of elites, negotiating tactics, and peacekeeping operations. This study takes advantage of this familiar kind of thinking about policy and action. We ask: What if <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> was <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> What would you do? We then continue the questioning in an attempt to tease out the reasons for the decision, in this case various collective actions. We add an analytical dimension to scenario decisionmaking. By administering the scenarios to a large population of respondents, we can systematically vary several aspects of both situations and actions. By using a simple rating task, we can produce scales – like temperature scales – that distinguish more (“hotter”) from less (“cooler”) important elements in decision-making. This is a new approach to the study of decision-making in an international context. 17 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{issues we}} will address {{to improve our}} {{understanding}} of how business processes work are illustrated by the causal loop diagram in Figure 2. 1 a. This models <b>a</b> simple advertising <b>situation</b> for <b>a</b> durable good. There is a pool of Potential Customers who are turned into Actual Customers by sales. Potential Customers and sales are connected in a negative feedback loop with the goal of driving Potential Customers to zero. If we visualize a typical mass advertising situation, we would expect that the greater the number of Potential Customers, the greater the sales, and this is shown in Figure 2. 1 a by the positive arrow between Potential Customers and sales. Similarly, greater sales lead to fewer Potential Customers (since the Potential Customers are converted into Actual Customers by sales), and hence there is a negative arrow from sales to Potential Customers. Since there are a odd number of negative links in the feedback loop between Potential Customers and sales, this is a negative feedback loop. We obtain from this diagram the (not very profound) insight that eventually sales must go to zero when the number of Potential Customers reaches zero. However, this insight by itself is not particularly useful for business management purposes because there is no information about the rate at which Potential Customers will go to zero. It can make a big di ± erence for managing the production and sales of this product if it will sell well for ten months or ten years before we run out of Potential Customers! For <b>a</b> simple <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> we could use a spreadsheet to develop a quantitative model to investigate the rate at which Potential Customers will go to zero, but as the complexity of the situation increases, this becomes more di ° cult.

40|$|Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is an {{exciting}} technology {{with the potential to}} have an ever increasing role in modern, mobile societies. The advent of Galileo, the European satellite navigation project, will allow a deeper impact in the quality of services supplied to the users, and consequently, into diffusion and development of mass market receivers. Obviously, in order to respond to mobility demands, an important aim will be to guarantee continuous outdoor and indoor location availability. The main challenging problem for indoor location is to find a solution between low signal to noise ratios characteristic of indoor scenario, and low complexity of user terminals. In <b>a</b> noise limited <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> to ensure <b>a</b> good synchronization, it is necessary to integrate over a longer period, with inevitable increase of complexity. The analysis done in this paper is based on acquisition of Galileo pilot signal in L 1 band, L 1 -C signal, that is a hierarchical code, constituted by a repetition of a 4092 chips primary code, modulated by a long duration secondary code of 25 chips. The resulting code has a total length of 102300 chips [1]. In this way, it is possible to achieve synchronization in two phases: the first step foresees the acquisition of the primary code synchronism, while the synchronization with the overlaying secondary code is pursued in the second phase with a limited uncertainty equal to only 25 acquisition hypothesis. Generally, the integration over a word of 4092 chips is not enough to cope with the harsh indoor scenario when performing the primary code synchronization. A classic approach to overcome this problem consists in trying to detect not a single primary code sequence, but a larger number of sequences, up to the entire 102300 chips concatenated code word. This approach has the great disadvantage t...|$|R
3000|$|It is {{important}} that this narrative null result be reported so {{that it has a}} chance to be included in future meta-analyses. Speculatively, there may be several reasons why a narrative effect was not observed. First, people may be born “story makers.” That is, they may have simply induced their own narrative. Even though two of the embodied conditions did not know why they needed to stick balloons on a wall, or hit the dragon with lightning strikes, those participants were game to engage in those simulations without ever asking the experimenters “why” questions. Second, our storyline may not have been compelling to the college-age students, being in the role of an apprentice is somewhat low prestige. We would do well to heed advice from Marsh et al., that subtle character cues can have major effects on the research outcomes and in games, “characters are never socio-affect neutral” (Marsh et al., 2011). Third, and we hold to this one most strongly, narratives may be most effective when the content is delivered over several days because attention to learning may begin to flag only after the first novel exposure. This study is based on a single intervention exposure. If finishing lengthy, multi-session content is at the users’ discretion, then the power of the narrative might be observed. We have not seen published studies yet that compare learning gains on multi-day and user-controlled lessons with and without narrative wrappers. The Koenig studies cited earlier were one-shot lab experiments <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one. We know that entertainment videogames with rich storylines (and even very thin storylines like the Mario Bros. series) keep users returning. More research is needed on science education and the inclusion of narrative wrappers to understand if there is a true “value add” for the extra time and resources needed to create and comprehend quality narrative wrappers for multi-session content. In <b>an</b> experimental <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one, participants know {{they are going to get}} their credit regardless of performance or “grit”. Participants were going to finish no matter how dull the task because credit was the carrot and an experimenter was in the room the entire time. A narrative wrapper may boost motivation/engagement only when certain conditions are present, e.g. multiple homework sessions, duller simulations. We recommend the narrative wrapper research be done in situations prone to attrition and state unequivocally that this one lab experiment should not be interpreted as a paean to never waste funds on great narrative wrappers. Our take-away is quite specific, “If you design a one-session science simulation lab experiment, you may not see significant differences in learning associated with a narrative wrapper.” [...]...|$|R
