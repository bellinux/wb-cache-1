Of course the announcement should be inserted {{a certain amount of}} time before the event and removed afterward. Often the need for manual modification is the reason for many out-of-date web sites. This work describes a web application to automate this process. Administrators can insert data about new events by using a web form, specifying: the title of the event, the publication date, the expiration date and the HTML page describing the event. The application saves all the information in a database and modifies the home page (inserting the event title among the links to the describing page) on the publishing date, and removing the link on the expiration date. The application interface also permits managing the information stored in the database: events can be viewed, modified or deleted. In order to maintain a history of events <b>all</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> in the database for one year after the expiration date.

OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} if women with Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection with severe degrees of immunosuppression are more predisposed to mortality from Gestational Trophoblastic Disease compared with HIV-infected women with less severe degrees of immunosuppression and Human Immunodefiency Virus (HIV) non-infected women. DESIGN: Retrospective review of case records. METHOD: A retrospective review {{was performed on}} all patients with Gestational Trophoblastic from 2003 to July 2007. A chart review <b>was</b> conducted and <b>information</b> captured on a data sheet. This retrospective audit was performed at the combined gynaecology oncology clinic of Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. <b>All</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> confidential and <b>was</b> strictly {{for the purposes of}} the audit. STATISTICS: Factors associated with mortality were tested using Fisher's exact test. Odds ratios were reported as a measure of the strength of association. Breslow-Day's test for homogeneity in odds ratios was used to compare mortality in HIV-infected and HIV non-infected women. The analysis was done using Stata 9. i RESULTS: A total of 78 patients with Gestational Trophoblastic Disease were reviewed. There were 53 patients with invasive molar pregnancy and 25 patients with choriocarcinoma. The HIV sero-prevalence was 31 %. There were 15 deaths (19 %). There were 8 HIV-infected (33 %o) and 7 HIV non-infected (13 %) women who demised. Of the 8 patients with CD 4 counts less than 200 cells/ uL, 7 patients demised. There were no mortalities amongst patients with CD 4 counts more than 200 cells/uL. Of the 15 deaths, 5 HIV-infected patients and 5 HIV non-infected patients received chemotherapy. There were 5 patients admitted in very poor general condition precluding the administration of chemotherapy. Amongst the 10 patients who received chemotherapy and demised, the causes of death included widespread disease, multiorgan failure and toxicity due to chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The overall survival of all patients managed with Gestational Trophoblastic Disease was 82 % in keeping with the expected high survival reported elsewhere. The majority of patients who demised were admitted in poor general condition and had abnormal blood profiles. Despite resuscitation, these patients failed to improve precluding the administration of chemotherapy which is the mainstay of treatment.

40|$|Abstract—Authentication plays a {{vital role}} in many secure systems. Most of these systems require user to log in with his or her secret {{password}} or pass phrase before entering it. This is to ensure <b>all</b> the valuables <b>information</b> <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> confidential guaranteeing also its integrity and availability. However, to achieve this goal, users are required to memorize high entropy passwords or pass phrases. Unfortunately, this sometimes causes difficulty for user to remember meaningless strings of data. This paper presents a new scheme which assigns a weight to each personal question given to the user in revealing the encrypted secrets or password. Concentration of this scheme is to offer fault tolerance to users by allowing them to forget the specific password to a subset of questions and still recover the secret and achieve successful authentication. Comparison on level of security for weight-based and weightless secret recovery scheme is also discussed. The paper concludes with the few areas that requires more investigation in this research...|$|R
40|$|Secure {{distributed}} computing addresses {{the problem of}} performing a computation {{with a number of}} mutually distrustful participants, {{in such a way that}} each of the participants has only limited access to the information needed for doing the computation. Over the past two decades, a number of solutions requiring no trusted third party have been developed using cryptographic techniques. The disadvantage of these cryptographic solutions is the excessive communication overhead they incur. In this paper, we use one of the SDC protocols for one particular application: second price auctions, in which the highest bidder acquires the item for sale at the price of the second highest bidder. The protocol assures that only the name of the highest bidder and the amount of the second highest bid <b>are</b> revealed. <b>All</b> other <b>information</b> <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> secret (the amount of the highest bid, the name of the second highest bidder, [...] .). Although second price auctions may not seem very important, small variations on this theme are used by many public institutions: e. g., a 1 2 call for tenders, where contract is given to the lowest oer (or the second lowest). The case study serves two purposes: we show that SDC protocols can be used for these kind of applications, and secondly, we assess the network overhead and how well these applications scale.

We selected only the cases with convincing history of seizure events, which were sent for EEG. They were advised to wash hair with shampoo and not to sleep overnight, so that patient can sleep on EEG table in the following morning. EEG was done within one month of seizure event. Each recording of EEG were obtained through digital equipments with minimal duration of 20 – 30 minutes and electrode positioned on scalp according to international 10 ˜ 20 system. Recording was done in both awake and sleep state, except those who didn’t sleep, only awakened state recording was taken. Provocative stimuli like hyperventilation, photic stimulation were given for three minutes each. For standardization, the background activity was classified as normal (organized and symmetrical) or abnormal (disorganized and/or asymmetrical). The EEG was interpretated by consultant neurologist, trained and experienced in electro-physiologic studies. The EEG was examined for specific epileptiform abnormality, the interictal spike or sharp wave. The abnormal electroencephalographic activity was also classified as generalized or focal. The presence and topography of bursts of slow waves and epileptiform paroxysms were evaluated. The latter were classified as spike-wave, sharp-wave and polyspike.

Methods: A phone survey was developed and tested in order to collect information on breakfast consumption habits and attitudes of children, targeted as food insecure. There were no incentives for persons to participate in the survey and <b>all</b> <b>information</b> gathered <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> in a secure place at the Center for Human Nutrition. Participants who were allowed to answer questions included parents/guardians of eligible children and teens who were old enough and able to answer for themselves. The answers were entered into a database with all personal identifiers removed, with the exception of zip codes for regional identification purposes. The data was then organized and analyzed. Results: Responses from parents/guardians to a 53 -item survey were collected on 300 children and the data was broken down based on grade in school, number of school aged children, race, gender of respondent, and the county they live in. The data showed that those in need of assistance at breakfast were likely receiving the help they needed from assistance programs including Free/Reduced Breakfast, SNAP, WIC and TANF. Most of the youth from the survey ate breakfast or had it available to them, and there were few barriers for breakfast consumption. Conclusion: The data could be used to show the importance of programs such as Free/Reduced Breakfast to help those who are in the most need. Future studies dividing the children into sixth grade and younger and seventh grade and older may provide more accurate information on these group’s attitudes towards breakfast and allow for targeted strategies to be developed to increase breakfast consumption for these groups.

Team members use a combination of traditional and innovative investigative techniques to apprehend and prosecute prolific auto thieves preying on Fresno residents. Working in concert with district auto theft detectives, District Crime Suppression Teams (DCST), and patrol officers, C-CATT members identify and target suspects involved in multiple auto thefts, auto theft rings, and “chop shops”. Active surveillance, confidential informants, technology, search warrants, parole and probation searches, and business inspections are used to locate evidence of auto theft and related crimes. Associated felony crimes, such as gang crimes, identity theft, narcotics trafficking and firearms violations, are investigated and prosecuted with assistance from Fresno MAGEC (Multi-Agency Gang Enforcement Consortium), Fresno PD Investigations Division, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and other available law enforcement resources. In every case possible, C-CATT will seek federal prosecution and incarceration for auto theft crimes committed in Fresno.Prevention efforts focus on engaging the community in education and target hardening. Public Service Announcements (PSA’s), media releases, community meetings, and service clubs inform the public of our efforts to fight auto theft, its link to serious and violent crime, and our residents’ ability to prevent becoming a victim of auto theft. In 2011, C-CATT shut down 50 chop shops, identified 32 auto theft crews, arrested 331 suspects, recovered 74 firearms, and recovered 520 stolen vehicles. By bringing together the law enforcement community and the public, the daily auto theft rate was reduced in Fresno from 20 cars per day down to 10 per day. In the first two months of 2012, auto theft in Fresno is down 35%, compared with the same two months of 2011.

For some network management applications, e. g., MIB browsing, {{there is a need}} to traverse portions of a MIB tree, especially tables, in both directions. While the GetNext request de ned by SNMP standard allows an easy and fast access to the next columnar object instance or next scalar object, there is no corresponding operator dened in the SNMP framework for retrieving the previous MIB object instance. This, in effect, allows an efficient MIB traversal only in one direction and makes the search in the reverse direction problematic. This paper presents and analyzes the GetPrev application, a tool that enables the retrieval of the previous instances of a columnar objects or scalar MIB objects. Our GetPrev application uses only standard SNMP GetNext and Get requests to carry on a fast and bandwidth efficient search for the required object instance. For example, as predicted by our analysis and shown by our experiments, retrieving a value of the last columnar object instance in a large forwarding table (ipForwardTable) containing about 3000 entries can take several minutes using a sequence of the GetNext requests (the straightforward approach used, e. g., by widely deployed snmpwalk and snmptable applications). The GetPrev application presented in this paper retrieves this value using no more than 20 GetNext requests (in most cases about 7 requests), taking no more than a second (i. e., it is two orders of magnitude faster and two to three orders of magnitude less bandwidth consuming...|$|R
