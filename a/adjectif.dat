40|$|This {{article is}} about a complex {{construction}} in French with an infinitive clause {{that seems to be}} an adverbial complement of a structure No être Adj with a human subject, for instance : Paul a été honnête d'intervenir. The properties of this construction are studied and contrasted with those of a construction with a closely related meaning but with a sentential subject : Que Paul soit intervenu est honnête de sa part. The human-subject construction is shown to be a feature of a class of adjectives which are independently characterized by the distribution of their subject. This construction defines them as adjectives of psychological qualities, as opposed to adjectives qualifying a physical behaviour or a look (gracieux, souple), a mood (mélancolique) or a feeling (triste).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} description of morphological variations and syntactic properties of Korean adjectives {{in order to}} implement an automatic parser of Korean texts. We classified 5, 300 simple adjectives according to the morpholo- gical variations of their root and inflectional suffixes. In addition, these adjectives were classified into 15 syntactic classes {{on the basis of}} formal criteria. The lexical analysis of Korean adjectives is extremely complex, since a great number of inflectional suffixes are attached to adjectival roots (an adjective generates about 6, 000 inflectional forms); moreover, some complements of adjectives can be found attached to adjectival roots. The fact that one must consider one or several nouns inside an adjectival string leads to a quite heavy parsing algorithm. One cannot avoid this situation without morphological and syntactic information. Therefore, it is necessary to construct on-line dictionaries as complete as possible. Nam Jee-Sun.

The properties of complementarity and gradation of a pair of antonyms like the temperature adjectives hot and cold, applied to food, vary according to modality and aspect, and, as far as aspect is concerned, it is essential to deal with the adjective in close connection with the determiner of the noun it qualifies.

These adjectives are numerous and semantically diverse. They {{can be used with}} abstract predicative nouns as well as concrete nouns. The adjectives of this class have a particular syntax. They can be analyzed as adverbs whose scope is a complete predicate, situated in a relative clause outside the noun phrase where they occur.

Unlike même and différent, it does not give rise to referentially dependent interpretations. Nevertheless the arguments of the relation can be expressed in various ways, which allows us to distinguish three different uses of pareil: (i) pareil used with an overt item of comparison, taking {{the form of a}} PP introduced by the preposition à; (ii) an anaphorical use of pareil, in which one of the arguments of the relation is expressed in the preceding context, and finally (iii) an internal or reciprocal use of pareil, in which the different arguments are expressed by the plural NP pareil is predicated of. The aim of this contribution is to study the factors that bring about the latter two interpretations. It is shown that the anaphorical reading is the most frequent one and that it is the only one possible whenever pareil is used attributively preceding the noun. In these uses, pareil is very close to tel: both adjectives establish what could be called a generic anaphora. As for the reciprocal interpretation, it is made possible by the presence of a quantifier, which focalises the part structure of the referent of the NP. This quantifying element can be a determiner, a floating quantifier, an adverbial or even a durative copular verb such as rester. interpretations.

Besides, premier & principal are complementary. Actually, premier comes from a "hierarchy" in the strict sense, unlike principal. It does not only account for the constraints weighing on adjacent nouns but also for the way the relations between a whole and its parts are conceptualized.

40|$|International audienceIn French, attributive {{adjectives}} (A) {{can appear}} both {{before or after}} the noun (N) :(1) a. une agréable soirée (anteposed) b. une soirée agréable (postposed) « a nice evening »We compare the difference between the syntax of spoken French (SF) and written French (WF) {{on the basis of this}} alternation phenomenon. We aim to determine in which cases the syntax of this phenomenon is different in SF and WF, and to quantify these differences. The methodology is inspired by the work by Bresnan et al. (2007) and Bresnan and Ford (2010) on dative alternation in English. Using statistical modeling on data extracted from written and spoken corpora, we test syntactic factors found in the literature (Abeillé and Godard, 1999; Wilmet, 1981; Forsgren, 1978; Blinkenberg, 1933 a. o.) We assume that, with statistical tools (logistic regression – Agresti, 2007 – and mixed-effect models – Gelman and Hill, 2006), we are able to free ourselves from variations due to the sampling of the corpora. Moreover, one advantage of the mixed-effect logistic regression is that it is predictive, in the sense that one can build a model on a set of data and use this model to predict the choice between anteposition and postposition on unseen data. This way, we can evaluate how well the model generalizes from the training set. Lastly, we make use of the possibility of testing the significance of interaction between different factors in order to evaluate which syntactic factors have a different behavior according to the medium used (spoken vs. written). To build our database, we first extracted the attributive As that appeared in both positions in the syntactically annotated newspaper corpus French Treebank (FTB, Abeillé and Clément 2004), leaving aside As with post-adjectival dependents. We then extracted the same As from the spoken corpus C-ORAL-ROM (CORAL, Cresti and Moneglia 2005). Besides the variable capturing the medium used (SF vs. WF), these data were annotated for 11 variables concerning the syntactic environment of each A in context: (1) the A is coordinated, (2) the A is modified by an adverbial element; the NP contains (3) an other A in postposition, (4) an other A in anteposition, (5) a relative clause, (6) a PP; the determiner of the NP is (7) demonstrative, (8) possessive, (9) definite; a measure of collocation for (10) the ordered sequence A+N and (11) the ordered sequence N+A (collocations estimated with χ 2, Manning and Schütze, 1999). We also differentiated two lemmas in context for 5 As: ancien 'ancient/ former', pur 'pure', seul 'alone/single', simple 'simple/modest', propre 'own/clean'. The database contains 6612 occurrences of attributive As (4986 in FTB, 1626 in CORAL) representing 170 lemmas, with 68. 9 % of anteposition (67. 1 % in FTB, 74. 3 % in CORAL). There is variation according to the lemmas: for instance, the A unique 'unique' is anteposed in 20 % of the cases, whereas sérieux 'serious' appears in this position in 51. 4 % and petit 'small' in 98. 6 %. Moreover, there is less alternation in spoken data than in written ones: the 170 lemmas appear in both positions in FTB, while only 56 (72, 8 % of the 130 lemmas attested in CORAL) of them are really alternating in CORAL. This seems to reveal that in spoken French, the As tend to have a more fixed behavior than in the written variant. One can hypothesize that the more the speech is spontaneous, the more the A occurs in its preferred position, that is the more frequent position. We used mixed-effects logistic regression to estimate the probability that the anteposition will be chosen as a function of 12 predictive variables (the 11 syntactic variables and the medium used: WF or SP). The construction of the model consists in estimating the coefficients that are associated with each variable. Besides the predictive variables, also called fixed effects, mixed-effects models are able to take into account the variation in the data by means of random-effects. In our case, the adjectival lemmas are the random effects in order to model the adjectival idiosyncrasies. We built a model with 12 fixed-effects, 1 random-effect and 11 interaction between the medium and the 11 syntactic variables. We tested all the interactions between the medium and the 10 syntactic variables interactions. We removed predictors and interactions that were non-significant at the 0. 05 level step by step, but keeping in the model non-significant fixed-effects for predictors that participated in significant interactions. All the fixed-effects as well as 4 interaction were significant and thus participate in predicting the position of the As. Each coefficient associated with fixed-effects can be interpreted as the preference for a position: a positive coefficient indicates a preference for anteposition and a negative one for postposition. Thus the model shows that the nature of the determiner influences the position: demonstrative, possessive and definite determiners favor the anteposition. Moreover, APs containing coordinated As or adverbial modifiers tend to be postposed, which confirms that speakers tend to put « heavy » APs after the N. The occurrence of a relative clause, a PP or another A after the N also favors the anteposition. Finally, the N the A is combined with affects the choice: the more the A and the N tend to be a collocation in a given order, as in à juste titre 'understandably', the more the sequence tend to occur in the given order. There is also a significant effect of the medium: SF favors postposition compared to WF. Insofar as each of these syntactic variables favor the same position in WF as well as in SF, we consider that the phenomenon is syntactically unified in both variants. There is only one factor that do not have the same effect: the presence of an anteposed adjective. It favors anteposition in SF and postposition in WF. The three other interactions with the medium show that the observed effect is strengthened or weakened in SF. First, demonstratives strongly favor antposition in WF, whereas in SF it has a weak effect. Second, the possessive determiner and the adverbial modifier tend to be more strongly associated with anteposition in SF. Grâce à une approche quantitative sur des données de corpus, nous étudions les contraintes syntaxiques et lexicales intervenant dans le choix de la position de l'adjectif épithète, en français parlé et en français écrit. La modélisation statistique de 6612 occurrences d'adjectif représentant 170 lemmes adjectivaux permet de mettre en lumière le rôle de onze contraintes syntaxiques tout en prenant en compte les spécificités lexicales. Les déterminants démonstratifs, possessifs et les articles définis favorisent l’antéposition. De plus, les SA contenant des adjectifs coordonnés ou des modifieurs adverbiaux ont tendance à être postposés. La présence de propositions relatives, de SP ou d’un autre <b>adjectif</b> après le nom favorise également la postposition. Enfin, on observe que plus le nom et l'adjectif ont tendance à former une collocation, plus l'ordre de cette collocation tend à être respecté. Nous montrons également que quatre contraintes syntaxiques interagissent avec le mode de production des données (oral ou écrit) ce qui signifie que ces contraintes ont un comportement différent selon le mode de production des données.

40|$|Chris Corne : Stative verbs and {{adjectives}} in Tayo The lexicon of tayo is French-based whereas its syntax is principally {{influenced by}} Kanak languages. In Tayo, {{there is a}} small number of pre-posed adjectives, coming distinctly from French since the Kanak languages do not allow such a word-order. Post-posed adjectives are rare. The alternative is a relative clause containing a stative verb, a Kanak pattern. The paper analyzes stative verbs found in the following context le + verb + subject and causative derivation through the use of prefix fe-+ stative verb, another Kanak pattern. Present-day bilingualism (Kanak languages-French) in the Tayo speech community determines a French or a Kanak reading of attributive (pre- and post-posed) and predicative adjectives, and stative verbs.

Adjectives in French can occupy either the prenominal position (gros livre, *livre gros), or the postnominal position (gant rouge, *rouge gant), or both (nouveau livre, livre nouveau). As a first approximation, this property is a lexical feature of the adjective.

In some other adjectival sentences with an appropriate noun, that noun plays the same part as colour {{and seems to be}} relevant to the description of the adjective. These appropriate nouns can usually be used in elementary sentences like The leather had some colour, but in many cases they have a more or less obligatory modifier. For example, you can hardly mention that an object has a colour without qualifying that colour at all. About 300 French nouns are appropriate in at least one adjectival sentence and have an obligatory modifier. They enter in a number of sentence structures related by several syntactic transformations. The appropriateness of the noun {{and the fact that the}} modifier is obligatory are reflected in these transformations. The description of these syntactic phenomena provides a basis for a classification of these nouns. It also concerns the lexical properties of thousands of predicative adjectives, and in particular the relations between the sentence without the noun : The leather was yellow and the adjectival sentence with the noun : The colour of the leather was yellow.

In most articles and books, it is considered that the adjective {{may as well be}} before or after its head noun. However, previous studies have focused almost exclusively on written French and / or invented examples. There are few studies on spoken French and no broad description. We therefore choose to launch a systematic description of the position of adjectives in spoken French (mostly unplanned), starting by limiting to adjectives appearing on both right and left of the noun to which they relate. These adjectives are described as alternating. This is the case in examples like: une sublime jeune femme / une jeune femme sublime ('a gorgeous young woman'). We focus on adjectives that can be pre-nominal or post-nominal in similar or identical contexts, without apparent distinctive setting (as in the example above). To carry out this study, we adopted a corpus-driven approach (Tonigni-Bonelli, 2001), restricted exclusively to occurrences met in our data. This paper presents a first exploratory study in which we mention only the first results. To highlight the influence on the results {{of the nature of the}} data taken into account, a comparison will be conducted with data of the same size from newspaper. It will be focusing specifically on the cases for which the trends are not congruent between oral and newspaper. So, we show that the detection of regularities can be strongly affected by the data taken into account. Our study is based on an oral resource of approximately 2. 3 million words coming from a combination of various corpora. File formats and transcription conventions were standardized. The entire resource was automatically tagged into parts of speech and lemmatized with a tool specially trained to work on spoken French. Regarding the written data for comparisons, we also combined various newspaper corpora. The size of the newspaper part is comparable to the size of the oral part. Queries were launched on the tagged corpus to observe the main trends and to extract the list of alternating adjectives. Then we read concordances to identify and correct detection errors. However by this method, we realized that we missed a small part of relevant examples. In a second step, to have the guarantee to work on the entirety of relevant data and to control a maximum of parameters, we queried directly the raw transcriptions to lead detailed analysis. On the tagged spoken corpus, we identified a total of 33, 397 occurrences being divided as follows: 16, 037 pre-nominal adjectives (48 %) and 17, 360 post-nominal adjectives (52 %). Alternating adjectives are not frequent in terms of different forms (only 162 of 2, 146), but they are the majority in terms of occurrences (19, 130). This phenomenon is related to the presence, in this category, of the most common adjectives like grand ('large'), petit ('little'), autre ('other'), etc. Furthermore, we saw that the pre-nominal position, among alternating adjectives, are large majority and that majority is mostly related to the 10 most frequent adjectives in this position. Regarding the various adjective usages, we highlighted four cases. First, we observed non spontaneous alternation. They are adjectives that alternate in writing but very rarely in the oral data that we viewed. The only examples are encountered in recordings of planned spoken French: Frodo jouit pleinement de son actuelle suprématie en l'absence de Freud [c-oral-rom] ('Frodo fully enjoys his current supremacy in the absence of Freud' [tv report on chimpanzees]) or in situations where there is an effect of parallelism: c'est un long travail et un dur travail [CRFP] ('it is a long work and a hard work'). The second case includes adjectives which the position is in complementary distributions. In this category, we met only discriminating contexts. This is the case of the adjective prochain ('next' in English). All contexts in which prochain is in pre-nominal position are different from those where it is in post-nominal position. The third case is similar to the previous but it contains some rare examples that are not in complementary distribution. The adjective propre ('own' in English) belongs to this category. We have found two post-nominal examples that are identical to the pre-nominal context (presence of a possessive determiner) : le patois était le euh leur ben leur langage propre [Corpaix] ('the dialect was their own language'). Finally, there are free alternate adjectives, that is to say adjectives can be either pre-nominal or post-nominal. This last category seems relatively marginal compared to others. But only a thorough work on the 162 alternate adjectives will demonstrate this hypothesis. We draw the tentative conclusion that the position of adjectives in unplanned spoken French is mostly intended. This point highlights the existence of a spontaneous grammar, hard to see in written data especially for stylistic reasons. La place de l'adjectif épithète en français parlé n'a pas encore fait l'objet d'une étude systématique. Nous avons donc entrepris de combler ce manque en nous concentrant, dans un premier temps, sur les <b>adjectifs</b> alternants. Nous avons plus particulièrement cherché à savoir si la place était majoritairement motivée ou au contraire relativement libre. Pour ce faire, 9 <b>adjectifs</b> ont été observés de manière précise et nous avons essayé de dresser une première cartographie des différents fonctionnements. De nos premiers résultats, nous en tirons la conclusion que la motivation de la place est majoritaire mais qu'il existe cependant quelques <b>adjectifs</b> à place totalement libre en français parlé. Nous apportons des éléments supplémentaires permettant d'étayer les hypothèses de C.

40|$|Anne-Marie Berthonneau : On the French "deictic" {{adjectives}} prochain and dernier or How to find one's {{way through}} time, space and texts This paper analyzes the referential functions of prochain/dernier in their {{temporal and spatial}} uses, {{on the basis of}} their syntactic properties as adjectives (among which, naturally, their position with respect to the noun). It also covers the relations between prochain and suivant with nouns denoting various kinds of material entities, which may or may not be considered as places. Prochain and dernier do not figure prominently in the littérature on adjectives, because of their non prototypical status. With respect to time, there is a general consensus assuming that they are "deictic", at least when they follow the noun (e. g. la semaine dernière/prochaine), despite the well known fact that dernier is an ordinal adjective. They contrast with (précédent /suivant) which establish reference on the basis of a given reference time (e. g. à Noël [...] . la semaine précédente/ suivante) rather than on the basis of speech time. Though it is often assumed that time should be analyzed as a transposition of space, the temporal behaviour of prochain and dernier turns out not to be precisely parallel to their spatial uses. Dernier no longer forms a pair with prochain (e. g. Je descends à la station prochaine /*dernière); it functions strictly as an ordinal adjective. Furthermore, suivant is in competition with prochain (e. g. Je descends à la station prochaine/à la prochaine station/à la station suivante), though the two adjectives produce clearly distinct references with respect to time (e. g. la semaine prochaine Ф la semaine suivante). Contrasting the behaviour of these adjectives with respect to time and space is important because it reveals the asymmetry between prochain and dernier, which is hidden if one only considers the temporal uses. It allows one to explain (i) how prochain and dernier come together to form a contrasting pair in their temporal uses, despite the fact that dernier is not an indexical; (ii) why suivant can provide the same referent as prochain with names of material entities, despite the fact that the meanings of the two are radically different. At the end of this journey through months and weeks, stations and times, women, pages and chapters, it will turn out that the differences between space and time are less important than might initially appear, at least if one takes into account a crucial property of temporal entities, namely their lack of salience.
