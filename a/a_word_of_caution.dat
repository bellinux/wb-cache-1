It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given unit in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.|$|E

"One-to-one" [...] and [...] "onto" [...] are {{terms that}} were {{more common in the}} older English {{language}} literature; [...] "injective", [...] "surjective", and [...] "bijective" [...] were originally coined as French words {{in the second quarter of}} the 20th century by the Bourbaki group and imported into English.

[...] Also, the statement [...] "f maps A onto B" [...] differs from [...] "f [...] maps A into B" [...] in that the former implies that f is an onto function (i.e., surjective), while the latter makes no assertion about the nature of the mapping.

40|$|Places {{may also}} be brands, but the brand concept implies {{something}} paradoxical. It allows us a simple and direct reference to a given reality, or fiction, we may want to commonly circumscribe; yet, frequently {{we may not be}} fully aware of what, if anything, is being specifically circumscribed. The brand subsumes both polysemy and intricate communication strategies tailored to mobilize particular affective or cognitive meanings. As in everything else then, applying the brand concept to places or cities, a growing option nowadays, raises additional questions that extend to the ethic and aesthetic fields. We thus briefly introduce some disciplinary perspectives on ‘brand’, consider its possible extension to geographical places, namely as “smart cities”, and present <b>a</b> few <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> on issues we then believe as problematic: social interaction as a fight of promises, and the danger of a stereotyped behaviour paired with a biased decoding of complexity.

40|$|US higher {{education}} and distinct state systems such as in California offer comparative models for UK {{higher education}}. This essay provides a comparative analysis of US and UK higher education, followed by {{a description of the}} development, and contemporary structure of California’s system.

The present study explores if C-Tests with different number of blanks measure the same construct as those with standard 25 gaps. Out of data from a four-passage C-Test with 40 blanks in each passage, two other datasets with 10 and 25 blanks in each passage were constructed. The three datasets were separately analysed with the Rasch model and the psychometric characteristics of the three test forms were compared. Results showed that the three forms have similar fit indices and are equally unidimensional. But C-Tests with more gaps {{turned out to be}} more reliable. Cross plotting students’ ability measures from pairs of C-Test forms on x and y axes revealed that test-takers have identical ability measures regardless of the number of gaps in the C-Tests. This was interpreted as evidence of the invariance of the C-Test construct when the number of gaps in the passages is altered.

30|$|Even {{though the}} {{advantageous}} media features of SL for university counseling were well {{received by the}} participants and thus empirically supported in this study, <b>a</b> few <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> are provided {{in view of the}} finding that SL was considered the least preferred channel for most of the counseling problems. Although the reasons why the participants selected one channel over the others were not gathered in this study, the users’ perceptions of the risks and difficulties in using SL may account for the results, as reflected in other studies examining the applications of emerging technologies in educational settings (e.g., Cao et al. 2013), and suggested by the diffusion of innovation theory (Rogers 2003) and TAM (Davis 1989). As noted earlier in this paper, issues regarding whether SL counseling is effective and of good quality, and if it would create difficulties and exert extra demands {{on the part of the}} users, both in itself and compared to the other counseling channels, are major factors when it comes to considering whether the adoption and diffusion of this technology should be promoted. As such, it is suggested that the availability and suitability of SL in specific context should take into account the client’s subjective evaluation of their individual level of readiness and dominant needs.|$|R

Most evidence issues arise in criminal cases, in which convicted defendants allege error in the admission of evidence against them or in the exclusion of evidence offered in their defense. A ruling in favor of the defendant could result in the reversal of the conviction and the release of the accused, something the courts seem loath to allow. Thus, many rulings on points of evidence, particularly those where the court disposes of the issue in a paragraph or two, should probably be interpreted as harmless error cases-cases in which the evidence against the defendant is so strong that the effect of the disputed evidence is negligible. Although the court does not treat these as harmless error cases, many seemingly contradictory opinions, upholding both trial courts that allow the state to introduce disputed evidence and those that prevent the defendant from introducing such evidence, can only be explained rationally in this way...|$|R
