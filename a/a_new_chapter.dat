5|$|Dystopia has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, and holds a Metacritic rating of 69/100. Commending the band's {{return to a}} more aggressive style, Calum Slingerland of Exclaim! wrote that Dystopia put the band back on track and started <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>chapter</b> in the band's storied career. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe liked the combination of energetic riffs and cynical lyrics {{about the state of}} the world. Loudwires Chad Bowar said Dystopia was a first-rate Megadeth album and praised the interplay between Mustaine and Loureiro.|$|E

5|$|Misperceptions of the Dixie Mission {{contributed to}} the {{nationwide}} Red Scare in the 1950s and 1960s. Thawing relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in the 1970s opened <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>chapter</b> for the mission. For the first time, the mission and its participants {{became the subject of}} serious scholarship, and many of the mission participants were among the first Americans invited to visit China in twenty years. In China, the Dixie Mission is remembered as a positive time between the two nations, and a symbol of Sino-American cooperation.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall of the}} {{communist}} regime marked <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>chapter</b> {{in the history of}} Poland and in the history of Solidarity. Having defeated {{the communist}} government, Solidarity found itself in a role it was much less prepared for — that of a political party — and soon began to lose popularity. Conflicts among Solidarity factions intensified. Wałęsa was elected Solidarity chairman, but support for him could be seen to be crumbling. One of his main opponents, Władysław Frasyniuk, withdrew from elections altogether. In September 1990, Wałęsa declared that Gazeta Wyborcza had no right to use the Solidarity logo.|$|E
5|$|Each planet {{offers a}} {{possible}} quest or {{challenge to the}} player. Challenges are tactical battles in which the player must fight against a variety of enemies. However, ships can only be harmed from behind or below; attacks from any other position will be countered by the ships' shields. Upon succeeding, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>chapter</b> {{is added to the}} player's character's story, and the player is rewarded with ship upgrades. These upgrades are used to customize ships with improvements, such as increased firing speed or heavier rear armor. The upgrades available to the player upon finishing each encounter with an enemy can vary, so the player may not receive the same upgrade by playing the same encounter in two different adventures. Flotilla has cooperative and split-screen multiplayer modes that can be played with an additional Xbox 360 controller.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixth}} edition Darwin {{inserted}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>chapter</b> VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) {{to respond to}} criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and {{could not have been}} produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on Fertilisation of Orchids that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to George Jackson Mivart's criticisms, including his claim that features such as baleen filters in whales, flatfish with both eyes {{on one side and the}} camouflage of stick insects could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature.|$|E
5|$|The tour's {{production}} and staging {{consisted of a}} 60 foot tall rotating LED cuboid {{referred to as the}} 'Monolith', a treadmill runway and a secondary stage that stores and produces 2,000 gallons of water. The theme of the tour was described as following the same linear chapters to that of the tour's supporting album Lemonade, with each rotation of the aforementioned 'Monolith' representing <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>chapter</b> of the show. Several music critics gave the show positive reviews, with a variety of publications praising both the tour's {{production and}} Beyoncé's performance and vocal abilities. The tour had a variety of notable opening acts, including a number of special guests joining prominent opener DJ Khaled on stage. Supporting acts also included artists signed to Beyoncé's own management company, Parkwood Entertainment, such as the duo CHLOE X HALLE, who were relatively unknown at the time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the tablet {{to him in the}} now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given the tablet, he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet, ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>chapter</b> for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E

5|$|Several sons of Gediminas {{continued}} his male line, {{but it was}} Algirdas who continued the main Gediminid line. Before deposing his brother Jaunutis in 1345, he ruled Kreva and, despite remaining pagan, married Maria, a daughter of the last prince of Vitebsk. After 1345 he became the Grand Duke of Lithuania and shared his power with his brother Kęstutis. Their successful collaboration is celebrated in Lithuanian historiography, and {{gave rise to a}} much debated theory that a tradition of co-rule or diarchy in Lithuania was customary and arose as early as 1285. The Grand Duchy experienced its greatest expansion during their reign. While Algirdas was mostly active in the east, Kęstutis occupied himself by managing the Duchy's interactions with the Teutonic Knights, Poland, and other western European entities. In 1350 Algirdas contracted a second marriage with Uliana of Tver; he chose their son Jogaila as the next Grand Duke. In 1385 Jogaila opened <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>chapter</b> in the history of Lithuania by converting the country to Christianity and signing a personal union with Poland, becoming King of Poland. This Polish–Lithuanian union, in various forms, survived until the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795. Jogaila's branch of the Gediminids is known as the Jagiellon dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The Strawberry Panic! manga, {{written by}} Sakurako Kimino and {{illustrated}} by Namuchi Takumi, was serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine between September 30, 2005 and February 28, 2007 with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>chapter</b> released once a month. Two bound volumes {{have been published in}} Japan under MediaWorks' Dengeki Comics label. The first went on sale on March 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Shizuma on the cover, and the second volume came out on October 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Tamao on the cover. While the manga's story is unfinished, Strawberry Panic! has not made an appearance in Dengeki G's Magazine since the publication of the April 2007 issue on February 28, 2007. Major differences between the anime and manga center around the plot and character interaction. Characters have vastly different character designs, such as Shion Tōmori and Kaname Kenjō. The manga introduces the Etoile election early on while the anime waits until {{the latter part of the}} series for dramatic effect. The first volume was released in English on December 23, 2007, the second in March 2008, and the omnibus with two additional chapters in October 2010, published by Seven Seas Entertainment.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked {{the start of}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>chapter</b> for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook {{during the course of}} his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E
