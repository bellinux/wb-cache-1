5|$|Neutrophils {{also play}} a key role in the {{development}} of most forms of acute lung injury. Here, activated neutrophils release the contents of their toxic granules into the lung environment. Experiments have shown that a reduction in the number of neutrophils lessens the effects of acute lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting neutrophils is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the liver, damage by neutrophils can contribute to dysfunction and injury in response to the release of endotoxins produced by bacteria, sepsis, trauma, <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> ischemia, and hypovolemic shock resulting from acute hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|Excessive alcohol {{consumption}} {{is a significant}} cause of hepatitis and {{is the most common}} cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is within the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease. This ranges in order of severity and reversibility from alcoholic steatosis (least severe, most reversible), <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> cirrhosis, and liver cancer (most severe, least reversible). Hepatitis usually develops over years-long exposure to alcohol, occurring in 10 to 20% of alcoholics. The most important risk factors for the development of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> are quantity and duration of alcohol intake. Long-term alcohol intake in excess of 80 grams of alcohol a day in men and 40 grams a day in women is associated with development of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (1 beer or 4 ounces of wine is equivalent to 12g of alcohol). <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> can vary from asymptomatic hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) to symptoms of acute or chronic hepatitis to liver failure.|$|E

50|$|Milk thistle {{has been}} used for a number of {{purposes}} including treatment of liver disease, prevention and treatment of cancer, and supportive treatment of poisoning from death cap mushrooms; however, clinical study results were described as heterogeneous and contradictory. A 2007 Cochrane Review included eighteen randomized clinical trials which assessed milk thistle in 1088 patients with <b>alcoholic</b> and/or <b>hepatitis</b> B or C virus liver diseases. It questioned the beneficial effects and highlighted the lack of high-quality evidence. The review concluded that more good-quality, randomized clinical trials are needed.

25|$|Fatty {{change and}} <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> with {{abstinence}} can be reversible. The later stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis {{tend to be}} irreversible, but can usually be contained with abstinence {{for long periods of}} time.|$|E
25|$|Although in {{rare cases}} liver {{cirrhosis}} is reversible, the disease process remains mostly irreversible. Liver transplantation remains the only definitive therapy. Today, survival after liver transplantation is similar for people with ALD and non-ALD. The requirements for transplant listing {{are the same as}} those for other types of liver disease, except for a 6-month sobriety prerequisite along with psychiatric evaluation and rehabilitation assistance (i.e., Alcoholics Anonymous). Specific requirements vary among the transplant centers. Relapse to alcohol use after transplant listing results in delisting. Re-listing is possible in many institutions, but only after 3–6 months of sobriety. There are limited data on transplant survival in patients transplanted for acute <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> but it is believed to be similar to that in nonacute ALD, non-ALD, and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> with MDF less than 32.|$|E

40|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} a common feature {{observed}} in {{a wide spectrum of}} chronic liver diseases including viral <b>hepatitis,</b> <b>alcoholic,</b> and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOXs) are emerging as major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several major isoforms are expressed in the liver, including NOX 1, NOX 2, and NOX 4. While the phagocytic NOX 2 has been known {{to play an important role}} in Kupffer cell and neutrophil phagocytic activity and inflammation, the nonphagocytic NOX homologues are increasingly recognized as key enzymes in oxidative injury and wound healing. In this review, we will summarize the current advances in knowledge on the regulatory pathways of NOX activation, their cellular distribution, and their role in the modulation of redox signaling in liver diseases...|$|R
25|$|In {{people with}} <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> the serum {{aspartate}} aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio is greater than 2:1.AST and ALT levels are almost always less than 500. The elevated AST to ALT ratio is due to deficiency of pyridoxal-6-phosphate, which is required in the ALT enzyme synthetic pathway. Furthermore, alcohol metabolite–induced injury of hepatic mitochondria results in AST isoenzyme release. Other laboratory findings include red blood cell macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume > 100) and elevations of serum γ-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels. Folate level is reduced in alcoholic patients due to decreased intestinal absorption, increased bone marrow requirement for folate {{in the presence of}} alcohol, and increased urinary loss.The magnitude of leukocytosis reflects severity of liver injury. Histologic features include Mallory bodies, giant mitochondria, hepatocyte necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration at the perivenular area. Mallory bodies, which are also present in other liver diseases, are condensations of cytokeratin components in the hepatocyte cytoplasm and do not contribute to liver injury.Up to 70% of patients with moderate to severe <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> already have cirrhosis identifiable on biopsy examination at the time of diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|First-line {{treatment}} of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is {{treatment of}} alcoholism. For those who abstain completely from alcohol, reversal of liver disease and a longer life are possible; patients at every disease stage {{have been shown}} to benefit by prevention of additional liver injury. In addition to referral to psychotherapy and other treatment programs, treatment should include nutritional and psychosocial evaluation and treatment. Patients should also be treated appropriately for related signs and symptoms, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and infection.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{hepatitis}} B, {{most cases}} of hepatitis C lead to chronic infection. Hepatitis C {{is the second}} most common cause of cirrhosis in the US (second to <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis).</b> In the 1970s and 1980s, blood transfusions were a major factor in spreading hepatitis C virus. Since widespread screening of blood products for hepatitis C began in 1992, the risk of acquiring hepatitis C from a blood transfusion has decreased from approximately 10% in the 1970s to 1 in 2 million currently.|$|E

40|$|The {{concentration}} of the conjugated bile acid, cholyigly-cine, in serum is a sensitive and specific indicator of he-patic function.

25|$|Common {{causes for}} acute liver failure are {{paracetamol}} (acetaminophen) overdose, idiosyncratic reaction to medication (e.g. tetracycline, troglitazone), excessive alcohol consumption (severe <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis),</b> viral hepatitis (hepatitis A or B — {{it is extremely}} uncommon in hepatitis C), acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and idiopathic (without an obvious cause). Reye syndrome is acute liver failure in {{a child with a}} viral infection (e.g. chickenpox); it appears that aspirin use may play a significant role. Wilson's disease (hereditary copper accumulation) may infrequently present with acute liver failure.|$|E
25|$|The most {{apparent}} distinguishing factor between alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) {{is a history}} of alcohol use or abuse. Thus, in patients who have no or negligible alcohol use, the diagnosis is unlikely to be <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> However, in those who use alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis especially if there is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic steatohepatitis AST>ALT with ratio of AST:ALT>2:1 while in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ALT>AST with ratio of ALT:AST>1.5:1.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholic {{liver disease}} is a major public health problem. For example, in the United States up to two million people have alcohol-related liver disorders. Chronic alcohol abuse can cause fatty liver, {{cirrhosis}} and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> Treatment options are limited and consist of most importantly discontinuing alcohol consumption. In cases of severe liver disease, the only treatment option may be a liver transplant from alcohol abstinent donors. Research is being conducted into the effectiveness of anti-TNFs. Certain complementary medications, e.g., milk thistle and silymarin, appear to offer some benefit. Alcohol is {{a leading cause of}} liver cancer in the Western world, accounting for 32-45% of hepatic cancers. Up to half a million people in the United States develop alcohol-related liver cancer.

40|$|Background and purpose: Alcoholic {{liver disease}} (ALD) such as <b>alcoholic</b> steatosis, <b>hepatitis</b> and {{cirrhosis}} are complex multistep chronic diseases reported in many animal studies. Chronic alcohol consumption induces hepatic oxidative stress {{due to increased}} generation of reactive oxygen species and/or reduced antioxidant capacity. Trametes versicolor belongs to the more advanced Basidiomycetes class of fungi that grows on tree trunks throughout the world. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of methanol and hot-water extraction from Trametes versicolor. Materials and methods: Trametes versicolor was collected and maceration extraction was performed. The extraction was then powdered through freeze drying. This study was performed in 20 + 5 g weight male mice that were randomly divided into 8 groups (n= 4 per group). Different doses of extract were gavaged for a week. Finally, liver tissues were removed for measuring Glutathione (GSH) level and blood samples were taken for determining AST, ALT and ALP levels.

25|$|In {{the early}} stages, {{patients}} with ALD exhibits subtle and often no abnormal physical findings. It {{is usually not}} until development of advanced liver disease that stigmata of chronic liver disease become apparent. Early ALD is usually discovered during routine health examinations when liver enzyme levels {{are found to be}} elevated. These usually reflect alcoholic hepatic steatosis. Microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis with inflammation are seen in liver biopsy specimens. These histologic features of ALD are indistinguishable from those of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Steatosis usually resolves after discontinuation of alcohol use. Continuation of alcohol use will result in a higher risk of progression of liver disease and cirrhosis. In patients with acute <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> clinical manifestations include fever, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and possible hepatic decompensation with hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and ascites accumulation.Tender hepatomegaly may be present, but abdominal pain is unusual. Occasionally, the patient may be asymptomatic.|$|E
25|$|Severe <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> has a poor {{prognosis}} and is notoriously difficult to treat. Without any treatment, 20-50% of patients may die within a month, but evidence shows treatment may extend life beyond one month (i.e., reduce short-term mortality). Available treatment options include pentoxifylline (PTX), {{which is a}} nonspecific TNF inhibitor, corticosteroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone (CS), corticosteroids with N-acetylcysteine (CS with NAC), and corticosteroids with pentoxifylline (CS with PTX). Data suggest that CS alone or CS with NAC are most effective at reducing short-term mortality. Unfortunately, corticosteroids are contraindicated in some patients, such as those who have active gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, kidney failure, or pancreatitis. In these cases PTX may be considered {{on a case by}} case basis in lieu of CS; some evidence shows PTX is better than no treatment at all and may be comparable to CS while other data show no evidence of benefit over placebo. Unfortunately, there are currently no drug treatments that decrease these patients’ risk of dying in the longer term, at 3–12 months and beyond.|$|E
25|$|The {{prognosis}} {{for people with}} ALD depends on the liver histology as well as cofactors, such as concomitant chronic viral hepatitis. Among patients with <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> progression to liver cirrhosis occurs at 10–20% per year, and 70% will eventually develop cirrhosis. Despite cessation of alcohol use, only 10% will have normalization of histology and serum liver enzyme levels. As previously noted, the MDF {{has been used to}} predict short-term mortality (i.e., MDF ≥ 32 associated with spontaneous survival of 50–65% without corticosteroid therapy, and MDF < 32 associated with spontaneous survival of 90%).The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has also been found to have similar predictive accuracy in 30day (MELD > 11) and 90-day (MELD > 21) mortality. Liver cirrhosis develops in 6–14% of those who consume more than 60–80 g of alcohol daily for men and more than 20 g daily for women. Even in those who drink more than 120 g daily, only 13.5% will suffer serious alcohol-related liver injury. Nevertheless, alcohol-related mortality was the third leading cause of death in 2003 in the United States. Worldwide mortality is estimated to be 150,000 per year.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{our study}} was able {{to confirm that the}} {{occurrence}} of IPA or respiratory tract colonisation by Aspergillus sp. in cirrhotic patients is increasing in the past 10  years, probably in relation to the number of cirrhotic patients admitted in liver ICU. In addition, following the publication of Gustot et al. [10], we were sensitised to this infection, with more frequent research. Moreover, this Aspergillus infection is associated with higher mortality. Based on our results, we recommend that cirrhotic patients with sepsis admitted to ICUs should be screened for fungal infections (bronchial aspiration, chest CT, biological markers, etc.), especially in cases of strong suspicion (<b>hepatitis</b> <b>alcoholic,</b> fewer persistence, etc.). This could also be useful to obtain an early diagnosis of IPA and a swift treatment of this complication, particularly in cirrhotic patients with COPD.|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have {{recently}} emerged as crucial modulators of molecular {{processes involved in}} chronic liver diseases. The few miRNAs with previously proposed roles in liver cirrhosis were identified in screening approaches on liver parenchyma, mostly in rodent models. Therefore, {{in the present study}} we performed a systematic screening approach in order to identify miRNAs with altered levels in the serum of patients with chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis. Methods: We performed a systematic, array-based miRNA expression analysis on serum samples from patients with liver cirrhosis. In functional experiments we evaluated the relationship between alterations of miRNA serum levels and their role in distinct cellular compartments involved in hepatic cirrhosis. Results: The array analysis and the subsequent confirmation by qPCR in a larger patient cohort identified significant alterations in serum levels of miR- 513 - 3 p, miR- 571 and miR- 652, three previously uncharacterized miRNAs, in patients with <b>alcoholic</b> or <b>hepatitis</b> C induced liver cirrhosis. Of these, miR- 571 serum levels closely correlated with disease stages, thus revealing potential as a novel biomarker for hepatic cirrhosis. Further analysis revealed that up-regulation of miR- 571 in serum reflected a concordant regulation in cirrhotic liver tissue. In isolated primary human liver cells, miR- 571 was up-regulated in human hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells in response to the pro-fibrogenic cytokine TGF-b. In contrast...|$|R
