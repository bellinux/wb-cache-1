At {{the end of}} 2008, the builders erected a fence just within the 50 m minimum demarcation zone required by Portuguese law. The Mina das Verdosas 2, and its underground gallery, were demolished in February 2011 because of a new road. The authorities (DRCNorte, Estradas de Portugal and the cabinet chief of the Secretary of State for Culture) claimed that both Mina das Verdosas 1 and 2 were never part of Sete Fontes (but in reality were never included in the IPPAR/IGESPAR classification process). In addition, both Estradas de Portugal and Braga Municipal Council claimed that the access road to the hospital would not affect Sete Fontes. By early 2011, the city's geographical information system platform continued to classify most of the terrains as suitable for construction (except for those included within the hospital's construction zone).|$|R
