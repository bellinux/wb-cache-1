2500|$|The {{narrative}} in 2 Samuel 1 {{also contains a}} narrative which is often interpreted as false testimony. The 1 Samuel narrative had described Saul as killing himself by falling on his own sword after having been wounded by the Philistines on Mount Gilboa and being in a situation with no hope of victory or escape. However, 2 Samuel tells of an Amalekite, who was probably on Mount Gilboa to strip the dead of their possessions, appearing to David with Saul’s crown and royal <b>arm</b> <b>band</b> and giving testimony that he had himself killed king Saul. [...] David immediately ordered that the Amalekite be put to death, saying, [...] "Your blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the ’s anointed.'" [...] The truth of the Amalekite’s testimony {{did not need to}} be determined for the sentence to be carried out: either the Amalekite had killed King Saul, or he had given false testimony to David regarding Saul’s death. [...] Both crimes were seen as [...] equally deserving of the death penalty.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{existence}} of the kingdom as described in the Malay Annals is debatable, archaeological excavations on Fort Canning and its vicinity {{along the banks of the}} Singapore River since 1984 by John Miksic have confirmed the presence of a thriving settlement and a trade port here during the 14th century. Remnants of a wall of significant size (described by John Crawfurd as around five metres wide and three metres high) and unique to the region were found inland along present day Stamford Road. [...] Excavations also found evidence of structures built on what is now Fort Canning Hill, along with evidence of fruit orchards and terraces. [...] Local lores when the British arrived in the early 1800s associated it with the royalty of ancient Singapura where its last ruler was buried, and the hill was known to them as the forbidden hill (Bukit Larangan), as it was the site of spirits. Items of gold jewelry, including rings, earrings, an <b>arm</b> <b>band</b> and what was likely a head ornament have also been found in 1928 when workers excavated on the hill for a reservoir. [...] These items may have been the possessions of a royal person who buried them. Numerous fragments of ceramics, porcelain, and other objects have been found at three different locations around the Singapore River and Fort Canning Hill, with those from Fort Canning Hill of a higher quality than the others, offering further evidence that it was the residence of the elites. The evidence may support the notion that Singapore was a political center in the 1300s.|$|E

We'll give them ten minutes' start and then go in pursuit. There's enough snow in patches to make snowballs. Any one hit on the arms or legs is wounded. A hit on the throwing arm puts that man out of the fighting, but he is still at liberty. A hit on either leg puts a man out of action, but he may hide if he can within a radius of a hundred feet of the place where he was hit. A hit on the head or any part of the body puts a man wholly out of action and he becomes a first aid man {{to take care of the}} wounded. You fellows have played the game before, and I presume each of you has a Red Cross <b>arm</b> <b>band</b> to pin on when you are hit so that you will be recognized as a non-combatant." ...|$|E
