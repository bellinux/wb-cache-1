And we can get you on my jet aircraft, and I'm sure I can deliver on that. One of my officers will ride {{in the front seat}} of my limousine with the chauffeur.|$|E

Until the intersection with West Edsall Boulevard, the route was paralleling local railroad tracks one block <b>away,</b> <b>now</b> following more residential homes. The route passes {{a couple of}} athletic fields and turns to the northeast at an intersection with Station Parkway. The route enters Leonia and passes {{to the east of}} the Overpeck County Park. Route 93 begins to fall in elevation, entering a residential district before crossing under the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95). After the turnpike, Route 93 continues northward into Englewood. The route continues a short distance further, interchanging with the Route 4 freeway. A short distance after the interchange, Route 93 officially ends at an intersection with Van Nostrand Avenue. County Route 501 continues on along Grand Avenue.|$|E

500|$|Godsmack headlined {{the fourth}} annual Mayhem Festival {{alongside}} Disturbed. The band entered the studio in January 2012 to mix a live album plus record several covers {{for an upcoming}} release. The band then went on tour in the spring with Staind. Godsmack has completed work on an EP of cover songs. Godsmack released their new live album Live & Inspired on May 15, 2012. The set included a bonus EP of cover tracks. In January 2013, Erna announced a short solo tour through America. In February, Sully {{said in an interview}} that Godsmack would take a break during 2013.

500|$|Fuller's [...] "The Great Lawsuit" [...] {{was written}} in serial form for The Dial. She {{originally}} intended to name the work The Great Lawsuit: Man 'versus' Men, Woman 'versus' Women; when it was expanded and published independently in 1845, it was titled Woman in the Nineteenth Century. After completing it, she wrote to a friend: [...] "I had put {{a good deal of}} my true self in it, as if, I suppose I went <b>away</b> <b>now,</b> the measure of my footprint would be left on earth." [...] The work discussed the role that women played in American democracy and Fuller's opinion on possibilities for improvement. It has since become one of the major documents in American feminism. It is considered {{the first of its kind}} in the United States.|$|E
500|$|After Ødegaard {{signed for}} Real Madrid, Norwegian former {{football}} scout Tor-Kristian Karlsen praised his mentality, stating {{that he had}} [...] "overcome every challenge in front of him". Karlsen called him [...] "so level-headed and mature" [...] and noted his intelligence and performance at school, while also saying {{that this could be}} a disadvantage as [...] "The best footballers tend to have a bit of needle, a bit of fire". While former Norway international Jan Åge Fjørtoft was supportive of the transfer to Real Madrid due to the opportunity to learn from Zidane, he warned that at the age of 16 he needed time to develop: [...] "Comparing Ødegaard to Messi is nonsense from the media. Messi is a player who can make the difference and Martin can do the same, but any comparisons should not be taken seriously". Ødegaard reacted to the attention on him by saying [...] "If you get carried <b>away</b> <b>now,</b> you won't get far in 10 years. I'm supposed to be at my best then, not now. That I know".|$|E

500|$|By the 1880s, Macdonald was {{becoming}} more frail, but he maintained his political acuity. In 1883, he secured the [...] "Intoxicating Liquors Bill" [...] which took the regulation system away from the provinces, in part to stymie his foe Premier Mowat. In his own case, Macdonald took better control of his drinking and binges had ended. [...] "The great drinking-bouts, the gargantuan in sobriety's of his middle years, were dwindling <b>away</b> <b>now</b> into memories." [...] As the budget moved forward, Macdonald studied the railway issue, and found the picture unexpectedly good. Although little money had been spent on the project under Mackenzie, several hundred miles of track had been built and nearly the entire route surveyed. In 1880, Macdonald found a syndicate, led by George Stephen, willing to undertake the CPR project. Donald Smith (later Lord Strathcona) was a major partner in the syndicate, {{but because of the}} ill will between him and the Conservatives, Smith's participation was initially not made public, though it was well-known to Macdonald. In 1880, the Dominion took over Britain's remaining Arctic territories, which extended Canada to its present-day boundaries, with the exception of Newfoundland, which would not enter Confederation until 1949. Also in 1880, Canada sent its first diplomatic representative abroad, Sir Alexander Galt as High Commissioner to Britain. With good economic times, Macdonald and the Conservatives were returned with a slightly decreased majority in 1882. Macdonald was returned for the Ontario riding of Carleton.|$|E

2500|$|Kong Rong, the Chancellor (相) of Beihai State (北海國; around present-day Weifang, Shandong), {{heard about}} Taishi Ci and {{regarded}} {{him as an}} extraordinary talent. He sent his subordinates to visit Taishi Ci's mother on multiple occasions and passed her many gifts. In the late 180s or early 190s, when Beihai came under attack by Yellow Turban rebels, Kong Rong led his troops to a fortress at Duchang (都昌; in present-day Weifang, Shandong). The rebels, led by Guan Hai (管亥), besieged the Duchang fortress. After Taishi Ci returned from Liaodong, his mother told him, [...] "You haven't met Kong Rong. He treated me very generously – almost like an old friend – while you were <b>away.</b> <b>Now</b> {{that he is in}} trouble, you should quickly go to help him." [...] Three days later, Taishi Ci travelled alone on foot to Duchang.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2003, British musicologists {{stumbled}} upon superficial {{similarities between the}} lyric and rhyming schemes of [...] "Yesterday" [...] and Nat King Cole's and Frankie Laine's [...] "Answer Me, My Love"; originally a German song by Gerhard Winkler and Fred Rauch called Mütterlein, it was a number 1 hit for Laine on the UK charts in 1953 as [...] "Answer Me, O Lord", leading to speculation that McCartney had {{been influenced by the}} song. McCartney's publicists denied any resemblance between [...] "Answer Me, My Love" [...] and [...] "Yesterday". [...] "Yesterday" [...] begins with the lines: [...] "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far <b>away.</b> <b>Now</b> it looks as though they're here to stay." [...] In its second stanza, [...] "Answer Me, My Love" [...] has the lines: [...] "You were mine yesterday. I believed that love was here to stay. Won't you tell me where I've gone astray".|$|E
2500|$|Several years pass, and {{the scene}} shifts to St. Petersburg. [...] Onegin has come to attend the most {{prominent}} balls and interact {{with the leaders of}} old Russian society. He sees the most beautiful woman, who captures the attention of all and is central to society's whirl, and he realizes that it is the same Tatyana whose love he had once turned <b>away.</b> <b>Now</b> she is married to an aged prince (a general). Upon seeing Tatyana again, he becomes obsessed with winning her affection, {{despite the fact that she}} is married. However, his attempts are rebuffed. He writes her several letters, but receives no reply. Eventually Onegin manages to see Tatyana and presents to her the opportunity to finally elope after they have become reacquainted. She recalls the days when they might have been happy, but that time has passed. Onegin repeats his love for her. Faltering for a moment, she admits that she still loves him, but she will not allow him to ruin her and declares her determination to remain faithful to her husband. She leaves him regretting his bitter destiny.|$|E
2500|$|Beethoven was in Teplitz when {{he wrote}} this on Tuesday the 7th (no doubt about that), and Antonie Brentano was (as Beethoven knew very well) {{at the same time}} (for several weeks) in [...] "K" [...] (Karlsbad). From Teplitz to Karlsbad (ca. 100km), the post coach took just one day. Therefore, if it had been {{intended}} for Antonie, she would have received the Letter on Friday morning, the latest. If, however, Beethoven expected the addressee to receive the Letter not before Saturday (and [...] "probably") then she must have been two days away from Teplitz, or one more day from Karlsbad – in a westerly direction: the next bigger township is Eger , ca. 50km from Karlsbad (and Franzensbad another 10km <b>away).</b> <b>Now</b> it is established that Antonie is definitely ruled out, it helps to know that the Austrian Emperor was briefly in Franzensbad on 5 July 1812, and given the known fact that Josephine's first husband was a personal friend of the Emperor (to whom she went to ask for help, after becoming a widow), it makes sense to assume that she tried to meet him there (after her encounter with Beethoven on 3–4 July).|$|E

2500|$|... 1969 Chevelles were {{billed as}} [...] "America's most popular {{mid-size}} car." [...] They showed only minor changes for 1969, led by revised front-end styling. A single chrome bar connected quad headlights (which became a familiar Chevrolet trademark with its concurrent light duty pickup trucks) with a revised front grille, now cast in ABS plastic, and a slotted bumper held the parking lights. Taillight lenses were {{larger and more}} vertical, flowing into the quarter panels. Front vent windows (hardtop and convertibles only) began to fade <b>away</b> <b>now</b> that Astro Ventilation (first introduced on the 1966 Buick Riviera which was used a year earlier on the Camaro and Caprice) was sending outside air into several Chevelle models. The Chevelle lineup slimmed down to Nomad, 300 Deluxe/Greenbrier, Malibu/Concours, and Concours Estate series, and the base 300 series was history. [...] No longer a series of its own, the SS 396 turned into a $347.60 option package for any two-door model. That meant not just a convertible, sport coupe, or pickup, but even the pillared coupe and sport coupe in the lower-rent 300 Deluxe series (except the base 300 Deluxe El Camino pickup). [...] Fewer SS396-optioned 300 Deluxe coupes and sport coupes were built than their Malibu counterparts and they are solid gold for collectors. The Super Sport option included a 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 beneath a double-domed hood, along with a black-out grille displaying an SS emblem and a black rear panel. More potent editions of the 396 engine also made the options list, developing 350 or [...] All SS396s produced {{from this point on}} shared the same VIN prefix with the Malibu sport coupe (136) where the original buildsheet and/or Protect-O-Plate (which is an aluminum tag included with the original sales invoice from Chevrolet dealers) can ID a genuine SS (especially for a numbers matching original which is unaltered). During the 1969 model year a police package (RPO B07) was available on the Chevelle 300 Deluxe 4-door sedan where some were optioned with the RPO L35 (396) motor along with a boxed frame (also shared with fleet orders e.g. taxicabs and rental cars); at the time the police option was reintroduced since the 1964/65 model years (at the time midsize squads came with economy powertrain usually {{in the case of the}} Chevelle a third generation Chevrolet inline six. The 300 Deluxe squads was not a sales success since the market was dominated by rival manufacturer Chrysler Corporation where its B platform (and its full sized sedans) outsold its competitors. Chevelle station wagons came in three levels: Concours, Nomad, and Greenbrier—the last a badge formerly used on the Corvair van. A new dual-action tailgate operated either in the traditional manner or as a panel-type door. Wagons stretched [...] overall versus [...] for coupes.|$|E
