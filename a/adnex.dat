40|$|BACKGROUND: The International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) {{group have}} {{developed}} the <b>ADNEX</b> (The Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa) model to predict the risk that an ovarian mass is benign, borderline, stage I, stages II-IV or metastatic. We aimed to externally validate the <b>ADNEX</b> model {{in the hands of}} examiners with varied training and experience. METHODS: This was a multicentre cross-sectional cohort study for diagnostic accuracy. Patients were recruited from three cancer centres in Europe. Patients who underwent transvaginal ultrasonography and had a histological diagnosis of surgically removed tissue were included. The diagnostic performance of the <b>ADNEX</b> model with and without the use of CA 125 as a predictor was calculated. RESULTS: Data from 610 women were analysed. The overall prevalence of malignancy was 30 %. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) for the <b>ADNEX</b> diagnostic performance to differentiate between benign and malignant masses was 0. 937 (95 % CI: 0. 915 - 0. 954) when CA 125 was included, and 0. 925 (95 % CI: 0. 902 - 0. 943) when CA 125 was excluded. The calibration plots suggest good correspondence between the total predicted risk of malignancy and the observed proportion of malignancies. The model showed good discrimination between the different subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the <b>ADNEX</b> model retains its performance on external validation in the hands of ultrasound examiners with varied training and experience.

40|$|All gynecologists {{are faced}} with ovarian tumors on a regular basis, and the {{accurate}} preoperative diagnosis of these masses is important because appropriate management depends {{on the type of}} tumor. Recently, the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) consortium published the Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (<b>ADNEX)</b> model, the first risk model that differentiates between benign and four types of malignant ovarian tumors: borderline, stage I cancer, stage II-IV cancer, and secondary metastatic cancer. This approach is novel compared to existing tools that only differentiate between benign and malignant tumors, and therefore questions may arise on how <b>ADNEX</b> can be used in clinical practice. In the present paper, we first provide an in-depth discussion about the predictors used in <b>ADNEX</b> and the ability for risk prediction with different tumor histologies. Furthermore, we formulate suggestions about the selection and interpretation of risk cut-offs for patient stratification and choice of appropriate clinical management. This is illustrated with a few example patients. We cannot propose a generally applicable algorithm with fixed cut-offs, because (as with any risk model) this depends on the specific clinical setting in which the model will be used. Nevertheless, this paper provides a guidance on how the <b>ADNEX</b> model may be adopted into clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{the utility of}} pre-operative diagnostic models for ovarian cancer based on ultrasound and/or biomarkers for referring patients to specialized oncology care. The investigated models were RMI, ROMA, and three models from the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group (LR 2, <b>ADNEX,</b> and the Simple Rules risk score, SRRisks). Design A secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from two cross-sectional cohort studies performed to externally validate diagnostic models.

40|$|Ovarian cancer, {{the fifth}} {{most common cause}} of cancer death among women, has the highest {{mortality}} rate of all gynecologic cancers. General survival rate is under 50 % but can reach 90 % if disease is detected early. Ultrasound is presently the best modality to differentiate between benign and malignant status. The patient with a malignant mass should be referred to an oncology surgeon since results {{have been shown to be}} superior to treatment by a specialist. Several ultrasound-based scoring systems exist for assessing the risk of an ovarian tumor to be malignant. The International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group, published two such systems: the Simple Ultrasound Rules and the Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (<b>ADNEX)</b> model. The Simple Rules classifies a tumor as benign, malignant or indeterminate and the <b>ADNEX</b> model determines the risk for a tumor to be benign or malignant and, if malignant, the risk of various stages. Sensitivity of the Simple rules and <b>ADNEX</b> model (using a cut-off of 10 % to predict malignancy), are 92 % and 96. 5 %, respectively and the specificity 96 % and 71. 3 %, respectively. These models are the best predictive tests for the preoperative classification of adnexal tumors. Their intent is to help the specialist make management decisions when faced with a patient with a persistent ovarian mass. The models are simple, easy to use and have been validated in multiple reports but not in the USA.

Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective multicenter cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study that included 1653 patients recruited at 18 centers from 2009 to 2012. All patients underwent standardized transvaginal ultrasonography by experienced ultrasound investigators. We assessed test performance of the IOTA Simple Rules (SRs), Simple Rules Risk (SRR), the Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (<b>ADNEX)</b> model and subjective assessment to discriminate between stage I-II ovarian cancer and benign disease. Reference standard was histology after surgery. Results: 230 (13. 9 %) patients proved to have stage IâII primary invasive ovarian malignancy, and 1423 (86. 1 %) had benign disease. Sensitivity and specificity with respect to malignancy (95 % confidence intervals) of the original SRs (classifying all inconclusive cases as malignant) were 94. 3 % (90. 6 % to 96. 7 %) and 73. 4 % (71. 0 % to 75. 6 %). Subjective assessment had a sensitivity and specificity of 90. 0 % (85. 4 % to 93. 2 %) and 86. 7 % (84. 9 % to 88. 4 %), respectively. The areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves of SRR and <b>ADNEX</b> were 0. 917 (0. 902 to 0. 933) and 0. 905 (0. 920 to 0. 934), respectively.

40|$|Objectives To {{develop a}} risk {{prediction}} model to preoperatively discriminate between benign, borderline, stage I invasive, stage II-IV invasive, and secondary metastatic ovarian tumours. Design Observational diagnostic study using prospectively collected clinical and ultrasound data. Setting 24 ultrasound centres in 10 countries. Participants Women with an ovarian (including para-ovarian and tubal) mass and who underwent a standardised ultrasound examination before surgery. The model was developed on 3506 patients recruited between 1999 and 2007, temporally validated on 2403 patients recruited between 2009 and 2012, and then updated on all 5909 patients. Main outcome measures Histological classification and surgical staging of the mass. Results The Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (<b>ADNEX)</b> model contains three clinical and six ultrasound predictors: age, serum CA- 125 level, type of centre (oncology centres v other hospitals), maximum diameter of lesion, proportion of solid tissue, more than 10 cyst locules, number of papillary projections, acoustic shadows, and ascites. The area under the {{receiver operating characteristic}} curve (AUC) for the classic discrimination between benign and malignant tumours was 0. 94 (0. 93 to 0. 95) on temporal validation. The AUC was 0. 85 for benign versus borderline, 0. 92 for benign versus stage I cancer, 0. 99 for benign versus stage II-IV cancer, and 0. 95 for benign versus secondary metastatic. AUCs between malignant subtypes varied between 0. 71 and 0. 95, with an AUC of 0. 75 for borderline versus stage I cancer and 0. 82 for stage II-IV versus secondary metastatic. Calibration curves showed that the estimated risks were accurate. Conclusions The <b>ADNEX</b> model discriminates well between benign and malignant tumours and offers fair to excellent discrimination between four types of ovarian malignancy. The use of <b>ADNEX</b> {{has the potential to}} improve triage and management decisions and so reduce morbidity and mortality associated with adnexal pathology. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to find out the incidence of ovarian torsion in the patients who were in ovulation induction treatment for either In vitro fertilization (IVF) or Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Also operative laparoscopic conservative treatment (detorsion or unwinding the twisted <b>adnex)</b> was tried to perform to all the patients. Among 10, 583 cycles 9 ovarian torsion cases had been diagnosed laparoscopically between January 1994 and October 1998. 104 ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) patients were evaluated during that time. From 104 hyperstimulated cases three had torsion of the <b>adnex</b> and two of them were pregnant. Five of the patients were clinically and one was chemically pregnant. First, laparoscopy was done to all the patients and 8 of them could be detorsioned, in one case unwinding performed by laparotomy because of the large size of the ovary. No complications were observed after conservative surgery. These results demonstrate that, in the IVF or ICSI clinics ovarian torsion has to be {{regarded as one of the}} major complications especially if the patients are hyperstimulated or pregnant or both. Immediate manipulation is needed conservatively, preserving the ovaries which were very important for those infertile patients. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
