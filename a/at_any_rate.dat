5|$|Recent {{research}} shows that the Mongol forces most probably never reached Pagan.

Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties, and retreated north to Tagaung.

5|$|The Eretrian {{strategy}} was to defend their walls, and undergo a siege. Possibly {{this was the only}} plan that could be agreed on, or became the default option when no plan was agreed. <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> since the Persian army had only suffered two defeats in the last century, and since a Greek army had never successfully fought the Persians, this was probably a sensible strategy.

5|$|The {{credence}} {{given to}} the reports was such that Pope Alexander III {{sent a letter to}} Prester John via his physician Philip on September 27, 1177. Nothing more is recorded of Philip, but it is most probable that he did not return with word from Prester John. The Letter continued to circulate, accruing more embellishments with each copy. In modern times, textual analysis of the letter's variant Hebrew versions has suggested an origin among the Jews of northern Italy or Languedoc: several Italian words remained in the Hebrew texts. <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> the Letters author was most likely a Westerner, though his or her purpose remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Thescelosaurus has {{generally}} been allied to Hypsilophodon and other small ornithopods as a hypsilophodontid, although recognized as being distinct among them for its robust build, unusual hindlimbs, and, more recently, its unusually long skull. Peter Galton in 1974 presented one twist to the classic arrangement, suggesting that because of its hindlimb structure and heavy build (not cursorial, or built for running, by his definition), it {{should be included in}} the Iguanodontidae. This has not been followed, with Morris arguing strongly against Galton's classification scheme. <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> Galton's Iguanodontidae was polyphyletic and not a natural group, and so would not be recognized under modern cladistic usage.|$|E

5|$|This time, the Burmese king {{received}} the imperial envoys but still refused to submit. The Burmese chronicles {{say that the}} king was so insulted {{that he had the}} envoys executed. But both Burmese inscriptional evidence and Yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed. <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> the imperial envoys did not get back to Yunnan in due time.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Philip {{engaged in a}} flurry of {{diplomatic}} activity. He bribed Berisades, son of the Thracian king Cotys, to withdraw Thracian support for Pausanias, and thereby prevented the Thracian invasion. Similarly, he bought off the Paionians with gifts in exchange for their withdrawal from Macedon. Philip may also have concluded a treaty with the victorious Dardanian king Bardylis, possibly surrendering large parts of Macedon in exchange for peace. Although no evidence remains of such a treaty, the fact that Illyrians did not follow up their victory despite Macedon's weakness is suggestive that some agreement was reached. Philip also married Bardylis's daughter (or niece), which may have formed part of the treaty. <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> Philip's diplomacy gave Macedon some breathing space and time for recovery.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus recounts that, {{according}} to the Athenians, as the battle began the Corinthians hoisted their sails and began sailing away from the battle, northwards up the straits. However, {{he also says that}} other Greeks denied this story. If this did in fact occur, one possible interpretation is that these ships had been a decoy sent to reconnoitre the northern exit from the straits, in case the arrival of the encircling Egyptian detachment was imminent (if indeed this also occurred). Another possibility (not exclusive of the former) is that the departure of the Corinthians triggered the final approach of the Persians, suggesting as it did that the Allied fleet was disintegrating. <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> if they indeed ever left, the Corinthians soon returned to the battle.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} quickly {{descended into}} a debacle. Aristagoras fell out with Megabates {{on the journey}} towards Naxos, and Herodotus says that Megabates then sent messengers to Naxos, warning the Naxians of the force's intention. It is also possible, however, that this story was spread by Aristagoras after the event, {{by way of a}} justification for the subsequent failure of the campaign. <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> the Naxians were able to prepare properly for a siege, and the Persians arrived to a well-defended expedition. The Persians laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually they and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force sailed back to the mainland without a victory.|$|E
5|$|The major {{characteristic}} of Prester John tales {{from this period}} is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever really been a Central Asian king. <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>rate</b> they had little hope of finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the Empire had provided. In works such as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville and Historia Trium Regum by John of Hildesheim, Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem Parzival, in which the Prester {{is the son of}} the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs.
