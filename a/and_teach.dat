40|$|Much of the self-image of the Western {{university}} {{hangs on}} the idea that research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> are intimately connected. The central axiom here is that research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> are mutually supportive of each other. An institution lacking such a set of relationships between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> falls short {{of what it means to}} be a university. This set of beliefs raises certain questions: Is it the case that the presence of such a mutually supportive set of relationships between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is a necessary condition of the fulfilment of the idea of the university? (A conceptual question). And is it true that, in practice today, such a mutually supportive set of relationships between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> characterises universities? (An empirical question). In my talk, I want to explore these matters in a critical vein. I shall suggest that: a) In practice today, such a mutually supportive set of relationships between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is in jeopardy. Far from supporting each other, very often research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> contend against each other. Research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> are becoming two separate ideologies, with their own interest structures. b) Historically, the supposed tight link between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is both of recent origin and far from universally achieved in universities. Institutional separateness between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is <b>and</b> has been evident, both across institutions and even across departments in the same institution. c) Conceptually, research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> are different activities: each is complex and neither is reducible to the other. In theory, therefore, research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> may be said to constitute a holy alliance but in practice, we see more of an unholy alliance. If, then, in an ideal world, a positive relationship between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is still a worthwhile goal, how might it be construed and worked for? Seeing research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> as two discrete and unified sets of activity is now inadequate. Much better is a construal of research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> as themselves complexes, as intermingling pools of activity helping to form the liquid university that is emerging today. On this view, research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> are fluid spaces, ever on the move, taking up new shapes, and themselves dividing and reforming, as the university reworks its own destiny in modern society. On such a perspective, working out a productive relationship between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is a complex project. This is an alliance that is neither holy nor unholy. It is an uneasy alliance, with temporary accommodations and continuous new possibilitie...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E
