40|$|Background: The role of trace {{elements}} in various biochemical processes inside {{the human body}} is vital and undeniable. New studies strictly emphasize the effect of life style and nutritional habits on the body health and improvement of public hygiene. This study aimed to compare the levels of Iron, Zinc, Manganese, and Copper in both herbs of <b>Anethum</b> <b>graveolens</b> <b>L.</b> and Trigonella foenum-graecum L. in daily diet. Materials and Methods: In this laboratory study, at first, the two fresh herbs of <b>Anethum</b> <b>graveolens</b> <b>L.</b> and Trigonella foenum-graecum L. were prepared and after the production of their wet ash, {{trace elements}} of Iron, Zinc, Manganese, and Copper were measured in both herbs. All of the measurements were performed using the atomic absorption spectroscopy against standard solutions of the four-mentioned elements. Results: Results from the measurements of the mentioned elements in the two herbs were according to the following: for <b>Anethum</b> <b>graveolens</b> <b>L.</b> Iron (9. 49), Copper (0. 173), Manganese (1. 31), and Zinc (1. 311) and for Trigonella foenum-graecum L. Iron (2. 24), Copper (0. 255), Manganese (0. 959), and Zinc (1. 514). (Note: These numbers are based on mg in 100 g of fresh herb).

The antioxidant property of <b>Anethum</b> <b>graveolens</b> was evaluated. Material and methods: A total of 36 mice (25 - 30 g) were randomized into 6 equal groups. Memory enhancing activity of <b>Anethum</b> <b>graveolens</b> in amnesic mice was investigated by using Elevated plus maze and Morris water maze. AchE activity, SOD and lipid peroxidation of brain homogenate were performed in control/ scopolamine/ standard / <b>Anethum</b> <b>graveolens</b> leaves extract treated mice. Result:Administrationof <b>Anethum</b> <b>graveolens</b> leaves extract significantly treated the learning and memory impairment induced by scopolamine. The effects were evaluated with the help of Morris water maze and Elevated plus maze.

In fact, Ferrous ion chelating activity, superoxide anion radical scavenging property, tyrosinase inhibition and total flavonoids of the oils were determined. Results: Chelating activity of 7. 8 µg of EDTA was equivalent to 2 µg of the pure oil. The oils had superoxide anion radical scavenging activities which may be related to their total phenol and flavonoid contents. IC 50 of ferrous ion chelating, antityrosiase and superoxide anion radical scavenging activities of pure and commercial oils were 1. 3, 1. 4, 1 and (171. 6, 589, 132) µg respectively.

Methods: This double-blind, clinical trial was conducted on pregnant women who met the inclusion criteria and referred to Hajar hospital in Shahrekord, Iran during 2015 - 2016. By simple random sampling, the patients were divided into two groups. In the first group, 10 cc Dill (<b>Anethum</b> <b>graveolens</b> <b>L.)</b> seed oil was prescribed at intervals of half an hour and one hour before spinal anesthesia and half an hour, one hour and two hours after spinal anesthesia. In the second group, placebos (standard treatment) were prescribed at the same intervals. Pain and vital signs, including blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, heart rate, bleeding, use of narcotics and NSAID and any additional medications (such as atropine and ephedrine) were recorded and rechecked during surgery, thirty minutes after spinal anesthesia and one hour, four hours and twelve hours after cesarean section. Results: The findings showed a significant difference between the two groups in the third stage of the study (4 hours after cesarean section) only in respiratory rate and in the fourth stage of the study (12 hours after cesarean section) in all vital signs (p< 0. 05). Also, the pain and nausea rate in the third and fourth stages of the study in the case group (Dill seed oil) were lower than those of the control group, indicating a significant difference in the pain level (p< 0. 05). The bleeding rate and use of NSAIDs and opioids twelve hours after caesarian section in the case group were significantly lower than those of the control group (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: considering the effect of Dill (<b>Anethum</b> <b>graveolens</b> <b>L.)</b> seed oil on reducing pain, bleeding rate and use of narcotics and NSIADs, it can be used in women undergoing cesarean section...|$|E
