500|$|In 1936, {{the poem}} was {{included}} in Collected Poems 1909–1935, of which 11,000 copies were published; the collection symbolically represented the completion of his former poems and his moving onto later works. [...] "Burnt Norton" [...] was Eliot's only major poem to be completed during a six-year period <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> writing plays and continued with his work on essays. The poem was re-published as an independent work in 1941, the same year [...] "East Coker" [...] and [...] "The Dry Salvages", two later poems of the Four Quartets, were published.|$|E
500|$|North Korean anti {{aircraft}} fire struck Sebille's P-51 <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> make {{a second}} run, heavily damaging the aircraft {{and it began}} trailing smoke and glycol coolant. Sebille had intended to release his second bomb, but he radioed Johnson {{that he had been}} hit and injured, probably fatally. Johnson radioed back Sebille should try to head for a US emergency landing strip in Taegu a short distance away, but Sebille responded with his last known words, [...] "No, I'll never make it. I'm going back and get that bastard (sic)". He dove straight toward the APC that was his target. He fired his six rockets in salvo, but instead of pulling up to the regular , he deliberately continued to dive his airplane and the remaining bomb straight into the target, firing his six machine guns. His plane sustained even heavier damage, and he crashed into the North Korean convoy destroying a large contingent of North Korean ground troops and vehicles though being killed instantly himself.|$|E

500|$|As a bowler, Miller had a classically high arm action, {{moving the}} ball sharply either way {{and able to}} make the ball rise from a good length. His action caused {{opposition}} batsmen to perceive that his deliveries were gaining pace after pitching. He was often able to generate more pace than his new ball partner, Lindwall. He was always willing to try something new if the batsman were set, varying his approach from fifteen paces to five and vice versa. A round arm delivery often managed to capture a wicket, surprising the batsman. Compton said that Miller [...] "often had no preconceived idea what he intended to bowl even <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> start his run". Miller often mixed slow leg breaks when he was bowling off a run. He once bowled English opening batsman David Sheppard with a googly during a Test. Hutton opined that Miller was the bowler who was least concerned with the position of his bowling mark, and said that he [...] "never felt physically safe against him". His use of bouncers at Trent Bridge during the 1948 tour was seen as excessive by the English crowd, who booed him. Miller simply sat down until the barracking had subsided. He was often required to bowl through pain, pressing a disk into place {{at the base of his}} spine before sending down the next delivery.|$|E
500|$|At 2:27p.m., Reagan {{exited the}} hotel through [...] "President's Walk" [...] and its T Street NW exit toward his waiting {{limousine}} as Hinckley waited within {{the crowd of}} admirers. The Secret Service had extensively screened those attending the president's speech. In a [...] "colossal mistake", the agency allowed an unscreened group to stand within [...] of him, behind a rope line. Unexpectedly, Reagan passed {{right in front of}} Hinckley. Believing he would never get a better chance, Hinckley fired a Röhm RG-14 [...]22LR blue steel revolver six times in 1.7 seconds, missing the president with all six shots. The first bullet hit White House Press Secretary James Brady in the head and the second hit District of Columbia police officer Thomas Delahanty {{in the back of his}} neck <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> protect Reagan. Hinckley now had a clear shot at the president, but the third bullet overshot him and hit the window of a building across the street. As Special Agent In Charge Jerry Parr quickly pushed Reagan into the limousine, the fourth bullet hit Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy in the abdomen as he spread his body over Reagan to make himself a target. The fifth bullet hit the bullet-resistant glass of the window on the open side door of the limousine. The sixth and final bullet ricocheted off the armored side of the limousine and hit the president in the left underarm, grazing a rib and lodging in his lung, causing it to partially collapse, and stopping less than an inch (25mm) from his heart. [...] Parr's prompt reaction had saved Reagan from being hit in the head.|$|E
500|$|The Mk 12 Gun Assembly (pictured) was a semi-automatic, power rammed, {{vertical}} sliding-wedge {{breech block}} type gun. Since this gun assembly fired semi-fixed ammunition, (pictured) each round {{was delivered to}} the guns in two pieces. Each gun, in this twin mount, had its own projectile hoist and powder case hoist from the upper handling room. The electric-hydraulic projectile hoist would deliver a projectile next to the projectile man with the nose down and waist high. The electric-hydraulic powder case hoist poked the case through a powder scuttle in the gun room's deck just next to the powder man's feet. [...] At the load command, the powder man would slip a primer protector {{off the end of}} the powder case, extract the case from the scuttle, and lift it into the gun's rammer tray. Meanwhile, the projectile man would pull a projectile out of the hoist, and place it in the rammer tray in front of the powder case. Then, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> get the next projectile out of the hoist, the projectile man would pull down on the rammer lever. This caused the power rammer to ram the projectile and powder case into the chamber. As the powder case cleared the top of the breechblock, the block would rise to seal the chamber. The gun was ready to fire. The case combination primer in the base of the powder case could be fired either electrically or by percussion. Electrical firing was the preferred method because the firing circuit could be energized by firing keys down in the plotting room when firing salvos at surface targets, or up in the director when firing at air targets. Percussion firing could be executed by the Pointer (man controlling elevation) by pushing a foot treadle. When the gun fired, the recoil's rearward motion returned the rammer lever to the up position, and the rammer would drive back {{to the rear of the}} rammer tray. During counter-recoil, the breechblock was automatically lowered and the spent powder case was ejected from the chamber. When the gun returned to battery, a blast of compressed air was sent down the bore to clean it out. The gun was ready to be reloaded.|$|E

2500|$|Žigić's tenth goal of {{the season}} gave Birmingham an early lead at Portsmouth, {{but it did not}} last. Chris Maguire {{equalised}} with a deflected free kick after a foul by Davies on Luke Varney, then Murphy received a second yellow card for a foul on Maguire, and from the resultant free kick, David Norris controlled the ball before turning to score; Birmingham lost their composure and the match, by four goals to one. Hughton said afterwards that he had [...] "not been as angry with any other refereeing performance this season", suggesting that the foul on Varney, for which Davies was booked, was in fact a foul by Varney, as the player himself admitted, that Norris had used his hand to control the ball <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> shoot, and that Murphy's second booking, for [...] "minimal" [...] shoulder-to-shoulder contact, was harsh– a view reinforced by the normally undemonstrative Murphy's aggressive reaction to his dismissal. King had a penalty saved in a draw with Cardiff City, and a 3–1 win at Doncaster Rovers in which both King and Žigić struck the woodwork and King was booked for diving when apparently fouled by the goalkeeper, moved Birmingham up to fourth in the table.|$|E
