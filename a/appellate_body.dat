However, trade liberalization poses great risk to the environment, which has been in a process of deterioration.

40|$|The {{dispute in}} EC – Seal Products raises {{fundamental}} {{questions about the}} relationship between public morals and international trade. Can WTO members impose trade restrictions based on moral or ethical concerns? Under what conditions can these concerns trump existing trade liberalization commitments? The dispute was filed in 2009 by Canada and Norway against the EU, which in the same year had banned seal products from being imported and placed on its market. According to the EU, the policy was introduced in response to European moral outrage at the inhumane killing of seals. The EU seal regime included a series of exceptions. In particular, it allowed imports of seal products hunted by Inuit or other indigenous communities, as well as imports of seal products processed and re-exported by EU producers.

40|$|Global Constitutional Lawmaking Abstract This article {{identifies}} {{a nascent}} phenomenon of “global constitutional lawmaking” {{in a recent}} WTO jurisprudence which struck down a certain calculative methodology (“zeroing”) in the antidumping area. The article interprets the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body’s</b> uncharacteristic anti-zeroing hermeneutics, which departs from a traditional treaty interpretation under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the past pro-zeroing GATT case law, as a “constitutional” turn of the WTO. The article argues that a positivist, inter-governmental mode of thinking, as is prevalent in other international {{organizations such as the}} United Nations, cannot fully expound this phenomenon. Critically, this turn originates from bold ideas which envision, and thus “constitute,” new institutional meaning and possibilities within the WTO, which are anchored firmly by a discernible purpose of cabining trade distortive/restrictive consequences from the use of zeroing which have long been left unchecked. The legitimacy (sustainability) of such constitutional lawmaking can be secured not only by exogenous factors such as domestic political support but also by endogenous factors such as normative recognition by the domestic legal system (“internalization) ...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body's</b> (AB) {{treatment}} of a particular legal question often provides insight into issues of more general importance. In this article, examination of the AB's {{treatment of}} a particular subsidy issue is used to explore the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures' (SCM Agreement) definition of subsidy and to question {{the efficacy of the}} AB's reliance on texturalism. The legal question analyzed arose when European governments challenged the US's imposition of countervailing duties (CVDs) on steel manufactured by 'privatized' steel companies. The US claimed the CVDs were proper since subsidies provided prior to privatization had 'passed through' to the privatized companies. The AB, relying heavily on the meaning of words rather than on consideration of 'object and purpose', found that the US had violated its obligations under the SCM Agreement. An analysis of the AB's logic and the authorities cited demonstrates that neither justifies the AB's conclusion. A heuristic model of the definition of subsidy is used to show that the question raised by privatization implicates issues of causation, overlooked by the AB, that are important in correctly interpreting the SCM Agreement. The problems arising from AB texturalism are contrasted with the justifications given for that approach, suggesting that a change in approach may be warranted., Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} Panel case under the WTO, which {{squarely}} deals with a Customs Valuation Agreement (CVA) and GATT V. Usually, impacts of disputes under CVA and/or GATT V are considered relatively small and do not get much attention {{compared with those of}} GATT III and/or GATT XI. Further, this Panel analyzes, in a careful manner, CVA and GATT V in accordance with the "Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties" (VCLT), and its conclusion is quite reasonable and yields no surprises. However, in practice, the number of trade disputes related to CVA and GATT V is large and their practical importance is not negligible. It is quite important for trade practitioners who deal with disputes under CVA and GATT V to be able to discuss with their counterparts issues that are not only based on their own interpretations, but are also based on the Panel's decision. Further to CVA and GATT V, this case also deals with GATT XI and GATT XX (d).

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{identifiable}} instances of national law generating international law is {{through the use of}} domestic legislation as the model for a treaty provision. This paper seeks to identify some consequences of using domestic legislation in this way by examining the World Trade Organization (WTO) where numerous obligations are modelled on national law. It argues that, far from straightforward, such a process is a particularly unpredictable form of law-making, the results of which are intelligible only as part of a complex process of "norm export". This paper proceeds in three parts: first, it outlines the motivation for norm export, and identifies one method, embedding domestic law in an international legal system; second, it identifies an example from international trade remedies law modelled on US provisions, and the subsequent unexpected interpretation by the Appellate Body; third and finally, it analyses the seeming failure of the US to establish uniform provisions consistent with its own law in this area, reframing critiques of the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body's</b> treatment of these US-originated WTO provisions. It does this by acknowledging the multiple exercises of norm export by actors, not only in these specific agreements but also in others, most notably in this case, the constituent document of the WTO's dispute settlement system, the Dispute Settlement Understanding, stressing the complexities involved in norm export and the inherent unpredictability of such an exercise...|$|R
40|$|Weinert, MatthewIntergovernmental {{organizations}} (IOs) {{are often}} {{capable of taking}} actions of their own volition – whether through design, delegation, or interpretation – so what are their interests and how do these direct their actions? This dissertation presents a framework to understand these interests and how they affect IOs’ actions. The framework identifies that organizations have competing demands from their external and internal environments which evoke endogenous and exogenous interests, respectively, and that these interests {{interact with one another}} to direct the action of the organization. The external environment of IOs represents the outside actors, norms, and events the organization must interact with, and their internal environment represents the organizations’ mandates, interpretation of charters, and political culture. This framework is applied to three cases of IO action under contentious circumstances where the IO is tasked with making difficult decisions. The cases include the World Trade Organization’s <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body’s</b> decision to allow unsolicited amicus briefs to be presented during Member-state trade disputes; UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali’s innovative approach to peacekeeping and the ensuing tumult; and the World Health Organization’s widely criticized response to the Ebola epidemic of 2014.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the compliance dispute brought by India alleging lack of compliance by the European Communities with an earlier WTO ruling on anti-dumping duties for cotton-type bed linen. India raised some {{issues relating to}} the EC treatment of “other factors ” {{in the conduct of}} its injury analysis that India had briefly noted in the original proceeeding but had not argued in full. India further claimed that the EC was in violation of WTO rules by treating all imports from firms not individually investigated {{as if they had been}} dumping when conducting its revised injury analysis, even though some of the firms individually investigated were found not to be dumping. We suggest that the first of these issues raises some interesting questions about the proper scope of res judicata, issue preclusion, and waiver in WTO jurisprudence. To highlight these questions, we develop a novel analytical model to compare expected litigation costs in a judicial system with a rule of waiver, to those in a system in which litigants can bring multiple claims. We show that a rule of waiver need not minimize litigation costs, because some disputes can be resolved at lower cost if a claimant is not forced to bring all of its arguments at once. On the question of the legality of treating all uninvestigated firms as if they engaged in dumping in the course of injury analysis, we conclude that the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body’s</b> decision has some economic appeal, but it rests on shaky legal foundation...|$|R
