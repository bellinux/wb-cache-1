40|$|Ethernet {{is a key}} {{component}} of the standards used for digital process buses in transmission substations, namely IEC 61850 and IEEE Std 1588 - 2008 (PTPv 2). These standards use multicast Ethernet frames that can be processed by more than one device.

A system of network traffic segregation using a combination of Virtual LAN (VLAN) and multicast <b>address</b> <b>filtering</b> using managed Ethernet switches is presented.

A method to map substation plant reference designations to multicast address ranges is proposed that enables engineers to determine the type of traffic and location of the source by inspecting the destination address.

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the filtering problem for a class of discrete-time stochastic nonlinear networked control systems with network-induced incomplete measurements. The incomplete measurements include both the multiple random communication delays and random packet losses, which are modeled by a unified stochastic expression in terms of a set of indicator functions that is dependent on certain stochastic variable. The nonlinear functions are assumed to satisfy the sector nonlinearities. The purpose of the <b>addressed</b> <b>filtering</b> problem is to design a linear filter such that the filtering-error dynamics is exponentially mean-square stable. By using the linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) method and delay-dependent technique, sufficient conditions are derived which are dependent on the occurrence probability of both the random communication delays and missing measurement. The filter gain is then characterized by the solution to a set of LMIs. A simulation example is exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedures.

Both the Lipschitz-like and ellipsoid-bounded nonlinearities are considered. The non-Gaussian noises {{are assumed to}} be unknown, bounded, and confined to specified ellipsoidal sets. The aim of the <b>addressed</b> <b>filtering</b> problem is to develop a recursive algorithm based on the semi-definite programme method such that, for the admissible time-delays, nonlinear parameters and external bounded noise disturbances, the quadratic estimation error is not more than a certain optimized upper bound at every time step. The filter parameters are characterized in terms of the solution to a convex optimization problem that can be easily solved by using the semi-definite programme method. A simulation example is exploited to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedures.

40|$|Abstract—Source <b>address</b> <b>filtering</b> {{is used as}} an {{important}} mechanism to prevent malicious traffic. Currently, most networks store filters in hardware such as TCAM, which has limited capacity, high power consumption and high cost. Although software can accommodate large number of filters, it needs multiple accesses to memory on the border router, which bears much more additional burden than other routers. In this paper, we propose a software-based mechanism for source <b>address</b> <b>filtering.</b> In our mechanism, we only need to check a few bits in source addresses on each router, rather than checking all bits on the ingress router. Through cooperation among routers, our mechanism ensures that malicious traffic will be filtered in the network. We formulate this problem as finding a cooperative scheme such that the loads on all routers are optimally balanced. We show that the problem can be optimally solved by dynamic programming. We evaluate our algorithms using comprehensive simulations with BRITE generated topologies and real world topologies. We conduct a case study on China Education and Research Network 2 (CERNET 2) configurations, a large IPv 6 network. Compared to checking 128 -bit IP addresses on ingress routers, our algorithm checks at most 40 bits on each router. I...|$|E
