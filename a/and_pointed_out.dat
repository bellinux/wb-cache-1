5|$|Barkley {{maintained}} that Hoover's {{response to the}} continuing depression and the severe drought in 1930 were inadequate <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the $45million in loans to farmers that he approved amounted to {{less than half the}} losses sustained by Kentucky's farmers alone. He was angered that Hoover refused to call a special legislative session to adopt relief measures after the regular congressional adjourned in early March 1931. He planned a series of speeches condemning Hoover beginning in June but was injured in an automobile accident on June 22, limiting his political activities {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Chiang {{ran into}} stiff {{opposition}} from his officers, including the powerful Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission He Yingqin, the Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, {{the head of}} the Fifth War Zone Li Zongren, and his German advisor Alexander von Falkenhausen. They argued that the Chinese Army needed more time to recover from its losses at Shanghai, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that Nanking was highly indefensible topographically. The mostly gently sloping terrain in front of Nanking would make it easy for the attackers to advance on the city, while the Yangtze River behind Nanking would cut off the defenders' retreat.|$|E

5|$|During Linnaeus' time it {{was normal}} for upper class women to have wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing {{campaign}} to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student, based on their experiences. In {{the tradition of the}} period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (prases) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus' dissertation was translated into French by J.E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice marâtre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage mercénaire. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> how none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk. It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms.|$|E
5|$|His derision {{of working}} class British Labour {{politicians}} also caused problems. When, in January 1966, three visiting Labour MPs were manhandled, kicked and punched {{while attempting to}} address 400 supporters of the Rhodesian Front, Van der Byl blamed the three for refusing an offer from his Ministry to co-ordinate the visit, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that they were breaking the law which required government permission for any political meeting of more than 12 people.|$|E

5|$|By September, several Blenheims were {{equipped}} {{with what was}} now officially known as AI Mk. I and training of the crews began with No. 25 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, {{and coming up with}} useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in the nose <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to Bowen that the enemy gunners would see the light from the CRTs and shoot the operator. The sets were re-fitted once again, returning {{to the rear of the}} fuselage, which caused more delays.|$|E
5|$|Others {{point out}} that in philosophy, a {{critical}} and skeptical reaction followed on from the Condemnations 1277. Since the theologians had asserted that Aristotle had erred in theology, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{the negative consequences of}} uncritical acceptance of his ideas, scholastic philosophers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (both Franciscan friars) believed he might also be mistaken in matters of philosophy. The Scotist and Ockhamist movements set Scholasticism on a different path from that of Albert the Great and Aquinas, and the theological motivation of their philosophical arguments {{can be traced back to}} 1277. They stressed the traditional Franciscan themes of Divine Omnipotence and Divine Freedom, which formed part of Ockham's first thesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{reality was}} very different. Lody's body {{was buried in}} an unmarked common grave in the East London Cemetery in Plaistow along with {{seventeen}} other men– ten executed spies and seven prisoners who died of ill-health or accidents. It was not until 1924 that the grave received a marker, at the instigation of the German Embassy. Lody's relatives were visiting it once a year and enquired whether his body could be exhumed and buried in a private grave. The War Office agreed, providing that the body could be identified, but the Foreign Office was more reluctant <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that a licence for exhumation {{would have to be}} authorised by the Home Office. The Lody family placed a white headstone and kerb on the grave some time around 1934.|$|E

5|$|While {{living in}} Boston and {{pursuing}} his chosen major, English literature, Marcus began a lifelong hobby of collecting rare and antique books. To finance his pursuits, he began The Book Collector's Service Bureau, a mail-order book service, {{beginning with a}} letter of introduction sent to 100 homes. The venture proved so successful that for a time Marcus considered entering that line of work full time, concerned that entering the retail business might curtail his freedom of expression in politics and other areas of interest; his father persuaded {{him that he would}} always be granted the liberty of his own views, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that retailing was more profitable and thus would allow him to amass a large book collection that much sooner.|$|E
5|$|After the games, Evans {{returned}} to the United States to continue his studies and collegiate swimming career. Before the 1984 Olympics, Evans travelled to Hong Kong to train with Haller, who was coaching the British colony's swimming team. Evans revitalised himself under his favourite coach and {{returned to}} his old style of sprinting. He twisted his ankle later in Perth and missed some training time. He won the Australian 100m breaststroke championship to qualify for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and returned to Arizona to continue training. His Olympic campaign was placed in jeopardy when the ASU threatened to remove Evans from the team for skipping their training camp in Australia. The threat was withdrawn after Evans' father confronted the ASU <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that his son was training, although in a different location. Before the Games, Evans joined the Australians for their final training camp at Stanford University in California. Evans arrived in Los Angeles with the same program as in Moscow; he entered both breaststroke events and the medley relay. Evans started brightly to win his heat of the 100m breaststroke in an Olympic record time of 1m 2.87s. His new mark did not last long—John Moffet broke it in a later heat to relegate Evans to the second-fastest qualifying time.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Thurman {{attended}} the San Francisco Conference for {{the founding of}} the United Nations as part of an unofficial delegation. The official African-American delegation included W. E. B. Du Bois, founder of the NAACP; Walter Francis White, Executive Secretary of the NAACP; and Mary McLeod Bethune founder of the National Council of Negro Women, but Bethune insisted on sending three additional observers from the NCNW, which included Thurman. After the event, Thurman published a report in the Chicago Defender on April 16, 1945, in which she questioned the limited role that people of color played in the proceedings <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the large populations of developing countries would become {{a force to be reckoned}} with. Thurman, as a representative for the NCNW, {{attended the}} Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, in 1947. The congress addressed many of the issues she supported such as women's rights, internationalism, and peace initiatives. In 1949, she led a delegation of members from the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples to Paris for the Fourth Plenary Session of UNESCO.|$|E

5|$|Like other ankylosaurids, Ankylosaurus had {{cervical}} half-rings (armor {{plates on}} the neck), {{but these are}} only known from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, and created an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on the neck, and that it covered {{the base of the}} neck and continued onto the shoulder region. Paleontologists Victoria M. Arbour and Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around {{the upper part of the}} neck, as in the closely related Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
5|$|On June 22 the FIA {{produced}} {{a press release}} from Max Mosley, {{in the form of}} a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in one corner, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E
5|$|Support for Chovanec's {{comments}} {{was largely}} {{among members of}} parliament elected for the Communist Party. Others accused Chovanec of abusing the tragedy for his own political benefit. Some members of parliament, such as Miroslav Antl, Chairman of the Senate Constitutional Committee, commented that the licensing process is thorough enough, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that he considers carrying of concealed firearm as a necessity due to variety of reasons, especially in recent time also due to the rising threat of Islamist terrorist attacks. Roman Váňa, Chairman of the Parliamentary Security Committee and member of Chovanec's own Social Democratic party, refused Chovanec's argument, while some other members of parliament went in the opposite direction, claiming {{that there are too}} few armed people among the Czech population, since a single armed civilian might have stopped Kovář's assault. The sentiment was shared also by, for example, Martin Koller, a former ambassador to Kuvait and Iraq, who said that an armed attacker may be stopped only by armed force, and who pointed out to a past well-known Czech case of a machete attack and to the Charlie Hebdo shooting, stating that both might have ended quite differently had the victims been armed.|$|E

5|$|The Washington Post {{columnist}} Dana Milbank {{wrote in}} his 2010 book Tears of a Clown, that Beck had been baited by Eiland-Hall to confirm {{the importance of the}} United Nations. Alexander Zaitchik came to a similar conclusion in his 2010 book Common Nonsense, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the discrepancy between Beck's criticism of the United Nations as part of a New World Order with Beck's subsequent reliance upon the WIPO where he chose to file the case. The case was cited by Jude A. Thomas in a 2011 article published in the John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law. In a discussion of the conflicts between freedom of speech and trademark, Thomas noted that panels of the UDRP have concluded website operators had fair use over domain names even in cases where the name in question was exactly the same as that trademarked by the individual filing the complaint to the WIPO.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Statement that {{eventually}} became the Forty-Two Articles are equally obscure. As early as December 1549, the archbishop was demanding from his bishops subscription to certain doctrinal articles. In 1551 Cranmer presented a version of {{a statement to the}} bishops, but its status remained ambiguous. Cranmer did not devote much effort into developing the articles, most likely due to work on the canon law revision. He became more interested once the hope for an ecumenical council began to fade. By September 1552, draft versions of the articles were being worked on by Cranmer and John Cheke, his scholarly friend who was commissioned to translate them into Latin. When the Forty-Two Articles were finally published in May 1553, the title-page declared that the articles were agreed upon by the Convocation and were published by the authority of the king. This was not in fact the case and the mistake was likely caused by miscommunications between the archbishop and the Privy Council. Cranmer complained about this to the council, but the authorities responded by noting that the articles were developed {{during the time of the}} Convocation—hence evading a direct answer. The council gave Cranmer the unfortunate task of requiring subscription to the articles from the bishops, many of whom opposed them <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the anomaly of the title-page. It was while Cranmer was carrying out this duty that events unfolded that would render the subscriptions futile.|$|E
