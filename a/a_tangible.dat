5|$|A forced {{variation}} {{that involves}} a sacrifice and usually results in <b>a</b> <b>tangible</b> gain {{is called a}} combination. Brilliant combinations– {{such as those in}} the Immortal Game– are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. A common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players' skills, is showing players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} {{a departure from}} that of his predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living emperors could be worshipped as divine {{in the east and}} dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from. Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as <b>a</b> <b>tangible,</b> living god.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Ginsberg's conviction, {{ruling that}} the New York State Legislature was not {{required}} to prove <b>a</b> <b>tangible</b> negative impact on youth from exposure to sexually explicit material. The Court said the New York State Legislature only needed to assume that such an impact existed. Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in the case, criticizing the New York law. He concluded he knew individuals who fit the definition of juvenile delinquent but were fifty years old, and extrapolated {{the impact of the}} decision could be expanded to affect adults and multiple organizations in society instead of just youths.|$|E

50|$|Placing <b>a</b> filter <b>tangible</b> {{between the}} VCO and the output causes the VCO's {{waveform}} {{to connect to}} the filter, and the filter waveform to connect to the output.

5|$|The author {{believes}} that determinations {{of what should}} be censored from whom should not {{be made by the}} government, stressing that a society must ensure that there is <b>a</b> <b>tangible</b> negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship. She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should and should not be censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship. Heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should be sure there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Under Warren's leadership, {{the school}} grew steadily, adding Schools of Dentistry, Nursing, and Public Health. Against some {{influential}} opposition, Warren established his medical {{school on the}} UCLA campus rather than {{in another part of}} the city. He strove to integrate not only the structures but the faculty with other departments of the university. He fostered the development of a major biomedical library as both <b>a</b> <b>tangible</b> and intellectual link between the life sciences and the health sciences.|$|E
5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an {{apparition}} of the murdered Banquo, along with eight kings of his family, descending through Fleance. King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, was the ninth Stuart king. This scene thus suggests strong support for James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, was <b>a</b> <b>tangible</b> fulfilment of the witches' prophecy. The apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} Snakedance, Saward {{requested that}} writer Christopher Bailey devise another story. The initial outline for May Time was commissioned on 24 August 1982 {{and was about}} the Doctor and his companions arriving at the court of Byzantium. Full scripts were commissioned on 16 September 1982 with the new title Man-watch, but the scripts were dropped from production for unclear reasons. A second attempt at the story under the title Children of Seth was attempted as a Sixth Doctor story, for which the scripts commissioned on 14 July 1983. This failed because of Bailey's failure to devise a structure for the new doctor's new 45 minute episode format and <b>a</b> <b>tangible</b> villain for the Doctor to face. It was later adapted as The Children of Seth by Marc Platt for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in December 2011. This version reverts to the TARDIS crew of the Fifth Doctor, Tegan and Nyssa.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} Calhoun's arrival in Washington, D.C., Tyler {{attempted}} to quickly finalize the treaty negotiations. Sam Houston, President of the Texas Republic, fearing Mexican retaliation, insisted on <b>a</b> <b>tangible</b> demonstration of U.S. commitments {{to the security}} of Texas. When key Texas diplomats failed to appear on schedule, the delay compelled Tyler to bring his new Secretary of State directly into negotiations. Secretary Calhoun was directed to honor former Secretary Upshur's verbal assurances of protection now offered by Calhoun in writing, to provide for U.S. military intervention in the event that Mexico used force to hold Texas. Tyler deployed U.S. Navy vessels to the Gulf of Mexico and ordered army units mobilized, entirely paid for with $100,000 of executive branch contingency funds. The move side-stepped constitutional requirements that Congress authorize appropriations for war.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of the United States regulates the music industry, enforces intellectual property laws, and promotes and collects certain kinds of music. Under American copyright law, musical works, including recordings and compositions, are protected as intellectual property {{as soon as they}} are fixed in <b>a</b> <b>tangible</b> form. Copyright holders often register their work with the Library of Congress, which maintains a collection of the material. In addition, the Library of Congress has actively sought out culturally and musicologically significant materials since the early 20th century, such as by sending researchers to record folk music. These researchers include the pioneering American folk song collector Alan Lomax, whose work helped inspire the roots revival of the mid-20th century. The federal government also funds the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, which allocate grants to musicians and other artists, the Smithsonian Institution, which conducts research and educational programs, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds non-profit and television broadcasters.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{distinction}} between a (alienable of) and o (inalienable of) is used for other semantic distinctions less clearly attributable to common alienability relationships except in metaphorical ways.

25|$|A {{characteristic}} {{trait of}} the movement was its defensive nature. Indeed, few offensive actions such as sabotages or occupation of localities have been recorded.

30|$|The results {{reported}} in the table provide evidence that the coefficient of tangibility is negative and statistically significant, indicating that firms having more tangible assets do less external financing regardless whether firms are financially constrained or unconstrained. The pecking order theory of capital structure also suggests {{that the relationship between}} tangibility and external financing is negative. <b>As</b> <b>tangible</b> assets are easier to value for outsiders than intangible asset, they lower the information asymmetries between managers and financers. Low information asymmetries decrease the cost of issuing new equity. We also find that the negative effect of tangibility on external financing is higher for financially constrained firms than financially unconstrained firms.|$|R
