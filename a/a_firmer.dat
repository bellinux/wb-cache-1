5|$|Bouldering {{is a form}} of rock {{climbing}} that is performed on large boulders, small rock formations or artificial rock walls, without the use of ropes or harnesses. While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide <b>a</b> <b>firmer</b> grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20ft.) tall. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders. Bouldering competitions, which employ a variety of formats, take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Gitera {{visited the}} king at his palace in Nyanza. Although Gitera had {{considerable}} {{respect for the}} monarchy, Rudahigwa treated him contemptuously; {{at one point he}} grabbed Gitera's throat, calling him and his followers inyangarwanda (haters of Rwanda). This humiliation prompted the MSM, APROSOMA and the pro-Hutu Catholic publications to take <b>a</b> <b>firmer</b> stance against the monarchy. Kinyamateka published a detailed report of Rudahigwa's treatment of Gitera, refuting his semi-divine image and accusing him of pro-Tutsi racism. The magazine also published stories citing the origin myths of the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa, calling the king's policies inconsistent with them. The articles did not immediately challenge the king's authority over the Hutu peasants, but their exposure of Rudahigwa's outburst led to a permanent schism between him, the Hutu counter-elite and Belgian authorities. In 1958 the Belgian colonial ministry tried to strip Rudahigwa of his power, reducing him to a figurehead, but his popularity with the regional chiefs and the Tutsi (who feared the growing Hutu movement) sparked a series of strikes and protests.|$|E

5|$|These {{events are}} {{at the tail end}} of the long GRB {{duration}} distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They have been proposed to form a separate class, caused by the collapse of a blue supergiant star, a tidal disruption event or a new-born magnetar. Only a small number have been identified to date, their primary characteristic being their gamma ray emission duration. The most studied ultra-long events include GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A. The low detection rate may be a result of low sensitivity of current detectors to long-duration events, rather than a reflection of their true frequency. A 2013 study, on the other hand, shows that the existing evidence for a separate ultra-long GRB population with a new type of progenitor is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength observations are needed to draw <b>a</b> <b>firmer</b> conclusion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Knowledge-based economies use {{knowledge}} as an input of production to produce knowledge-intensive products and services. In such economies, <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> growth crucially depends on knowledge accumulation, technical {{change and the}} resulting innovation activities. To achieve sustained growth, <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> must keep on innovating. <b>A</b> <b>firm’s</b> core competence and its refinement and development over time {{play a crucial role}} in <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> innovation activities and its growth. In this paper, a conceptual framework of <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> innovation and growth in knowledge-based economy is presented. This framework is based on <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> core competence and its development over time within a firms’ cluster. This model is empirically estimated and evaluated, in a pilot study, via a data set from a manufacturing cluster of 128 firms operating in the North East England. The empirical results provide some support for the proposed framework. In particular, it is found that the conditional probability that <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> undertakes R&D activity to innovate in such <b>a</b> cluster of <b>firms</b> is over 70...|$|R

This study utilizes a broader definition of organizational innovation capabilities that includes the generation, dissemination and strength of innovative activity in <b>a</b> <b>firm.</b> Such <b>a</b> composite measure is then used to predict market value of <b>a</b> <b>firm.</b> The unique features of this study are that it uses multiple indicators of firm innovation, it uses 10 year cross sectional, longitudinal data on <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> innovation profile along with lagged measures of market value...|$|R

5000|$|Generally, <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> {{must have}} revenue R ≥ TC, total costs, {{in order to}} avoid losses. However, in the short run, all fixed costs are sunk costs. Netting out fixed costs, <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> then faces the {{requirement}} that R ≥ VC, variable costs, in order to continue operating. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> will find it more profitable to operate so long as the market price p ≥ AVC, average variable cost. Conventionally stated the shutdown rule is: [...] "in the short run <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> should continue to operate if price exceeds average variable costs." [...] Restated, the rule is that to produce in the short run <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> must earn sufficient revenue to cover its variable costs. The rationale for the rule is straightforward. By shutting down <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> avoids all variable costs. However, the firm must still pay fixed costs. Because fixed cost must be paid regardless of whether <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> operates they should not be considered in deciding whether to produce or shut down.|$|R
