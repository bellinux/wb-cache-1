5|$|By 1721, the Baptist {{community}} in Taunton had grown large, <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> affluent. They {{built a new}} chapel, funded entirely by the congregation, very near {{to the site of}} the original Meeting House. The pastor of the church at the time was Joseph Jeffries, and during his ministry the church transitioned from a Baptist church to Unitarianism.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{shows the}} view from the boundary of the Nackington Road end of the St. Lawrence Ground with Canterbury Cathedral visible in the background. The painting has Blythe in the action of bowling from the Pavilion End to Johnny Tyldesley. Tayler compressed the view of the playing area so that he could feature all of Kent's eleven players while keeping them recognisable <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> sized.|$|E
5|$|The young Harriet {{spent much}} of her {{childhood}} at the family home at Fulbeck Hall in Lincolnshire, sited high on the limestone hills above Grantham. The house, which had been given to Henry Fane by his father, was a not over-large modern mansion at the time of Arbuthnot's childhood. It was rebuilt following a fire in 1733, and further extended and modernised in 1784 by Henry Fane. At Fulbeck Harriet and her 13 siblings enjoyed a comfortable <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> affluent rural childhood.|$|E

25|$|The Ambassador (1984) starred Robert Mitchum. King Solomon's Mines (1985) was an Indian Jones-style {{pastiche}} shot in Zimbabwe with Richard Chamberlain <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> {{successful at}} the box office. After Murphy's Law (1986) with Bronson tried another Indiana Jones-type tale with Chuck Norris, Firewalker (1986).|$|E
25|$|According to {{the person}} who was the last station master at Tapanui, the {{building}} widely identified as the Tapanui station was not the station. The station was across the road <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> close to the goods shed. The roof of the goods shed, the last railway building at Tapanui, has recently collapsed.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after their}} discovery, 28 of the 33 miners {{appeared}} in a 40-minute video recorded using a mini-camera delivered by the government via palomas ("doves", referring to their role as carrier pigeons), 5-foot-long (1.5 m) blue plastic capsules. The footage showed {{most of the men}} in good spirits <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> healthy, though they had all lost weight.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{in service}} the Redhens were {{mechanically}} robust <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> reliable; they were attractive options {{for use on}} heritage and tourist railways after retirement. However, their age, and the increasing service time since overhaul, has affected their reliability in preservation. Some continue to operate on broad gauge lines in south-eastern Australia. Many have been broken up, but {{the first and last}} units and a few others still exist.|$|E
25|$|Maher's {{argument}} {{considers a}} universe of exactly two objects, {{each of which is}} very unlikely to be a raven (a one in a thousand chance) <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> unlikely to be black (a one in ten chance). Using Carnap's formula for induction, he finds that the probability that all ravens are black decreases from 0.9985 to 0.8995 when it is discovered that one of the two objects is a black raven.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the {{geographic}} distribution of Nephila is large, {{there are many}} habitat similarities between these locations. A warm <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> wet climate is generally preferred, as {{these are some of}} the environmental cues that induce spiderling hatching. Locally, spiders look for relatively dense vegetation where webs can be set up in areas that insects will regularly fly through. Urban environments are also attractive due to the large prey concentrations and lower amounts of predation.|$|E
25|$|Car {{production}} resumed with a four-cylinder model, the TA 14, {{based on}} the pre-war 12/70. A solid, reliable and attractive car, the TA 14 fitted well the mood of sober austerity in post-war Britain, {{but much of the}} magic attaching to the powerful and sporting pre-war models had gone and life was not easy for a specialist car manufacturer. Not only had Alvis lost their car factory but many of the pre-war coachbuilders had not survived either and those that had were quickly acquired by other manufacturers. The post-war history of Alvis was dominated by the quest for reliable <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> priced coachwork.|$|E
25|$|In May 2007, the Salvadoran {{government}} produced its National Energy Policy, {{whose main}} objectives are: (i) ensuring proper, continuous, quality <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> priced energy supply; (ii) reduce vulnerability in energy provision through diversification of the country’s energy sources; (iii) minimize environmental impacts; and (iv) increase energy services coverage {{to the population}} and to the economic sectors. The specific objectives and strategic lines of the National Energy Policy include: (i) diversification and increase of energy sources; (ii) expansion of coverage; (iii) promotion of market efficiency and establishment of clear and stable rules; (iii) promotion of energy efficiency; and (iv) support for energy integration.|$|E

25|$|Space {{sickness}} {{was effectively}} unknown during the earliest spaceflights, as these were undertaken in very cramped conditions; {{it seems to}} be aggravated by being able to freely move around, and so is more common in larger spacecraft. Around 60% of Space Shuttle astronauts currently experience it on their first flight; the first case is now suspected to be Gherman Titov, in August 1961 onboard Vostok 2, who reported dizziness and nausea. However, the first significant cases were in early Apollo flights; Frank Borman on Apollo 8 and Rusty Schweickart on Apollo 9. Both experienced identifiable <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> severe symptoms—in the latter case causing the mission plan to be modified.|$|E
25|$|Miguel Ángel Asturias {{was born}} in Guatemala City on October 19, 1899, the first child of Ernesto Asturias Girón, a lawyer and judge, and María Rosales de Asturias, a schoolteacher. Two years later, his brother, Marco Antonio, was born. Asturias's parents were of Spanish descent, <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> distinguished: his father could trace his family line back to colonists who had arrived in Guatemala in the 1660s; his mother, whose ancestry was more mixed, was the {{daughter}} of a colonel. In 1905, when the writer was six years old, the Asturias family moved to the house of Asturias' grandparents, where they lived a more comfortable lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|These census numbers show a 363,000 {{population}} {{increase in the}} western states and territories between 1860 and 1870. Some of this increase is because of a high birth rate in the western states and territories, but most is from emigrants moving from the east {{to the west and}} new immigration from Europe. Much of the increase in California and Oregon is from emigration by ship, as there was fast <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> low cost transportation via east and west coast steamships and the Panama Railroad after 1855. The census numbers imply at least 200,000 emigrants (or more) used some variation of the California/Oregon/Mormon/Bozeman trails to get to their new homes between 1860 and 1870.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the judges}} commands, {{the dog and}} handler team walks a {{predetermined}} pattern with the dog remaining on the handler's left side <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> close and attentive to the handler. The dog also must automatically sit when the judge instructs the team to halt. Each sponsoring organization has different requirements for what must be included in this exercise but generally a heeling pattern must include: a left turn, a right turn, an about turn, a fast and slow section, and a halt. Heeling {{is one of the}} most basic obedience exercises and as such it is often incorporated into other exercises such as the moving stand and the figure 8. It is also how most teams will enter and move about the ring between exercises.|$|E
25|$|Under the Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education, {{primary schools}} {{were to be}} tuition-free <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> located for the {{convenience}} of children attending them; students would attend primary schools in their neighborhoods or villages. Parents paid a small fee per term for books and other expenses such as transportation, food, and heating. Previously, fees were not considered a deterrent to attendance. Under the education reform, students from poor families received stipends, and state enterprises, institutions, and other sectors of society were encouraged to establish their own schools. A major concern was that scarce resources be conserved without causing enrollment to fall and without weakening of the better schools. In particular, local governments were told not to pursue middle-school education blindly while primary school education was still developing, or to wrest money, teaching staff, and materials from primary schools.|$|E
25|$|Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661 (1994), is a United States Supreme Court case {{concerning}} the First Amendment rights of public {{employees in the}} workplace. By a 7–2 margin the justices held {{that it was not}} necessary to determine what a nurse at a public hospital had actually said while criticizing a supervisor's staffing practices to coworkers, as long as the hospital had formed a reasonable belief as to the content of her remarks <b>and</b> <b>reasonably</b> believed that they could be disruptive to its operations. They vacated a Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in her favor, and ordered the case remanded to district court to determine instead if the nurse had been fired for the speech or other reasons, per the Court's ruling two decades prior in Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle.|$|E

60|$|Doubtless it was {{a partial}} {{wandering}} of the mind that took the poor old woman away on this old-witch flight; {{and it was very}} curious and pitiful to witness the compunction with which she returned to herself and took herself to task for the preference which, in her wild nature, she could not help giving to harum-scarum wickedness over tame goodness. Now she tried to compose herself, <b>and</b> talk <b>reasonably</b> <b>and</b> godly.|$|R
