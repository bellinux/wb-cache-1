5|$|The Oakridge {{students}} are placed into learning groups named after animals. Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) initially suspects her daughter Juanita (Madison De La Garza), {{who is in}} the Leopards, is among the slow group, whereas Susan (Teri Hatcher) is pleased that her son M.J. (Mason Vale Cotton) is in the Giraffes, which she believes are advanced. This leads to competitive behavior between the two ladies. Eventually, by taking pictures of different students' homework and studying them, Gabrielle realizes the Leopards are actually advanced and the Giraffes are slow. When Susan realizes this, she confronts a teacher in public, and the secret code of the animal groups becomes widespread. While Susan and Gabrielle wait to talk to the principal, they both admit they got carried away and confess fears that they <b>are</b> <b>letting</b> their kids down.|$|E

25|$|Alex {{returns to}} his parents' flat, {{only to find that}} they <b>are</b> <b>letting</b> his room to a lodger. Now homeless, he wanders the streets and enters a public library, hoping to learn of a painless method for {{committing}} suicide. The old scholar whom Alex had assaulted in Part 1 finds him and beats him, with the help of several friends. Two policemen come to Alex's rescue, but turn out to be Dim and Billyboy, a former rival gang leader. They take Alex outside of town, brutalise him, and abandon him there. Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realising too late that it is the one he and his droogs invaded in Part 1. The writer, F. Alexander, still lives here, but his wife has since died of injuries she sustained in the gang-rape. He does not recognise Alex, but gives him shelter and questions him about the conditioning he has undergone. Alexander and his colleagues, all highly critical of the government, plan to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thus prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected. Alex inadvertently reveals that he was the ringleader of the home invasion; he is removed from the cottage and locked in an upper-story bedroom as a relentless barrage of classical music plays over speakers. He attempts suicide by leaping from the window.|$|E

500|$|The {{proposal}} of using criminal sanctions to enforce attendance under this new system was opposed by MPs {{from both the}} Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who believed compulsion and threats were the wrong approach to increasing participation. A spokesperson for the DfES said the proposals were not about [...] "forcing young people to do something they don't want to", and that [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>letting</b> young people down if we allow them to leave education and training without skills {{at the age of}} 16." [...] However, the Prime Minister's Queen's Speech in November 2007, which discussed the raise in school leaving age, suggested that pupils who failed to comply with new laws are to be expected to face fines or community service, rather than custodial sentencing which had previously been proposed. Local Authorities will also be expected to ensure pupils are participating up to 18 years of age.|$|E
500|$|On October 10, 2016, {{approximately}} 15 {{minutes of}} footage was screened at 115 IMAX 3D locations in North America, and select 3D and IMAX 3D locations worldwide. Fans attending the event received an exclusive IMAX poster for the film. Umberto Gonzales of TheWrap called the footage [...] "stunning to behold". He added that a sequence shown {{in which the}} Ancient One sends Strange [...] "on his first trippy tour through the multiverse" [...] was [...] "where the IMAX 3D really shines. The audience is given an incredible visual tour of the multiverse which features other dimensions and other realities. It really is something to behold in IMAX 3D," [...] concluding that [...] "after being shown only 15 minutes of incredible preview footage, IMAX 3D is the definitive format to see the film." [...] Britt Hayes for Screen Crush felt the footage was [...] "dizzying" [...] and [...] "far weirder and wilder than [...] trailers <b>are</b> <b>letting</b> on," [...] though {{felt it was a}} bit difficult [...] "to judge some of what was shown out of context (especially earlier scenes)". Regarding the same sequence where the Ancient One sends Strange through the multiverse, Hayes said, [...] "Seth Rogen's comedic drug trip sequences have nothing on the psychedelic visuals employed here. It's astounding, elaborate stuff, and easily provides the most entertaining moments in the footage." [...] IGN's Terri Schwartz said the sequences shown were where [...] "Derrickson's horror aesthetics shine through".|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} {{official}} objections to intolerance {{by the party}} leadership and some Reformer MPs, comments and decisions made at party conventions by Reform Party supporters {{on a number of}} issues were considered highly intolerant by onlookers. In 1991, Manning was humiliated at a Reform Party rally when a Reform Party supporter spoke in support of Manning in racist terms, saying “You’re a fine white person. You know, we <b>are</b> <b>letting</b> in too many people from the Third World, the low blacks, the low Hispanics. They’re going to take over the province”. Later in the same rally another Reform Party supporter stood up and said “Let them [...] go. We don’t need Quebec.” Long-time Progressive Conservative member and political commentator Dalton Camp observed the 1994 Reform Party convention in Ottawa and was personally disgusted with what he heard, saying: [...] "The speechifying gives off acrid whiffs of xenophobia, homophobia, and paranoia—like an exhaust—in which it seems clear both orator and audience have been seized by some private terror: immigrants, lesbians, people out of work or from out of town and criminals." [...] In the Reform Party policy convention in 1995, Manning urged members to avoid extremism, and a motion was passed by the vote of the delegates that the Reform Party recognized the equality of every individual, but only after the delegates demanded that the words [...] "without discrimination" [...] be removed from the motion. The 1995 convention went on to Reform party delegates controversially called for the removal of group specification in all human rights legisiation which was accepted in the convention by a 93 percent vote in favour. Another controversial motion in the 1995 convention called for tighter regulation of people infected with HIV which was supported by 84 percent of the delegates. One Reformer delegate raised concern that such a policy on HIV would make the party look anti-homosexual, but another delegate responded to this saying [...] "I did not join the Reform Party to bow down at the altar of political correctness".|$|E

2500|$|The series utilises several {{techniques}} {{from the}} stage and theatre and converting them to the screen. [...] The series frequently breaks the fourth wall (purposely...and, usually, at least once per episode), as well as employing other stylised, cinematic devices such as cutaway scenes shot in a different style {{from the rest of}} the show. For example, in several episodes characters appear to [...] "stop time", interacting with other actors that remain frozen in place, while key members of the cast announce their intentions to us (the audience) or further develop their [...] "con" [...] between themselves and other characters by discussing plans with either each other—or even themselves; while certain members freeze in place, others of the cast are free to move around the set and drink other peoples drinks and pilfer other peoples pockets and the like. [...] This technique serves many purposes—chiefly of which is a stylistic approach to theater, but it can also be said that it is used here as a metaphor for how the main characters of this drama can manipulate their environment at will—as opposed to average individuals who, most of the time, remain oblivious to what is going on around them. Examples of this can be seen in the pilot episode ("The Con Is On"), the first episode of the second series ("Gold Mine") and the second episode of the fourth series ("Signing Up to Wealth"). Other fourth-wall-breaking moments are more subtle – a character might smile directly at the camera as the con begins to take shape, or an actor may make an editorial comment to the viewers, or they might even wink at us...as if we are in on it with them, or they <b>are</b> <b>letting</b> us in on a secret. Some episodes insert fantasy sequences – scenes shot like a Bollywood musical or a silent movie, for example, all well-known cinematic style choices used to elicit emotions or mood from the audience in just a few steps that might, otherwise, take up pages of dialogue in order to accomplish.|$|E
