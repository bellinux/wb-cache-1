5|$|Flooding {{caused by}} Connie {{generally}} did not attract much media attention; however, the floods were important {{in setting the}} conditions for later significant flooding across the northeastern United States. Just five days after Connie struck North Carolina, Hurricane Diane affected the same area, but instead of continuing to the northwest it turned to the northeast. Diane produced further rainfall in already wet <b>areas</b> <b>from</b> Connie. Damage from Diane totaled at least $700million, and six states were declared federal disaster <b>areas</b> <b>from</b> the combined hurricanes' impact; this allowed federal assistance for the affected areas.|$|E

5|$|Between the 1940s and the 1970s, {{the city}} saw {{significant}} growth in suburban <b>areas</b> <b>from</b> population migration. Veterans were returning from military service {{in large numbers}} seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, {{a part of the}} local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} {{are open to}} the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of which were built before 1930 and are still in their original locations. They were built mostly in Spanish Colonial or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former).

Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, separate the residential <b>areas</b> <b>from</b> the working portions of the ranch.|$|E

5|$|In 1867, Dyer {{became a}} member of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), a {{patriotic}} society of civil war Union veterans. It was around this time that he started to acquire details about Union regiments.

The statistics he collected expanded into further <b>areas,</b> <b>from</b> regiments to details of formations, battles, movements, and similar data. He began to research using official records in various state capitals, and continued speaking to ex-soldiers and high-standing officers, such as General Sherman, who expressed interest in a comprehensive compendium and welcomed its future publication.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Richard Bulliet of Columbia University {{wrote that}} the {{dromedary}} exists in large numbers in <b>areas</b> <b>from</b> which the Bactrian camel has disappeared; the converse is also true to a great extent.

5|$|In May 1944, Nos.1, 18 and 31 Squadrons {{attacked}} Japanese {{positions in}} Timor, while No.2 Squadron was withdrawn from combat to re-equip with Mitchells.

No.2 Squadron returned to operations with Mitchells in June. That month, No.18 Squadron flew 149 sorties, damaging Japanese airfields and shipping in the Timor area, but lost its commanding officer to anti-aircraft fire during a raid.|$|E

Later, two more cases, one each in rural Damascus and Aleppo, were identified. It was the first outbreak in Syria since 1999. Doctors and international public health agencies report more than 90 cases of polio in Syria, with fears of contagion in rebel <b>areas</b> <b>from</b> lack of sanitation and safe-water services.|$|E
