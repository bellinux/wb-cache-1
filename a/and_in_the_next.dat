5|$|After Mircea I's death, princes succeeded {{one another}} on the throne with devastating frequency. For instance, Michael I (14181420) was overthrown by his cousin, Dan II (14201431), <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decade the throne was {{occupied}} with frequent changes either by Dan II or by his cousin, Radu II the Bald (14211427), the former being supported by Sigismund I of Hungary and the latter by the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|Enolate {{trapping}} {{with various}} electrophiles is decidedly less common. In one study, the Nazarov cyclization is {{paired with a}} Michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to β-nitrostyrene. In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions: it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R-group.|$|E

5|$|By early 1972, {{with the}} {{monument}} to Caroline erected on Codden Hill, Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life. In February he assisted the {{passage through the}} House of Commons of Heath's European Communities Bill, approving the United Kingdom's accession to the European Economic Community. The bill was opposed by Labour and by some Conservatives. By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill's second reading, and it duly became law. By mid-1972 the Liberals' fortunes were rising significantly; the public was equally disenchanted with both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local election results were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 Rochdale was won from Labour, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: Sutton, Isle of Ely, Ripon and Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E
5|$|Despite her {{inability}} to take a wicket in the WNCL, Ebsary was retained in the national team <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> five months of international cricket, she did not bowl a ball. Ahead of the 2009 World Cup, the Australians headed to New Zealand for a Rose Bowl series, Ebsary was {{left out of the}} first two ODIs against New Zealand, but was recalled for the next two matches at Seddon Park in Hamilton. She scored 30 from 47 balls in the first match before making her ODI top-score of 86 the next day. Batting at No. 3, she struck nine boundaries and faced only 76 balls, scoring at faster than a run-a-ball. This helped set up Australia's 4/307 and they went on to win by 44 runs, their second consecutive victory. The teams returned to Australia where Ebsary made her T20 international debut at the Sydney Cricket Ground. She did not bat or bowl in a rain-affected Australian win.|$|E
5|$|Despite this auspicious {{start to}} his career, Shearer was only eased {{into the first}} team {{gradually}} and made just ten goalless appearances for the club the following season. Throughout his career Shearer was recognised for his strength, which, during his time at Southampton, enabled him to retain the ball and provide opportunities for teammates. Playing as a lone striker between wide men, Rod Wallace and Matt Le Tissier, Shearer scored three goals in 26 appearances in the 1989–90 season, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next,</b> four goals in 36 games. His performances in {{the centre of the}} Saints attack were soon recognised by the fans, who voted him their Player of the Year for 1991.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Peloponnesian War, the militaristic city-state of Sparta had been able to impose a hegemony over the heartland of Classical Greece (the Peloponessus and mainland Greece south of Thessaly), the states of this area having been severely weakened by the war. This state of affairs was resented by many of the Greek city-states, which had traditionally been ferociously independent, and led directly to the Corinthian War of 395–387 BC. Sparta emerged from this conflict with its hegemony intact, though only as a result of Persian intervention, which led to the so-called King's Peace. The fragility of Spartan dominance had been demonstrated however, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decade, the Thebans would revolt against Sparta. The Spartans were unable to successfully quell the revolt, leading to de facto Theban independence. Then, after several years of desultory conflict, the Thebans finally met the Spartans in open battle at Leuctra (371 BC), and under the leadership of Epaminondas inflicted an unprecedented defeat on the Spartan army, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I in the process.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 6 January 1934, Chapman died at his home in Hendon. Arsenal were top of the table by the New Year, but their league form stuttered as a result of Chapman's {{unexpected}} death. Joe Shaw stood in as caretaker manager and continued Chapman's good work, as Arsenal won the 1933–34 First Division title. In May 1934, Arsenal appointed George Allison, beginning a successful thirteen-year spell as manager. The club retained the league title in 1934–35 <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> season defeated Sheffield United in the 1936 FA Cup Final. Arsenal won another championship in 1937–38, their fifth in eight years, to reinforce their position as the dominant team of the 1930s. Britain's involvement in the Second World War meant the ordinary football calendar was abandoned. In {{the early part of the}} 1940s, Arsenal participated in various wartime competitions, still managed by Allison.|$|E
5|$|Kyo is {{a secret}} {{character}} in most versions of The King of Fighters '99, and has no team. In the story, Kyo is kidnapped by the NESTS syndicate to use his DNA to make various clones of himself. He tries to obtain answers personally from his captors entering their base but is forced to retreat when the place around him begins to collapse. Depending on how many points the player has when the game finishes, Kyo can be faced as a bonus fight. He continues his fight against the NESTS alone in The King of Fighters 2000 <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> game, Kyo reunites with his old teammates, and his student Shingo Yabuki, to make a comeback on the Japan Team.

5|$|Meanwhile, the NSDAP was in {{a period}} of {{rebuilding}} and waiting. The economy had recovered, which meant fewer opportunities for the Nazis to agitate for change. The SA was reorganised, but with Franz Pfeffer von Salomon as its head rather than Göring, and the Schutzstaffel (SS) was founded in 1925, initially as a bodyguard for Hitler. Membership in the party increased from 27,000 in 1925 to 108,000 in 1928 and 178,000 in 1929. In the May 1928 elections the party only obtained twelve seats out of an available 491. Göring was elected as a representative from Bavaria. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> election, the NSDAP won 6,409,600 votes and 107 seats in the Reichstag. In May 1931, Hitler sent Göring on a mission to the Vatican, where he met the future Pope Pius XII.|$|E
5|$|Booth scored 127 not {{out against}} Somerset, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> match against Lancashire, {{he was caught}} behind for 99 from the bowling of another Brian Booth. He played consistently, with two more half-centuries to earn his debut in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford in place of Colin McDonald. The series was evenly poised at 11, and Australia batted first on a pitch that {{initially}} assisted fast bowling. The surface was tinged with green and England fielded a pace line-up that included Brian Statham and Fred Trueman. Booth was struck in the torso by his first ball, a bouncer that did not rise as high as was expected. He managed to repel a spearing yorker on the second ball and compiled a battling 46, the second highest score on the difficult pitch, featuring in a partnership of 46the highest in Australia's inningswith Bill Lawry. Australia managed only 190 on the bowler-friendly pitch. Booth only managed nine in the second innings before Australia retained the Ashes after an English collapse {{on the final day}} resulted in a 54-run win. In the drawn Fifth and final Test at The Oval, Booth came in with the score at 4/211 after the dismissal of O'Neill for 117. He featured in a 185-run partnership with Peter Burge. Booth was dismissed for 71 while attempting to loft the spin of Tony Lock over the infield, as captain Richie Benaud needed quick runs; observers felt the need to attack cost Booth his maiden Test century. Booth added three more 70s in the closing tour matches before the team returned to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands {{on top of the}} other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and threw it in the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E

5|$|Lewis died in 1893, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{decade the}} DL built no new lines. However, {{a group of}} investors bought the company, {{including}} the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis's heirs. The first segment of the line into downtown Dayton was completed in late 1902, branching off the main line at Hempstead and ending at Lambeth, site of the Dayton State Hospital. Unable to obtain a franchise from Dayton, and still unprofitable, the DL entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at foreclosure in April 1907 and reorganized in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had organized the new company succeeded in obtaining the franchise, and sold the stock to a new group of investors in January 1909. Construction was restarted in April, and in November the branch reached the intersection of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the National Cash Register plant. Finally, after completing the cuts and fills required along the east bank of the Great Miami River, the DL opened its new main line in 1912, to a passenger depot {{on the north side of}} Washington Street, several blocks south and west of the city's main Union Station. A freight depot was located just to the north, at Eaker Street, and just beyond was an interchange track (not part of the original line) connecting to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (B system) and, via that line, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Panhandle Route, part of the Pennsylvania system).|$|E
5|$|The {{opposing}} sides began {{bringing in}} reinforcements to the Kupres Plateau on 5 March to strengthen positions held around individual settlements populated by different ethnic groups, communications between those positions, and roads leading {{away from the}} plateau {{to the north and}} south. Different parts of the town of Kupres were controlled by the opposing forces, while the adjacent territory surrounding the town was controlled by the Bosnian Croat TO. In turn, that territory was surrounded by Bosnian Serb TO-held territory. By the end of the month, the bulk of the civilians living in the area were evacuated. On 2 April, negotiations to defuse the situation failed while the reinforcements continued to arrive. The battle commenced the next day. In Kupres itself, the Bosnian Croat TO achieved minor territorial gains on 4–5 April, before the JNA managed to advance to the outskirts of the town the next day. The JNA entered Kupres in the afternoon of 7 April <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few days, it successfully drove the Croatian forces from the plateau. The breakthrough came about after the infantry originally deployed to the battle was reinforced by an armoured battalion deployed from Knin.|$|E
