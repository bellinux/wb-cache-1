40|$|Stroke causes {{long-term}} disability, and rehabilitative {{training is}} commonly used to improve the consecutive functional recovery. Following brain damage, surviving neurons undergo morphological alterations to reconstruct the remaining neural network. In the motor system, such neural network remodeling is observed as a motor map reorganization. Because of its significant correlation with functional recovery, motor map reorganization has been regarded as a key phenomenon for functional recovery after stroke. Although the mechanism underlying motor map reorganization remains unclear, increasing evidence has shown a critical role for <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> in the corticospinal tract. In this study, we review previous studies investigating <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> in the corticospinal tract after stroke and discuss which mechanisms may underlie the stimulatory effect of rehabilitative training. <b>Axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> in the corticospinal tract can be classified into three types based on the location and the original targets of corticospinal neurons, {{and it seems that}} all the surviving corticospinal neurons in both ipsilesional and contralesional hemisphere can participate in <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> and motor map reorganization. Through <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling,</b> corticospinal neurons alter their output selectivity from a single to multiple areas to compensate for the lost function. The remodeling of the corticospinal axon is influenced by the extent of tissue destruction and promoted by various therapeutic interventions, including rehabilitative training. Although the precise molecular mechanism underlying rehabilitation-promoted <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> remains elusive, previous data suggest that rehabilitative training promotes <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> by upregulating growth-promoting and downregulating growth-inhibiting signals...|$|E
40|$|Remodeling of {{the remnant}} {{neuronal}} network after brain injury possibly mediates spontaneous functional recovery; however, the mechanisms inducing <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> during spontaneous recovery remain unclear. Here, {{we show that}} altered γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling is crucial for <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> of the contralesional cortex after traumatic brain injury. After injury to the sensorimotor cortex in mice, we found {{a significant decrease in}} the expression of GABAAR-α 1 subunits in the intact sensorimotor cortex for 2 weeks. Motor functions, assessed by grid walk and cylinder tests, spontaneously improved in 4 weeks after the injury to the sensorimotor cortex. With motor recovery, corticospinal tract (CST) axons from the contralesional cortex sprouted into the denervated side of the cervical spinal cord at 2 and 4 weeks after the injury. To determine the functional implications of the changes in the expression of GABAAR-α 1 subunits, we infused muscimol, a GABA R agonist, into the contralesional cortex for a week after the injury. Compared with the vehicle-treated mice, we noted significantly inhibited recovery in the muscimol-treated mice. Further, muscimol infusion greatly suppressed the axonal sprouting into the denervated side of the cervical spinal cord. In conclusion, recovery of motor function and <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> of the CST following cortical injury requires suppressed GABAAR subunit expression and decreased GABAergic signaling...|$|E
40|$|Task-specific rehabilitative {{training}} {{is commonly used}} for chronic stroke patients. <b>Axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> {{is believed to be}} one mechanism underlying rehabilitation-induced functional recovery, and significant roles of the corticospinal pathway have previously been demonstrated. Brainstem-spinal pathways, as well as the corticospinal tract, have been suggested to contribute to skilled motor function and functional recovery after brain injury. However, whether <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> in the brainstem-spinal pathways is a critical component for rehabilitation-induced functional recovery is not known. In this study, rats were subjected to photothrombotic stroke in the caudal forelimb area of the primary motor cortex and received rehabilitative training with a skilled forelimb reaching task for 4 weeks. After completion of the rehabilitative training, the retrograde tracer Fast blue was injected into the contralesional lower cervical spinal cord. Fast blue-positive cells were counted in 32 brain areas located in the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. Rehabilitative training improved motor performance in the skilled forelimb reaching task but not in the cylinder test, ladder walk test, or staircase test, indicating that rehabilitative skilled forelimb training induced task-specific recovery. In the histological analysis, rehabilitative training significantly increased the number of Fast blue-positive neurons in the ipsilesional rostral forelimb area and secondary sensory cortex. However, rehabilitative training did not alter the number of Fast blue-positive neurons in any areas of the brainstem. These results indicate that rehabilitative skilled forelimb training enhances <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> selectively in the corticospinal pathway, which suggests a critical role of cortical plasticity, rather than brainstem plasticity, in task-specific recovery after subtotal motor cortex destruction...|$|E

Plg+/+ and Plg-/- mice (n = 10 /group) were subjected to permanent intraluminal monofilament middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). A foot-fault test and a single pellet reaching test were performed prior to and on day 3 after stroke, and weekly thereafter to monitor functional deficit and recovery. Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected into the left motor cortex to anterogradely label the corticospinal tract (CST). Animals were euthanized 4 weeks after stroke. Neurite outgrowth was also measured in primary cultured cortical neurons harvested from Plg+/+ and Plg-/- embryos. In Plg+/+ mice, the motor functional deficiency after stroke progressively recovered with time. In contrast, recovery in Plg-/- mice was significantly impaired compared to Plg+/+ mice (p, 0. 01). BDA-positive axonal density of the CST originating from the contralesional cortex in the denervated side of the cervical gray matter was significantly reduced in Plg-/- mice compared with Plg+/+ mice (p, 0. 05). The behavioral outcome was highly correlated with the midline-crossing CST axonal density (R 2. 0. 82, p, 0. 01). Plg-/- neurons exhibited significantly reduced neurite outgrowth.

It is accompanied by inflammation and remodelling of the intramuscular terminal nerve fibres. Since the growth-associated protein B- 50 /GAP- 43 {{has been shown to}} be involved in axonal outgrowth and synaptic remodelling following neuronal injury, we have investigated the presence of B- 50 in gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles of mdx mice.

40|$|The growth-associated protein GAP- 43 has {{a pivotal}} role in axonal growth and {{guidance}} during development. Towards the end of postnatal development its expression dramatically declines in most brain regions with few exceptions, such as cerebellar cortex and inferior olive (IO). When experimentally over-expressed in murine CNS in vivo, it is able to induce axonal sprouting, moreover it is up-regulated in conditions known to induce a structural remodelling of neuronal connectivity, such as injuries to the CNS and neurodegenerative disorders. However the reason why high expression is maintained through adulthood only in some regions in the adult brain has never been clarified. Taking advantage of lentiviral vectors and shRNAs to induce an efficient and stable gene silencing specifically in the IO, we chose to investigate GAP- 43 role in <b>axonal</b> <b>remodelling</b> of the adult CFs, since they originate from one of the nuclei which retain GAP- 43 high expression levels, they are conveniently arranged for morphological studies and they are endowed with profound plastic and regenerative potentials.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Spinal interneurons {{have emerged}} as crucial targets of supraspinal input during {{post-injury}} <b>axonal</b> <b>remodelling.</b> For example, lesioned corticospinal projections use propriospinal neurons as relay stations to form intraspinal detour circuits that circumvent the lesion site and contribute to functional recovery. While {{a number of the}} molecules that determine the formation of neuronal circuits in the developing nervous system have been identified, it is much less understood which of these cues are also expressed in the injured spinal cord and can thus guide growing collaterals and initiate synaptogenesis during circuit remodelling. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address this question we characterized the expression profile of a number of guidance and synaptogenic molecules in the cervical spinal cord of healthy and spinal cord-injured mice by in situ hybridization. To assign the expression of these molecules to distinct populations of interneurons we labeled short and long propriospinal neurons by retrograde tracing and glycinergic neurons using a transgenically expressed fluorescent protein. Interestingly, we found that most of the molecules studied including members of slit-, semaphorin-, synCAM-, neuroligin- and ephrin- families as well as their receptors are also present in the adult CNS. While many of these molecules were abundantly expressed in all interneurons examined, some molecules including slits, semaphorin 7 a, synCAM 4 and neuroligin 1 showed preferential expression in propriospinal interneurons. Overall the expression pattern of guidance and synaptogenic molecules in the cervical spinal cord appeared to be stable over time and was not substantially altered following a midthoracic spinal cord injury. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study indicates that many of the guidance and synaptogenic cues that regulate neuronal circuit formation in development are also present in the adult CNS and therefore likely contribute to the <b>remodelling</b> of <b>axonal</b> connections in the injured spinal cord...|$|R

Currently no retrograde tracers can specifically label rubrospinal axons and neurons (RSNs).

Here we developed a recombinant adenovirus carrying a green fluorescent protein reporter gene (Adv-GFP) which can preferentially, intensely, and bi-directionally label the RST. When Adv-GFP was injected into the second lumbar spinal cord, the GFP was specifically transported throughout the entire RST, with peak labeling seen at 2 weeks post-injection. When Adv-GFP was injected directly into the RN, GFP was anterogradely transported throughout the RST.

Functional synaptic coupling of a small fraction of these neurons is, however, correlated with the existence of synaptic boutons at existing touch sites. These data provide the first direct experimental evidence for a tabula rasa-like structural matrix between neocortical pyramidal neurons and suggests that pre- and postsynaptic interactions shape the conversion between touches and synapses to form specific functional microcircuits.

40|$|Aberrant {{sprouting}} and synaptic {{reorganization of}} the mossy fiber (MF) axons are commonly found in the hippocampus of temporal lobe epilepsy patients and result {{in the formation of}} excitatory feedback loops in the dentate gyrus, a putative cellular basis for recurrent epileptic seizures. Using ex vivo hippocampal cultures, we show that prolonged hyperactivity induces MF sprouting and the resultant network reorganizations and that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is necessary and sufficient to evoke these pathogenic plasticities. Hyperexcitation induced an upregulation of BDNF protein expression in the MF pathway, an effect mediated by L-type Ca 2 channels. The neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase (Trk) B inhibitor K 252 a or function-blocking anti-BDNF antibody prevented hyperactivity-induced MF sprouting. Even under blockade of neural activity, local application of BDNF to the hilus, but not other subregions, was capable of initiating MF <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling,</b> eventually leading to dentate hyperexcitability. Transfecting granule cells with dominant-negative TrkB prevented axonal branching. Thus, excessive activation of L-type Ca 2 channels causes granule cells to express BDNF, and extracellularly released BDNF stimulates TrkB receptors present on the hilar segment of the MFs to induce axonal branching, which may establish hyperexcitable dentate circuits.

More recent studies have demonstrated significant reductions in functional neuronal markers in subcortical brain regions in primates as a consequence of aging, including dopaminergic and cholinergic systems, although corresponding losses in cortical innervation from these neurons have not been investigated. In the present study, we report that aging {{is associated with}} a significant 25 % reduction in cortical innervation by cholinergic systems in rhesus monkeys (P < 0. 001). Further, these age-related reductions are ameliorated by cellular delivery of human nerve growth factor to cholinergic somata in the basal forebrain, restoring levels of cholinergic innervation in the cortex to those of young monkeys (P = 0. 89). Thus, (i) aging {{is associated with a}} significant reduction in cortical cholinergic innervation; (ii) this reduction is reversible by growth-factor delivery; and (iii) growth factors can <b>remodel</b> <b>axonal</b> terminal fields at a distance, representing a nontropic action of growth factors in modulating adult neuronal structure and function (i. e., administration of growth factors to cholinergic somata significantly increases axon density in terminal fields). These findings are relevant to potential clinical uses of growth factors to treat neurological disorders...|$|R
40|$|International audience: Neuronal {{remodeling}} {{is essential}} for the refinement of neuronal circuits in response to developmental cues [1 - 4]. Although this process involves pruning or retraction of axonal projections followed by axonal regrowth and branching, how these steps are controlled is poorly understood. Drosophila mushroom body (MB) γ neurons provide a paradigm for the study of neuronal remodeling, as their larval axonal branches are pruned during metamorphosis and re-extend to form adult-specific branches [5]. Here, we identify the RNA binding protein Imp as a key regulator of <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling.</b> Imp is the sole fly member of a conserved family of proteins that bind target mRNAs to promote their subcellular targeting [6 - 12]. We show that whereas Imp is dispensable for the initial growth of MB γ neuron axons, it is required for the regrowth and ramification of axonal branches that have undergone pruning. Furthermore, Imp is actively transported to axons undergoing developmental remodeling. Finally, we demonstrate that profilin mRNA is a direct and functional target of Imp that localizes to axons and controls axonal regrowth. Our study reveals that mRNA localization machineries are actively recruited to axons upon remodeling and suggests a role of mRNA transport in developmentally programmed rewiring of neuronal circuits during brain maturation...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral {{neuropathy}} is {{a chronic}} complication of diabetes mellitus. To investigated the efficacy {{and safety of}} the extended treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy with thymosin β 4 (Tβ 4), male diabetic mice (db/db) {{at the age of}} 24 weeks were treated with Tβ 4 or saline for 16 consecutive weeks. Treatment of diabetic mice with Tβ 4 significantly improved motor (MCV) and sensory (SCV) conduction velocity in the sciatic nerve and the thermal and mechanical latency. However, Tβ 4 treatment did not significantly alter blood glucose levels. Treatment with Tβ 4 significantly increased intraepidermal nerve fiber density. Furthermore, Tβ 4 counteracted the diabetes-induced axon diameter and myelin thickness reductions and the g-ratio increase in sciatic nerve. In vitro, compared with dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons derived from nondiabetic mice, DRG neurons derived from diabetic mice exhibited significantly decreased neurite outgrowth, whereas Tβ 4 promoted neurite growth in these diabetic DRG neurons. Blockage of the Ang 1 /Tie 2 signaling pathway with a neutralized antibody against Tie 2 abolished Tβ 4 -increased neurite outgrowth. Our data demonstrate that extended Tβ 4 treatment ameliorates diabetic-induced axonal degeneration and demyelination, which likely contribute to therapeutic effect of Tβ 4 on diabetic neuropathy. The Ang 1 /Tie 2 pathway may mediate Tβ 4 -induced <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—The Nogo-A {{protein is}} an {{important}} inhibitor of <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> after central nervous system injuries, including ischemic stroke. Interfering with the function of Nogo-A via infusion of a therapeutic anti–Nogo-A antibody after stroke increases neuronal remodeling and enhances functional recovery in rats. In this study, we describe the regional distribution of cortical neurons expressing Nogo-A in normal rats and following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Methods—Normal and post-MCAO neuronal Nogo-A expression were described via immunohistochemical analyses. All brains were processed for Nogo-A and parvalbumin expression. The level of Nogo-A expression was scored for each cortical area or white matter structure of interest. The number and fluorescent intensity of layer V neurons in contralesional sensorimotor forelimb cortex were also assessed at each time point. Results—Nogo-A expression was observed in both cortical pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Neuronal expression of Nogo-A changed over time in ipsilesional and contralesional cortical areas after MCAO, becoming globally elevated at 28 days after stroke. Nogo-A expression was not observed to fluctuate greatly in the white matter after stroke, {{with the exception of}} a transient increase in Nogo-A expression in the external capsule near the stroke lesion. Conclusions—Neuronal Nogo-A expression is significantly increased at 28 days post-MCAO in all examined brai...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Pak kinases are {{targets of}} the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc 42, which {{regulate}} cell shape and motility [1 – 5]. It is increasingly apparent that part of this function {{is due to the}} effect Pak kinases have on microtubule organization and dynamics. Recently, overexpression of Xenopus Pak 5 was shown to enhance microtubule stabilization, and it was shown that mammalian Pak 1 may inhibit a microtubule-destabilizing protein, Op 18 /Stathmin [6, 7]. We have identified a specific phosphorylation site on mammalian Pak 1, T 212, which is targeted by the neuronal p 35 /Cdk 5 kinase [8, 9]. Pak 1 phosphorylated on T 212, Pak 1 T 212 (PO 4), is enriched in axonal growth cones and colocalizes with small peripheral bundles of microtubules. Cortical neurons overexpressing a Pak 1 A 212 mutant display a tangled neurite morphology, which suggests that the microtubule cytoskeleton is affected [9]. Here, we show that cyclin B 1 /Cdc 2 phosphorylates Pak 1 in cells undergoing mitosis. In the developing cortex and in cultured fibroblasts, Pak 1 T 212 (PO 4) is enriched in microtubule-organizing centers and along parts of the spindles. In living cells, a peptide mimicking phosphorylated T 212 accumulates at the centrosomes and spindles and causes an increased length of astral microtubules during metaphase or following nocodazole washout. Together these results suggest that similar signaling pathways regulate microtubule dynamics in a <b>remodeling</b> <b>axonal</b> growth cone and during cell division...|$|R
40|$|Gualou Guizhi {{decoction}} (GLGZD) {{is effective}} for the clinical treatment of limb spasms caused by ischemic stroke, but its underlying mechanism is unclear. Propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL), immunohistochemistry, western blot, and real-time qPCR {{were used to}} observe the axonal regeneration and neuroprotective effects of GLGZD aqueous extract on organotypic cortical slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and further elucidate the potential mechanisms. Compared with the OGD group, the GLGZD aqueous extract decreased the red PI fluorescence intensity; inhibited neuronal apoptosis; improved the growth of slice axons; upregulated the protein expression of tau and growth-associated protein- 43; and decreased protein and mRNA expression of neurite outgrowth inhibitor protein-A (Nogo-A), Nogo receptor 1 (NgR 1), ras homolog gene family A (RhoA), rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK), and phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP 2). Our study found that GLGZD had a strong neuroprotective effect on brain slices after OGD injury. GLGZD plays {{a vital role in}} promoting <b>axonal</b> <b>remodeling</b> and functional remodeling, which may be related to regulation of the expression of Nogo-A and its receptor NgR 1, near the injured axons, inhibition of the Rho-ROCK pathway, and reduction of CRMP 2 phosphorylation...|$|E
