5000|$|He {{taught that}} there are no {{absolute}} [...] "things", there are only processes {{in a constant state of}} change (annica); that there is no fixed or permanent essence or soul (annata); and that suffering is inherent to life (dukkha) (the Three Marks of Existence). In the Satipatthana Sutta, the Buddha described four foundations (or bases) of mindfulness - mindfulness of the body, of sensations, of the mind, and of dharmas (i.e. phenomena, thoughts, <b>arisings),</b> and is recorded as saying, [...] "There is one thing that leads to happiness in the present and liberation in the future; and what is this one thing? It is mindfulness of the body." [...] (Anguttara Nikaya, sutta I, 21.) Thus mindfulness of the body is the direct way to liberation and the end of suffering. Zen yoga practice is primarily concerned with the body and sensations, and observing life as a process in a constant state of change, so is in direct line with the Buddha's method of awakening.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a simple and accurate method for estimating the quantity and composition of household waste <b>arisings.</b> The method is based on the fundamental tenet that waste <b>arisings</b> can be predicted from information on the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of households, thus reducing the need for the direct measurement of waste <b>arisings</b> to that necessary for the calibration of a prediction model. The aim of the research is twofold: firstly to investigate the generation of waste <b>arisings</b> at the household level, and secondly to devise a method for supplying information on waste <b>arisings</b> {{to meet the needs of}} waste collection and disposal authorities, policy makers at both national and European level and the manufacturers of plant and equipment for waste sorting and treatment. The research was carried out in three phases: theoretical, empirical and analytical. In the theoretical phase specific testable hypotheses were formulated concerning the process of waste generation at the household level. The empirical phase of the research involved an initial questionnaire survey of 1277 households to obtain data on their socio-economic characteristics, and the subsequent sorting of waste <b>arisings</b> from each of the households surveyed. The analytical phase was divided between (a) the testing of the research hypotheses by matching each household's waste against its demographic/socioeconomic characteristics (b) the development of statistical models capable of predicting the waste <b>arisings</b> from an individual household and (c) {{the development of a}} practical method for obtaining area-based estimates of waste <b>arisings</b> using readily available data from the national census. The latter method was found to represent a substantial improvement over conventional methods of waste estimation in terms of both accuracy and spatial flexibility. The research therefore represents a substantial contribution both to scientific knowledge of the process of household waste generation, and to the practical management of waste <b>arisings...</b>|$|E

The analysis focuses on the factors affecting refuse <b>arisings</b> rates. Household size, the presence of infant children and housing type were all found to be positively correlated with the total quantity of refuse <b>arisings</b> in a given household. Households in detached houses generated greater quantities of paper and cardboard than households in other types of housing.

30|$|In {{spite of}} various {{efforts to reduce}} food waste <b>arisings</b> per capita, {{quantities}} of food waste continue to increase due to population growth. In spite of the UK success in introducing intervention programmes that have reduced food waste <b>arisings</b> per capita by 24 %, the overall household food waste <b>arisings</b> in the UK have flat lined at around 7 million tonnes per year, with further large-scale reductions not yet possible (Parry 2014; Quested and Andrew 2017). As food waste {{is unlikely to be}} significantly reduced in the short term, greater efforts must be made to reduce its environmental impacts. This could be achieved by first quantifying environmental burdens associated with food waste treatment, identifying processes with the highest environmental impacts (i.e., hotspot analysis) and finally introducing measures to mitigate these impacts.|$|E
40|$|The UK motor {{industry}} {{is committed to}} recycling scrap plastic obtained from End-of-Life vehicles, and between now and 2002 the industry body (ACORD) will implement a programme for recovery and recycling. But planning the programme requires a reliable prediction of the future <b>arisings</b> of plastic, which is conditional upon having a good estimate of the materials composition of today's average car. This paper validates a materials forecast made in 1982 of the average family car for the 1990 s by comparing it to an actual example. The comparison shows that whilst the forecast was broadly correct it overestimated the quantities of thermosetting plastic {{at the expense of}} the commodity plastics: PP, PE, and ABS. Furthermore, subsequent use of the forecast to predict the <b>arisings</b> of scrap takes it outside of its original context. Scrap arising from the UK fleet comes from cars of many ages and types, and is poorly represented by a single average car. This paper proposes that a forecast obtained from a model of the fleet average car better represents the variety of cars scrapped. The model incorporates four interrelated factors: design generation, total vehicle weight, types and amounts of plastics, and the structure a of the market for cars. The new forecast for the year 2002 shows that the <b>arisings</b> of scrap plastic are about one-third less than expected...|$|E

40|$|Installing utility {{pipelines}} {{generates a}} significant amount of trench <b>arisings,</b> which are usually transported to landfills instead of being reused as backfill material. This practice generates CO 2 emissions and wastes raw materials. This paper presents a more sustainable solution, an eco-trench, which is based on re-using trench <b>arisings</b> as backfill and adding a top layer of expansive concrete to improve the eco-trench’s structural performance. The technical feasibility of the eco-trench was evaluated through a finite element model, which identified the degree of expansion in concrete required to avoid failure or subside the stresses caused by traffic. The potential expansion of concrete was measured under confined conditions in the laboratory by means of a novel test developed for this purpose. The results showed that adding calcium oxide generates the required internal stress. The results were then confirmed in a pilot experience. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Local waste {{management}} strategies {{need to take}} into account all household waste <b>arisings,</b> including those taken to Civic Amenity sites (also known as Household Waste Recycling Centres or HWRCs) and other ‘bring’ facilities. However research in this area has consistently failed to integrate site-based data with collection round data. Research that deals with one aspect of the household waste stream in isolation can build a misleading picture of the amount and type of waste produced by households in any particular area and can be a serious weakness in the development of realistic {{waste management}} scenarios. This paper describes research, carried out in collaboration with Hampshire County Council, to develop a method of integrating compositional data from a limited sample of waste collection rounds with operational data on the relative use of the different collection facilities for household waste. The resultant reconstructed waste <b>arisings</b> and compositional profile for each area was then used to develop scenarios for exploring future policy options...|$|E
40|$|As {{a scheme}} for {{achieving}} the minimisation of household waste, variable (weight / volume based) charging is often suggested. It {{has been reported}} that reductions in waste <b>arisings</b> were observed, however it is not clear where the reduction happened (or who reduced), and what side-effects are taking place in lieu of the observed decrease in waste. In many cases, private companies as well as the municipality collect business waste together with household waste. It could be that the waste reduction was recorded on the municipal waste statistics due to a shift in service providers. It is also important to know to which type of residents (income levels / housing types etc) this scheme is most effective (or otherwise). Another important aspect is to what extent a "genuine " minimisation has happened, and how much is it due to diversion to recycling. Recycling and minimisation should be grasped as separate concepts. The efficacy of waste policy is often assessed by analysing the municipal waste statistics. Using the city as a unit for analysis, it is difficult to address the issues mentioned above, as <b>arisings</b> from areas with different socio-economic characteristics are all aggregated into one figure. Waste <b>arisings</b> data including separate collections for recyclables, were made available at the school district level in Fukuoka, Japan. This splits the city (pop 1. 4 M) into more than 140 districts of a similar size. Using this data, it is possible to cross-analyse waste reduction with area-specific variables, before and after the implementation of the variable charging scheme...|$|E
