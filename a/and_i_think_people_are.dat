Hickman {{described}} {{the decision to}} use a new Hyperion, rather than an existing one:"This is yet another parallel universe Hyperion. This is not King Hyperion, or Supreme Power Hyperion, this is not Gruenwald's Hyperion. This is Hyperion without all that baggage. This is Hyperion with a fresh slate, for a very specific purpose. He comes out of what the big story is behind the whole Avengers three-year plan that I have. He's very important, very pivotal, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> really going to dig where we go with that. He's not going to be our poor analogue for Superman." ...|$|E

There just hasn't been a voice for that normal dude when it comes to rap." [...] He added, [...] "I think a lot of rap is just escalated to a place that many people can't relate to... My niche is that I'm relatable. I don't rap about going to the club and popping bottles." [...] In terms of his rapping skills, Lil Dicky is able [...] "to manipulate words at an excessive speed, and weave rhyme patterns together in a way that's funny while also making viewers want to rewind parts of his videos".|$|E

[...] Haigh revealed that he had come across Daniel Conway's artwork after [...] "trawling the internet looking for an artist". Haigh was immediately drawn to Conway because of the cohesion between his work and the album's lyrical and conceptual themes; [...] "We’ve always been a visual band <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> going to realise that when they see the artwork. Dan Conway is the guy doing the artwork and he’s monumentally talented. His pictures already described our songs perfectly; it was as though he’d already been drawing them for us".|$|E

50|$|The {{script was}} an {{original}} by Cliff Green who had adapted Picnic at Hanging Rock for Pat Lovell. Green {{gave her a}} copy of the script {{on the last day of}} Picnics shoot and she was immediately interested. Lovell:While it isn't a 'women's film', it is the sort of film - like 'Picnic' - that women would like to go to with their husbands. We've had a lot of pornography and a lot of violence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> ready for a love story. This is a very real one. and even though it's set in 1920, it could happen at any time. It's a story with a tremendous amount of charm. Essentially what it says is that people can love more than one person, but be out of communication with one of them. I think a lot of people will identify with it.The budget was raised from the Australian Film Commission, the Victorian government, the Nine television network and Greater Union.

5000|$|Jonathan Davis, the vocalist of Korn, {{spoke about}} the {{criticism}} of nu metal from heavy metal fans, saying [...] "There's a lot of closed-minded metal purists that would hate something because it's not true to metal or whatever, but Korn {{has never been a}} metal band, dude. We're not a metal band. We've always been looked at as what they called the nu-metal thing. But we've always been the black sheep and we never fitted into that kind of thing so ... We're always ever evolving, and we always piss fans off and we're gaining other fans and it is how it is."

Despite the large amount of criticism that the genre received, Jack Porter of The Michigan Daily defended nu metal, writing [...] "Unfortunately, some barriers prevent listeners from understanding nu-metal bands apart from the identity that genre label has given them—picture a bone-headed suburban white kid sporting a backwards baseball cap. What used to be a descriptor for a specific strain of alternative metal turned into a ghetto for every band that a) plays extremely heavy yet radio-friendly music and b) sucks. Because the genre came to be defined by its lack of quality, many 'serious' music fans have missed out on what it has to offer." [...] Additionally, Jody Macgregor of FasterLouder called nu metal [...] "music's most hated genre" [...] and wrote that nu metal is [...] "not as bad as people think".|$|E
5000|$|Appearing in the 2008 film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, Fuller told an interviewer: If {{you take}} seriously that {{evolution}} {{has to do}} with the transition of life forms, and that life and death are just natural processes, then one gets to be liberal about abortion and euthanasia. All of those kinds of ideas seem to me follow very naturally from a Darwinian perspective - a deprivileging of human beings, basically. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> who want to endorse Darwinism have to take this kind of viewpoint very seriously.|$|R
5000|$|Hull {{described}} Lewis saying: [...] "He {{was not a}} nasty {{person because}} he was just evil - he was that way {{because of the way}} he was brought up <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> saw through that".

Hull described the character's time on the serial saying that Lewis [...] "started off as a lovely bloke but tried to murder his girlfriend and then committed suicide".|$|R
5000|$|She also states [...] "People {{are very}} curious - {{which is a}} really good thing but this is quite a departure, so I hope they like it. Making this record has given me a lot of {{emotional}} strength, and has allowed me the opportunity to share {{some of the things that}} have played an important part in my personal growth over the past few years. I have laid it all out there for the world to see - <b>and</b> <b>I</b> guess to judge. However overall, it's a very positive and intimate record <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> will identify with it." ...|$|R
50|$|Lloyd Alexander, {{the author}} of the books on which the film was based, had a more complex {{reaction}} to the film:First, I have to say, there is no resemblance between the movie and the book. Having said that, the movie in itself, purely as a movie, I found to be very enjoyable. I had fun watching it. What I would hope is that anyone who sees the movie would certainly enjoy it, but I'd also hope that they'd actually read the book. The book is quite different. It's a very powerful, very moving story, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> would find a lot more depth in the book.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2015, federal NDP MP Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst) criticized Cardy's {{leadership}} and its conduct {{in the election}} campaign saying that Cardy had moved the provincial party {{too far to the}} centre. “The problem, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> with the provincial party, with Dominic, was that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he was too much to the right to even be in the centre, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> read into that," [...] said Godin who added: “I think it did hurt the party.

[...] Pickler also connected with the song because of her husband, saying that [...] "for me, my greatest treasure {{is my best friend}} and my best friend is my husband. <b>And</b> every night <b>I</b> get to go home to a good man. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> for the <b>people</b> out there that have yet to discover their soul mate and that significant other, that hasn’t found that best friend yet, I want to give them hope that that is possible." ...|$|R
500|$|According to {{frontman}} Dave Mustaine, {{the album}} title refers to stereotypical rock stars. When {{asked about the}} matter, and an earlier comment about Axl Rose having killed the traditional rock star image, Mustaine explained that [...] "People want heroes. Most bands look like average Joes, wearing gas-station shirts, have funky hair-dos <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> wanna {{be able to go}} 'they may not be popular, but they're MY band.'" [...] Mustaine {{went on to say that}} many of contemporary rock music groups looked and sounded the same, and that the music industry needed a hero. He then proceeded to contrast a perceived lack of image of then current music scenes with the image of 1980s metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.|$|R

5000|$|The dance remix of Advance Australia Fair/Waltzing Matilda (by Hylton Mowday) was {{composed}} {{especially for the}} event. It caused backlash among the public, most notably, the Prime Minister of Australia of the time, John Howard. He said, [...] "the public {{will not be able}} to sing along. The anthem should only be played and sung to allow maximum audience participation. It is after all our national anthem <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> it should be played around with. It's become widely accepted <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> should be encouraged to sing it with great gusto, but it's got to be played in a way that enables them to do so.

500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Steve Huey {{wrote that}} Dr. Octagonecologyst [...] "...attracted {{more attention than}} any non-mainstream rap album in quite a while, thanks to its inventive production and Keith's bizarre, free-associative rhymes." [...] Huey also states that Dr. Octagonecologyst represented [...] "...the first truly new, genuine alternative to commercial hip-hop since the Native Tongues' heyday. It appealed strongly to alternative audiences who'd grown up with rap music, but simply hadn't related to it since the rise of gangsta". Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, [...] "I just made a record. I was an artist on a project, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> [...] that <b>I</b> was an artist on a project. Octagon wasn't my life...I've {{done a lot of}} things that were totally around different things other than Octagon.

A 2012 Internet meme, [...] "Texts from Hillary", was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages.
