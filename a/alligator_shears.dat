50|$|The safety {{requirements}} for other powered metalworking shears {{are contained in}} ANSI B11.4, but <b>alligator</b> <b>shears</b> are specifically exempted from that standard. Federal OSHA and various state OSHA programs have requirements for guarding <b>alligator</b> <b>shears,</b> and newly manufactured <b>alligator</b> <b>shears</b> are provided with guards that adjust {{to the size of}} the stock or scrap being cut. The purpose of this guard, however, is to prevent pieces of metal from being ejected during cutting. Such a guard also prevents inadvertent exposure of the operator's hands, but does not conform to more stringent 'point of operation' guarding requirements.|$|E
50|$|Older <b>alligator</b> <b>shears</b> were {{powered by}} a flywheel. These shears ran continuously, which posed a safety hazard. Now <b>alligator</b> <b>shears</b> are {{hydraulically}} actuated. When actuated, the piston arm extends and slowly closes the upper jaw of the alligator shear, which passes alongside the bed or lower jaw of the shear to perform the cut.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alligator</b> <b>shears</b> {{are used}} for cutting long metal stock or scrap, {{generally}} where accuracy is not an important consideration, and the size or shape of the material makes other cutting or shearing options impractical- often the only other cutting option is cutting with a torch. <b>Alligator</b> <b>shears</b> are often {{used in conjunction with}} large metal shredders in the metal recycling industry, to 'clean' or prepare scrap for shredding by removing unwanted fittings or other parts the shredder will not accept.|$|E
50|$|In {{an interpretive}} letter dated June 24, 1981, Federal OSHA {{discussed}} the guarding dilemma {{presented by the}} <b>alligator</b> <b>shear.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{specialized}} tools used in scrapyards are hazardous, {{such as the}} <b>alligator</b> <b>shear</b> which cuts metal using hydraulic force, compactors, and {{scrap metal}} shredders.|$|R
50|$|These {{practical}} {{considerations for}} guarding are not exclusive to <b>alligator</b> <b>shears.</b> A {{much more common}} type of equipment, the press brake, also requires point of operation guarding when used with standardized stock, but not with large-dimension stock.|$|E
50|$|An {{alligator}} shear, historically {{known as}} a lever shear and sometimes as a crocodile shear, is a metal-cutting shear with a hinged jaw, powered by a flywheel or hydraulic cylinder. <b>Alligator</b> <b>shears</b> are generally set up as stand-alone shears; however, there are types for excavators. The jaw size can range from 4 to 36 in long. They are generally used to cut steel members, such as rebar, pipe, angle iron, or I-beams.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} master´s {{thesis is}} to design {{solution}} of equipment for dividing rods of non-ferrous metals. The equipment is primarily meant for innovation of semi-finished product preparation in blacksmith's workshop. This master´s thesis mainly focused on design of individual mechanical components of <b>alligator</b> <b>shears</b> and their calculations. There are also solved dangerous places for operators and surroundings by using a safety analysis. The result of this master´s thesis is possibility of design mechanical part according to assignment...|$|E
