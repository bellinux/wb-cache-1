5|$|Many {{of those}} killed were tortured, beaten using chains and burned. Most {{of the victims were}} killed by gunshots, but the cause of death proved hard to {{establish}} for eight victims whose bodies were severely burned. A couple was bound with chains and burned alive, two women were killed using axes or similar sharp objects, one of them by several axe blows to her head. Another couple was beheaded and their heads were placed in bags. One victim was cut by <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> while still alive, and another died trapped in her house which was torched by the paramilitaries. The Serb civilian who attempted to protect the others was also beaten, tortured using lighted cigarettes and heated chains, and then flayed.|$|E

25|$|The {{carving of}} a piece, which is done while the wood is still wet, can last {{anywhere}} from hours to a month, {{depending on the}} size and fineness of the piece. Often the copal wood that is used will influence what is made, both because of the shapes the branches can take and because male and female trees differ in hardness and shape. Carving is done with non-mechanical hand tools such as machetes, chisels and knives. The only time a more sophisticated tool is used is when <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> is employed to cut off a branch or level a base for the proposed figure. The basic shape of the creature is usually hacked using a machete, then a series of smaller knives used as the final shape is achieved. Certain details such as ears, tails and wings are usually made from pieces separate from the one for the main body.|$|E
500|$|Onstage tension {{began to}} grow between Kiedis and Frusciante. Kiedis {{recalled}} an argument after a show in New Orleans: [...] "We had a sold-out house and John just stood in the corner, barely playing his guitar. We came offstage and John and I got into it." [...] With the Peppers now playing shows at arenas rather than theaters, the promoters of the tour decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act. Kiedis contacted Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, {{and asked him if}} Nirvana would replace Pearl Jam on the tour—an offer Grohl accepted. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan, however, refused to play with Nirvana as he once dated frontman Kurt Cobain's wife Courtney Love. The Pumpkins were, therefore, taken off the concert bill and replaced with Pearl Jam. Their first show with Nirvana was at the L.A Sports Arena. Kiedis considered their act to be [...] "raw energy; their musicality, their song selection, they were like <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> cutting through the night." [...] When the Red Hot Chili Peppers finished touring with Nirvana, they traveled to Europe, where Frusciante, in need of someone to connect to, brought along his girlfriend Toni Oswald. Kiedis said that [...] "John had broken our unwritten rule of no spouses or girlfriends on the road." [...] Briefly interrupting the European-tour, the Chili Peppers flew to New York City and performed on an episode of Saturday Night Live. The band played [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] as the second number; a performance that Kiedis felt was sabotaged by Frusciante: ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{discussion}} with Dow, Father Brophy {{decided to build}} the largest wooden crucifix in the world on Calvary Hill, located north of the Long House Chapel. In July 1952, Bishop Babcock granted them permission to begin the project. The foundation of the Cross required a [...] high steel and concrete base which was covered with soil, creating a hill [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide. In the summer of 1952, redwood timber was custom cut with <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> from a lumber yard in Oregon and shipped on a railroad flat car. It took two days to assemble the Cross.

One of those is the fear of teeth being broken, which I used in my first film. Another is the claw of an animal, like a saber-toothed tiger reaching with its tremendous hooks. I transposed this into a human hand. The original script had the blades being fishing knives." ...|$|E

The <b>Chain</b> <b>SAW</b> was designed to only be fired from the hip, with a handle along the top to hold the firearm (which is mounted instead of a stock) meaning the user would wield the <b>Chain</b> <b>SAW</b> {{as if they were}} using an actual chainsaw. <b>As</b> the <b>Chain</b> <b>SAW</b> is intended to be hip-fired, various targeting aids were developed alongside it to aid the aiming and accuracy, although KAC admits that more work on targeting aids will have to be made before the <b>Chain</b> <b>SAW</b> could be produced and used effectively.|$|R

40|$|The faulty {{communication}} versus risky decision hypotheses {{of failure}} to follow safety instructions were explored {{in a laboratory}} experiment. Four groups of 10 male college students differing in tool-using experience and safety orientation were asked to perform work sample activities with <b>an</b> electric <b>chain</b> <b>saw.</b> Safety orientation was provided by classroom lecture content. Dependent variables were compliance with safety warnings contained in the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operating instruc-tions and recognition of those instructions in a posttrial test. Understanding of instructions was verified by posttrial interview. Overall group compliance with the test safety instructions was 55. 6 %. Compliance for the group experienced with <b>chain</b> <b>saws</b> was 41. 25 %; for the inexperienced group it was 70 %. An ANOVA showed both tool experience and safety orientation to be significant in influencing compliance. Instruction recognition was 87. 5 % overall with no difference between groups.
