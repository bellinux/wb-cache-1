5|$|The work {{assumes that}} the royal legal system would still address some issues that later would have been dealt with by ecclesiastical courts.

It takes for granted that the Anglo-Saxon laws of England are still in effect. It also addresses the administration of forest law under Henry I.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{examines}} {{the link between}} highway congestion, labor productivity, and output {{in a sample of}} California counties for the years 1977 through 1988. A county production function is modified to include both the value of each county’s street <b>and</b> <b>highway</b> capital stock <b>and</b> a measure of the congestion on each county’s highway network. This allows a comparison of two distinct policies—expanding the street <b>and</b> <b>highway</b> stock versus reducing congestion on the existing stock. The evidence suggests that congestion reduction is productive. The effects of expanding the street <b>and</b> <b>highway</b> stock are more suspect. Overall, the results provide evidence that using existing street <b>and</b> <b>highway</b> infrastructure more efficiently can produce economic benefits...|$|R
