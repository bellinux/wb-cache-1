5|$|Throughout the Brezhnev {{years and}} the lengthy interregnum that followed, the {{generation}} which had come of age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> died or were pensioned off, they were replaced {{by men and women}} for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues.</b> The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Hewitt Crane <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{developed}} the world's first all-magnetic digital computer, based upon extensions to magnetic core memories.

5|$|The Academy's benefactress, Catherine I, who had {{continued}} the progressive policies {{of her late}} husband, died {{on the day of}} Euler's arrival. The Russian nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelve-year-old Peter II. The nobility was suspicious of the academy's foreign scientists, and thus cut funding and caused other difficulties for Euler <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues.</b>|$|E
5|$|The London Chess Club, {{which had}} fallen out with Staunton <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues,</b> {{organised}} a tournament that was played a month later and had a multi-national set of players (many of whom had competed in Staunton's tournament), {{and the result was}} the same – Anderssen won.|$|E

5|$|A second {{important}} decision in which Owsley was a participant {{was the case}} of Blair, etc. v. Williams, which invalidated the Kentucky Replevin Act of 1820. This law granted debtors a two-year grace period in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept notes from the Bank of Kentucky. Owsley <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> opined that this law was in violation of the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision was extremely unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's opinion in the related case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Farke <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> in 2014 {{published}} {{a description of}} a new neoceratopsian, Aquilops americanus, through the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE. They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would have a large ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E
5|$|Gröning {{left school}} with high marks {{and began a}} {{traineeship}} as a bank clerk when he was 17, but war was declared shortly after he started employment and eight of the twenty clerks present were immediately conscripted into the army. This allowed the remaining trainees to further their banking careers {{in a relatively short}} amount of time; however, despite these opportunities, Gröning <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> were inspired by Germany's quick victories in France and Poland and wanted to contribute.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was {{suggested that the}} cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Bruce Cunningham <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{discovered}} {{the first instance}} of a circularly permuted protein in nature. After determining the peptide sequence of the lectin protein favin, they noticed its similarity to a known protein– concanavalin A– except that the ends were circularly permuted. Later work confirmed the circular permutation between the pair and showed that concanavalin A is permuted post-translationally through cleavage and an unusual protein ligation.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Singh <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{discovered}} that a tiny portion of the short arm of sex-determining Y chromosome was necessary and sufficient to convert a female mouse to male. This fundamental discovery provided a new concept of Chromosomal translocation of sex-determining region from Y chromosome to X chromosomes causing sex reversal in mice. These findings later became {{the foundation for the}} discovery of a similar phenomenon of sex reversal in humans.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Kaspersky {{was granted}} an early release from his {{military}} service {{and left the}} defense ministry {{to take a job}} at the Information Technology Center of a private company KAMI, in order to work on his antivirus product full-time. There, he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> improved the software and released it as a product called Antiviral Toolkit Pro in 1992. At first the software was purchased by about ten clients per month. It earned about $100 per month, mostly from companies in Ukraine and Russia. Kaspersky's then-future wife Natalya Kaspersky became his coworker at KAMI.|$|E
5|$|James E. Rhoads, an {{astronomer}} at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, analyzed the burst and determined {{that it was not}} strongly beamed. Further analysis by Frail <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> indicated that the total energy released by the burst was approximately 5×1050ergs (5×1043J), and Rhoads determined that the total gamma-ray energy was approximately 3×1050erg (3×1043J). This implied that the gamma-ray and kinetic energy of the burst's ejecta were comparable, effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Morton <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{anticipated}} that {{copies of the}} new book would be prepared quickly. However, around the same time, Crown Prince Taufa'ahau Tupou IV returned from a trip to Australia where he realized that some changes should be made to the written Tongan language. Morton began working on a revised draft, but felt unacquainted with Tongan grammar. For a year, he studied the language and finally completely his revision on March 15, 1945. The Tongan version of the Book of Mormon was published in April 1946.|$|E

5|$|On 1 March 1953, Stalin {{suffered}} a massive stroke, apparently on rising after sleep. Stalin had left orders {{not to be}} disturbed, and it was twelve hours until his condition was discovered. Even as terrified doctors attempted treatment, Khrushchev <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> engaged in intense discussion as to the new government. On 5 March, Stalin died. As Khrushchev and other high officials stood weeping by Stalin's bedside, Beria raced from the room, shouting for his car.|$|E
