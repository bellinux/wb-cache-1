40|$|The gene coding for the 100 kDa monomeric protein (P 100) of the S {{layer of}} Thermus thermophilus HB 8 has been cloned in the Escherichia coli plasmid vector pUC 9. Recombinant {{plasmids}} were selected by colony screening with <b>anti-P</b> 100 rabbit <b>antiserum.</b> The gene, named slpA (for surface layer protein A), was identified in a bacterial clone harboring a hybrid plasmid, pMF 4, with a 5. 8 -kbp insert. This plasmid consistently expressed a protein specifically recognized by <b>anti-P</b> 100 <b>antiserum.</b> Expression was apparently independent of Plac, {{indicating that the}} promoter for P 100 is functional in E. coli. Most E. coli strains transformed with plasmids containing the 5. 8 -kbp insert cloned in pMF 4 expressed two proteins with apparent masses of 52 and 50 kDa, which were strongly recognized by <b>anti-P</b> 100 <b>antiserum</b> in Western immunoblots. The 52 -kDa fragment could be overproduced, and the sequence of the N-terminal undecapeptide, determined by microsequencing, indicated that it could correspond to the N-terminal domain of P 100. Expression of slpA in lon mutants of E. coli led to accumulation of a protein indistinguishable from native P 100, indicating that the complete gene was cloned and that the product of lon, protease La, was involved in proteolytic degradation of P 100 synthesized in E. coli...|$|R

40|$|A {{specific}} {{polyclonal antiserum}} was prepared against a gel-purified 60 kDa extracellular protein of Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111 corresponding to protein p 60 previously detected in culture broths of L. mono-cytogenes strains Mackaness and EGD [Kuhn, M. & Goebel, W. (1989), Infection and Zmmunity 57, 55 - 61]. Indirect immunogold labelling combined with {{transmission electron microscopy}} and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the location and distribution of p 60 on the bacterial cell surface. In bacteria grown to the early stationary phase about 25 % of the extracellular protein {{was estimated to be}} associated with the cell surface. The <b>anti-p</b> 60 <b>antiserum</b> proved to be Listeria-specific. In an indirect immunofluorescence test the antiserum reacted with Listeria strains representing all species and different serotypes, except L. seefigeri, L. wefshimeri, L. grayi and L. murrayi. No immunological cross-reactions were observed with 27 strains of bacteria from 16 other genera.

40|$|The {{presence}} {{and distribution of}} nervous-system-specific protein (S- 100 protein), peripheral nerve myelin proteins (P 2 protein and P 0 protein) {{that have not been}} given any attention in the field of tumor pathology, and striated muscle-related proteins (myoglobin and myosin) were studied in 18 cases of granular cell tumor by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. The granular cells of all cases were negatively stained with anti-striated-muscle-related protein antiserums. On the other hand, they were positively stained with anti-S- 100 protein, P 2 protein, and P 0 protein antiserums. The distribution of P 2 protein and P 0 protein corresponded with that of characteristic PAS-positive granules on serial sections. Angular bodies in the interstitial cells were also positively stained with <b>anti-P</b> 2 protein <b>antiserum</b> and <b>anti-P</b> 0 protein <b>antiserum.</b> These results further support the hypothesis that the granular cell tumor is derived from Schwann cells and also suggest that myelin proteins are major core proteins of the characteristic granules and angular bodies of interstitial cells. The biologic significance of these results in relation to myelinogenesis is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{the presence of}} XMRV in a cohort of Quebec patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). DNA was purified from activated {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) and PCR was used to detect XMRV gag and env in 72 patients. Anti-XMRV antibodies were searched in sera of 62 patients by Western blot analysis. Attempts to detect XMRV antigens was made, using immunofluorescence with Gag <b>anti-p</b> 30 <b>antiserum</b> on activated PBMC from 50 patients. Plasma viremia was measured by RT-PCR on 9 subjects. Finally, detection of infectious virus in 113 CFS subjects was made by co-culture of PHA+IL- 2 activated PBMC with human LNCaP carcinoma cells, and by infecting the same susceptible cells with plasma, using a reverse transcriptase (RT) assay as a readout in both experiments. No detection of XMRV footprints nor infectious virus was detected with any of the approaches, in any of the tested individuals...|$|R
40|$|DNA primase {{activity}} of the yeast DNA polymerase-primase complex is related to two polypeptides, p 58 and p 48. The reciprocal role of these protein species {{has not yet been}} clarified, although both participate in formation of the active center of the enzyme. The gene encoding the p 58 subunit has been cloned by screening of a lambda gt 11 yeast genomic DNA library, using specific <b>anti-p</b> 58 <b>antiserum.</b> Antibodies that inhibited DNA primase activity could be purified by lysates of Escherichia coli cells infected with a recombinant bacteriophage containing the entire gene, which we designate PR 12. The gene was found to be transcribed in a 1. 7 -kilobase mRNA whose level appeared to fluctuate during the mitotic cell cycle. Nucleotide sequence determination indicated that PR 12 encodes a 528 -amino-acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 62, 262. The gene is unique in the haploid yeast genome, and its product is essential for cell viability, as has been shown for other components of the yeast DNA polymerase-primase complex...|$|R
40|$|A vaccinia virus-encoded {{double-stranded}} RNA-binding protein, p 25, {{has been}} previously implicated in inhibition of the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase. In this study, we have identified the vaccinia viral gene (WR strain) that encodes p 25. Amino acid sequence analysis of a chymotryptic fragment of p 25 revealed a close match to the vaccinia virus (Copenhagen strain) E 3 L gene. The WR strain E 3 L gene was cloned and expressed either in COS- 1 cells or in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in vitro. A M(r) 25, 000 polypeptide that could bind to poly(rI). poly(rC) -agarose and that reacted with p 25 -specific antiserum was produced in each case. In addition, COS cells expressing E 3 L gene products inhibited activation of the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase in extracts from interferon-treated cells. Removal of E 3 L-encoded products by adsorption with <b>anti-p</b> 25 <b>antiserum</b> resulted in loss of kinase inhibitory activity. These results demonstrate that the vaccinia virus E 3 L gene encodes p 25 and that {{the products of the}} E 3 L gene have kinase inhibitory activity. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the E 3 L gene products with the protein sequence data base revealed a region closely related to the human interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase...|$|R
40|$|Transcription {{factor p}} 45 NF-E 2 is highly {{expressed}} in the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. Although p 45 recognizes regulatory regions of several erythroid genes, mice deficient for this protein display only mild dyserythropoiesis but have abnormal megakaryocytes and lack circulating platelets. A number of megakaryocytic marker genes have been extensively studied, {{but none of them}} is regulated by NF-E 2. To find target genes for p 45 NF-E 2 in megakaryopoiesis, we used an in vivo immunoselection assay: genomic fragments bound to p 45 NF-E 2 in the chromatin of a megakaryocytic cell line were immunoprecipitated with an <b>anti-p</b> 45 <b>antiserum</b> and cloned. One of these fragments belongs to the second intron of the thromboxane synthase gene (TXS). We demonstrate that the TXS gene, which is mainly expressed in megakaryocytes, is indeed directly regulated by p 45 NF-E 2. First, its promoter contains a functional NF-E 2 binding site; second, the intronic NF-E 2 binding site is located within a chromatin-dependent enhancer element; third, p 45 -null murine megakaryocytes do not express detectable TXS mRNA, although TXS expression can be detected in other cells. These data, and the structure of the TXS promoter and enhancer, suggest that TXS belongs to a distinct subgroup of genes involved in platelet formation and function...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{modulation}} of Ia-like antigens on the surface membrane of human T cells responding in a one-way mixed leukocyte culture. A heterologous <b>antiserum,</b> (<b>anti-p</b> 23, 30), which is specific to HLA-D-related antigens and which is unreactive with normal peripheral T cells or thymocytes, was found to bind significantly to all T cells transformed in mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) as determined by indirect immunofluorescence on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter 1. Furthermore, cytotoxic T cells responsible for cell-mediated lympholysis were shown to react with anti-p 23, 30, whereas their unactivated progenitors did not. Immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a radioactive 29, 000 and 34, 000 dalton complex from MLC-primed T cells labeled with [35 S]methionine indicated that allosensitized T cells synthesized these HLA-D-related antigens...|$|R
40|$|CTLA- 4 is a T cell antigen that is {{structurally}} {{related to}} CD 28 {{and serves as}} a high affinity ligand for the B cell antigen B 7 - 1 / 2. Unlike CD 28, the function of CTLA- 4 is unclear, although reports have implicated the antigen in the costimulation of T cells. Recently, phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) has been implicated in the costimulatory function of CD 28 by virtue of its ability to bind to a pYMNM motif within the cytoplasmic tail of the antigen. In this study, we show that CTLA- 4 can also associate with PI 3 -kinase as detected by lipid kinase analysis and immunoblotting with <b>anti-p</b> 85 <b>antiserum.</b> High pressure liquid chromatographic separation of deacylated lipids showed the presence of a peak corresponding to PI- 3 -P. Anti-CTLA- 4 ligation of the receptor induced {{a significant increase in the}} levels of precipitable PI 3 -kinase activity. Peptide binding studies revealed that the NH 2 - and COOH-terminal SH 2 domains of p 85 bind the CTLA- 4 cytoplasmic pYVKM motif with an affinity (ID 50 : 0. 6 and 0. 04 microM), that is similar to CD 28. CTLA- 4 binding to PI 3 -kinase provides further evidence that CTLA- 4 is not an inert counterreceptor, but rather is coupled to an intracellular signaling molecule with the capacity to regulate cell growth...|$|R
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 -dependent aldrin {{epoxidation}} {{was characterized}} in third instar larvae of the aquatic midge, Chironomus tentans. Optimal {{in vitro assay}} conditions for the epoxidase were pH 7. 6 and 31 °C. Activity was linear up to 40 min of incubation time and 0. 5 mg microsomal protein per incubation. The activity was concentrated in the mic rosomal fraction of whole body homogenates and was NADPH-dependent. The effect of atrazine exposure on aldrin epoxidase was measured to determine if this herbicide induces cytochrome P 450 -dependent activity. Comparisons of control and atrazine-exposed midges indicated increased epoxidase activity {{as a result of}} atrazine exposure, and a 45 kDa protein of increased intensity was observed after SDS-PAGE of microsomal protein. The molecular weight of this protein was similar in size to cytochrome P 450 enzymes reported for other insects. Heme staining of SDS-PAGE gels and immunochemical studies using a Drosophila melanogaster <b>anti-P</b> 450 polyclonal <b>antiserum,</b> further support the cytochrome P 450 nature of this inducible 45 kDa protein...|$|R
40|$|S-layer {{deletion}} mutants of Thermus thermophilus HB 8 overproduce {{a regular}} array which surrounds groups of several cells. Averages of two-dimensional projections revealed a detailed architecture similar in general morphology and unit cell dimensions {{to that of}} the S-layer but having a different mass distribution. The structural components of these "S-layer-like arrays" are a group of three proteins of 52 (P 52), 50 (P 50), and 36 (P 36) kDa, which are overexpressed in S-layer mutants. These three proteins specifically bind antibodies against P 52, suggesting that the smaller proteins correspond to fragments derived from P 52. This hypothesis was demonstrated by the identity of the trypsin digestion products of P 52 and P 50. The gene slpM, responsible for the synthesis of P 52, was cloned by using synthetic oligonucleotides designed from partial amino acid sequences of P 52 and P 50. When slpM was expressed in Escherichia coli, proteins specifically recognized by <b>anti-P</b> 52 <b>antiserum</b> whose electrophoretic mobilities were similar to those of P 52 and P 36 were detected. The sequence of slpM revealed the existence of an open reading frame in which the amino termini of P 52, P 50, and P 36 were identified. The unprocessed product of slpM is a 469 -amino-acid-long polypeptide whose theoretical M(r) (52, 131) was in good agreement with the electrophoretic mobility of P 52. The properties deduced for the product of slpM are very different from those of any S-layer protein so far sequenced. The possible roles of SlpM in wild-type cells are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) is a {{familial}} {{neurological disorder}} pathologically characterized by amyloid deposition in the cerebrum and cerebellum. In GSS, the amyloid is immunoreactive to antisera raised against the prion protein (PrP) 27 - 30, a proteinase K-resistant peptide of 27 - 30 kDa that is derived by limited proteolysis from an abnormal isoform of a neuronal sialoglycoprotein of 33 - 35 kDa designated PrPSc. Polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides homologous to residues 15 - 40 (P 2), 90 - 102 (P 1), and 220 - 232 (P 3) of the {{amino acid sequence}} deduced from hamster PrP cDNA were used to investigate immunohistochemically the distribution of PrP and PrP fragments in the brains of two patients from the Indiana kindred of GSS. Two types of anti-PrP-immunoreactive deposits were found: (i) amyloid deposits, which were exclusively labeled by <b>anti-P</b> 1 <b>antiserum</b> to residues 90 - 102 of PrP, and (ii) preamyloid deposits, which were labeled by all anti-PrP antisera but did not exhibit the tinctorial and optical properties of amyloid. The latter appeared as diffuse immunostaining of the neuropil that targeted to areas in which amyloid deposits were most abundant. They were partially resistant to proteinase K digestion and consisted ultrastructurally of amorphous, flaky, electron-dense material. These findings substantiate our previous observation that the major amyloid component in the GSS Indiana kindred is an internal fragment of PrP and indicate that full-length abnormal isoforms of PrP and/or large PrP fragments accumulate in brain regions most affected by amyloid deposition. These findings {{support the view that}} in the GSS Indiana kindred a stepwise degradation of PrP occurs in situ in the process of amyloid fibril formation...|$|R
40|$|The oral {{pathogen}} Streptococcus mutans {{expresses a}} surface protein, P 1, which {{interacts with the}} salivary pellicle on the tooth surface or with fluid-phase saliva, resulting in bacterial adhesion or aggregation, respectively. P 1 is a target of protective immunity. Its N-terminal region {{has been associated with}} adhesion and aggregation functions and contains epitopes recognized by efficacious antibodies. In this study, we used Bacillus subtilis, a gram-positive expression host, to produce a recombinant N-terminal polypeptide of P 1 (P 1 (39 - 512)) derived from the S. mutans strain UA 159. Purified P 1 (39 - 512) reacted with an anti-full-length P 1 antiserum as well as one raised against intact S. mutans cells, indicating preserved antigenicity. Immunization of mice with soluble and heat-denatured P 1 (39 - 512) induced antibodies that reacted specifically with native P 1 on the surface of S. mutans cells. The anti-P 1 (39 - 512) antiserum was as effective at blocking saliva-mediated aggregation of S. mutans cells and better at blocking bacterial adhesion to saliva-coated plastic surfaces compared with the anti-full-length P 1 antiserum. In addition, adsorption of the <b>anti-P</b> 1 <b>antiserum</b> with P 1 (39 - 512) eliminated its ability to block the adhesion of S. mutans cells to abiotic surfaces. The present results indicate that P 1 (39 - 512), expressed and purified from a recombinant B. subtilis strain, maintains important immunological features of the native protein and represents an additional tool for the development of anticaries vaccines.

40|$|AIM: To {{develop a}} highly {{sensitive}} and specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system {{for analysis of}} p 53 protein in cancer lysates. METHODS: The anti-p 53 monoclonal antibodies DO 7, 1801, BP 53. 12, and 421, and <b>anti-p</b> 53 polyclonal <b>antiserum</b> CM 1 were assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis to identify those most suitable for determining p 53 status of cancer cells. Antibodies with desired characteristics were used to develop a non-competitive sandwich type ELISA system for analysis of p 53 expression in cancer cytosols. Using the ELISA, p 53 protein concentrations were measured in a small series of breast cancers, and the quantitative values compared with p 53 immunohistochemical data of the same cancers. RESULTS: DO 7 and 1801 gave the most specific and reliable results on immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Using these two antibodies, a non-competitive sandwich type ELISA system was developed to analyse p 53 quantitatively. Analysis of the breast cancer series showed a good correlation between immunohistochemistry and the ELISA-tumours were generally positive using both techniques. Discrepancies were noted however: some cancers were immunohistochemically negative but ELISA positive. One explanation for this {{may be that the}} ELISA is more sensitive than immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: The p 53 ELISA system is a non-competitive double monoclonal antibody sandwich method, using DO 7 and 1801 which {{have been shown to be}} highly specific for p 53 protein by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. The lower threshold of the assay is 0. 1 ng/ml analyte in an enriched recombinant p 53 preparation. As p 53 is now regarded as a protein associated with prognosis in breast and other cancers, the assay may have clinical applications...|$|R
