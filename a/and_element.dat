5|$|Seaborg was the {{principal}} or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium <b>and</b> <b>element</b> 106, which, {{while he was still}} living, was named seaborgium in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 atomic isotopes and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the second atomic bomb. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, most notably iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. In addition to his theoretical work {{in the development of the}} actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series.|$|E
5|$|The Russian discoverers {{reported}} their synthesis in 2006. According to IUPAC recommendations, the discoverers {{of a new}} element {{have the right to}} suggest a name. In 2007, the head of the Russian institute stated the team were considering two names for the new element: flyorium, in honor of Georgy Flyorov, the founder of the research laboratory in Dubna; and moskovium, in recognition of the Moscow Oblast where Dubna is located. He also stated that although the element was discovered as an American collaboration, who provided the californium target, the element should rightly be named in honor of Russia since the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions at JINR was the only facility in the world which could achieve this result. These names were later proposed for element 114 (flerovium) <b>and</b> <b>element</b> 116 (moscovium). However, the final name proposed for element 116 was instead livermorium, and the name moscovium was later proposed and accepted for element 115 instead.|$|E
5|$|The team at RIKEN has {{listed the}} {{synthesis}} of element 121 among their future plans after their attempts to synthesise element 120 in 2017–2018 <b>and</b> <b>element</b> 119 in 2019–2020. Their attempts at the latter two involve targets of 248Cm with projectiles of 54Cr and 51V respectively; the reaction of 248Cm with 55Mn would produce the same isotopes of element 121 as the JINR's suggested reaction of 249Bk with 54Cr in the 3n (300Ubu) and 4n (299Ubu) channels. Before this, the RIKEN team had successfully produced livermorium (element 116) in the fusion of 248Cm with 48Ca, and will next try to produce new isotopes of oganesson (element 118) in the fusion of 248Cm with 50Ti.|$|E

25|$|Kat & Alfie: Redwater (also called Redwater in Ireland), is a British–Irish co-production {{television}} {{drama series}} broadcast on RTÉ One and BBC One. It {{was created by}} Dominic Treadwell-Collins as a six-part series based on the characters Kat Moon, played by Jessie Wallace, and Alfie Moon, played by Shane Richie, from the soap opera EastEnders. The series {{is set in the}} fictional Irish village of Redwater, where the residents are hiding a dark secret, and features an ensemble cast. Redwater is a co-production between the BBC <b>and</b> <b>Element</b> Pictures, with Victoria Wharton serving as producer. It was filmed on location in Dublin, County Waterford and County Wicklow between 11 April and 26 July 2016. It started airing in Ireland on 14 May 2017 and the United Kingdom on 18 May 2017. It has also been shown in the United States and Canada. A second series was mooted during filming of the first but in September 2017, it was confirmed that no more episodes would be produced, leaving the fates of the characters unknown.|$|E
25|$|The Parthenon {{maintains}} the same proportion at {{a larger scale}} of 8 × 17 columns, but follows the same principles. In spite of the eight columns on its front, the temple is a pure peripteros, its external cella walls align with the axes of the 2nd and 7th columns. In other regards, the Parthenon is distinguished as an exceptional example among the mass of Greek peripteroi by many distinctive aesthetic solutions in detail. For example, the antae of pronaos and opisthodomos are shortened so as to form simple pillars. Instead of longer antae, there are prostyle colonnades inside the peristasis {{on the front and}} back, reflecting Ionic habits. The execution of the naos, with a western room containing four columns, is also exceptional. The Parthenon's Archaic predecessor already contained such a room. All measurements in the Parthenon are determined by the proportion 4:9. It determines column width to column distance, width to length of the stylobate, and of the naos without antae. The temple's width to height up to the geison is determined by the reverse proportion 9:4, the same proportion squared, 81:16, determines temple length to height. All of this mathematical rigour is relaxed and loosened by the optical refinements mentioned above, which affect the whole building, from layer to layer, <b>and</b> <b>element</b> to element. 92 sculpted metopes decorate its triglyph frieze: centauromachy, amazonomachy and gigantomachy are its themes. The external walls of the naos are crowned with a figural frieze surrounding the entire cella and depicting the Panathenaic procession as well as the Assembly of the Gods. Large format figures decorate the pediments on the narrow sides. This conjunction of strict principles and elaborate refinements makes the Parthenon the paradigmatic Classical temple. The Temple of Hephaistos at Athens, erected shortly after the Parthenon, uses the same aesthetic and proportional principles, without adhering as closely to the 4:9 proportion.|$|E

500|$|Critics responded {{positively}} to [...] "Cold Comfort", though several characterised it as weaker than previous episodes in the series. David Chater, writing in The Times, described [...] "Cold Comfort" [...] as [...] "a breather" [...] after the [...] "small masterpieces" [...] of [...] "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] and [...] "The 12 Days of Christine". He said that [...] "Cold Comfort" [...] offers [...] "a promising set-up, but ... doesn't unfold {{with the same}} simple, logical elegance as others in the series". Andrew Billen, also writing for The Times, gave the episode three out of five stars, considering it weaker than is typical for Inside No. 9. John Robinson, who reviewed the episode for The Guardian, felt that though [...] "the episode has the tools to ratchet up the suspense", it [...] "lacks both the plausibility <b>and</b> <b>element</b> of surprise that characterise the best of this series".|$|E
500|$|The first {{claim of}} a {{discovery}} {{was published by}} Luigi Rolla and Lorenzo Fernandes of Florence, Italy. After separating a mixture of a few rare earth elements nitrate concentrate from the Brazilian mineral monazite by fractionated crystallization, they yielded a solution containing mostly samarium. This solution gave x-ray spectra attributed to samarium <b>and</b> <b>element</b> 61. In honor of their city, they named element 61 [...] "florentium." [...] The results were published in 1926, but the scientists claimed that the experiments were done in 1924. Also in 1926, {{a group of scientists}} from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Smith Hopkins and Len Yntema published the discovery of element 61. They named it [...] "illinium," [...] after the university. Both of these reported discoveries were shown to be erroneous because the spectrum line that [...] "corresponded" [...] to element 61 was identical to that of didymium; the lines thought to belong to element 61 turned out to belong to a few impurities (barium, chromium, and platinum).|$|E

500|$|VSEPR theory {{predicts a}} bent-T-shaped {{molecular}} geometry {{for the group}} 17 trifluorides. All known halogen trifluorides have this molecular geometry and have a structure of AX3E2—a central atom, denoted A, surrounded by three ligands, X, and two unshared electron pairs, E. If relativistic effects are ignored, TsF3 should follow its lighter congeners in having a bent-T-shaped molecular geometry. More sophisticated predictions show that this molecular geometry would not be energetically favored for TsF3, predicting instead a trigonal planar molecular geometry (AX3E0). This shows that VSEPR theory may not be consistent for the superheavy elements.

Ruthenium tetroxide and osmium tetroxide are both volatile, due to their symmetrical tetrahedral molecular geometry and their being charge-neutral; hassium tetroxide should similarly be a very volatile solid. The trend of the volatilities of the group 8 tetroxides is known to be RuO4< OsO4 > HsO4, which completely confirms the calculated results. In particular, the calculated enthalpies of adsorption (the energy required for the adhesion of atoms, molecules, or ions from a gas, liquid, or dissolved solid to a surface) of HsO4, −(45.4 ± 1) kJ·mol−1 on quartz, agrees very well with the experimental value of −(46 ± 2) kJ·mol−1.
