25|$|Colorado has a flat 4.63% income tax, {{regardless}} of income level.

Colorado's state sales tax is 2.9% on retail sales. When state revenues exceed state constitutional limits, according to Colorado's Taxpayer Bill of Rights legislation, full-year Colorado residents can claim a sales tax refund on their individual state income tax return.

25|$|Under a Roth IRA, first {{enacted in}} 1998, individuals, whether {{employees}} or self-employed, voluntarily contribute post-tax funds {{to an individual}} retirement arrangement (IRA). In contrast to the 401(k) plan, the Roth plan requires post-tax contributions, but allows for tax free growth and distribution, provided the contributions have been invested for at least 5 years and the account owner has reached age 59½. Roth IRA contribution limits are significantly lower than 401(k) contribution limits. For tax-years 2016 and 2017, individuals may contribute no more than $5,500 per year to a Roth IRA if under age 50, and $6,500 if age 50 or older. Additionally, Roth IRA contribution limits are reduced for taxpayers with a Modified <b>Adjusted</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>Income</b> (modified AGI) greater than $117,000 ($184,000 for married filing jointly), phasing out entirely for individuals with a modified AGI of $132,000 ($194,000 for married filing jointly), for 2016. See 401(k) versus IRA matrix that compares various types of IRAs with various types of 401(k)s.|$|E
25|$|A Roth 401(k) plan is {{probably}} most advantageous {{to those who}} might otherwise choose a Roth IRA, such as younger workers who are currently taxed in a lower tax bracket but expect to be taxed in a higher bracket upon reaching retirement age. Higher-income workers may prefer a traditional 401(k) plan because they are currently taxed in a higher tax bracket but would expect to be taxed at a lower rate in retirement; also, those near the Roth IRA income limits may prefer a traditional 401(k) since its pre-tax contributions lowers Modified <b>Adjusted</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>Income</b> (MAGI) and thus increases eligibility for various other tax incentives (Roth IRA contributions, the Child Tax Credit, medical expense deduction, etc.). Another consideration for those currently in higher tax brackets {{is the future of}} income tax rates in the US: if income tax rates increase, current taxation would be desirable for a wider group). The Roth 401(k) offers the advantage of tax free distribution but is not constrained by the same income limitations. For example, in tax year 2013, normal Roth IRA contributions are limited to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older); up to $17,500 could be contributed to a Roth 401(k) account if no other elective deferrals were taken for the tax year, such as traditional 401(k) deferrals.|$|E

Section 1604 of the Act imposes a prohibition on making commodity payments or conservation payments to individuals or entities that have 3-year average <b>adjusted</b> <b>gross</b> <b>incomes</b> exceeding $2.5 million (unless 75% or more of the income is from farming, ranching, or forestry).|$|R
40|$|The Bush {{administration}} advocates its January 2003 {{proposal to}} repeal personal dividend taxation {{on the basis}} that the cut would stimulate the economy, primarily benefit American seniors, and eliminate an unfair case of "double taxation. " This paper primarily analyzes the proposal using a different criterion - its distributional impacts. Contrary to the administration's claim that seniors receive over half of all dividend income, U. S. Census Bureau data indicate that seniors receive only about one-quarter of dividend income. Dividend income is more concentrated towards high- income tax filers than the distribution of U. S. income as a whole. About two-thirds of dividend income accrues to the top 10 % of tax filers. Less than one-fifth of tax filers with <b>adjusted</b> <b>gross</b> <b>incomes</b> of less than $ 75, 000 have any dividend income at all. Also, dividend income is highly skewed by race - only 8 % of blacks and 6 % of Hispanics receive dividend income. ...|$|R

5000|$|A March 2016 {{analysis}} by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center summarized Clinton's tax proposals as follows: [...] "Hillary Clinton proposes raising taxes on high-income taxpayers, modifying taxation of multinational corporations, repealing fossil fuel tax incentives, and increasing estate and gift taxes. Her proposals would increase revenue by $1.1 trillion over the next decade. Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes. Marginal tax rates would increase, reducing incentives to work, save, and invest, and the tax code would become more complex. The analysis does not address a forthcoming proposal to cut taxes for low- and middle-income families." [...] Clinton specifically has proposed a 4% surcharge on taxpayers earning over $5 million a year; a 30% minimum tax rate on millionaires, defined as those with <b>adjusted</b> <b>gross</b> <b>incomes</b> above $1 million (the [...] "Buffett Rule"), a 28% cap on most deductions, and increased taxes on long-term capital gains. The proposal also increases several business taxes, and seeks to penalize excessive risk-taking in the financial sector {{while at the same}} time creating incentives for business programs that would help workers and communities in distress. The Tax Policy Center estimates that Clinton's plan, on average; would: leave the poorest earners' taxes essentially unchanged; increase middle-income households' taxes by $44 (a 0.001% change); increase the top 1%'s taxes by $78,000; and increase the top 0.1%'s taxes by $520,000.|$|R

5000|$|The {{explanation}} of the 1969 Act prepared by Congress's Staff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation described {{the reason for the}} AMT as follows:"The prior treatment imposed no limit on the amount of income which an individual or corporation could exclude from tax as the result of various tax preferences. As a result, there were large variations in the tax burdens placed on individuals or corporations with similar economic incomes, depending upon the size of their preference income. In general, those individual or corporate taxpayers who received the bulk of their income from personal services or manufacturing were taxed at relatively higher tax rates than others. On the other hand, individuals or corporations which received the bulk of their income from such sources as capital gains or were in a position to benefit from net lease arrangements, from accelerated depreciation on real estate, from percentage depletion, or from other tax-preferred activities tended to pay relatively low rates of tax. In fact, many individuals with high incomes who could benefit from these provisions paid lower effective rates of tax than many individuals with modest incomes. In extreme cases, individuals enjoyed large economic incomes without paying any tax at all. This was true for example in the case of 154 returns in 1966 with <b>adjusted</b> <b>gross</b> <b>incomes</b> of $200,000 a year (apart from those with income exclusions which do not show on the returns filed). Similarly, a number of large corporations paid either no tax at all or taxes which represented very low effective rates." ...|$|R
