5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production {{expected it to}} be <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> of the ordinary. It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E

25|$|The defence case {{began on}} the morning of 12 March 2012 and lasted half a day.

25|$|The dynasty is {{regarded}} as the greatest native Yemeni state since the fall of pre-Islamic Himyarite Kingdom. They were of Turkic descent. They claimed an ancient Yemenite origin to justify their rule. The Rasulids were not the first dynasty to create a fictitious genealogy for political purposes, nor were they doing <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> of the ordinary in the tribal context of Arabia. By claiming descent from a solid Yemenite tribe, the Rasulids brought Yemen to a vital sense of unity in an otherwise chaotic regional milieu.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, an {{animated}} series {{based on the}} character was produced and broadcast by GameTap {{as part of a}} series of re-imaginings of popular video game series. Titled , it ran between May and June 2007. Multiple noted animators and writers were involved with the series, including Peter Chung, Warren Ellis, Gail Simone and Jim Lee. While the production team had great creative freedom, they were given a basic guideline for the character by the developers so that Lara would not do <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> of character.|$|E
25|$|The seasons between 1924 and 1927 saw {{a slight}} {{dropping}} off from Barratt, though he remained {{an important part}} of the Nottinghamshire side. In Wisden 1925, he was singled out for consistency. In both 1924 and 1925, he took more than 90 wickets at an average of less than 20 runs per wicket, but in 1926, that fell to just 66 wickets at a cost of 32 runs apiece. The recovery to 75 wickets at 21.14 in 1927 owed something to his fourth return of eight wickets in an innings, eight for 53 against Worcestershire at Trent Bridge. Nor was the batting <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> of the ordinary: he failed to pass 50 in 1924, 1925 or 1926, and reached a highest of only 57 in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Very {{soon after}} arrival over the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea), at 10:35., North Korea {{reacted to the}} {{presence}} of the EC-121, but not {{in a way that would}} jeopardize the mission. At 12:34 local time, roughly six hours into the mission, the Army Security Agency and radars in Korea detected the takeoff of two North Korean Air Force MiG-21s from East Tongchong-ni near Wonsan and tracked them, assuming that they were responding in some fashion to the mission of Deep Sea 129. In the meantime the EC-121 filed a scheduled activity report by radio on time at 13:00 and did not indicate <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> of the ordinary, but this was the last message sent from the plane. Twenty-two minutes later the radars lost the picture of the MiGs and did not reacquire it until 13:37, where they were closing with Deep Sea 129 for a probable intercept.|$|E

500|$|Hugh Trevor-Roper, {{writing for}} The New York Review of Books, was highly {{critical}} of the [...] "encyclopedic" [...] detail in Brown's writing: [...] "He piles on the illustrative (or irrelevant) detail. He cannot leave <b>anything</b> <b>out.</b> Every person mentioned must have a potted biography. Every place must be equipped with atmosphere, furniture, associations." [...] Roper also criticised the material, writing that Brown had inserted [...] "a novel thesis", that Allied deception during the war was controlled by MI6, [...] "which, in my opinion, is quite wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} care home where Roland lives. When they gently {{ask him about}} the night of the murder, he tells them he had not seen <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> of the ordinary. He also {{inadvertently}} reveals his mathematical prowess by rapidly counting the star designs visible on Scully's blouse; however, his handwriting does not match the fourth sample taken from the whiteboard. The discussion ends when Roland experiences a violent vision and has {{what seems to be a}} fit. Later that night, Roland has another vision in which he sees someone killing Keats. He appears at the lab and murders Keats by submerging his head in a tank of liquid nitrogen. Keats' frozen body is left to shatter as Roland begins typing at one of the computers.|$|E
500|$|Belisarius {{knew that}} success for his {{expedition}} relied on gaining {{the support of}} the local population, which had largely retained its Roman identity and to which he presented himself as a liberator. Thus on the next day of the landing, when some of his men stole some fruit from a local orchard, he severely punished them, and assembled the army and exhorted them to maintain discipline and restraint towards the native population, lest they abandon their Roman sympathies and go over to the Vandals. Belisarius' pleas bore results, for, as Procopius reports (The Vandalic War, I.17), [...] "the soldiers behaved with moderation, and they neither began any unjust brawls nor did <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> of the way, and , by displaying great gentleness and kindness, won the Libyans to his side so completely that thereafter he made the journey as if in his own land".|$|E

500|$|On the album's {{recording}} sessions, Smith noted [...] "there {{was a lot}} {{of drugs}} involved". The band took LSD and drank a lot of alcohol, and to save money, they slept in the office of their record label. The musicians usually turned up at eight, and left at midday looking [...] "fairly deranged". Smith related: [...] "We had an arrangement with the off-licence up the road, every night they would bring in supplies. We decided we weren't going to throw <b>anything</b> <b>out.</b> We built this mountain of empties in the corner, a gigantic pile of debris in the corner. It just grew and grew". According to Tolhurst, [...] "we wanted to make the ultimate, intense album. I can't remember exactly why, but we did". The recording sessions commenced and concluded in three weeks. Smith noted, [...] "At the time, I lost every friend I had, everyone, without exception, because I was incredibly obnoxious, appalling, self-centered". He also noted that with the album, he [...] "channelled all the self-destructive elements of my personality into doing something".|$|E
500|$|Sunderland lost 1–0 away to Manchester City on 5 November after a goal from Stephen Ireland. Manager, Roy Keane, {{expressed}} his frustration in a post match interview saying [...] "We didn't deserve anything. I don't feel we did {{enough to get}} <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> of the game. I don't think their keeper had too many saves to make, did he?". 10 November was the first Tyne–Wear derby of the season. Danny Higginbotham put Sunderland into the lead shortly after half time, but James Milner drew Newcastle level on the 68th minute after his cross beat goalkeeper Craig Gordon into the far post. Sunderland {{had a chance to}} win the game when ex-Newcastle forward Michael Chopra headed against the bar minutes from full-time. Sunderland ended the month on a low as they were beaten 7–1 away to Everton on 24 November. Dwight Yorke scored Sunderland's only goal just before half time. Roy Keane said [...] "It's hard to take, but we lose as a team and I picked the team and sorted the tactics so I have no problem taking responsibility for what happened." ...|$|E
500|$|As captain, Johnson {{was noted}} for his public {{relations}} skills and his gift for public speaking. [...] He was optimistic by nature, with {{a belief in}} [...] "guts and determination". [...] However, he was seen as insensitive at times; Bill Johnston took offence when Johnson attempted to rouse him during a practise session: [...] "Just cos {{you are one of}} the old blokes in the side doesn't mean you don't have to bloody well put in you know." [...] At times his optimism could appear artless and naive. Ian Craighis successor as Australian captainwas critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: [...] "I don't think [...] was ever realistic about the situation. [...] I supposed he felt obliged to make rallying speeches, but the team knew what was going on." [...] Pat Crawford felt [...] "Johnson couldn't get <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> of the players, whereas the guys would have busted a gut for [...] ". [...] He was seen by some of his team mates as [...] "dictatorial" [...] with [...] Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead-in match before 1956 Test series in England.|$|E

500|$|Three {{months prior}} to its broadcast, an {{incomplete}} version of the pilot was released through BitTorrent clients, fueling speculation that it was leaked deliberately to increase interest in the program. Executive producer Burk denied the claims, saying that [...] "we hate putting <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> there until it's done, and that's really the reason why you guys didn't get any advance copies". Abrams {{said that while the}} production crew [...] "freaked out" [...] about the leak, he was pleased that the [...] "response has been much more positive than not, especially for something that wasn't completed yet". The broadcast version of the pilot had new scenes added while other scenes were removed; Abrams also said that there was [...] "tightening and moving some moments here and there", and the ending was entirely different. Burk also stated that the composer, Michael Giacchino, had not finished his score {{at the time of the}} leak, and the most of the featured music was temp music. A variation of a piece of Giacchino's music called [...] "Hollywood and Vines" [...] used in the pilot was originally featured on Lost, as it was created for that show, also created by Abrams.|$|E
500|$|Part of Whitman's {{role at the}} Attorney General's {{office was}} {{interviewing}} former Confederate soldiers for Presidential pardons. [...] "There are real characters among them", he later wrote, [...] "and you know I have a fancy for <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> of the ordinary." [...] In August 1866, he took a month off in order to prepare a new edition of Leaves of Grass which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher. He {{hoped it would be}} its last edition. In February 1868, Poems of Walt Whitman was published in England thanks to the influence of William Michael Rossetti, with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved. The edition became popular in England, especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer Anne Gilchrist. Another edition of Leaves of Grass was issued in 1871, the same year it was mistakenly reported that its author died in a railroad accident. As Whitman's international fame increased, he remained at the attorney general's office until January 1872. He spent much of 1872 caring for his mother who was now nearly eighty and struggling with arthritis. He also traveled and was invited to Dartmouth College to give the commencement address on June 26, 1872.|$|E
500|$|The show, {{entitled}} Keeping Up With the Kardashians, premiered on October 14, 2007. The reality series {{centers around}} {{the members of the}} Kardashian-Jenner blended family, focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloé. Most episodes have very similar structure: the family [...] "show off their privileged lifestyle and maybe get into one or two minor family squabbles before ultimately wrapping things up with a monologue that reinforces the importance of family," [...] as noted by Caroline Siede of Quartz. Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described the reality series as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Kim Kardashian described the beginning of filming the show, [...] "When we first started , we came together as a family and said, 'If we're going to do this reality show, we're going to be 100 percent who we really are.'". She further commented on the show's authenticity by saying that the network [...] "has never once put <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> there that we haven't approved of or accepted". The series was renewed for a second season one month after its premiere due to high ratings. Seacrest described the show's success: [...] "At the heart of the seriesdespite the catfights and endless sarcasmis a family that truly loves and supports one another [...] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain." ...|$|E
