5|$|As {{initially}} conceived, MSR was a short-range {{system for}} tracking Sprint missiles before they {{appeared in the}} MAR's view, as well as offering a secondary target and jammer tracking role. In this initial concept, the MSR would have limited processing power, just enough to create tracks to feed back to the MAR. In the anti-jamming role, each MAR and MSR would measure the <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jammer.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held {{vertically}} at an <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, {{and a pair}} of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|King's Highway55, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway55 and historically as the Niagara Stone Road and Black Swamp Road, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario, which connected the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) with Niagara-on-the-Lake, following Niagara Stone Road. The route divided a swath of wineries {{at the foot of the}} Niagara Escarpment, passing at an oblique <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> concession road grid.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the present}} house {{was built in the}} early 14th century by Sir John de Clevedon. There is {{speculation}} that it may lie on the site of a Roman building, based on excavations to the south of the house in 1961/62. The house incorporates remnants of a 13th-century building which lie at an <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of the house. It was situated nearly two miles inland from the parish church of St Andrew, which stands on the coast.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 24 January the Archduke's army took {{positions}} east of {{the small town of}} Byczyna on the royal road leading into Poland. They felt secure in their camp, on the Habsburg side of the border, and did not expect the Poles to cross. Zamoyski marshaled his forces into three lines and was able to position them at an <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opponent's line.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the similar downy birch (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy birch are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The leaf base of silver birch is usually a right <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stalk while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are quite different but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E

When polarized light is applied {{to a group of}} randomly oriented fluorophores, most of the excited molecules will be those oriented within a particular range of <b>angles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> applied polarization. If they do not move, the emitted light will also be polarized within a particular range <b>angles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> applied light.|$|R

It is both the first mosque in Cairo to have such decoration, and also the first to have a façade which follows {{the line of the}} street, built at an <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rectangular hypostyle hall whose orientation is dictated by the qibla direction.|$|E
5|$|To {{steer the}} canoe in mid-ocean on a {{consistent}} course, the navigator selects a star and keeps the canoe pointed toward it. Should it become cloud-blocked, or rise too high in the sky, he selects another star but offsets his reference to remain true to the first, or steers at the same relative <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> swell as when steering toward the star.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.|$|E

5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind shear direction.|$|E
5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as the rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E

5|$|Most {{art historians}} {{believe that there}} are a number of {{indicators}} that the panel was the left-hand wing of a dismantled diptych. The frame contains clasps, implying it was once hinged to a second panel. The work seems composed to be symmetrically balanced towards an accompanying right-hand wing: Mary is positioned slightly to the right of centre, while her downward, almost coy glance is directed at a space beyond the edge of the panel, suggesting that she is looking at, or in the direction of, a kneeling donor in a right-hand wing. The visible architectural features – with the exception of the niches, the crucifixion and the windows directly behind it, which are at a right <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nave and centre front, facing the viewer – are at the left of the panel, facing right.|$|E
5|$|So-called superluminal {{motion is}} seen in certain astronomical objects, such as the {{relativistic}} jets of radio galaxies and quasars. However, these jets are not moving at speeds {{in excess of the}} speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc {{of the plain}} maskray is thin and diamond-shaped with narrowly rounded outer corners, measuring 1.1–1.3 times longer than wide. The leading margins of the disc are gently concave and converge at a broad <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pointed tip of the snout. The small eyes are placed close together, and behind them are the spiracles. The nostrils are elongated and have a skirt-shaped flap of skin between them. The small mouth bears prominent furrows at the corners and contains two slender papillae on the floor. Small papillae are also found around {{the outside of the}} mouth. There are five pairs of gill slits. The pelvic fins are fairly large and pointed.|$|E

5|$|The rules {{regarding}} the correct methods {{to display the}} flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their hoists should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted at an <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards {{each other and the}} flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables, lecterns, podiums or buildings, or be draped from railings.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends on the {{characteristics}} of the prevailing wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.|$|E
5|$|However, more conveniently, {{a pair of}} indices (n,m) is used instead. The indices {{refer to}} equally long unit vectors at 60° angles to each other across a single 6-member carbon ring. Taking the origin as carbon number 1, the a1 unit vector may be {{considered}} the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 3, and the a2 unit vector is then the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 5. (See the upper {{right corner of the}} diagram at right.) To visualize a CNT with indices (n,m), draw n a1 unit vectors across the graphene sheet, then draw m a2 unit vectors at a 60° <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> a1 vectors, then add the vectors together. The line representing the sum of the vectors will define the circumference of the CNT along the plane perpendicular to its long axis, connecting one end to the other. In the diagram at right, Ch is a (4,2) vector: the sum of 4 unit vectors from the origin directly to the right, then 2 unit vectors at a 60° angle down and to the right.|$|E
