25|$|The {{origin of}} the Martian moons is still controversial. Phobos and Deimos both {{have much in common}} with {{carbonaceous}} C-type asteroids, with spectra, albedo, and density very similar to those of C- or D-type asteroids. Based on their similarity, one hypothesis is that both moons may be captured main-belt asteroids. Both moons have very circular orbits which lie almost exactly in Mars's equatorial plane, and hence a capture origin requires a mechanism for circularizing the initially highly eccentric orbit, and adjusting its inclination into the equatorial plane, most probably by a combination of atmospheric drag and tidal forces, although {{it is not clear that}} sufficient time is available for this to occur for Deimos. Capture also requires dissipation of energy. The current Martian atmosphere is too thin to capture a Phobos-sized object by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking.</b> Geoffrey Landis has pointed out that the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated under tidal forces.|$|E

50|$|Vacuums are {{commonly}} used to produce suction, which has an even wider variety of applications. The Newcomen steam engine used vacuum instead of pressure to drive a piston. In the 19th century, vacuum was used for traction on Isambard Kingdom Brunel's experimental <b>atmospheric</b> railway. Vacuum <b>brakes</b> were once widely used on trains in the UK but, except on heritage railways, they {{have been replaced by}} air brakes.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{industry}} has produced high-temperature fiber and whiskers. The author examined the atmospheric reentry of the USA Space Shuttles and proposed {{the use of}} high temperature tolerant parachute for <b>atmospheric</b> air <b>braking.</b> Though it is not large, a light parachute decreases Shuttle speed from 8 km/s to 1 km/s and Shuttle heat flow by 3 - 4 times. The parachute surface is opened with backside {{so that it can}} emit the heat radiation efficiently to Earth-atmosphere. The temperature of parachute is about 1000 - 1300 C. The carbon fiber is able to keep its functionality up to a temperature of 1500 - 2000 C. There is no conceivable problem to manufacture the parachute from carbon fiber. The proposed new method of braking may be applied to the old Space Shuttles as well as to newer spacecraft designs. Comment: 7 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{movement}} of the artificial satellites of the Earth on low orbits is analyzed which are subject to resistance of a rarefied atmosphere. Temperature and density of terrestrial atmosphere at height of 200 - 800 km vary over wide range under influence of external conditions. The changes of solar activity are compared to variations of satellite <b>braking</b> (<b>atmospheric</b> drag). In {{spite of the fact that}} unequivocal dependence of the atmosphere density behavior from the considered physical factors of solar activity is not present, the attempt is done to find the characteristic periods in these processes. Some periods of fluctuation of an atmosphere density are revealed which can be harmonics of the basic period close to 27 days. Fluctuations of density with the period about 27 days have two close components, which reason is not quite clear. Probably, they are caused by rotation of the Sun and lunar tidal wave in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere...|$|R
50|$|As InSight science {{goals are}} not related to any {{particular}} surface feature of Mars, potential landing sites were chosen on the basis of practicality. Candidate sites needed to be near the equator of Mars to provide sufficient sunlight for the solar panels year round, have a low elevation to allow for sufficient <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking</b> during EDL, flat, relatively rock-free to reduce the probability of complications during landing, and soft enough terrain to allow the heat flow probe to penetrate well into the ground. An optimal area that meets all these requirements is Elysium Planitia, so all 22 initial potential landing sites were located in this area. The only two other areas on the equator and at low elevation, Isidis Planitia and Valles Marineris, are too rocky. In addition, Valles Marineris has too steep a gradient to allow safe landing.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} Mars's moons is unknown and the {{hypotheses}} are controversial. The main hypotheses {{are that they}} formed either by capture or by accretion. Because of the similarity to the composition of C- or D-type asteroids, one hypothesis is that the moons may be objects captured into Martian orbit from the asteroid belt, with orbits that have been circularized either by atmospheric drag or tidal forces, as capture requires dissipation of energy. The current Martian atmosphere is too thin to capture a Phobos-sized object by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking.</b> Geoffrey Landis {{has pointed out that}} the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated due to tidal forces. The main alternative hypothesis is that the moons accreted in the present position. Another hypothesis is that Mars was once surrounded by many Phobos- and Deimos-sized bodies, perhaps ejected into orbit around it by a collision with a planetesimal.|$|E

40|$|The {{technology}} {{requirements for}} the design of a generic aerocapture vehicle system are summarized. These spacecraft have the capability of completely eliminating fuel-costly retropropulsion for planetary orbit capture through a single aerodynamically controlled <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking</b> pass from a hyperbolic trajectory into a near circular orbit. This generic system has application at both the inner and outer planets. Spacecraft design integration, navigation, communications, and aerothermal protection system design problems were assessed in the technology requirements study and are discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} high-lift, winged {{atmospheric}} entry-glide vehicle by {{an early}} Mars manned mission lasting 14 - 16 months allows the effective use of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking</b> to decelerate upon arrival at Mars. Following nearly-constant deceleration, the vehicle skips out of the atmosphere into a low planetary orbit. The maximum atmospheric heating rate thus generated is {{of the order of}} 100 W/sq cm at the stagnation point for a fully catalytic surface; the corresponding equilibrium wall temperature was 2150 K. The vehicle envisioned could be radiatively cooled to an entry speed of over 8 km/sec...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} has concerned itself with evaluating alternative methods of recovering a sample module from a trans-earth trajectory {{originating in the}} vicinity of Mars. The major modes evaluated are: (1) direct atmospheric entry from trans-earth trajectory; (2) earth orbit insertion by retropropulsion; and (3) <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking</b> to a capture orbit. In addition, the question of guided vs. unguided entry vehicles was considered, as well as alternative methods of recovery after orbit insertion for modes (2) and (3). A summary of results and conclusions is presented. Analytical results for aerodynamic and propulsive maneuvering vehicles are discussed. System performance requirements and alternatives for inertial systems implementation are also discussed. Orbital recovery operations and further studies required to resolve the recovery mode issue are described...|$|E
40|$|The 80 to 130 km {{altitude}} {{region is}} our old ignorosphere, {{the region of}} the atmosphere that no one seems to be interested in and yet the critical region for shuttle entry and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking.</b> Comparison between the Air Force reference atmosphere and Shuttle Inertial Measurement Units data shows large fluctuations at high latitudes. New data sources are available now, such as the Arecibo and Millstone Hill ionospheric scatter radars. In the 20 to 80 km altitude range there is a reasonable quantity of data on the mean atmosphere, however, infomation on diurnal variability is needed. In the 20 to 80 km altitude range data is needed to identify systematic variations and models for the regions are preliminary. Unpredictable variations are observed: turbulence, storm effects, gravity waves...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of optimal and near optimal atmospheric flight trajectories for drag modulated aeroassisted orbital transfer is presented. An explicit and adaptive closed loop guidance approach for {{this mode of}} orbit transfer is also presented with performance near the optimal nominal trajectories. The orbital transfer of interest is for return from high earth orbit to low earth orbit. Most of what is discussed in this paper concerns the aeroassisted or atmospheric segment which lowers the apogee of the high earth orbit to the apogee of the low earth orbit. Minimization of the total impulsive delta-V at this low earth orbit apogee is the optimization criterion. Control about this impulse due {{to a number of}} potential error sources in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking</b> is the requirement imposed on closed loop guidance...|$|E
40|$|Future {{plans for}} the {{continued}} exploration of Mars call for a sample return mission. This plan proposes bringing a distributed, selected sample of Mars material from several locales on Mars back to earth. The mission options studied to date utilize an extensive number of aerodynamic concepts not previously planned in past planetary exploration programs. These include various modes of orbit modification using <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking,</b> aeromaneuvering to effect precision surface landing, very low ballistic entry for a network of surface penetrators, low flying hydrazine powered airplanes, balloons, ascent vehicles and direct entry of the samples on return to earth. This paper will discuss the concepts and their feasibility along with technology problems associated with them as surveyed from the reference material. The paper focuses primarily on the aerocapture technique {{as it relates to}} Mars orbit modification. Remaining orbit modification techniques are also discussed briefly for comparison...|$|E
40|$|Porous {{monolithic}} ablative systems insulate atmospheric {{reentry vehicles}} from reentry plasmas generated by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking</b> from orbital and exo-orbital velocities. Due to the necessity that these materials create a temperature gradient {{up to several}} thousand Kelvin over their thickness, {{it is important that}} these materials are near their pristine state prior to reentry. These materials may also be on exposed surfaces to space environment threats like orbital debris and meteoroids leaving a probability that these exposed surfaces will be below their prescribed values. Owing to the typical small size of impact craters in these materials, the local flow fields over these craters and the ablative process afford some margin in thermal protection designs for these locally reduced performance values. In this work, tests to develop ballistic performance models for thermal protection materials typical of those being used on Orion are discussed. A density profile as a function of depth of a typical monolithic ablator and substructure system is shown in Figure 1 a...|$|E
40|$|An Aeroassist Flight Experiment (AFE) is {{proposed}} {{to show how}} the use of an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking</b> device can reduce the perigee velocity of a vehicle upon its return from a mission to geosynchronous orbit. This braking device would be used to attain low earth orbit comparable with the STS Orbiter. The basic design of the AFE is presented and the guidance and control aspects of the design are discussed. The lifting-brake design selected for the AFE is a raked cone with a coefficient of drag of 1. 5 and a lift to drag ratio of 0. 3. The potential second flight of the AFE would have a ballute aerobraking device with a predictor/corrector guidance scheme. It is concluded that the approach described to implement the AFE is a feasible one and minimizes risk by having adequate margins wherever needed, by reducing error sources in sensitive areas, and by conducting an extensive simulation activity to verify the design...|$|E
40|$|Single pass aerocapture and aeroassisted orbital {{transfer}} {{designs are}} discussed for modifying spacecraft orbits using planetary atmospheres. Aerodynamic drag {{can be used}} to shift a hyperbolic flyby trajectory to a planetary orbit by having the spacecraft altering its in-plane L/D ratio to maintain constant drag until the desired velocity is attained. The spacecraft would then move out of the atmosphere, sometimes with a small propulsive assist. Sample missions to Uranus, Jupiter, and Titan are mentioned, with mission scenarios commencing with a Shuttle launch. Biconic-shaped spacecraft are cited as having the best L/D for insertion accuracy, a low hypersonic ballistic coefficient, and volumeric efficiency. Aeroassisted orbital transfer involves <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking</b> in order to shed velocity on a return trip from higher orbits. No decision has yet been made as to the spacecraft shape, but calculations indicate that aeroassist braking before return to LEO for rendezvous with the Shuttle has the potential for the lowest cost/mass to GEO of any delivery system currently under consideration...|$|E
40|$|Currently reentry of USA Space Shuttles and Command Module of Lunar Ships burns a {{great deal}} of fuel to reduce reentry speed because the {{temperatures}} are too high for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>braking</b> by conventional fiber parachutes. Recently high-temperature fiber and whiskers have been produced which could be employed in a new control rectangle parachute to create the negative lift force required. Though it is not large, a light parachute decreases Shuttle speed from 8 km/s (Shuttle) and 11 km/s (Apollo Command Module) up to 1 km/s and Space Ship heat flow by 3 - 4 times (not over the given temperature). The parachute surface is opened with backside so that it can emit the heat radiation efficiently to Earthatmosphere. The temperature of parachute is about 600 - 1500 o C. The carbon fiber is able to keep its functionality up to a temperature of 1500 - 2000 o C. There is no conceivable problem to manufacture the parachute from carbon fiber.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the solution for minimum-fuel, free-time transfer between coplanar elliptical orbits {{with the possible}} use of a planetary atmosphere to generate a decelerative braking force. The optimal pure propulsive two-impulse transfer is first considered. It is shown that the solution is obtained by solving a set of three equations for three unknowns.
