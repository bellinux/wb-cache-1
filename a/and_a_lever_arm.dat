40|$|INTRODUCTION There {{are many}} {{approaches}} to developing microrobots [1 - 3]. One {{of the more}} successful examples of "microrobots" is insects, which have articulated limbs. In 1992, Suzuki, Shimoyama et. al., introduced the concept of creating insect-like microrobots with exoskeletons made from polysilicon plates, and flexible polyimide joints [2]. In 1994, we continued in that direction by proposing a class of articulated microrobots using hollow triangular beams (HTB's) as links, microhinges [4] as revolute joints, and linear electrostatic stepper motors for actuation [5]. Figure 1 a shows a diagram of our proposed articulated manipulator, which consists of robot links connected by revolute joints. Figure 1 b shows {{a picture of a}} macroscopic remotecontrolled model of our manipulator with three HTB's. Figure 2 shows a SEM picture of an HTB <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lever</b> <b>arm,</b> each connected to a stepper motor. RIGID MICROROBOT LINKS A surface micromachined link, made f...|$|E

40|$|Summary: The EZLoc {{is a new}} femoral {{fixation}} device for soft tissue anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction that combines superior fixation properties (1427 N strength, N/mm stiffness, and high resistance to slippage) with a simple surgical technique. The EZLoc is composed of a slotted body through which the ACL graft is looped <b>and</b> <b>a</b> deployable <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> that rigidly fixes the graft on the anterolateral cortex of the femur. The EZLoc comes in a sterile package with a sharp-tip passing pin that is secured in the slotted body with a suture tied under tension. After the ACL graft is passed into the femoral tunnel, the suture is cut, the passing pin is removed, and the suture is tensioned, which deploys the <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> and fixes the EZLoc on cortical bone. The EZLoc {{can be used with}} both the one- and 2 -tunnel ACL reconstruction techniques, and is available in several length and diameter combinations that are for use in tunnels ranging from 20 to 60 mm in length and ACL grafts ranging from 5 to 10 mm in diameter.

40|$|Myosin V is a two-headed {{molecular}} motor that binds six light chains per heavy chain, which creates unusually long <b>lever</b> <b>arms.</b> This motor moves processively along its actin track in discrete 36 -nm steps. Our model {{is that one}} head of the two-headed myosin V tightly binds to actin and swings its long <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> through <b>a</b> large angle, providing a stroke. We created single-headed constructs with different-size <b>lever</b> <b>arms</b> and show that stroke size is proportional to <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> length. In <b>a</b> two-headed molecule, the stroke provides the directional bias, after which the unbound head diffuses to find its binding site, 36 nm forward. Our two-headed construct with all six light chains per head reconstitutes the 36 -nm processive step seen in tissue-purified myosin V. Two-headed myosin V molecules with only four light chains per head are still processive, but their step size is reduced to 24 nm. A further reduction in {{the length of the}} <b>lever</b> <b>arms</b> to one light chain per head results in a motor that is unable to walk processively. This motor produces single small ≈ 6 -nm strokes, and ATPase and pyrene actin quench measurements show that only one of the heads of this dimer rapidly binds to actin for a given binding event. These data show that for myosin V with its normal proximal tail domain, both heads <b>and</b> <b>a</b> long <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> are required for large, processive steps...|$|R

40|$|M 31 {{is a very}} tempting {{target for}} a microlensing search of compact objects in galactic haloes. It is the nearest large galaxy, it {{probably}} has its own dark halo, and its tilted position {{with respect to the}} line of sight provides an unmistakable signature of microlensing. However most stars of M 31 are not resolved and one has to use the "pixel method": monitor the pixels of the image rather than the stars. AGAPE is the implementation of this idea. Data have been collected and treated during two autumns of observation at the 2 metre telescope of Pic du Midi. The process of geometric and photometric alignment, which must be performed before constructing pixel light curves, is described. Seeing variations are minimised by working with large super-pixels (2. 1 ") compared with the average seeing. A high level of stability of pixel fluxes, crucial to the approach, is reached. Fluctuations of super-pixels do not exceed 1. 7 times the photon noise which is 0. 1 % of the intensity for the brightest ones.

40|$|Myosin II, the myosin {{which has}} {{provided}} the most biochemical and structural data, is dimeric consisting of a long coiled-coil region with the motor domain flexibly attached to the N-terminal end of the coiled-coil. The motor domain (subfragment 1, S 1, or cross-bridge) is obtained by proteolytic cleavage of myosin. S 1 is a minimal model for the transport of actin filaments by myosin. S 1 contains the ATPase, the actin-binding site which is regulated by ATP binding, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> long <b>lever</b> <b>arm,</b> which moves actin past myosin by a swinging motion. The <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> is buttressed by two calmodulin-like light chains. X-ray crystallography of S 1 and S 1 prepared without the <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> shows that {{the backbone of the}} molecule is a seven-stranded β-sheet. The active site is very similar to the G-proteins <b>and</b> contains <b>a</b> P-loop <b>and</b> switch 1 and switch 2 elements. Moreover,the motor domain can be found in three conformations that correspond with three of the four states predicted by the Lymn-Taylor cross-bridge cycle. The rotation of the <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> (power stroke) is coupled to changes in the relative positions of switch 2 and the P-loop after ATP binding. This rotation is reversed on products release (the power stroke). The movement of switch 1, which accompanies ATP binding, is coupled with an opening or closing of a cleft in the actin-binding site, which leads to large changes in the actin affinity. Myosin V yields crystallographic data on the strong actin-binding form of the cross-bridge. Strong binding to actin is accompanied by a bending of the central β-sheet, which enables products release and hence induces the power stroke. All myosins probably use the same mechanism...|$|R
