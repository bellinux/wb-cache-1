25|$|Even {{though both}} Junker Ove and Hilda suspect {{that they are}} in the wrong place in their lives as the story begins, they are not able to act on their own initiative. The dream gives Hilda <b>an</b> <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> this other life, and the dream by the hill gives Junker Ove an idea about the ideal woman, but it is the {{crucifix}} and the golden goblet, two Christian symbols, which reveal the truth of the matter. Christianity is to be thanked for the restoration of harmony. Junker Ove gets his Hilda, and the promise of gold persuades Sir Mogens to be united with Birthe who, in a modern interpretation, represents the young woman with the unruly disposition unable to conform to society's norms. She is handed over - troll for gold - to Sir Mogens in order to continue her life somewhere else completely.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. Útgarða-Loki appears, has his {{servants}} prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, Útgarða-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor {{says that he is}} unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that Útgarða-Loki will now speak negatively about him. Útgarða-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had <b>an</b> <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. Útgarða-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. Útgarða-Loki was in fact the immense Skrýmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skrýmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.|$|E

Yet, even before that, Italy received <b>an</b> <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> new music from across the Atlantic in the form of Creole singers and dancers who performed at the Eden Theater in Milan in 1904; they billed themselves as the [...] "creators of the cakewalk." [...] The first real jazz orchestras in Italy, however, were formed during the 1920s by bandleaders such as Arturo Agazzi and enjoyed immediate success. In spite of the anti-American cultural policies of the Fascist regime during the 1930s, American jazz remained popular.|$|E
500|$|About Presley's performance, Down Beat wrote: [...] "Let it {{be noted}} that Elvis Presley's latest, King Creole, is his best picture thus far--comparatively speaking, of course. Maybe about 10 more films (and as many drama coaches) from now Elvis might begin to get <b>an</b> <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> what acting's all about." [...] TV-Radio Mirror {{magazine}} praised Presley's acting over his past roles: [...] "Elvis Presley does his strongest acting job so far. Two years ago, Presley on the screen was a laughing stock. [...] But nobody is laughing now". Meanwhile, The Monthly Film Bulletin criticized the violence depicted in the film and rated the movie a III, denoting poor, stating, [...] "This entangled series of cliches, each with more unlikely motivation than the last, provides the most unattractive Presley vehicle so far. His numbers only offer intermittent relief from the calculated violence and viciousness, and he can do little to balance the disagreeable movie".|$|E

500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup {{reported a}} 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the event, based on 270 critic reviews. Just before {{the release of}} the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, [...] ""Trinity War" [...] itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, {{or any of the other}} elements the crossover was initially predicated upon." [...] After Justice League #23 was released, Schedeen added,"Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers to savor the high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. [...] "Trinity War" [...] may well emerge as the new poster child for everything wrong with that approach. In the end, [...] "Trinity War" [...] becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that Justice League #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling [...] "finale" [...] issue." [...] Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event [...] "cleverly weaving in threads set up two years ago in all related titles." [...] However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that [...] "the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It’s a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of these last few years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore." [...] Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt [...] "there are no true conclusions of any sort" [...] after the whole event, [...] "just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions" [...] added at the end of Justice League #23. As with Gray, Zawisza [...] "was hopeful DC's tactic of bleeding events one to the next would be over following the relaunch, but this issue proves – without <b>an</b> <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> doubt – that that is simply not the case." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eurogamer’s Oliver Clare noted {{a few minor}} game design flaws, {{which he}} {{attributed}} to [...] "Impact Games' inexperience with interface design".

He stressed that the game shows no bias, and holds an [...] "amazingly positive educational potential". Clare claimed he suffered viewing all the tragedies in the game, and {{that the first time}} he won the game, tears came to his eyes : [...] "For a few poignant moments you get <b>an</b> <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> what peaceful co-existence in the Middle East might actually feel like, what it might mean". Judy Siegel-Itzkovich from The Jerusalem Post had a similar opinion, stating that the game is [...] "immersive" [...] and that [...] "learning the background of this endless dispute could be very educational". Her colleague Calev Ben-David was impressed by the graphics and texts. He also appreciated the winning condition: according to him, setting a time limit would have been unrealistic.|$|E

60|$|The next {{traveller}} {{that deserves}} notice is the unfortunate Douville,[FN#16] through whose tissue of imposture runs a golden thread of truth.

Then again the lighter footsteps of the nurses, who had evidently been sent out of the room, when Sir Thomas went in.

40|$|Despite {{playing a}} {{significant}} role in defining the boundaries of manslaughter, the ‘gross negligence’ concept is notoriously indeterminate. There is no comprehensible and consistent means of measuring whether conduct is sufficiently gross to warrant criminal conviction. The gross negligence condition also sets the culpability bar too low by permitting the criminal censure of undeserving defendants who did not advert to any risk of death associated with their conduct. Whilst acknowledging the difficulties of distinguishing advertence from inadvertence in cases that straddle the margins of legitimate criminal punishment and accidental death, it is argued that punishment should only be meted out to those who are consciously aware, or at least had <b>a</b> conscious <b>inkling,</b> <b>of</b> the risk of encroaching on the victim’s legally protected interests. A reformulated offence that regards the defendant’s conscious choices as the true determinant of culpability is theoretically plausible and would inject the clarity, certainty and consistency that is required of a law that dictates the parameters of a serious homicide offence...|$|R

60|$|Not that in equivocal {{reference}} to the povertiresque old farmer Millthorpe, Pierre is here intended to be hinted at. Still, man can not wholly escape his surroundings. Unconsciously Mrs. Glendinning had {{always been one of}} these curious Optimists; and in his boyish life Pierre had not wholly escaped the maternal contagion. Yet often, in calling at the old farmer's for Charles of some early winter mornings, and meeting the painfully embarrassed, thin, feeble features of Mrs. Millthorpe, and the sadly inquisitive and hopelessly half-envious glances of the three little girls; and standing on the threshold, Pierre would catch low, aged, life-weary groans from a recess out of sight from the door; then would Pierre have some boyish <b>inklings</b> <b>of</b> something else than the pure povertiresque in poverty: some <b>inklings</b> <b>of</b> what it might be, to be old, and poor, and worn, and rheumatic, with shivering death drawing nigh, and present life itself but a dull and <b>a</b> chill! some <b>inklings</b> <b>of</b> what it might be, for him who in youth had vivaciously leaped from his bed, impatient to meet the earliest sun, and lose no sweet drop of his life, now hating the beams he once so dearly loved; turning round in his bed to the wall to avoid them; and still postponing the foot which should bring him back to the dismal day; when the sun is not gold, but copper; and the sky is not blue, but gray; and the blood, like Rhenish wine, too long unquaffed by Death, grows thin and sour in the veins.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} trend, between 1905 {{and the late}} 1920 s in UK and US child psychology, of ‘discovering’, {{labelling}} and calculating different ‘ages’ in children. Those new ‘ages’ – from mental to emotional, social, anatomical ages, and more – were understood as either replacing, or meaningfully related to, chronological age. The most famous, mental age, ‘invented’ by Alfred Binet {{in the first decade}} of the century, was instrumental in early intelligence testing. Anatomical age triggered great interest until the 1930 s, with many psychologists suggesting that physical development provided <b>a</b> more reliable <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> which grade children should be in than chronological age. Those ages were calculated with great precision, and educational recommendations began to be made on the basis of these. This article maps this psychological and educational trend, and suggests that it cultivated a vision of children as developmentally erratic, worthy of intense scientific attention, and enticingly puzzling for researchers...|$|R
