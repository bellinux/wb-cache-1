40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 60 - 63) During {{the cold}} war, the United States intelligence community {{was focused on}} addressing a specific intelligence threat: spies. One of the ways U. S. intelligence agencies alleviated this threat was by penetrating the adversary's Foreign Intelligence Services. They learned {{that this was the}} most effective way in countering the threat. After September 11, the intelligence community focused on addressing a new threat: <b>al-Qaida,</b> a <b>networked</b> based terrorist organization. Traditional counterterrorism tools are insufficient in addressing the new threat. The U. S. government is willing to bring to bear every tool at its disposal including the penetration of terrorist organizations. This thesis compares the infiltration of terrorist organizations versus Foreign Intelligence Services. It also discusses why terrorist organizations are much more difficult to penetrate and which methods that were previously employed against Foreign Intelligence Services are ineffective. This will enable the reader to realize that penetrating terrorist organizations require a different mentality as well as a tailored approach. Applying these conclusions will allow for more effective penetrations of terrorist organizations and minimal loss of life...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the post-Lisbon {{legal framework}} for the adoption of restrictive measures against individuals or non-State entities – so-called ‘targeted sanctions’ or ‘smart sanctions’. It is argued that the procedural differences to adopt targeted sanctions {{in the framework of}} the EU’s counter-terrorism activities (Art. 75 TFEU) and with regard to the implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (Art. 215 TFEU) increase the potential for inter-institutional litigation. This is particularly the case because the boundaries between the EU’s competences in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) and the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) are blurred. This is illustrated with the discussions surrounding the adoption of amendments to Regulation 881 / 2002 imposing restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with Usama bin Laden, the <b>Al-Qaida</b> <b>network</b> and the Taliban after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Parliament contests the adoption of those amendments on the basis of Art. 215 (2) TFEU and argues that only Art. 75 TFEU is the appropriate legal basis given the counter-terrorism objective of the measure at stake. This article discusses the different options to find an appropriate solution for this inter-institutional competence battle and argues that the Court’s new possibilities to rule on the duty of consistency may help find a way out...|$|E
