The method consists of an initial application of a limit concentration list, that certifies the contamination. Ascertained of the need to intervene, an absolute risk analysis is used to appraise the real contamination of the site and the reclamation objective. During this phase, it is often important to use specific mathematical models that, simulating the real behavior of contaminants in the ground, give all the useful information to elaborate a correct program of intervention...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an outstandingly innovative pilot project of collaborative urban design and integrated planning. 16 experts (architects, urbanists, geographers and economists) underwent a professionally designed and facilitated consensus construction process {{and developed a}} common project proposal for the reconversion and re-vitalization of Frunze 35, an <b>abandoned</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>site</b> in Kiev (Ukraine). In five days of intense work a multi-sectorial socio-economic and a multi-scale spatial approach led to a project proposal, that focused on history and heritage, activities, architecture, link to the surroundings and a feasible management model for Frunze 35. This experience is transferrable to collaborative urban planning all over Europe, whenever an effective participation and involvement of stakeholders, users and other interested actors are in demand...|$|E

40|$|The <b>abandoned</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>site</b> at the Sepetiba Bay (SE-Brazil) {{is one of}} {{the most}} heavily {{contaminated}} sites on the earth's surface concerned to Zn, but also presents As in alarming concentrations. Vegetation on this site is scarce and under the surviving species Pityrogramma calomelanos and Nephrolepis biserrata are the most abundant ones. Total As concentrations up to 2271 mg kg- 1 in P. calomelanos were determined, being this specie more efficient in arsenic accumulation than N. bisserata. The size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with UV-Vis detector coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to screen the distribution of As between different molar mass fractions. Highest concentration of As was found after extraction with TRIS-HCl, pH 7. 4 (about 60 - 100 % of total As) characterizing an association of this element with bioligands including phytochelatins and glutathione...|$|E
40|$|A {{stepwise}} {{human health}} risk assessment procedure carried out using American Society for Testing and Materials methodology {{was applied to}} three contaminated sites located in northern Italy: ail uncontrolled landfill. an <b>abandoned</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>site</b> and an industrial waste contaminated land. Two different tiers of analysis were performed {{by means of the}} analytical model RBCA Tool Kit and the numerical model API-DSS, respectively. The latter was applied according to both a deterministic and a probabilistic risk analysis. The comparison of the two approaches highlighted the great benefit provided by probabilistic analysis for the risk assessment based on site specific parameters and more complex models, in particular for groundwater exposure route. Finally, the risk-based site specific target levels were compared to the generic regulatory threshold limits fixed by the Italian regulation. The comparison showed the regulatory limits generally too restrictive for non-carcinogenic Substances but less protective for carcinogenic chemicals, outlining the need of a site-specific risk assessment especially for carcinogenic substances...|$|E
40|$|Zaha Hadid's Kartal Pendik Masterplan (2006) for a {{new city}} centre on the east bank of Istanbul proposes the {{redevelopment}} of an <b>abandoned</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>site</b> located in a crucial infrastructural node between Europe and Asia as a connecting system between the neighbouring areas of Kartal {{in the west and}} Pendik in the east. The project is organised on what its architects call a soft grid, a flexible and adaptable grid that allows it to articulate connections and differences of form, density and use within the same spatial structure [1]. Its final overall design constitutes only one of the many possible configurations that the project may take in response {{to the demands of the}} different areas included in the masterplan, and is produced from a script that is able to generate both built volumes and open spaces, skyscrapers as well as parks. The soft grid in fact produces a ‘becoming’ rather than a finite and definitive form: its surface space does not look like a grid, but is derived from a grid operation which is best explained by the project presentation in video animation. The grid here is a process of ‘gridding’, enacted according to ancient choreographed linear movements of measuring, defining, adjusting, reconnecting spaces through an articulated surface rather than superimposed on an ignored given like an indifferent colonising carpet...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} {{and management of}} <b>abandoned</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> (brownfields), which cover large areas {{of land in the}} Crişul Repede Valley Territorial Planning Unit, is a great challenge. Of the many <b>abandoned</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sites,</b> the glass factory of Pădurea Neagră was selected in order to highlight the peculiarities of a certain typology of territorial occupation and use, which is representative for the studied area. The whole abandoned area was reserved entirely for the glass factory, which now finds itself in an advanced stage of degradation. As a peculiarity, one remarks that it is surrounded by the neighboring secondary homes, an area in full expansion. The industrial zone covers {{a significant part of the}} built-up area of the village (21 %), preventing the development of the territory in question, while at the same time it creates an aesthetic disability for the small community which has only the perspective of tourism development. The revitalization of the community can be achieved through the rehabilitation/conversion of the industrial area, as a valid alternative to the inevitable urban expansion, as it will have a positive impact on the development of tourism. There are many destinations which could be gained as a result of the rehabilitation, but the most appropriate destination would be a multifunctional center of creation, accompanied by a small glass museum and a workshop that would produce small-scale traditional glasswork, for tourism purposes...|$|R
5000|$|Widespread {{appreciation}} {{of the importance of}} industrial heritage by the general public is still lacking in many areas, as the subject often maintains the perception of being [...] "not old enough" [...] to truly be considered archaeology. Additionally, there are often negative associations with neglected or <b>abandoned</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sites,</b> including the social, economic and environmental consequences ("brownfield" [...] sites). As with other history-based fields, one of the continuing challenges of industrial archaeologists throughout the world is the competition for ever-decreasing public funding for their research, educational and preservation projects. The sheer number of historic <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> and limited funding often means that many are still being lost to neglect, fire and demolition.|$|R

The possibility to remove metal contaminants, specifically nickel (Ni), by means of fungi was presented exploiting a set of fungal strains isolated from a Ligurian dismissed mine. The achieved results demonstrate the high Ni(II) tolerance, up to 500 mg Ni l- 1, and removal capability of a Trichoderma harzianum strain. This latter hyperaccumulates up to 11, 000 mg Ni kg- 1, suggesting its possible use in a bioremediation protocol able to provide a sustainable reclamation of broad contaminated areas...|$|R

50|$|Based on the {{residential}} planning concepts of Clarence Stein and Henry Wright, these fifty-two projects are architecturally cohesive, with composed on {{one to four}} story row house and apartment buildings, arranged around open spaces, creating traffic-free play spaces that defined community lift. Many of these projects were built on slum land, but land acquisition proved difficult, so <b>abandoned</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> and vacant land were also purchased. Lexington's two early projects were constructed on an abandoned horse racing track. At Ickes' direction, many of these projects were also segregated, designed and built for either whites or African-Americans. Race was largely determined by the neighborhood surrounding the site, as American residential patterns, in both the North and South, were highly segregated.|$|R

40|$|Dereliction {{tourism is}} {{the act of}} seeking out <b>abandoned</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> as sites of {{aesthetic}} pleasure, leisure or adventure. Drawing on research in areas of industrial ruination in Russia, the UK and North America, {{this article examines the}} role of the 'dereliction tourist' as a way of critically reflecting on the ethics of 'outsider' research. Ethical problems are associated with both dereliction tourism and ethnographic research in areas of industrial decline, including voyeurism, romanticization, and the reproduction of negative stereotypes about marginal people and places. However, both dereliction tourism and ethnographic research also share more positive ethical possibilities through offering alternative ways of imagining places and raising social justice awareness of issues related to deprivation and blight. Through considering the ambivalent figure of the dereliction tourist in relation to ethnography, this article advances a way of being in the research field through intrinsic ethical reflection and practice. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} argued that commodification of rural areas leads {{to a change in}} the rural economy from being based on exploiting the physical environment to being mainly based on exploiting the aesthetical appeal of rural areas. In this article, however, it is revealed that commodification of rural areas in Norway is closely connected with exploitation of the physical environ-ment, including through the re-resourcing of land from marginal agriculture and <b>abandoned</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> into second home developments. This re-resourcing has also been an economic driving force for related tourist, housing and infrastructure developments. Politically, it has significantly influenced local power configurations. Simultaneously, external and local actors are commanded by stronger environmental reg-ulations that govern the geography of re-resourcing. This article is based on studies of the municipalities of Ringebu and Kragerø, Norway, using analysis of plan-ning documents and qualitative interviews.

40|$|Industrial canal {{zones are}} those {{abandoned}} factory areas along watercourses {{that have made}} distinctive many areas {{at the edge of}} a consolidated urban structure. Nowadays, their originally peripheral locations have acquired central positions in the settled cities and they are targeted for plans of urban growth.

40|$|Modern {{industrial}} development commenced in many Chinese mega-cities after the 1840 Opium War with Britain. Industry continued to develop according to Chinese socialist production policies after 1949. Following {{the adoption of}} market economic practices throughout the late 1970 s and 1980 s, China’s industrial landscape began to dramatically transform. One consequence of this transformation is the rapid disappearance of industrial heritage through demolition, as obsolete factories are replaced by new industrial zones outside the city limits. Adaptive reuse of inner city industrial heritage for cultural purposes {{has emerged as a}} way to preserve China’s dramatic urban industrial heritage. This paper discusses selected cultural precincts in Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing which have been adapted from <b>abandoned</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sites.</b> Comparing the differences of the reuse patterns in the three cities, the paper analyses the local contexts behind the patterns, including the history of {{industrial development}}, the current remaining industrial heritage types, specific cultural context, and local government policy...|$|R

40|$|This book {{covers a}} range of topics that are of {{increasing}} importance in engineering practice: natural hazards, pollution, and environmental protection through good practice. The {{first half of the}} book deals with natural risk factors, of both natural and human origin, that should be considered: subsidence, accidental infiltration, soil instability, rockslides and mudslides, debris flow, and degradation of buildings and monuments due to pollution and climactic effects, for example. These problems are highlighted and it is shown that a combination of sophisticated numerical techniques and extensive experimental investigations are necessary in order to effectively tackle these problems. The second half of the book is devoted to the use of polluted sites and associated problems, a topic of growing significance given the increasing reclamation of land from <b>abandoned</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> for urban development over the last 20 years. Different types of oil pollution and decontamination methods are described, followed by a discussion of waste management and detailed coverage of confinement liners used in surface waste disposal...|$|R
