5|$|During the 1990s, Morrison {{developed}} a close association with two vocal talents <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> their careers: Georgie Fame (with whom Morrison had already worked occasionally) lent {{his voice and}} Hammond organ skills to Morrison's band; and Brian Kennedy's vocals complemented the grizzled voice of Morrison, both in studio and live performances.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams were}} {{competing}} in the Scottish First Division {{at the time of}} the final and despite being ranked <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the league table, St Johnstone in third and Dunfermline in ninth, both teams were in relatively bad form. St Johnstone had drawn seven games from thirteen and were nine points behind second placed Dundee; whilst Dunfermline had won only three games in thirteen and were two points off the bottom of the table. The match was the first time the clubs had met in the Challenge Cup, however, they had already played each other twice in the season in the First Division; both matches ended in 0–0 draws.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Russia, they settled into a 200-room palace (the former Baryatinsky mansion) at 46 Sergievskaya Street (today Tchaikovsky Street), Saint Petersburg. The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olga and Peter had {{separate}} bedrooms <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the building, and the Grand Duchess had her own art studio. Unhappy in her marriage, she fell into bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. It took two years for her hair to regrow.|$|E

5|$|For his {{voting record}} during the 2007 {{legislative}} session, Rice earned a 4% rating from the fiscally conservative Colorado Union of Taxpayers and a 100% rating from the environmentally-oriented Colorado Conservation Voters; both ratings placed him <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Democratic caucus from average Republican ratings.|$|R
5|$|While the river, its valley, and {{the rail}} line proceed south from North Cohocton, NY21 {{turns to the}} northeast, {{ascending}} out of the valley and finally crossing the county line, at this point bordering Ontario County. The route meanders across another area of hilly, undeveloped terrain {{to the village of}} Naples, home to the north end of NY53 and the south end of NY245. NY21 meets the two routes <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the community, with NY53 terminating south of the village center and NY245 beginning to its north. Naples also serves as NY21's entrance to the Finger Lakes region; the village itself is located in the southernmost part of the Canandaigua Lake valley.|$|E
5|$|Amundsen did not {{publicise}} {{his change}} of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's {{public and private}} funding was earmarked for scientific work in the Arctic; there was {{no guarantee that the}} backers would understand or agree to the proposed volte-face. Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the earth, to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{opens with}} two men fighting, {{including}} one of them being thrown to the floor by the latter. Stanlistening to the action from her houseleaves the place by car, following which she and her boyfriend are presented sitting <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a bed. The singer is eventually left by the male alone in the room, with him being shown entering a supermarket while Stan lays on the ground near a piano. Later, he gets back to her house again, but Stan closes the door in his face. Subsequently, she is portrayed traveling with a red car previously shown in the beginning, arriving at an old vehicle and holding a bird on her arm. Over {{the rest of the}} music video, the singer is shown meeting her love interest face to face two more times, including a performance of the song to a bar's crowd in which he is featured, sporting a white dress and head accessory. Her suitor ends struggling with alcohol issues. Scenes interspersed through the main video present the singer laying over the abandoned vehicle, and playing the piano in her room.|$|E

25|$|Spider {{fighting}} (Hiligaynon: pahibag sang damang; Cebuano: paaway kaka or sabong sa kaka; Mindanao Cebuano: sabong sa damang) is {{a popular}} blood sport among rural Filipino children, especially in the Bisaya region. The game begins by placing two spiders <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a stick.

25|$|A third complex {{consists}} of species with rather large, openly coiled to nearly planispiral shells with pronounced prickly sculpture and widely expanded outer lips; the shells are often strongly patterned. The group contains Abbottella haitensis, and Abbottella moreletianus. Bartsch (1946) broke Abbottella moreletianus into five subspecies. Zoogeographically, this group presents a problem: {{the two species}} occur <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the island (Thomazeau, Haiti and the Samaná Peninsula and environs). This group will be addressed in a future study.|$|E

25|$|Fowler got {{round the}} above problem {{by using a}} {{weighted}} cart with a pulley mounted beneath the frame. The cart had disc wheels that dug into the ground so that the cart acted as an anchor for the pulley. Two carts would be placed <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the furrow so as to pull the plough in either direction, and after completing a furrow, the carts would be winched to the position for the next furrow.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, Japanese cuisine {{has become}} quite popular.

Sushi and sashimi takeout began in Vancouver and Toronto, {{and is now}} common {{throughout}} Canada. The largest supermarket chains all carry basic sushi and sashimi, and Japanese ingredients and instant ramen are readily available in most supermarkets. Most mid-sized mall food courts feature fast-food teppan cooking. Izakaya restaurants have surged in popularity.|$|E
25|$|The White Star Line {{had long}} since broken that mould. As seen aboard Titanic, all White Star Line {{passenger}} ships divided their Third Class accommodations into two sections, always <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the vessel from one another. The established arrangement was that single men were quartered in the forward areas, while single women, married couples and families were quartered aft. In addition, while other ships provided only open berth sleeping arrangements, White Star Line vessels provided their Third Class passengers with private, small but comfortable cabins capable of accommodating two, four, six, eight and 10 passengers.|$|E

25|$|Near the {{southern}} end of Zermatt, the Matterhorn Express gondola transports passengers up to the interchange station at Furi. From here there is access to Schwarzsee via a gondola to the right, a cable car that leads on to the Trockener Steg midstation (and then on to the Klein Matterhorn), and a new gondola, opened on 18 December 2006, links Furi to Riffelberg on the Gornergrat mountain. This lift addresses one of the most persistent criticisms of Zermatt: that {{it is very difficult to}} ski the two sides of the valley without a tiresome trek through Zermatt between the Gornergratbahn and the Matterhorn Express <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the town.|$|E
25|$|During mitosis, microtubules {{grow from}} centrosomes located <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the cell and also {{attach to the}} {{centromere}} at specialized structures called kinetochores, {{one of which is}} present on each sister chromatid. A special DNA base sequence in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region. The microtubules then pull the chromatids apart toward the centrosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. Once the cells have divided, the chromatids are uncoiled and DNA can again be transcribed. In spite of their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which enables these giant DNA structures to be contained within a cell nucleus.|$|E
25|$|In 1856 Fowler filed {{a patent}} {{relating}} to {{a method of}} ploughing using two self-moving engines, placed <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the field and each using a winch to draw a plough backwards and forwards between them. This system did away {{with the need for}} pulleys and anchors, but was more expensive in that it required two engines, only one of which was working at a time. It is believed that Fowler persevered with his single-engine ploughing system because it was cheaper and he saw it as more affordable for average farmer. Eventually the double-engine ploughing method superseded the single-engine system that had won the prize at Chester. Because of its expense it was normally operated by contractors.|$|E
