5|$|Born to Cheryl and Doug McLeod in St. Albert, Alberta, a city near Edmonton, Erin {{was raised}} with her younger sister, Cara, and older sister, Megan. As a young girl, McLeod {{fell in love}} with hockey and the Edmonton Oilers. At the age of five, her family moved to Calgary, where she {{channelled}} her obsession into soccer. She quickly climbed the local soccer ranks <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> a midfielder on a Calgary select team. At the age of 12, the goalkeeper on the team was injured and she stepped up for the spot. She has been a goalkeeper ever since.|$|E
5|$|A {{cannonball}} {{from the}} second French broadside struck Corbet within minutes of the first broadside, the ball tearing off his foot above the ankle just as a large wooden splinter thrown from the gunwale struck the thigh of the same leg, shattering the bone. Corbet was brought below to the ship's surgeon where the remnant of his leg was hastily amputated and bound, and command devolved on Lieutenant John Crew Tullidge. At 02:30, Astrée pulled away from Africaine to perform hasty repairs, but Bouvet's guns had wrecked Africaines rigging, leaving the British frigate uncontrollable and largely immobile. Slowly moving ahead, Africaine engaged Iphigénie at close range but was counter attacked by Astrée <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> assailed on both sides, Astrée angled in such a position {{that she was able}} to rake the British ship, inflicting significant damage and casualties.|$|E
5|$|She then {{played in}} the three T20s held at Bellerive Oval in Hobart. The first of these matches was a curtain-raiser to the match between the Australia and West Indies men teams, {{and was the first}} match to be shown live on free-to-air {{television}} in Australia. New Zealand batted first and Australian fast bowler Ellyse Perry extracted an outside edge from captain Aimee Watkins from the first ball of the match. The ball flew straight to Healy's mid-riff and she dropped it. Watkins went on to score 44 from 36 balls as New Zealand made 7/117 and Healy's only dismissal was to catch Nicola Browne from Sthalekar's off spin. Healy came to the crease at 6/107 {{at the end of the}} 19th over and had scored three runs from as many balls <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> on strike for the final ball of the match, bowled by Browne, with Australia needing three runs for the win. The delivery was wide outside off and Healy's expansive shot took the outside edge of the bat and flew towards the vacant first slip area. It would have gone for a match-winning four runs but for New Zealand wicket-keeper Rachel Priest diving across and catching the ball one-handed in her right glove, handing the tourists a two-run victory.|$|E

25|$|After {{shakedown}} out of San Diego, General D. E. Aultman got underway 30 June {{bound for}} France. She transited the Panama Canal and arrived Marseilles 24 July, embarking troops, nurses, and Red Cross workers for the Pacific theater. The transport sailed 26 July via the Panama Canal <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> 1 day out of Balboa bound for New Guinea when the Japanese capitulated 15 August.|$|E
25|$|Zina Young {{joined the}} Mormon Exodus to the Rocky Mountains, {{arriving}} in the Salt Lake Valley in September 1848. In Utah Territory, she would raise her two Jacobs sons, her daughter, and the four children of Brigham Young and Clara Ross with fierce independence and strength. She resisted {{the loss of her}} independence as Brigham drew her, physically and socially, into his vast household, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> very lonely once there. She relied heavily upon kinship ties to her brothers and sister {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
25|$|Back in Los Angeles, Australian singer Glenn Shorrock (ex-Little River Band) {{asked her}} to provide backing vocals on his solo album Villain of the Peace (1982) and to join him on his {{subsequent}} six-week tour of Australia in 1983. Matthews decided to stay in Sydney at the tour's completion <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> in demand as a session vocalist and singing jingles. She sang on albums by Jimmy Barnes, Richard Clapton, Tim Finn and Icehouse. After singing backing vocals on Models' 1985 album Out of Mind, Out of Sight, she became a regular vocalist for the band. Matthews and Models' guitarist and vocalist, Sean Kelly, had an 11-year personal relationship. Other backing singers for Models included Kate Ceberano and Zan Abeyratne, both members of I'm Talking – the two bands often toured together. In 1986, Matthews joined Peter Blakeley and The Resurrection, with Blakeley (ex-Rockmelons) on lead vocals, Chris Abrahams on bass guitar and piano (ex-The Benders), Jim Benjamin on drums and Mark Punch on guitar (Renée Geyer Band). Her second album with Models, Models' Media appeared in December which reached the top30.|$|E

25|$|Williams {{is known}} for {{producing}} exceptional comebacks, particularly on the Grand Slam level. She has won three Grand Slam singles titles after saving match points, (the 2003 Australian Open final versus Kim Clijsters, the 2005 Australian Open final versus Maria Sharapova, and the 2009 Wimbledon final versus Elena Dementieva), a feat achieved more often than any other player in history. She also {{came back from a}} 3–5 deficit in the third set against Kim Clijsters in the 1999 US Open en route to her first Grand Slam singles title. In the 2012 US Open final against Victoria Azarenka, she was down 3–5 in the third set <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> two points away from losing the match. Williams then proceeded to win the next 4 games and defeated Azarenka. In the semi-finals of the 2015 French Open, Williams was ill and barely able to walk during changeovers, yet beat her opponent, Timea Bacsinszky, 6–0 in the third set. Another improbable win occurred in the third round of the 2015 Wimbledon Championships, when she recovered from two breaks of service in the third set to defeat Great Britain's number-one female player, Heather Watson. Williams has bounced back from a set down to win in 37 Grand Slam matches.|$|E
25|$|The women's singles final {{was played}} by then WTA No. 2 Ana Ivanovic, the 2007 French Open and 2008 Australian Open runner-up, assured to become World No. 1 on June 9, 2008 {{regardless}} of the result, and thirteenth seed Dinara Safina, the Berlin Tier I titlist, in her first ever Grand Slam final appearance. Ivanovic made the strongest start in the match, taking Safina's serve in the opening game, and once more at 3–1, to open a 4–1 lead in the first set. Safina started {{to take back the}} advantage, as she broke the Serbian twice and won her own serve to come back at 4–4. Ivanovic immediately recovered her break, and eventually kept her serve at 5–4, to close the first set on the score of 6–4. Ivanovic broke the Russian for a 2–1 lead in the second set, and continued to dominate Safina up to the seventh game, where she held double-break balls at 4–2. Af the end of this long game, in which both players repeatedly took and lost the advantage, Safina ultimately kept her serve, but the Russian was unable to attack Ivanovic in the following game, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> serving to stay in the match at 3–5. The Serbian pressured Safina, and eventually broke her a final time, to win the match on the score of 6–4, 6–3, after ninety-eight minutes of play. Both players received their trophies from the hands of former World No. 1 and 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007 French Open champion Justine Henin in the awards ceremony that followed, which crowned Ivanovic, a first-time Grand Slam winner, as the new Roland-Garros women's singles champion. Ivanovic became the first Serbian winner of a Grand Slam women's singles title, and the second Serbian overall after Novak Djokovic's win at the 2008 Australian Open. It would be the last time that Ana Ivanovic would feature past the Round of 16 at any Grand Slam tournament until the 2012 US Open.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Olivia {{attended}} a showing of The Land of Heart's Desire, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> {{moved by the}} performance. She wanted to meet the [...] "tall and black haired" [...] poet and asked Johnson to invite Yeats to tea on 10May1894, adding in her handwriting to the invitation, [...] "I shall be {{so glad to see}} you". In his Memoirs Yeats referred to her as [...] "Diana Vernon", writing, [...] "In this book I cannot giver her real name—Diana Vernon sounds pleasantly in my ears and will suit as well as any other".|$|E

500|$|For {{many years}} the LSO had a {{reputation}} as an almost exclusively male ensemble (women harpists excepted). Morrison describes the LSO of the 1960s and 1970s as [...] "a rambunctious boys' club that swaggered round the globe." [...] Before the 1970s one of the few women to play in the orchestra was the oboist Evelyn Rothwell, who joined in the 1930s <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> regarded as an outsider by her male colleagues. She was not admitted to full membership of the orchestra: the first woman to be elected {{as a member of the}} LSO was Renata Scheffel-Stein in 1975. By that time other British orchestras had left the LSO far behind in this regard.|$|E
500|$|In 1891, the Boston cyclorama, {{housed in}} the Cyclorama Building, was {{exchanged}} temporarily with the cyclorama Crucifixion of Christ in Philadelphia. When it returned in 1892, it was stored in a [...] crate behind the exhibition hall, where it was subjected to damage from weather, vandals removing boards from the crate, and two fires. It was eventually purchased in its deteriorated state by Albert J. Hahne of Newark, New Jersey, in 1910. Hahne displayed sections of the cyclorama in his department store in Newark beginning in 1911, and sections were also shown in government buildings in New York City, Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. In the Baltimore exhibition, George E. Pickett's widow, [...] "Sallie" [...] Pickett, lectured on her husband's experiences <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> very moved by the experience.|$|E
500|$|On May 18 of {{the same}} year, Alexander Berkman was {{released}} from prison. Carrying a bouquet of roses, Goldman met him on the train platform <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> [...] "seized by terror and pity" [...] as she beheld his gaunt, pale form. Neither was able to speak; they returned to her home in silence. For weeks, he struggled to readjust to life on the outside; an abortive speaking tour ended in failure, and in Cleveland he purchased a revolver {{with the intent of}} killing himself. [...] He returned to New York, however, and learned that Goldman had been arrested with a group of activists meeting to reflect on Czolgosz. Invigorated anew by this violation of freedom of assembly, he declared, [...] "My resurrection has come!" [...] and set about securing their release.|$|E

500|$|With Shadar defeated, Oliver {{prepares to}} return home, but the White Witch appears and casts a spell known as [...] "manna", an ash-like {{substance}} that turns all living beings {{in the three}} major cities into undead-like creatures. A girl named Pea, who has been appearing to Oliver on occasion, travels with the group and uses her magic to clear the cities of manna and restore the people to normal; the group then travel to defeat the White Witch herself. They discover {{that she was a}} young queen called Cassiopeia from thousands of years ago who had noble intentions, but was manipulated by her [...] "council of twelve", calling themselves the Zodiarchs, who desired to run the country. Feeling powerless, she found and used the manna spell, believing it would bring peace and prosperity to her people. When the horrific effects of manna were revealed, she gradually witnessed the death of all of her subjects, including the council, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> on her own; she was gradually driven to despair and became the White Witch, believing that all life must be destroyed in an attempt to [...] "start over". Her power created an illusory version of the council to oversee the destruction of the world, but the remains of her kind intentions also created the council member that helped the group by sending them back in time, as well as Pea, the incarnation of her as a child. Having been defeated, Cassiopeia fuses together with Pea and is restored to her former, kind self. After assisting the group in destroying the Zodiarchy, the last manifestations of the council, Cassiopeia declares that she will dedicate her life to making amends for her actions and Oliver bids farewell to his friends before returning to his old life in Motorville.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story is}} told by [...] "Thérèse" [...] in an inn, to Madame de Lorsagne. It is finally {{revealed}} that Madame de Lorsagne is her long-lost sister. The irony is that her sister submitted to {{a brief period of}} vice <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> a comfortable existence where she could exercise good, while Justine refused to make concessions for the greater good and was plunged further into vice than those who would go willingly.|$|E
2500|$|Bakari and her mother, Aziza Aboudou, were {{traveling}} to the Comoros for a summer vacation. Like many of the passengers of Yemenia Flight 626, they began their voyage from Paris, France on a different plane, which made an intermediate stop in Marseille and then landed in Sana'a, Yemen. There the passengers boarded another aircraft, an Airbus A310, for the flight segment to Comoros, with a stop in Djibouti. As it descended for its approach, minutes away from its final destination of Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport, the jet plunged into the ocean [...] north of the coastline of Grande Comore island, breaking apart as it hit the water, at approx. 01:50 local time (22:50 UTC). Bakari was ejected from the plane as it crashed, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> floating alone outside amid debris.|$|E

2500|$|Kylie Minogue reinvented herself musically in {{the first}} decade of the 21st century <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> faced with a renewed and {{increasing}} gay fanbase. She said, [...] "My gay audience has been with me from the beginning ... they kind of adopted me." [...] Minogue first became aware of her gay audience in 1988, when several drag queens performed to her music at a Sydney pub, and she later saw a similar show in Melbourne. Minogue felt [...] "very touched" [...] to have such an [...] "appreciative crowd," [...] and this encouraged her to perform at gay venues throughout the world, as well as headlining Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, the largest gay pride festival in the world. Her sister, Dannii Minogue, also has a large gay following and has been regarded a gay icon.|$|E
2500|$|At sixteen, then {{living on}} her own, Streisand's youth and {{ambition}} worked in her favor, but she lacked a mature woman's physical features which were needed for serious female roles. She therefore took various menial jobs {{to have some}} income. At one period, she lacked a permanent address, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> sleeping {{at the home of}} friends or anywhere else she could set up the army cot she carried around to save on rent expense. When desperate, she would return to her mother's flat in Brooklyn for a home-cooked meal. However, her mother would be horrified by her daughter's [...] "gypsy-like lifestyle," [...] wrote biographer Karen Swenson, and again begged her to give up trying to get into show business; but Streisand took her mother's pleadings as even more reason to keep trying: [...] "My desires were strengthened by wanting to prove to my mother that I could be a star." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the next}} two years, Maria’s aunt turned towards {{religion}} and charity work. Planning to retire from court and to form a religious order, Grand Duchess Elisabeth decided to find a husband for her niece. Shortly after Easter 1907, Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland the second son of King Gustav V of Sweden and Victoria of Baden visited St Petersburg and he {{was introduced to the}} sixteen-year-old Maria Pavlovana. She was plump, mischievous and proud. The prince was tall, thin, dark and distinguished looking [...] "with beautiful grey eyes”, Maria recalled. He stayed for dinner, and the following day, Maria was told that he wished to marry her. Pressed by her aunt to give a speedy answer, Maria agreed to the prince’s proposal <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> engaged to a man she had known for only few hours. The official betrothal was announced in June 1907 at Peterhof palace.|$|E
