5|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{activities}} for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately {{at a distance from}} the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, <b>and</b> <b>enhance</b> their performance in training and competition.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less than half a centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build <b>and</b> <b>enhance</b> reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before his}} {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand <b>and</b> <b>enhance</b> Belgian prestige.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space <b>and</b> <b>enhance</b> the image of the architecture in the surroundings.

5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to prolong <b>and</b> <b>enhance</b> the effects of psilocybin. Alcohol {{consumption}} may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because acetaldehyde, one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, Virgin America {{announced}} {{its intention to}} start flying to Toronto from Los Angeles and San Francisco, making it the airline's first international destination. Following the Department of Transportation's approval of Virgin America's proposal to fly to Canada, international service began on June 29, 2010. However, due to high operating costs and higher demand for Dallas/Fort-Worth, Virgin America terminated Toronto service on April 6, 2011. Virgin America began its service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in December 2010, and continued until after {{the repeal of the}} Wright Amendment in October 2014, which prompted the airline to establish a focus city at the Dallas Love Field <b>and</b> <b>enhance</b> the number of connecting destinations. As a result, Virgin America transported almost 31,000 passengers through Dallas Love Field in the first month, achieving 3.58% market share at Dallas Love Field.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} the Danelaw by West Saxon kings had united England in a single kingdom for the first time, {{enabling}} kings from Æthelstan onwards {{to see themselves as}} heirs of the Carolingian emperors; the regulation of monasteries by a uniform Benedictine rule was designed to unite the kingdom ideologically <b>and</b> <b>enhance</b> royal prestige. The monks depended on the king {{in a way that the}} local ealdormen did not, so their loyalty could be trusted and they could act as a counterbalance to powerful local families. The Regularis Concordia required that psalms be said for the king and the queen in monasteries several times a day, and specified that royal consent must be obtained for the election of abbots. The reformers aimed to enhance the Christian character of kingship, and one aspect of this was to raise the status of the queen; Edgar's last wife, Ælfthryth, was the first king's consort to regularly witness charters as regina.|$|E
5|$|The game's 21skills fall evenly {{under the}} {{categories}} of combat, magic, and stealth, and many skills complement more than one area. Combat skills are used primarily for battle and incorporate armor and heavy weapons like blades, axes, maces, and hammers. Magic skills rely {{on the use of}} spells to alter the physical world, to affect the minds of others, to injure and debilitate enemies, to summon monsters to help fight, and to heal wounds. Stealth skills allow the player to crack locks, haggle for goods, use speech to manipulate people, and apply cunning in combat (through the use of a bow or with a sneak attack). The spells, weapons, and other tools such that a player needs to employ <b>and</b> <b>enhance</b> these skills, such as lockpicks, can be purchased in shops, stolen from NPCs, or found as loot on the bodies of foes or in dungeons.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Final Fantasy VII, where a {{character}} could equip {{three types of}} equipment (weapon, armor and accessory), Vincent's equipment consists solely of his weapon, which can contribute to his armor rating <b>and</b> <b>enhance</b> his stats through customization. Vincent has three basic gun frames available to him; a three barrel handgun called Cerberus, a rifle called Hydra, and a machine gun called Griffon. There are also several different barrels available throughout the game; short, regular and long, with longer barrels allowing easier long-range targeting, but reducing Vincent's movement speed due to their weight. Accessories, which can {{be attached to the}} weapons, include a sniper scope, charms which can increase Vincent's defense and decrease the weight of the gun (among other things), and materia, which enables magic shots with special properties that use up Vincent's magic points. Ammunition capacity can also be increased through upgrades.|$|E
