It is the most laborious and sordid work I have ever come upon, and it takes every hour of my time and as much vitality as I can put into it. ... You can't know, never having done it, how such work does sap your poor brain and wring it dry of anything you'd like to pretend was there. I jump about like a squirrel in a cage and wonder how I got here <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> am doing it. I never in my life wanted to do this sort of thing. I have a clean conscience on that score. Then why am I hammering away at it, I'd like to know? I often wonder whether I shall ever write another line of anything I care to.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The {{plot of the}} episode has been criticized by some reviewers. Kyle Lemmon of Under the Radar gave the episode a three out of ten rating, concluding that [...] "this new episode is rarely grounded {{in any kind of}} reality. The best examples of The Simpsons center the situational humor in somewhat plausible scenarios within the town. I guess after so many years, they've completely run out of ideas." [...] Similarly, Television Blend's Jesse Carp wrote that the plot shows [...] "essentially what is wrong with the show <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> stopped watching. Because of the endless amount of material needed to keep a series running for twenty three years, they have to resort to outlandish plots and endless cameos to stay interesting. The best episodes,... definitely have some absurd elements but they're all firmly grounded in a fairly real world of Springfield, USA and its colorful cast of characters. I'd like to see more of that. I miss them." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright {{was asked about the}} significance of Bran witnessing the scene at the Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran knows why this is significant, but he knows that it is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've learned so far during his visions has been pretty big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad? And why have I been shown this? If I find out who the dad is <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> need to know who the dad is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E
500|$|... "WOW" [...] is an {{industrial}} dance song, and Manson has {{described it as}} a turning point for the album, explaining: [...] "The first half of the record is kind of bitter and angry, but there's a confidence that starts to rebuild itself [...] I wanted to do a song that represented who I am, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> started doing this in the first place." [...] Manson plays a one-stringed guitar on the song, which also features the sound of him [...] "snorting lines of something - whatever it might have been - as a percussion instrument." [...] In a review of the leaked demo, which was originally titled [...] "The WoW", James Gill of Metal Hammer described it as [...] "genuinely filthy and intensely sexy. [...] It doesn't have anything in the way of memorable hooks, but it's the sort of track that would sound amazing in a goth strip club... if one existed." [...] "Wight Spider" [...] is one of the heaviest songs on the album, and has been compared to the work of Mastodon. Metal Hammer also said of the track: [...] "whether conscious or not, what [...] learned from Trent Reznor is back: the track builds and builds without changing direction." [...] "Unkillable Monster" [...] is a down-tempo rock song which alternates between a quiet-verse and loud-chorus structure, and features layered, distorted vocals and guitars.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{critical}} and commercial success {{of her two}} previous albums, Jackson continued to receive numerous comparisons to her brother Michael, often with doubts that she held staying power in the music industry. When Edna Gundersen of USA Today questioned her about the subject, she responded: [...] "Certain people feel I'm just riding on my last name... That's why I just put my first name on janet. <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> never asked my brothers to write or produce music for me." [...] Virgin Records expressed the album title [...] "punctuates the declaration of strength the singer, songwriter and producer boldly expresses on this moving collection of songs which explore love, sensuality, the power of sisterhood and her own evolving self-identity." [...] Thomas Harrison, author of Music of the 1990s (2011) wrote that [...] "he conscious decision was made, by the company and/or Jackson, to put her into the same league as other one-named artists, such as Madonna, Bono, and Prince, {{or at least to}} put her on the same standing as others in the industry who are often called by one name, such as Whitney, Mariah, Diana, Dolly, and Garth among others. Jackson could now, in a sense, stand on her own and not be seen as a product of the family entertainment machine." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant magazine recounted the title of the album ultimately [...] "announced the singer as completely independent of her male-dominated family [...] it positioned her as the person in charge of her sound." ...|$|E
500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E

Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other.

2500|$|In April, {{the sisters}} decided to flat {{together}} but trouble arose with Brooke's flatmate's Bella Cooper (Amelia Reid) and Luke Durville (Gerald Urquhart) refusing to move out. Brooke ended up manipulating the two into relationship problems {{to get them}} out but ultimately helped the two and was at odds with Bree's antagonistic view of the couple. Brooke and Bree's mother Annette (Louise Wallace) returned in July 2012 and the cast enjoyed portraying the relationship between the mother and her illegitimate daughter, with Wallace stating: [...] "It's good looking at the back story and what happened in our relationship and where it all went wrong, why she hates me <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> don't give a rats arse about her. We are deeply flawed." [...] She went on to state that Annette would have never; [...] "anticipated having to deal with this part of her past, so it throws her a real curveball when she arrives and discovers Bree has firmly entrenched herself in Brooke's life" [...] and that; [...] "In some ways, Bree and Annette are more similar than Brooke and Annette, which really riles Annette." [...] Following her lack of respect from Annette, Bree held her captive and mentally tortured her. She decided that life would be easier as Brooke and started to adopt her personality, [...] "All she really wants is acceptance and love and, as we're seeing now, she's finding a way for that to happen by adopting Brooke's persona." [...] The storyline was compared to films: Fatal Attraction and Single White Female, though Blampied tried not to be influenced by them. The storyline climaxed in Bree, under the identity of Brooke, attempting to murder her sister and hiding her body in a storage container. Vinnie realised something was wrong and a search party soon found Brooke. Bree tried to escape but was mown down by a forklift. After finally accepting what she had done was wrong, Bree tried to make up with Brooke but ended up being sectioned to a psychiatric ward.|$|E
