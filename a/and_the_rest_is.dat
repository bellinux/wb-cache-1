5|$|In nature, free oxygen is {{produced}} by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>is</b> produced by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.|$|E

5|$|To combine glyphs, rongorongo employs {{consistent}} rules. First, the ‘defining feature’ of a glyph is identified, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>is</b> discarded. Then, this ‘defining feature’ is grafted onto a ‘main body’ glyph which retains most of {{its original}} shape (except for {{the addition of the}} ‘defining feature’). This is done {{in such a way that}} aesthetic unity is maintained. Typically, either one or two ‘defining features’ may be grafted onto a single ‘main body’.|$|E

Total toll income reported by Hrvatske autoceste {{in the first half}} of 2011 was 508.1 million kuna (68.3 million euro). This figure pertains to the A1 south of the Bosiljevo2 interchange as well as all other motorways operated by Hrvatske autoceste, however the A1 represents the longest and the busiest tolled motorway operated by Hrvatske autoceste. Toll income reported by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb for the first half of 2011 is 191.2 million kuna (25.7 million euro). This sum includes company toll income generated elsewhere, however the A1 section represents the busiest section of the motorway network operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb. Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb reported increase of the toll income compared to the same period of 2010 of 2.2% and 5% respectively.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>is</b> excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E

25|$|Although {{constructed}} with different systems, {{all of the}} buildings on the site give a common image and appear as a unified whole.

The other unifying element is the use of brick. All buildings have a base of about 40cm of black brick <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>is</b> built of yellow bricks.
