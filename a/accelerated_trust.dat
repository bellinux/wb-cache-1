40|$|Trust is {{critical}} for effective negotiations, yet trust violations are common. Prior work has often assumed trust to be fragile—easily broken and difficult to repair. We investigate this proposition in a laboratory study and find that trust harmed by untrustworthy behavior can be effectively restored when individuals observe a consistent series of trustworthy actions. Trust harmed by the same untrustworthy actions and deception, however, never fully recovers—even when deceived participants receive a promise, an apology, and observe a consistent series of trustworthy actions. We also find that a promise to change behavior can significantly speed the trust recovery process, but prior deception harms {{the effectiveness of a}} promise in <b>accelerating</b> <b>trust</b> recovery...|$|R
30|$|The {{uncertainty}} impacts the node’s {{anticipation of}} neighbour’s behaviour and decisions during communication; we include {{uncertainty in the}} trust management system. It represents whether a trustor node collected the required information from past communications with a trustee and its confidence in that communication. An efficient method to reduce the uncertainty is to exploit the mobility characteristics of the MANET. The node mobility can increase the propagation of direct and indirect measurements and hence <b>accelerates</b> the <b>trust</b> convergence.|$|R
40|$|Future Internet is {{expected}} to incorporate large volumes of diverse sensing devices organized in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and reacting upon real-world phenomena. Security has attracted significant research efforts converging to trust management systems, in which nodes trust establishment is based on both direct observations and recommendations of neighboring nodes (indirect trust). The exchange of indirect <b>trust</b> <b>accelerates</b> <b>trust</b> establishment, especially in mobile networks, at, usually, high energy costs. In this paper, {{the impact of the}} indirect trust exchange frequency on performance is investigated in mobile WSNs in terms of packet loss and energy consumption. We prove via simulations that, as the mobility speed increases, improved performance of the trust management system is achieved for more frequent indirect trust exchange at the cost of significant energy consumption. In order to alleviate the energy burden, we propose to limit the volume of the communicated indirect trust information a) by sharing only confident opinions and b) by piggy-backing indirect trust information in anyway transmitted routing control messages exchanged frequently enough to support the required mobility levels. As shown through extensive simulations, this approach doubles the network lifetime compared to the case of dedicated messages for indirect trust, while still achieving low packet loss.

40|$|This study {{examined}} how leaders can <b>accelerate</b> follower-attributed <b>trust</b> in {{the leader in}} a temporary group context, {{often referred to as}} swift trust. We proposed and found some support for the notion that static factors, such as a leader 2 ̆ 7 s rank, social similarity with followers, and performance record, would positively influence follower-attributed trust in the leader in a temporary group context. Furthermore, we proposed and found significant support for the notion that dynamic factors, such as a leader 2 ̆ 7 s positivity and a leader 2 ̆ 7 s use of individualized consideration and participative decision-making, would positively influence follower-attributed trust in the leader in a temporary group context.

30|$|Moreover, we {{find that}} two kinds of {{political}} participation, rightful resistance and grassroots elections, exert prominent effects on police trust. The significant correlation between grassroots elections and police trust {{can be regarded as}} an effect of grassroots election participation on the public. The public achieve higher discursive power on grassroots community affairs through participating in grassroots election. Both the urban community committees and village committees are grassroots autonomy organizations, but the latter is far more important than the former. Especially since the mid- 1980 s, elections at village level were massive and fierce and were far more competitive than community committee election in urban areas. Then, the next question is, why does the urban grassroots election <b>accelerates</b> police <b>trust</b> more than the rural area one does in our findings? Participation in urban and rural grassroots elections could be considered as a form of pro-establishment action, but the competitiveness of village election makes it more tolerant on villagers with anti-establishment tendencies. Thus, grassroots elections amplifies less on villagers’ police trust than that on urban residents’ police trust.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Hardware Trust is an {{emerging}} problem in semiconduc-tor integrated circuit (IC) security due to widespread outsourcing and the stealthy nature of hardware Trojans. Conventional post-manufacturing testing, test generation algorithms and test coverage metrics cannot be readily extended to hardware Trojan detection. As a result {{there is a}} need to develop approaches that will en-sure trusted in-field operation of ICs, and more generally trust in computing. We present a distributed software scheduling prototype, TADS (Trojan Aware Distributed Scheduling), to achieve a Trojan-activation tolerant trustworthy computing system in a multi-core processor potentially containing hardware Trojans. TADS is designed to be transparent to applications and can run on general purpose multicore PEs without modifications to the operating system or underlying hardware. TADS can, with high confidence, continue to correctly execute its specified queue of job subtasks in the presence of hardware Trojans in the multi-core PEs while learning the individual trustworthiness of the individual PEs. Specially crafted self-checking subtasks called bounty hunters are introduced to <b>accelerate</b> PE <b>trust</b> learning. Also, by learning and maintaining individual PE trustworthiness, the scheduler is able to achieve Trojan containment by scheduling subsequent job subtasks to PEs with high learned trust. I...|$|R

June, 17, 2011, Open University in the Netherlands (CELSTEC), Heerlen, The Netherlands. The central research question of this thesis is: How to inform trustworthiness assessments of virtual project team {{members in the}} initial phase of collaboration?There is common agreement that the availability of personal information and the possibility to interact informally {{at the start of}} a project <b>accelerates</b> the <b>trust</b> formation process. This goes for face-to-face as well as for virtual project teams. However, there is no shared understanding as to what information is critical for this acceleration and why it is so. Acceleration of the trust formation process is beneficial, as interpersonal trust is one of the key factors influencing performance in face-to-face as well as virtual teams. When little or no trust exists within a team, serious collaboration problems are bound to occur. Virtual project teams experience more problems with interpersonal trust formation than face-to-face teams. This is likely to be due to the diminished availability of information and its computer-mediated character. Once we know what information is important for trustworthiness assessments and why it is so, we could use it for the design of measures to accelerate the formation of interpersonal trust. To investigate the central research question we combined a theoretical (top-down) with a practical, design-oriented (bottom-up) research approach. We concluded our research with an evaluation.

30|$|In mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs), {{the reliability}} of nodes, quality of data and access control cannot be achieved successfully for various network functionalities through traditional cryptographic security, which makes MANET vulnerable to illegitimate node behaviour changes. These node misbehaviours, referred as soft security threats, need to be detected and prevented {{in order to protect}} against the accumulation of false measurements with selfish and malicious intentions. Trust has been employed as a powerful tool to handle the soft security threats and to provide security among uncertain and dynamic nodes effectively in MANET. Therefore, it is of great importance that efficient trust management mechanisms should be developed in a public key infrastructure (PKI), in order to verify the identities on the ad hoc networks for reliable and secure group communication. However, the independent nature of nodes and the computational complexities make the trust management a challenging one in MANET. In this paper, we present an efficient distributed trust computation and misbehaviour verification method with Bayesian and Evidence theorem, on hexagonally clustered MANET. Besides, a secured PKI system is designed in the paper by applying the proposed trust management scheme in terms of certificate revocation, which is an important functionality of PKI cryptosystem. The uncertainty impacts the node’s anticipation of neighbour’s behaviour and decisions during communication; we include uncertainty in the trust management system. An efficient method to reduce the uncertainty is to exploit the mobility characteristics of MANET that <b>accelerates</b> the <b>trust</b> convergence. The simulation results reveal a better performance against adversaries in creating considerable untrustworthy transactions with a mobility-aware cluster guarantee. Moreover, the proposed trust application shows its betterment in the revocation process in terms of revocation rate and time. Thus, the proposed scheme provides an effective security solution that incorporates the optimistic features of trust mechanisms and hierarchical Voronoi clustering.|$|R
40|$|Corporate Social Capital {{theory has}} been used as a prism through which diverse {{economic}} issues have been explored (Leenders and Gabbay 1999). This thesis draws upon it once again, to provide a framework for understanding the attitudes to business networking held by the owner-managers of Small to Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Northern Ireland. Using a multiple case study approach as outlined by Yin (2009), the research was conducted in Rotary clubs and golf clubs, which have traditionally fostered such exchanges but in secondary function to wider social welfare or sporting aims. Through the use of in-depth interviews the individual's opportunities to engage with others, motivation for doing so and ability to produce value from the interactions were explored (Adler and Kwon 2002). Respondents provided clear examples of when their business had benefited (or indeed suffered) as the result of their social network. The overarching themes emerging from the data are increased access to information that could be converted into competitive advantage and the <b>accelerated</b> development of <b>trust</b> among network members. This, however, was tempered by frequent mention of the ‘dark side' (Gargiulo and Benassi 1999) where an unpropitious reputation is easy to form but difficult to shed and the very idea of overt networking is still considered by some to be uncouth. The research identified five factors that impacted on an individual SME owner-managers ability to generate social capital, specifically: the location and age profile of the club and the gender/ occupation and personality of the SME owner-manager. This thesis provides a new perspective on the experiences of the SME owner-manager in a time of continued economic uncertainty. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} based on the field survey {{conducted}} in Sep. 2013 and the recent literature reviews. It aims to conduct research on biodiversity policies in Myanmar and to discuss about the role of Seed Bank, which preserves genetic resources of the country. We first reviewed the current status of Myanmar policy and governance of genetic resources and traditional knowledge related to agriculture and forest biodiversity. Myanmar has a total area of 677, 000 km 2 and stretches from north to south with different elevations from sea level to high mountains. The country is rich in biodiversity with forests covering half of the land and rivers. However, due to economic restrictions in the past and recent rapid economic growth, forest area has been decreased, which resulted in unstable supply of woods, their primary energy source, and in loss of biodiversity. Myanmar has been active in joining international agreements related to biodiversity even before democratization. Even though some national laws on natural conservation and forest preservation were enacted, there is an urgent need for steady implementation of policies and for enhanced grassroots activities, thus improving governance. Agriculture is the main industry in Myanmar. Due to loss of habitats, climate change and expansion of human dwellings, agricultural biodiversity is threatened. To sustain food security and economic development, it is necessary to preserve and promote Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA). The Seed Bank was established in Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation with cooperation with Japanese government in 1990. It now preserves 11, 916 plant genetic resources in short-term storage and 11, 676 genetic resources in middle-to-long term one. Finally, we reviewed two types of seed banks. The first type is mainly for management of genetic resources by governments, functioning more as a gene bank. The second type is aimed for promoting variety changes for the farmers at a grassroot level. The strategic roles of two types of banks and their complementarities are reviewed. The seed banks at local and grass-roots levels contribute to <b>accelerate</b> activities and <b>trust</b> building of international non-profit organizations. It is observed that international stakeholders started to strategically take advantage of the bank. 研究者情報D...|$|R
40|$|The only measure {{likely to}} halt {{violence}} in Indonesia’s Papua province {{in the short}} term is a major overhaul of security policy, argues this report. A spate of violence in Papua in May and June 2012 exposed the lack of a coherent government strategy to address this multidimensional conflict. Shootings of non-Papuans in the provincial capital Jayapura in June, likely involving pro-independence militants, were followed by the death of one of those militants at police hands, highlighting the political dimension of the problem. In Wamena, a rampage by soldiers after the death of a comrade shows the depth of distrust between local communities and the army, and the absence of mechanisms to deal with crises. The shooting of five Papuans by newly arrived members of a paramilitary police unit (Brigade Mobile, Brimob) in a remote gold-mining area of Paniai highlights the violence linked to Papua’s vast resource wealth and rent-seeking by the security apparatus with little oversight from Jakarta. While these events are still under investigation, they signal that unless the Yudhoyono government can address these very different aspects of the conflict, things may get worse. An overhaul of security policy would help. Two factors are driving much of the violence: a wide range of Papuan grievances toward the Indonesian state and a security policy that seems to run directly counter to the government’s professed desire to build <b>trust,</b> <b>accelerate</b> development and ensure that a 2001 special autonomy law for Papua yields concrete benefits. To date the law has failed to produce either improvement in the lives of most Papuans or better relations with the central government. Its substance has been frequently undercut by Jakarta, although provincial lawmakers also bear responsibility for failing to enact key implementing regulations. One of the last measures to prompt accusations in Papua of Jakarta’s bad faith was the 2011 division into two of the Papuan People’s Council (Majelis Rakyat Papua, MRP), an institution set up under the law to safeguard Papuan values and culture {{that was supposed to be}} a single body, covering all of Papua. In many ways the MRP was the keystone of special autonomy but it has been plagued by problems since its much-delayed establishment; the division, with Jakarta’s active endorsement, has further reduced its effectiveness. These problems would be hard enough to manage if Papua had functioning political institutions, but it does not. An ineffectual caretaker governor appointed in July 2011 has left the Papuan provincial government in limbo. Meanwhile, the organisation of a new election has been stymied by a provincial legislature that has focused most of its energy on blocking the former governor from running and vying in national courts with the local election commission for control over parts of the electoral process. The picture is just as grim at district level. This leaves the central government without an engaged partner in Papua, and Papuans without a formal channel for conveying concerns to Jakarta. The role of a new policy unit – the Unit for Accelerated Development in Papua and West Papua, known by its Indonesian abbreviation of UP 4 B – established in September 2011, increasingly appears limited to economic affairs, where it will struggle to show visible progress {{in the short term}}. Hopes that it might play a behind-the-scenes political role in fostering dialogue on Papuan grievances are fading, as it becomes increasingly clear that dialogue means different things to different people. Efforts to hammer out some consensus on terms and objectives have been set back by the violence, as the government is reluctant to take any steps that might be perceived as making concessions under pressure. The challenge for the government is to find a short-term strategy that can reduce violence while continuing to work out a policy that will bring long-term social, economic and political benefits and address longstanding grievances. That strategy must involve clear and visible changes in the administration, control and accountability of both the police and military. The security apparatus is not the only problem, nor are police and soldiers always the perpetrators of violence; many have been victims as well. But they have come to symbolise everything that has gone wrong with Jakarta’s handling of the Papuan conflict. It therefore follows that a change in security policy is the best hope for a “quick win” that can transform the political dynamics and halt the slide toward further violence...|$|R
