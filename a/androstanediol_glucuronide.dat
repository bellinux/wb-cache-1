40|$|Sex hormones {{have been}} implicated in the {{etiology}} {{of a number of}} diseases. To better understand disease etiology and the mechanisms of disease-risk factor associations, this analysis aimed to investigate the associations of anthropometric, sociodemographic and behavioural factors with a range of circulating sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin. Statistical analyses of individual participant data from 12, 330 male controls aged 25 - 85 years from 25 studies involved in the Endogenous Hormones Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group. Analysis of variance was used to estimate geometric means adjusted for study and relevant covariates. Older age was associated with higher concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin and dihydrotestosterone and lower concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, free testosterone, androstenedione, <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> and free estradiol. Higher body mass index was associated with higher concentrations of free estradiol, <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide,</b> estradiol and estrone and lower concentrations of dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, free testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Taller height was associated with lower concentrations of androstenedione, testosterone, free testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin and higher concentrations of <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide.</b> Current smoking was associated with higher concentrations of androstenedione, sex hormone-binding globulin and testosterone. Alcohol consumption was associated with higher concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione and <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide.</b> East Asians had lower concentrations of <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> and African Americans had higher concentrations of estrogens.

For each assay, estimates of components of variance were then used to estimate the coefficient of variation, the intraclass correlation between measurements on different days from a given individual, and the minimum detectable relative difference for a standard design. These data indicate that {{for at least one}} of the laboratories a single sample with two laboratory replicates per sample of <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide,</b> androstenedrone, DHEA, DHEA sulfate, and dihydrotestosterone yields an intraclass correlation coefficient exceeding 0. 80 and can be used to discriminate reliably among men.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether the absence of increased 5 alpha-reductase activity explained the absence of hirsutism in premenopausal obese women with increased free testosterone (FT) levels. DESIGN: As in hyperandrogenicity there generally exists evidence for increased 5 alpha-reductase activity, we measured, as parameters of 5 alpha-reductase activity, plasma levels of 5 alpha-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol glucuronide (ADG) and androsterone glucuronide (ADTG) as well as their precursor levels in obese women without hirsutism, obese hirsute women, non-obese hirsute women, and non-obese, non-hirsute women. PATIENTS: Eighty-two premenopausal women (20 - 45 years old) were studied, in four age matched groups: 39 controls, 18 obese without hirsutism, 11 non-obese hirsute and 14 obese hirsute women. MEASUREMENTS: Blood samples were taken between days 5 and 7 of the menstrual cycle. Steroid hormone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Free testosterone levels were measured by equilibrium dialysis. RESULTS: Compared to controls, mean free testosterone levels were increased (P less than 0. 01) in obese, obese hirsute and hirsute patients, whereas mean DHEAS levels were increased in hirsute and obese hirsute (P less than 0. 01), but not in obese, women. Mean <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> levels were markedly increased in hirsute and obese hirsute patients (P less than 0. 01), but not in obese women. Plasma androsterone glucuronide levels were increased in hirsute (P less than 0. 01), in the normal range in obese hirsute, and decreased in obese women (P less than 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that, despite the presence of higher free testosterone levels, neither 5 alpha-reductase activity (as suggested by normal <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> levels) nor adrenal androgen precursor levels (DHEAS) are increased in obese women without hirsutism...|$|E
40|$|Androgens are {{essential}} {{for the growth of}} the prostate gland and have been implicated in the development of prostate cancer. Little is known about the determinants of androgen levels in men, although observed ethnic differences suggest they may have a genetic basis. Several polymorphisms have been identified in the steroid 5 alpha-reductase type II gene (SRD 5 A 2), which encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to its more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone. Although some of these polymorphisms have been associated with increased prostate cancer risk, the association with circulating androgen levels remains unclear. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the association between the (TA) (n) dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the 3 ' untranslated region and the A 49 T polymorphism (which replaces the normal alanine with threonine at codon 49) in the SRD 5 A 2 gene and serum androgen concentrations in 604 British men. In particular, we wanted to test the hypotheses that the variant alleles are associated with an increased serum concentration of <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide,</b> a direct metabolite of dihydrotestosterone and a serum marker of 5 alpha-reductase activity. Mean hormone concentrations were evaluated in each genotype, and adjusted for age and other relevant factors. We found no evidence that the SRD 5 A 2 (TA) (n) repeat polymorphism was associated with androgen levels. Men who possessed one or two copies of the variant T allele in the A 49 T polymorphism had a significantly 24 % lower <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> concentration than men who were homozygous for the wild-type allele (P = 0. 0003).

40|$|BACKGROUND Recent {{literature}} suggests that high circulating vitamin D may increase prostate cancer risk. Although the mechanism through which vitamin D may increase risk is unknown, vitamin D concentration could influence circulating sex steroid hormones that {{may be associated with}} prostate cancer; an alternate explanation is that it could be associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration causing detection bias. OBJECTIVE We examined whether serum vitamin D concentration was associated with sex steroid hormone and PSA concentrations in a cross-sectional analysis of men in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES).

The hormones reviewed have been postulated {{to be involved in}} the aetiology of prostate cancer: androgens and their metabolites testosterone (T), non-SHBG-bound testosterone (non-SHBG-bound T), di-hydrotestosterone (DHT), <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> (A-diol-g), androstenedione (A-dione), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), the oestrogens, oestrone and oestradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin. The ratio of the mean hormone concentration in prostate cancer cases to that of controls (and its 95 % confidence interval (CI)) was calculated for each study, and the results summarized by calculating the weighted average of the log ratios. No differences in the average concentrations of the hormones were found between prostate cancer cases and controls, with the possible exception of A-diol-g which exhibited a 5 % higher mean serum concentration among cases relative to controls (ratio 1. 05, 95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 11), based on 644 cases and 1048 controls. These data suggest that there are no large differences in circulating hormones between men who subsequently go on to develop prostate cancer and those who remain free of the disease.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sex hormones in serum {{have been}} {{hypothesized}} {{to influence the}} risk of prostate cancer. We performed a collaborative analysis of the existing worldwide epidemiologic data to examine these associations {{in a uniform manner}} and to provide more precise estimates of risks. METHODS: Data on serum concentrations of sex hormones from 18 prospective studies that included 3886 men with incident prostate cancer and 6438 control subjects were pooled by the Endogenous Hormones and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group. Relative risks (RRs) of prostate cancer by fifths of serum hormone concentration were estimated by use of conditional logistic regression with stratification by study, age at recruitment, and year of recruitment. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: No associations were found between the risk of prostate cancer and serum concentrations of testosterone, calculated free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide,</b> estradiol, or calculated free estradiol. The serum concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin was modestly inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (RR in the highest vs lowest fifth = 0. 86, 95 % confidence interval = 0. 75 to 0. 98; P(trend) =. 01).

40|$|ABSTRACT: UDP-glucuronyl {{transferase}} (UDPGT) {{activity was}} determined for androgens in tissue minces and microsomal fractions from {{the liver and}} extrahepatic tissues (kidney, skin, prostate, and preputial glands) of the male rat. Liver microsomes showed the highest UDPGT activity {{with each of the}} androgens tested (t,, = 7, 3, and 10 nmol/minute/mg protein for testosterone, androsterone, and androstanediol, respectively). UDPGT activity (V) for androstanedial in the liver was 1 02 -fold higher than in the kidney and 1 03 -fold higher than in the skin and prostate. UDPGT activity for androgens was not detected in microsomes from preputial glands. Furthermore, no body site distribution was found for androgen UDPGT activity in skin microsomes. The Michaelis-Menten constant (K,,,) for UDPGT in liver microsomes was 20. 4, 12. 2, and 2. 2 MM, respectively, for testosterone, androstanediol, and androsterone. Kidney microsomes showed a K,,, of 19. 4 and 26. 9 MM, respectively, for androstanediol and androsterone. The K,,, for testosterone was very high in the kidney (138 MM), suggesting that it was a poor substrate. In microsomes from the skin and prostate, the K,.,,was very high (range 43 - 162 MM) for all three androgen substrates, suggesting that these androgens were not the preferred substrates for UDPGT in these tissues. These results indicate that the liver was the main site of androgen UDPGT activity and the skin and prostate formed little, if any, androgen glucuronides. These results suggest that <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> was formed primarily in the liver and may not be a reliable marker of peripheral androgen metabolism...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the hypothesis that}} serum concentrations of circulating androgens and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are associated with risk for prostate cancer in a case-control study nested in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Concentrations of androstenedione, testosterone, <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> and SHBG were measured in serum samples for 643 prostate cancer cases and 643 matched control participants, and concentrations of free testosterone were calculated. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios for risk of prostate cancer {{in relation to the}} serum concentration of each hormone. After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no significant association with overall risk for prostate cancer for serum total or free testosterone concentrations (highest versus the lowest thirds: OR, 1. 02; 95 % CI, 0. 73 - 1. 41 and OR, 1. 07, 95 % CI, 0. 74 - 1. 55, respectively) or for other androgens or SHBG. Subgroup analyses showed significant heterogeneity for androstenedione by cancer stage, with a significant inverse association of androstenedione concentration and risk for advanced prostate cancer. There were also weak positive associations between free testosterone concentration and risk for total prostate cancer among younger men and risk for high-grade disease. In summary, in this large nested case-control study, concentrations of circulating androgens or SHBG were not strongly associated with risk for total prostate cancer. However, our findings are compatible with a positive association of free testosterone with risk in younger men and possible heterogeneity in the association with androstenedione concentration by stage of disease; these findings warrant further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comOBJECTIVE: To use a large population-based case-control study to test the association between the common genetic variant rs 743572 (â 34 T to C), prostate cancer risk and circulating levels of several hormones. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A previous meta-analysis concluded that reported associations between rs 743572 in the promoter of CYP 17 A 1 and prostate cancer risk might reflect publication bias, but a few recent studies reported associations with prostate cancer risk and data suggesting that rs 743572 is functional. We genotyped 824 prostate cancer cases and 737 population-based controls, and applied unconditional logistic regression to estimate the association between rs 743572 and prostate cancer risk. We also used linear regression of transformed testosterone, <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide,</b> dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, androstenedione, sex hormone-binding globulin and oestradiol (circulating levels) measured for controls, to estimate the association between these levels and rs 743572. The linear models were adjusted for age and laboratory batch. RESULTS: Men with different genotypes had similar circulating levels of all the hormones measured (all P 0. 3) and grade (all P > 0. 3).

All subjects underwent a complete urologic evaluation that included prostate volume determination by transrectal ultrasonography and serum assays for androgens and estrogens. RESULTS After age adjustment, BMI (weight (kg) /height (m) 2) was positively correlated with increasing levels of <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> (AG), estradiol (E 2), estrone sulfate (E 1 S), and the ratios of E 2 :total testosterone (TT) and E 2 :free testosterone (FT); however, increasing BMI was negatively correlated with androstenedione (AD), FT, TT, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).

However, to date, there is lack of evidence on the association between serum inorganic phosphate (Pi) and sex steroid hormones. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between Pi, sex steroid hormones and a known Pi metabolic regulator, vitamin D, in men in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III). From NHANES III, we selected 1412 men aged 20 + who participated in the morning session of Phase I (1988 - 1991) with serum measurements of Pi, sex hormones, and vitamin D. Multivariable linear regression was used to calculate crude and geometric mean Pi by total and estimated free testosterone and estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> (AAG), and vitamin D. Similar analyses were performed while stratifying by race/ethnicity and vitamin D levels. We found a lack of statistically significant difference in geometric means of Pi across quintiles of concentrations of sex hormones, indicating a tight regulation of Pi. However, Pi levels were inversely associated with calculated free testosterone in non-Hispanic black men, with geometric mean levels of Pi of 1. 16 and 1. 02 Â ng/mL for those in the lowest and highest quintiles of free testosterone, respectively (p-trendÂ <Â  0. 05). A similar but weaker pattern was seen between total testosterone and Pi. An inverse association was also seen between AAG and Pi in men with vitamin D concentration below the median (< 24. 2 Â ng/mL). No associations were observed among men with vitamin D levels at or above the median. Our findings suggest a weak link among sex hormones, vitamin D, and Pi in men. The observed effects of race/ethnicity and vitamin D indicate a complex association involving various regulators of Pi homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Several studies {{demonstrate}} {{a link between}} diabetes and sex steroid hormones, but the link with pre-diabetes remains elusive. In this study, we hypothesize that pre-diabetes, which is characterised by having impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired HbA 1 C, may influence circulating sex steroid hormone concentrations in men. Thus, we investigated whether serum sex steroid hormone concentrations differ between men with and without pre-diabetes. We analyzed data for 1139 men who were aged 20 + years when they participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We calculated adjusted geometric mean serum concentrations of total and estimated free testosterone, <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide,</b> total and estimated free estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in men with and without pre-diabetes. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) of lower concentrations of androgens and SHBG, and higher concentrations of estradiol by prediabetes status. Adjusting for age and race/ethnicity, total testosterone concentration was lower among men with (geometric mean: 4. 68 Â ng/mL) than without (5. 36 Â ng/mL, pÂ =Â  0. 01) pre-diabetes. SHBG concentration was also lower in men with (31. 67 Â nmol/L) than without (36. 16 Â nmol/L; pÂ =Â  0. 01) pre-diabetes. Concentrations of the other hormones did not differ between men with and without pre-diabetes. After adjusting for demographic and lifestyle factors, pre-diabetic men had a higher odds of lower testosterone (OR: 2. 58; 95 % CI: 1. 54 - 4. 29), higher free estradiol level (OR: 1. 59; 95 % CI: 1. 14 - 2. 22), and lower SHBG level (OR: 2. 27; 95 % CI: 1. 32 - 3. 92) compared to men without pre-diabetes. These associations were attenuated after adjusting for adiposity (testosterone OR: 1. 76; 95 % CI 0. 95 - 3. 27, free estradiol OR: 1. 29, 95 % CI: 0. 88 - 1. 88, SHBG OR: 1. 71; 95 % CI 0. 88 - 3. 30). Our findings suggest that men with pre-diabetes have lower circulating total testosterone and SHBG and higher free estradiol levels...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the lifestyle and nutritional determinants of serum bioavailable androgens and their related hormones in men. METHODS: This study {{is based on}} a sample of 696 men {{with a wide range of}} nutrient intakes, whose diet and lifestyle characteristics were assessed with a questionnaire and serum sex hormones measured using immunoassays. RESULTS: Men aged 70 years or older had 12 % lower testosterone and 40 % lower free-testosterone (FT) and <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> (A-diol-g) concentrations than men who were 20 - 29 years of age. Conversely, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations were 90 % and 49 % higher in the oldest age group compared with the lowest, respectively. Men who had a body mass index (BMI) of 30 + kg/m 2 had 30 % lower testosterone, 45 % lower SHBG, 22 % lower LH and 5 % lower FT concentrations compared with men with a BMI of < 20 kg/m 2. Conversely, A-diol-g concentration was 15 % higher in the highest BMI category compared with the lowest. A high waist circumference was further associated with a 12 % lower testosterone and SHBG concentration, after adjusting for BMI. Compared with never-smokers, smoking 10 + cigarettes/day was associated with 15 % higher testosterone, 22 % higher SHBG and 17 % higher LH concentrations; FT and A-diol-g were not associated with smoking. Compared with no exercise, vigorous exercise of 3 + hours/week was associated with 11 % higher testosterone and 16 % higher SHBG concentrations, whilst LH, FT, and A-diol-g were not associated with vigorous exercise. Dietary factors were not strongly associated with hormones, although saturated fat intake was negatively associated with SHBG (r = - 0. 10; p = 0. 01) and alcohol intake was positively associated with A-diol-g (r = 0. 11; p = 0. 004). No dietary factors were associated with testosterone, FT, or LH. CONCLUSIONS: Age is the strongest determinant of serum bioavailable androgens. BMI and some lifestyle and dietary factors influence SHBG and testosterone concentrations, but have no strong association with FT, suggesting that homeostasis is effective. A-diol-g shows broadly similar associations to FT, with the exception of the effect of BMI and alcohol...|$|E
40|$|The {{human brain}} can be {{regarded}} as a target organ for sex steroid hormones. Hormones exert their influence via different pathways and sex steroid receptors are widely distributed within the brain. Several studies suggest gender differences in behavior and cognitive function and have stimulated research on the role of testosterone and estrogen. The overall aims of this thesis were to explore eventual effects of sex hormone treatment on certain aspects of behavior and brain function in postmenopausal women. A total of two hundred naturally postmenopausal women were recruited to four weeks of treatment with either testosterone undecanoate 40 mg/day, estradiol valerate 2 mg/day or placebo in a randomized trial. At the end of treatment, all women were tested to evaluate economic behavior (altruism, reciprocal fairness, trust, trustworthiness, risk aversion, risk investment, risk assessment) and cognitive function (verbal memory, verbal fluency, spatial ability). Blood samples were collected at baseline and after four weeks and analyzed for estradiol, testosterone, <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide,</b> oxytocin, sex hormone-binding globulin and insulin-like growth factor I. Treatment with testosterone or estrogen had no significant influence on economic behavior and cognitive function. Still, significant correlations between sex hormone levels and some aspects of cognitive function were found. High estrogen levels, a high estradiol/testosterone ratio and increasing estradiol levels during estrogen treatment were all associated with lower spatial ability. It could be that a specific balance between estrogen and testosterone is required for optimal effects on spatial- and verbal abilities. Also the estrogen/testosterone ratio and a curvilinear relationship could be important. Ten surgically postmenopausal women were treated with estrogen alone (transdermal estradiol 100 Î¼g/day) for three months and in combination with testosterone undecanoate 40 mg/day for further three months. The influence of treatment on the serotonin transporter binding potential (5 -HTT BP) in specific brain areas was studied by positron emission tomography (PET) using the special ligand [11 C]MADAM. Serum levels of sex hormones, mood and cognitive abilities were measured. Treatment with estrogen alone or in combination with testosterone significantly reduced 5 -HTT BPs in several cortical and limbic regions. Furthermore, hormone treatment significantly enhanced mood and cognitive abilities like letter and category fluency. These data provide novel evidence for the influence of sex steroid hormones on the serotonergic system in the human brain...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that male {{testosterone}} concentrations have declined over time. To explore this in a large US population, we examined testosterone and free testosterone concentrations in National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 1988 - 1991 and 1999 - 2004. We also examined sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), estradiol, and <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> (3 Î±-diol-G) over the same period. Non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American men from 1988 - 1991 and 1999 - 2004 NHANES surveys who were â¥ 20 {{years old and had}} serum from morning blood draws were included in this analysis (1988 - 1991 : N = 1, 413; 1999 - 2004 : N = 902). Testosterone, estradiol and SHBG were measured by competitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassays and 3 Î±-diol-G was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Free testosterone was calculated using testosterone and SHBG values. Adjusted mean hormone concentrations were estimated using linear regression, accounting for NHANES sampling weights and design, age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, waist circumference, alcohol use and smoking. Differences in adjusted mean concentrations (Î) and two-sided p-values were calculated; p < 0. 05 was statistically significant. Overall, 3 Î±-diol-G and estradiol declined between 1988 - 1991 and 1999 - 2004, but there was little change in testosterone, free testosterone, or SHBG (Î: 3 Î±-diol-G = - 1. 83 ng/mL, p < 0. 01; estradiol = - 6. 07 pg/mL, p < 0. 01; testosterone = - 0. 03 ng/mL, p = 0. 75; free testosterone = - 0. 001 ng/mL, p = 0. 67; SHBG = - 1. 17 nmol/L, p = 0. 19). Stratification by age and race revealed that SHBG and 3 Î±-diol-G declined among whites 20 - 44 years old (Î: SHBG = - 5. 14 nmol/L, p < 0. 01; 3 Î±-diol-G = - 2. 89 ng/mL, p < 0. 01) and free testosterone increased among blacks 20 - 44 years old (Î: 0. 014 ng/mL, p = 0. 03). Estradiol declined among all ages of whites and Mexican-Americans. In conclusion, there was no evidence for testosterone decline between 1988 - 1991 and 1999 - 2004 in the US general population. Subgroup analyses suggest that SHBG and 3 Î±-diol-G declined in young white men, estradiol declined in white and Mexican-American men, and free testosterone increased in young black men. These changes {{may be related to the}} increasing prevalence of reproductive disorders in young men...|$|E
40|$|The âLow Tâ {{marketing}} campaign has driven {{a dramatic increase}} in testosterone prescription in the last few years, particularly in North America. However, sales of testosterone are now falling again, as regulators, particularly the Food and Drug Administration in the US and Health Canada, have drawn attention to the potential cardiovascular risk of testosterone. Currently the role of androgens in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other non-communicable chronic diseases is controversial and unclear. Observationally lower testosterone is associated {{with a wide range of}} conditions including CVD, cognitive problems and depression. However, observational studies are open to residual confounding and reverse causality. Moreover, different androgen biomarkers tend to have different relations with these outcomes. This thesis examined the association of <b>androstanediol</b> <b>glucuronide</b> (3 Î±-diol-G), a correlate of the breakdown product of all androgens, with electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in a population-representative sample of US men. To minimize reverse causality, this thesis also used a separate-sample instrumental variable (SSIV) estimator to examine the effect of testosterone on several outcomes, including well-established CVD risk factors, Framingham score, ECG parameters, inflammatory markers and cognitive function in Chinese men. The associations of 3 Î±-diol-G and serum testosterone tertiles, with ECG parameters were examined in a nationally representative study of 773 US men aged 40 + years from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III phase 1 (1988 - 1991) using linear regression. For the SSIV analysis, a genetic rule predicting testosterone was developed in 289 young Chinese men from Hong Kong based on three selected testosterone-related single nuclear polymorphisms (rs 10046, rs 1008805 and rs 1256031). Multivariable censored and linear regression models were used to examine the association of genetically predicted testosterone with the outcomesin 4212 older Chinese men from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. 3 Î±-diol-G and serum testosterone were poorly correlated (0. 11) in US men. 3 Î±-diol-G was unrelated to corrected QT interval (QTb) or heart rate but higher testosterone was associated with shorter QT interval and lower heart rate in US men. Genetically predicted testosterone was unrelated to most of the outcomes examined in Chinese men, including blood pressure, fasting glucose, Framingham score, QT interval, corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula (QTf), heart rate, white blood cell, granulocyte, lymphocyte, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, delayed 10 -word recall score and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, but was associated with higher LDL-cholesterol(0. 02 mmol/L, 95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 04), lower HDL-cholesterol (- 0. 01 mmol/L, 95 % CI - 0. 02 to - 0. 001) and longer corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula (QTb) interval(0. 66 milliseconds, 95 % CI 0. 02 to 1. 31). The null associations of 3 Î±-diol-G with markers of cardiac function further suggest observations about endogenous serum testosterone may not indicate the cardiovascular effects of testosterone. Findings from SSIV do not corroborate observed protective associations of testosterone or correspondingly potentially protective effects of testosterone on a range of indicators of chronic diseases, but raise the possibility that higher testosterone might adversely affect lipid profile and cardiac function, with corresponding implications for cardiovascular events. Replication for cardiovascular events in a larger sample is required. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
