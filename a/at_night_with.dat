5|$|Despite its {{abundance}} in certain areas, the Caribbean reef shark {{is one of}} the least-studied large requiem sharks. They are believed {{to play a major role}} in shaping Caribbean reef communities. These sharks are more active <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>with</b> no evidence of seasonal changes in activity or migration. Juveniles tend to remain in a localized area throughout the year, while adults range over a wider area.|$|E
5|$|He {{notes the}} degree of {{artifice}} concealed behind the apparent simplicity of the imagery as everyday moments are captured. A piece of driftwood is tossed and broken by the waves; people stroll along the promenade; a group of dogs gather by the water's edge whilst ducks strut across the frame. A pool of water is shot <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>with</b> {{the sounds of a}} storm, and frogs croaking break the stillness.|$|E
5|$|The Natya Shastra (13.66) {{recommends}} worship to Matrikas {{before setting}} up the stage and before dance performances. Indra declares in chapter 90 of Devi Purana that the Matrikas are the best among all deities and should be worshipped in cities, villages, towns and shields. Matrikas are generally to be worshipped on all occasions with Navagraha (the nine planets) and the Dikpala (Guardians of the directions) and <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>with</b> the Goddess.|$|E

5|$|A big celebration {{is held by}} the city's {{population}} as the Simpsons are officially evicted from Springfield. When the family drives out {{into the middle of}} nowhere <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>with</b> no place to stay, they come across a man who takes them to a county called The Outlands, which is a dirty, run-down place where there are no rules and regulations. The Simpsons settle in The Outlands and meet Julian Assange—their unfriendly next-door neighbor who operates the WikiLeaks Headquarters there.|$|E
5|$|During migration, {{the song}} thrush travels mainly <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>with</b> {{a strong and}} direct flight action. It flies in loose flocks which cross the sea on a broad front rather than concentrating at short {{crossings}} (as occurs in the migration of large soaring birds), and calls frequently to maintain contact. Migration may start as early as late August in the most easterly and northerly parts of the range, {{but the majority of}} birds, with shorter distances to cover, head south from September to mid-December. However, hard weather may force further movement. Return migration varies between mid-February around the Mediterranean to May in northern Sweden and central Siberia. Vagrants have been recorded in Greenland, various Atlantic islands, and West Africa.|$|E

5|$|Flowering {{begins in}} February {{and is usually}} {{finished}} {{by the end of}} June. The species has an unusually low rate of flowering: even at the peak of its flowering season, it averages less than seven inflorescences per plant flowering at any one time. Individual flowers open sequentially from bottom to top within each inflorescence, the rate varying with the time of day: more flowers open during the day than <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>with</b> a peak rate of around two to three florets per hour during the first few hours of daylight, when honeyeater foraging is also at its peak.|$|E
5|$|Jomfru Ane Gade (literally Virgin Anne's Street) {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous streets in Aalborg if not in Denmark. Popular for its cafés and {{restaurants}} during the day, it is even busier <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>with</b> its clubs, discos and bars. During the 1990s, the street was infamously a 'hang out' of two biker gangs who were at war for some years all over Scandinavia. As the bikers disappeared it became increasingly popular for people of all ages. The pedestrian hubs of Nytorv Square and John F. Kennedy Square in the central city area are also part of the cityscape.|$|E
5|$|Julian Carlton was a 31-year-old man {{who came}} {{to work as a}} chef and servant at Taliesin for the summer. Carlton was an Afro-Caribbean of West Indian descent, ostensibly from Barbados. He was {{recommended}} to Wright by John Vogelsong, Jr., the caterer for the Midway Gardens project. Carlton and his wife Gertrude had previously served in the house of Vogelsong's parents in Chicago. Originally a genial presence on the estate, Carlton grew increasingly paranoid. He stayed up late <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>with</b> a butcher knife, looking out the window. This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick, who issued an ad in a local paper for a replacement cook. Carlton was given notice that August 15, 1914 would be his last day in their employ.|$|E

5|$|On 18 April 1943, a Royal Air Force {{breakdown}} lorry {{heading to the}} airfield at Ta' Qali <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>with</b> no street light hit the arch and severely damaged its Santa Venera-facing façade. The central arch was dismantled by military personnel {{under the supervision of}} the Public Works Department about two months later. The arch was completely destroyed on 12 February 1944, when a Royal Army Service Corps truck hit the remaining parts of the structure. The stone remains were supposedly stored by the British but, similar to several other historic relics, they were never retrieved by the Maltese and the whereabouts are unknown. However, the arch's two marble plaques were repossessed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the edge}} of the Munassib Depression, Bertram risked a double bluff. From 15 October 1942, a week before the attack, Camouflage {{constructed}} three and a half dummy field regiments of artillery. They were carefully made to appear seriously camouflaged, but day by day, they were maintained less and less well, to allow the enemy to decide it was facing dummy guns at Munassib. When the real battle had begun, the dummies were replaced <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>with</b> real artillery, which then kept utterly still for a day. An Axis tank attack on Munassib was shocked to find itself being fired on by the massed 'dummy' guns.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} of {{the film}} began in New York City on July 2, 2012, and lasted for 23 days. Carney chose to film in Manhattan's lesser known neighborhoods {{that would be more}} recognizable to locals than tourists. Specific locations included Greenwich Village, the East Village, Times Square, and Washington Square Park. Rather than performing live during filming, the actors sang to pre-recorded tracks. In order to save money on hiring a full crew and extras, some scenes—including one in Times Square—were shot late <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>with</b> a handheld camera. The rooftop location near the Empire State Building is located at 28 W 36th St.|$|E

5|$|The city of Nagasaki {{had been}} one of the largest {{seaports}} in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of , ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The four largest companies in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90% of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90% of the city's industry. Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>with</b> AN/APQ-13 radar.|$|E
5|$|When the 4th Division was relieved, {{they were}} sent to the Saint-Mihiel area, where they would {{undertake}} a small support role. Major Middleton was given the task of directing the unit's transport, complicated by the requirement to move <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>with</b> equipment and personnel to be drawn by horse and mule. After Saint-Mihiel, the unit was moved to Verdun where hundreds of thousands of French and Germans had become casualties earlier in the war. This would become the last major engagement of the First World War for Middleton, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 17 September, shortly before the commencement of the operation, called the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.|$|E

5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>with</b> extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{innovations}} in business {{caused by the}} use of the nickel in coin-operated machines was the automat, in which patrons would serve themselves by inserting a coin (initially a nickel, though by the 1950s a higher denomination was needed) into a mechanism, turning a handle, and removing a sandwich or dessert. These restaurants were first established in Germany, but were popularized in the United States by, among other firms, Horn & Hardart. A type of business which took its name from the coin was the nickelodeon cinema, where a nickel bought admission to view a series of one-reel short films, generally about 12minutes in length, which ran continuously from early afternoon until late <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>with</b> the patron free to remain as long as he liked. Although another denomination gave the penny arcade its name, the nickel was commonly used there as well.|$|E
5|$|At the conference, {{in light}} of the little {{information}} available on Egyptian dispositions and intentions, and due to a shortage of infantry and artillery, the commanders agreed they could not relieve the surrounded strongpoints on the canal in the near future. There was a general consensus to attack Egyptian forces throwing them off balance, but disagreed on how to do so. Southern Command expected to have 640 tanks on Monday October 8, of which 530 tanks would be distributed among three divisions: 200 tanks under Adan, 180 under Sharon, and 150 under Mandler after part of his losses were replaced. Estimates put the number of Egyptian tanks at 400, when there were in fact 800 tanks across the canal by Sunday evening. In light of the apparent superiority, Gonen recommended a frontal attack <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>with</b> Adan's 162nd Division crossing to the west bank at El-Qantarah and Sharon's 143rd Division crossing into Suez City. Adan however, lacking infantry, urged a cautious approach until more reserves reached the front.|$|E
