5000|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>disinsection</b> {{is the use}} of {{insecticide}} {{on international}} flights and in other closed spaces for insect and disease control. Confusion with disinfection, the elimination of microbes on surfaces, is not uncommon. Insect vectors of disease, mostly mosquitoes, have been introduced into and become indigenous in geographic areas where they were not previously present. Dengue, chikungunya and Zika spread across the Pacific and into the Americas by means of the airline networks. Cases of [...] "airport malaria", in which live malaria-carrying mosquitoes disembark and infect people near the airport, may increase with global warming.|$|E

40|$|A general {{discussion}} {{of the problem of}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>disinsection</b> is presented. The weaknesses of the present aerosol method, the limitations imposed by airline operators, government officials, passengers, and others, and the potential value of insecticidal vapours as a means of <b>aircraft</b> <b>disinsection</b> are discussed. An apparatus is described for screening insecticides for their vapour toxicity to houseflies and mosquitos. This apparatus led to the discovery of DDVP (O,O-dimethyl- 2, 2 -dichlorovinyl phosphate) and its remarkable vapour toxicity to insects, and to the subsequent studies of its potential use in the vapour state for <b>aircraft</b> <b>disinsection...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>disinsection</b> with aerosol {{insecticides}} during flight {{has generally}} been held to be inadvisable because {{it was assumed that}} the insecticides would be rapidly removed by the cabin air-conditioning system. We have developed protocols to deliver 2 % d-phenothrin at a dose of 35 g per 100 m 3 in various aircraft, and trials undertaken on Boeing 747 and 767 aircraft showed that their air-conditioning systems do not preclude effective disinsection. Mortality levels of 100 % for Culex quinquefasciatus and Musca domestica test insects were recorded under normal operating conditions during routine scheduled passenger flights with disinsection procedures undertaken at "blocks-away" or at "top-of-descent". As a result, "top-of-descent" disinsection has been introduced as the recommended procedure for aircraft landing in Australia...|$|E
40|$|A {{serious problem}} is {{posed by the}} {{inadvertent}} transport of live mosquitoes aboard aircraft arriving from tropical countries where vector-borne diseases are endemic. Surveys at international airports have found many instances of live insects, particularly mosquitoes, aboard aircraft arriving from countries where malaria and arboviruses are endemic. In some instances mosquito species have been established in countries {{in which they have}} not previously been reported. A serious consequence of the transport of infected mosquitoes aboard aircraft has been the numerous cases of "airport malaria" reported from Europe, North America and elsewhere. There is an important on-going need for the disinsection of aircraft coming from airports in tropical disease endemic areas into nonendemic areas. The methods and materials available for use in <b>aircraft</b> <b>disinsection</b> and the WHO recommendations for their use are described...|$|E
40|$|Pest control {{operations}} need to {{be carried}} out in aircrafts to prevent insect-transmitted diseases in humans and to control the spreading of insect vectors. Measurement were done in the passenger cabin during application on biocide-containing aerosolsprays using different methods for <b>aircraft</b> <b>disinsection</b> (in-flight-spraying method and pre-embarkation method). Concentrations in the air were 21 µg/m 3 for pyrethrins (285 µg/m 3 piperonyl butoxide) and 133 to 203 µg/m 3 for d-phenothrin (results of air measurements during spraying and 40 min afterwards). Within 20 to 40 min after spraying d-phenothrin concentration of about 1 µg/m 3 were detectable (pre-embarkation method). Concentrations (median values) found on seats, head rests, and floor varied between 24 and 39 ng/cm 2 (pyrethrins), 144 and 233 ng/cm 2 (piperonal butoxide), and 96 and 1159 ng/cm 2 (d-phenothrin) ...|$|E
40|$|Pest control {{operations}} in aircrafts {{are necessary to}} prevent the spreading of insect-transmitted infectious diseases. However, if pesticides are used in flight as sprays health disorders in passengers and crew members cannot be excluded. Measurements were taken during application of different disinsection sprays using the "top-of-descent" technique simulated at ground level in parked aircrafts. Concentrations in the air (during spraying and 40 minutes afterwards) were 21 µg/m 3 / 285 µg/m 3 for pyrethrins/piperonyl butoxide (median values with SRA spray) and 133 µg/m 3 (224 µg/m 3) for d-phenothrin after use on Aircraft Disinsectant Denka (Arrow <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Disinsection</b> Spray). Maximum amounts inhaled were calculated to be 17 - 200 µg. Concentrations found on interior surfaces differed widely. On vertical surfaces (walls, folding tables, overhead bins) median values varied between <= 2 ng/cm 2 and <= 17 ng/cm 2. Concentrations (median values) on seats, headrests and floor were 24 - 39 ng/cm² (pyrethrins), 144 - 233 ng/cm 2 (piperonyl butoxide) and 219 - 1005 ng/cm 2 (d-phenothrin) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{introduction}} of West Nile virus (WNV) to Hawaii could have severe impacts on human health, wildlife health and, as a result, Hawaii’s tourism-based economy. To provide guidance for management agencies seeking {{to prevent the}} {{introduction of}} WNV, we performed a quantitative assessment of the pathways by which WNV could reach Hawaii from North America. We estimated the rate of infectious individuals reaching Hawaii by the following means (1) humans on aircraft, (2) wind-transported mosquitoes, (3) human-transported mosquitoes, (4) human-transported birds or other vertebrates, and (5) migratory birds. We found that pathways 3 and 4 represented the highest risk. We estimated that each year, 7 – 70 WNV infectious mosquitoes will reach Hawaii by airplane when WNV becomes well established in the Western U. S. Exemp-tions in current quarantine regulations will also result in the import of birds that will be infectious with WNV for 0. 3 – 2. 2 bird-days each year. We propose actions that would substantially {{reduce the risk of}} WNV reaching Hawaii by these means, including reinstating <b>aircraft</b> <b>disinsection</b> in cargo holds and altering bird quarantine rules. Finally, research is urgently needed to determine whether a migratory bird can survive the migration from North America to Hawaii with a viremic WNV infection...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{expansion}} of global travel {{has resulted in}} the importation of African Anopheles mosquitoes, giving rise to cases of local malaria transmission. Here, cases of ‘airport malaria’ are used to quantify, using a combination of global climate and air traffic volume, where and when are the greatest risks of a Plasmodium falciparum-carrying mosquito being importated by air. This prioritises areas at risk of further airport malaria and possible importation or reemergence of the disease. Methods Monthly data on climate at the World’s major airports were combined with air traffic information and African malaria seasonality maps to identify, month-by-month, those existing and future air routes at greatest risk of African malaria-carrying mosquito importation and temporary establishment. Results The location and timing of recorded airport malaria cases proved predictable using a combination of climate and air traffic data. Extending the analysis beyond the current air network architecture enabled identification of the airports and months with greatest climatic similarity to P. falciparum endemic regions of Africa within their principal transmission seasons, and therefore at risk should new aviation routes become operational. Conclusions With the growth of long haul air travel from Africa, the identification of the seasonality and routes of mosquito importation is important in guiding effective <b>aircraft</b> <b>disinsection</b> and vector control. The recent and continued addition of air routes from Africa to more climatically similar regions than Europe will increase movement risks. The approach outlined here is capable of identifying when and where these risks are greatest...|$|E
40|$|A new "pre-embarkation" {{method for}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>disinsection</b> was {{investigated}} using two different 2 % d-phenothrin containing aerosols. Five experiments in aircrafts {{of the type}} Airbus 310 (4 x) and Boeing 747 - 400 (1 x) were performed. In the absence of passengers and crew the d-phenothrin aerosol was sprayed under the seat rows and in a second step {{at the height of}} approximately 1. 60 m by moving {{from one end of the}} cabin to the other. Concentration levels of d-phenothrin were determined at different time periods after application of the aerosol spray. In a B 747 - 400 with the air conditioning system operating the concentrations ranged between 853 and 1753 microg/m 3 during and till 5 min after the beginning of spraying at different locations in the cabin. Within 5 - 20 min after the end of the spraying concentrations of 36 - 205 microg/m 3 and 20 - 40 min thereafter only ca. 1 microg d-phenothrin/m 3 were detectable (average values in relation to each period of measurement). On cabin interior surfaces the median values for mainly horizontal areas ranged from 100 to 1160 ng d-phenothrin/cm 2. d-Phenothrin concentrations in the air were sufficient to kill flying insects like house flies and mosquitoes within 20 min. Horizontal surfaces were 100 % effective against insects up to 24 h after spraying. Doses inhaled by sprayers determined by personal measurements were calculated to be 30 - 235 microg d-phenothrin per 100 g spray applied (30 % in the respirable fraction for Arrow Aircraft Disinsectant; 10 % for Aircraft Disinsectant Denka). If passengers will board, e. g., 20 min after the end of the disinsection operation, inhalation exposure is estimated to be practically negligible. Also possible dermal exposure from residues in seats and headrests is very low for passengers during the flight. Therefore any health effects for passengers and crew members are very unlikely...|$|E
