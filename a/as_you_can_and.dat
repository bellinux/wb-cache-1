500|$|After Robinson's hire as manager, Doby {{returned}} {{to work for the}} Expos. In 1976, Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team's batting coach. As a team, the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a [...]255 batting average, 586 runs scored and 73 home runs. By June 29, 1977, the team's average was [...]284, and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs. They finished the season second in team batting average (to the Yankees and Red Sox, each with a [...]281 average) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs scored as a team. After firing the White Sox's manager and former Doby teammate Bob Lemon, Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30, 1978. At age 53, Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson. [...] "It's so nice to work for a man like Bill Veeck. You just work as hard <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>and</b> if the opportunity arises, you will certainly get the opportunity to fulfill your dreams", Doby said after being named White Sox manager.|$|E
500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>and</b> everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditional naval {{doctrine}} envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines. This {{view was}} challenged when army airman General Billy Mitchell demonstrated {{the capability of}} aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel. In the interwar debate that followed, some saw the carrier as defensive in nature, providing air cover to protect the battle group from shore-based aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft were lighter in design and had not {{been shown to be}} as lethal. The adage [...] "Capital ships cannot withstand land-based air power" [...] was well known. Aviation proponents, however, imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power. Halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system. When he testified at Admiral Husband Kimmel's hearing after the Pearl Harbor debacle he summed up American carrier tactics being to [...] "get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>and</b> to dump it on him." [...] Halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon.|$|E

2500|$|McKenzie's {{organizational}} principles were {{to ensure}} harmony and unity within the Society, work cooperatively {{with the white}} establishment and uphold standards of quality and achievement for Indians. He wrote, [...] "No issue, no bill, no policy is comparable in importance with a demonstration that Indians can maintain unity and cordial feelings even at times of difference upon specific points." [...] McKenzie was well connected to the political establishment in Washington, D.C., and by 1914, he solicited over 400 Non-native associate memberships from influential academicians, politicians and Progressive organizations. [...] Parker noted, [...] "I am sure that we all wish you to secure for us as many members <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>and</b> win for us {{the right kind of}} friends." [...] Parker was deeply grateful for McKenzie's support and assistance through the Society's most productive years, and in 1913 nominated McKenzie for Commissioner of Indian Affairs to Franklin K. Lane, then U.S. Secretary of the Interior. Writing without McKenzie's knowledge, Parker cited [...] "his friend's broad experience, special knowledge of the Indian, rare understanding of the legal and social status of our native wards. I know of no fitter person for the difficult task that falls upon the Office of the Indian Commissioner." [...] McKenzie and Parker collaborated until 1915, when McKenzie departed Ohio State University and his friends in Columbus to assume the Presidency of Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. Parker and McKenzie remained lifelong friends and colleagues.|$|E
2500|$|Richie {{spoke to}} Inside Soap about Alfie's reaction, {{saying that when}} he discovers {{it is one of}} the three Branning brothers, it [...] "really tips him over the edge, and Alfie becomes a monster. He finally gets some balls and decides enough is enough. He tells Kat that he doesn't care about her anymore—he says she's filthy and disgusting. Alfie has kept going with Kat for the sake of their love and their history. But if he can't forgive her for this latest indiscretion, there's no way they can keep their family together." [...] He said that he and Wallace had [...] "a vested interest" [...] to get the scenes right, [...] "because our bosses gave us such a great opportunity. We spent a lot of time working on it—and I hope we've ticked every box." [...] Richie called the bedsit scene [...] "fantastic" [...] and told the BBC, [...] "It's very rare you get a 15-minute scene with two people in one room". He {{explained}} that he and Wallace spent a lot of time with the episode's director, Karl Neilson, [...] "just going over stuff, finding out where the emotions were, who was the victim, who was on the offensive, who was on the defensive", where usually there are no rehearsals. Richie also revealed that the bedsit set was a [...] "tiny space" [...] that was purposely built for the episodes, which Richie said was [...] "quite claustrophobic". He called it a [...] "square room [...] nowhere to hide", with [...] "every blink of the eye, every look, every frown, every sigh" [...] being seen, adding [...] "if you're looking angry, it's there to be seen, you're naked to it". He said he [...] "loved" [...] that about filming the episode, and said, [...] "you work hard to try and be as good an actor <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>and</b> then you're given an opportunity by the BBC and by EastEnders to step up to the mark. Lorraine [...] believing that two actors could do that—it's a bit of a pressure on your shoulders, but me and Jessie loved it." [...] Richie and Wallace filmed the episode about two months before it was broadcast.|$|E
