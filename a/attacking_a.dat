(species uncertain), and a solitary Odontomachus has been seen <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> P. labiata. In a test the ant Diacamma vagans usually killed single-handed a P. labiata.|$|E
5|$|However, {{towards the}} end of his reign Manuel's {{achievements}} in the east were compromised by a serious defeat at Myriokephalon, which in large part resulted from his arrogance in <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> well-defended Seljuk position. Although the Byzantines recovered and Manuel concluded an advantageous peace with Sultan Kilij Arslan II, Myriokephalon proved to be the final, unsuccessful effort by the empire to recover the interior of Anatolia from the Turks.|$|E
5|$|In November 1912 Davison {{was arrested}} for a final time, for <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> Baptist {{minister}} with a horsewhip; she had mistaken the man for Lloyd George. She was sentenced to ten days' imprisonment and released early following a four-day hunger strike. It was the seventh time she had been on hunger strike, and the forty-ninth time she had been force-fed.|$|E

On the night of 9/10 July they advanced up steep terrain under the cover of a heavy artillery barrage. During the fighting that followed, one of the battalion's members, Private James Gordon, performed the deeds for which he subsequently received the Victoria Cross, crawling forward and single-handedly <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> French post that was holding up his company's advance.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|On 10 July 1940, {{the first}} major clashes of the Battle of Britain {{occurred}} in a phase known as the Kanalkampf. 20 Bf 109s of III./JG 51 led by Hauptmann Hannes Trautloft and 30 Bf 110 C of I./Zerst√∂rergeschwader 26 escorted 20 Dornier Do 17 bombers of II./Kampfgeschwader 2 <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> large convoy off Folkestone.

5|$|The game {{is set in}} six locations: Kenya, {{defending}} the ADATA facility; the Arctic, attacking an alien base while defending a human one; the North Atlantic Ocean, where the player must defend oil rigs and attack a second alien base; California, where parts of a fleet to invade the alien's moon base must be defended; the Moon, <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> further alien base; and a planet in the Crab Nebula, assaulting the planet from which the alien attackers came.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} battery served several other roles. It was hoped that a medium-calibre shell {{might be able}} to score a hit on an enemy dreadnought's sensitive fire control systems. It was also felt that the secondary armament could {{play an important role in}} driving off enemy cruisers from <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> crippled battleship.|$|E

5|$|At {{daylight}} a reconnaissance by No. 1 Squadron aircraft reported three British armoured cars {{halfway across}} the Esdraelon Plain {{on their way to}} Afulah, a cavalry brigade at Lejjun and two brigades just entering the plain advancing on a broad front. The 5th Cavalry Division had ordered the 14th Cavalry Brigade to Afulah. This brigade reached the Afulah to Nazareth road at about 05:30, and at 07:15 after <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> German or Ottoman force, the 20th Deccan Horse captured Afulah railway station and about 300 prisoners. The division's artillery, which had moved through the Abu Shusheh pass during the morning, rejoin the 5th Cavalry Division at Afulah later in the day.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist has platform-specific features, {{including}} voice {{integration with}} Xbox 360's Kinect peripheral which allows players to distract enemies before <b>attacking.</b> <b>A</b> player {{can also use}} the Kinect sensor to control the protagonist with their body instead of the Xbox 360 controller. In the Wii U version, the Gamepad controller's touchscreen is an interface, accessing gadgets and other features from the protagonist's arm-mounted computer (OPSAT), and incorporating screen and motion controls to highlight enemies with thermal vision when using Killing in Motion. The Wii U version was not shipped with the game's cooperative mode.|$|E

5|$|Early {{the next}} day the NZMRB moved towards Katia, with the {{intention}} of <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> Turkish gun emplacement. The brigade positioned itself between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on the left and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right. Taking the lead, the regiment advanced close enough by 14:30 to charge the position on horseback, then dismounted and continued the attack on foot, all in the face of heavy rifle and machine-gun fire. No progress was made and they {{spent the rest of the}} day returning fire from cover. The engagement cost the regiment one dead and six wounded.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and weapons {{at the expense}} of other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an allowance for the failures of some primary objectives. When the mission is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss the mission, and the performance of the player, before the next mission can be taken on.|$|E
5|$|From a {{behavioral}} standpoint, {{one of the}} most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a Velociraptor <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> Protoceratops, providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an Edmontosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged {{in such a way that}} shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. Cannibalism amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod Majungasaurus.|$|E

50|$|Besides <b>attacking</b> pieces, <b>a</b> {{target of}} a fork can be a direct mating threat (for example, <b>attacking</b> <b>an</b> {{unprotected}} knight while simultaneously setting up a battery of queen and bishop to threaten mate).

5|$|In April 1917, Peƒáanac re-emerged {{with his}} guerrillas, <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> railway station, {{destroying}} a bridge and raiding a Bulgarian {{village on the}} border. Peƒáanac avoided a further offensive by the occupation forces in July by disappearing into the mountains once again. After emerging for a short time, in September‚ÄìOctober 1917 Peƒáanac again dispersed his guerrillas and infiltrated the Austro-Hungarian occupied zone, where he remained in hiding until mid-1918. During his period in hiding, {{he met with the}} Kosovar Albanian leader Azem Galica to discuss joint actions against the occupation forces.|$|E
5|$|In the race's sixth stage, Roberto Visentini won the leg after <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> few {{kilometers}} from the finish. Saronni regained the race lead after finishing second {{on the stage and}} earning a fifteen-second time bonus. The next two stages both resulted in a bunch sprint, with Guido Bontempi winning stage 7 and Franco Chioccioli, stage 8. The ninth stage contained the climbs of Monte Terminillo and La Forca and was considered one of the tougher stages in the race. Malvor-Bottecchia-Vaporella rider Ac√°cio da Silva won the stage as the top of the general classification rankings remained unchanged from the previous days.|$|E
5|$|Many prelates lived {{around the}} street during the Middle Ages, {{including}} the Bishops of Salisbury and St Davids and the Abbots of Faversham, Tewkesbury, Winchcombe and Cirencester. Tanning of animal hides became established on Fleet Street {{owing to the}} nearby river, though this increased pollution leading to a ban on dumping rubbish by the mid-14th century. Many taverns and brothels were established along Fleet Street and have been documented {{as early as the}} 14th century. Records show that Geoffrey Chaucer was fined two shillings for <b>attacking</b> <b>a</b> friar in Fleet Street, though modern historians believe this is apocryphal.|$|E
50|$|Another patrol on May 30 in poor {{conditions}} <b>attacked</b> <b>an</b> Heinkel He 111 {{that was}} preparing to <b>attack</b> <b>an</b> transport. The enemy machine jettisoned its bombs due to the Skuas attack but was then lost in the poor visibility.|$|R
