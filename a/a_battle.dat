5|$|In naval battles, players {{control a}} fleet of up to twenty varied ships, and use 18th-century tactics to {{overcome}} enemy fleets. As with army units, each ship's crew has a set amount of morale that changes as <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> progresses; a crew may attempt to withdraw their vessel from the battle if their morale is broken, or in extreme cases may surrender. <b>A</b> <b>battle</b> is won when all hostile ships have been sunk, captured, or have left the map. Individual ships can be maneuvered, or remain in formation with other ships from the fleet. Players can designate which parts of a hostile ship they want a crew to target, making ships prone to sustaining authentic damage during a battle: masts can be toppled, sails and gun ports can be destroyed and damage can entirely disable a ship's ability to manoeuvre or eventually sink it. The types of ammunition can be used during <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> are grapeshot, chain-shot and round shot, which have different uses, from killing enemy crew to disabling enemy movement. As battles progress, crews can try to board enemy vessels and fight hand-to-hand {{in an attempt to}} capture the ship. The weather in a naval battle is also important; bad weather can create poor visibility. Ships cannot be repaired in mid-battle unlike its successor, , but fires on board ships can be put out automatically.|$|E
