Its main section extends from the western industrial suburb of Elefsina to Athens International Airport; while two beltways, namely the Aigaleo Beltway (A65) and the Hymettus Beltway (A64) serve parts of western and eastern Athens respectively. The span of the <b>Attiki</b> Odos in all its length is , making it the largest metropolitan motorway network in all of Greece.|$|E

25|$|Athens {{has been}} a {{destination}} for travellers since antiquity. Over the past decade, the city's infrastructure and social amenities have improved, {{in part because of}} its successful bid to stage the 2004 Olympic Games. The Greek Government, aided by the EU, has funded major infrastructure projects such as the state-of-the-art Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, the expansion of the Athens Metro system, and the new <b>Attiki</b> Odos Motorway.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s {{it became}} evident that smog from {{factories}} and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, {{as well as}} a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the <b>Attiki</b> Odos motorway, the expansion of the Athens Metro, and the new Athens International Airport), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004 Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
25|$|The ancient site of Athens is {{centred on}} the rocky hill of the acropolis. In ancient times the port of Piraeus was a {{separate}} city, but {{it has now been}} absorbed into the Athens Urban Area. The rapid expansion of the city, which continues to this day, was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s, because of Greece's transition from an agricultural to an industrial nation. The expansion is now particularly toward the East and North East (a tendency greatly related to the new Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport and the <b>Attiki</b> Odos, the freeway that cuts across Attica). By this process Athens has engulfed many former suburbs and villages in Attica, and continues to do so. The table below shows the historical population of Athens in recent times.|$|E
