5|$|Assuming <b>a</b> <b>composition</b> {{similar to}} that of Jupiter and that the planet's {{atmosphere}} is close to chemical equilibrium, it is predicted that 55 Cancri d is covered in a layer of water clouds: the planet's internal heat probably keeps it too warm to form the ammonia-based clouds that are typical of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is likely to be about 4 to 5 times stronger than Jupiter, or about 10 to 15 times that of Earth which is because the radius of the planet is unlikely to be much more than Jupiter's and is probably slightly smaller than Jupiter due to the high metal content in the parent star.|$|E

40|$|Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an {{emerging}} software engineering paradigm for developing distributed {{applications in the}} Internet era. In this paradigm, web services from different organizations are composed to realize business goals. To safeguard application consistency in such an environment, atomicity is a desirable property for <b>a</b> service <b>composition,</b> {{in the sense that}} the service composition could either terminate successfully or abort without any side effects. However, conventional database transactions are inapplicable in such an environment due to the long-running, distributed, autonomous and heterogeneous nature of web services. Instead, exception handling, a weak consistency approach, is often adopted to resolve application inconsistency based on the concept of atomicity sphere, a structured criterion for the atomicity property of service compositions. In this thesis, we propose a process algebraic framework to study the atomicity property in <b>a</b> service <b>composition</b> using the exception handling approach. We discuss the following three research issues: 1) The global analysis of atomicity sphere for <b>a</b> service <b>composition.</b> In <b>a</b> service <b>composition,</b> service providers usually provide only abstract public views of their services to service consumers. These public views expose only partial information of their services. Therefore, it is difficult to analyze the atomicity sphere of <b>a</b> service <b>composition</b> using existing work because full comprehensive information about the provided services is needed. To address this issue, we propose an approach to publishing the atomicity information of services in their public views. Service consumers could then use these public views to check the atomicity sphere in <b>a</b> service <b>composition</b> instead of using the services. 2) The local analysis of atomicity sphere in <b>a</b> service <b>composition.</b> In some situations, besides the details of their services, organizations may also not be willing to share information about their collaborators with the other collaborators in <b>a</b> service <b>composition</b> due to privacy concerns or business reasons. To check the atomicity sphere of <b>a</b> service <b>composition</b> in such scenarios, the global analysis approach is incompetent. To address this issue, we propose an alternative way to check the atomicity sphere of <b>a</b> service <b>composition</b> using <b>a</b> local analysis approach. 3) The detection and resolution of atomicity violations caused by implicit interactions in <b>a</b> service <b>composition.</b> Concurrent execution of services may lead to implicit interactions between services (i. e., resource sharing). Such implicit interactions may also cause atomicity violations at runtime even if <b>a</b> service <b>composition</b> satisfies the atomicity sphere. To address this issue, we propose an approach to identify only afflicted implicit interactions in <b>a</b> service <b>composition,</b> and suppress their threats to the atomicity property with extra behavior constraints. We evaluate the framework of our proposal based on examples modeled after a couple of real life applications and the associated experimental results...|$|R

5|$|One {{explanation}} is {{the exposure of}} whiter subsurface layers by impacts; another is that the scattered objects' greater distance from the Sun creates <b>a</b> <b>composition</b> gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets. Mike Brown, discoverer of the scattered object Eris, suggests that its paler colour could be because, at its current distance from the Sun, its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its entire surface, creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice. Pluto, conversely, being closer to the Sun, would be warm enough that methane would freeze only onto cooler, high-albedo regions, leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions bare of ice.|$|E
