30|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> is {{a feature}} of wood that affects {{the shape of the}} sawn timber. Boards sawn from logs with a large <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> have a {{tendency}} to twist when the moisture content changes. In sawmills the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> in logs is judged manually. For research purposes the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> in stems and logs is normally measured by destructive methods. In this study the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> of the stems was measured nondestructively with a computed tomography (CT) scanner. Twelve Norway spruce (Picea abies) stems from two stands in Sweden were scanned with a CT scanner with one cross-sectional scan every 10 mm along the stem. Concentric surfaces at various distances from the pith were reconstructed from the stack of CT images. In these concentric-surface images, which show various internal features of the log. the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle was measured at different distances from the pith and at different heights in the stem. The destructive measurements of the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> were carried out on disks from the top ends of the logs. On these disks the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> was measured at different distances from the pith with a protractor. Finally, the results from the destructive method were compared with the results from analysis of the CT images. The nondestructive and destructive measurements were compared in pairs with the same radial and approximately the same height position in each pair. The correlations (r) between the two methods were 0.81 and 0.71. respectively, for the two stands.

These studies found that the narrow-sense heritability of SGA in radiata pine ranged from moderate to high, which was consistent with research on other conifers such as Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.)

30|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> is {{a regular}} feature of many tree species, and {{remains one of the}} most {{important}} factors influencing wood utilisation (Denzler et al. 2015). However, the factors controlling its formation are poorly understood (Harris 1989; Kubler 1991; Skatter and Kučera 1997). <b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle (SGA) is defined as the orientation of wood fibres or tracheids with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tree stem (Kozlowski et al. 1967). Changes in the grain angle within stems are a well-known feature of old trees and of the corewood of conifers, and are normally attributed to pseudotransverse and anticlinal cell division in the vascular cambium (Bannan 1966; Larson 1994; Schulgasser and Witztum 2007). <b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> is an important defect is sawn timber and is a primary source of twist distortion during drying (Ormarsson and Cown 2005).|$|R

Generally, the additive genetic variance for mean grain angle decreased with increasing ring number. Although dominance variance was comparatively high near the pith, it decreased to zero in subsequent growth rings. Highest heritability estimates of mean grain angle occurred at ring 4 and then declined with age, ranging from 0.45 down to 0.20. Age-age phenotypic correlations were higher than genetic correlations, especially those involving early growth rings.

30|$|Distortions due to {{moisture}} {{changes during}} drying or in service {{are a major}} problem for construction timber. Twist, caused mainly by the cylindrical geometry, the orthotropic nature of the wood material, and the tendency of the wood fibers to grow in a spiral around the stem, is often regarded as the most detrimental distortion of sawn timber. There is a need for a basic mechanical understanding of how the twist distortion arises and also a need for a simple formula to predict the amount of twist distortion. In this article such a formula is proposed, and theory and experimental data that indicate the validity of the formula are shown. The first term in the formula is a modification of a traditional expression which is proportional to the mean value of the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle in the cross section in question. The second term in the formula is new and is proportional to the gradient of the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle, and this term normally counteracts the first term so that a stud with a left-handed <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> might achieve a right-handed twist. Linear elastic finite element method (FEM) results and comparisons with experimental data show that the formula works well and that linear FEM calculations exaggerate the twist, which is probably partly due to nonlinear effects. The formula could be used to predict the twist of sawn timber from measured <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angles on the log surface.|$|R

30|$|One of {{the factors}} that has the {{greatest}} influence on the utilisation of wood {{from a wide range of}} species, including radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don), is lack of dimensional stability caused by <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> (Johansson et al. 1994). <b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle (SGA) is defined as the orientation of fibres (tracheids) with reference to the longitudinal axis of the tree stem. The relatively high values of SGA found in radiata pine (Ormarsson and Cown 2005), particularly in corewood, can cause twist in dry timber, distortion in plywood sheets, surfacing problems during machining (Tsehaye and Walker 1995; Ekevad 2005) and are a major cause of drying degrade in radiata pine and other conifers (Haslett and McConchie 1986; Haslett et al. 1991; Danborg 1994). Cown et al. (1995) reported that twist in radiata pine is responsible for at least 90 % of the instability of affected radiata pine timber produced in fast-grown plantations in New Zealand. Similarly, Sorensson and Lausberg (1996) demonstrated that a decrease in <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> in juvenile wood of 3 degrees was sufficient to reduce rejection rates for twist from 12 % to 5 %, and would save the New Zealand forest industry about $ 58 million per annum.|$|R

40|$|Wood {{is a major}} {{construction}} material that is used in many contexts, and for different purposes. Serious problems may arise, however, when moisture related deformations as twist occur in wood used in different types of building structures, joinery and furniture. Twist can be explained to a great degree by the helical deviation of the grain angle {{in relation to the}} longitudinal direction of the log or the sawn board. Wood fibres form a spiral within the tree, and this is a natural occurrence that is named <b>spiral</b> <b>grain.</b> The wood fibres close to the pith in Norway spruce form a left-handed spiral. In most trees the grain angle turns over to be right-handed with time. Sawn timber that exhibits large grain angles lead to problems of shape stability and stiffness in finished constructions. In this thesis the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) was stated as well as the effect on sawn timber. The material was based on sample trees from Sweden and Finland. Samples were taken in twenty-two stands at different heights in tree. From six stands studs were sawn and dried for measuring twist and other deformations. The <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> was measured with the method scribe test on 390 log discs taken at the top-end of the logs. Account was given concerning changes in grain angle from pith to bark, regarding both increasing annual ring numbers and distance from pith. The development of grain angle over tree age was utilized to study whether annual growth, size of tree, height in tree as well as silvicultural treatments affected <b>spiral</b> <b>grain.</b> Moreover, the relation between grain angle and distance to pith (in mm) was used to forecast twist in sawn timber. The left-handed grain angle was at its greatest between the fourth and eighth annual rings. Thereafter for most trees the grain angle turned from left-handed to right-handed in a linear fashion, in a manner that was unique for each individual tree. The pattern of <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> differed significantly between different stands, regarding change of inclination with increasing age or distance from pith. The culmination of the grain angle close to the pith occurred at somewhat higher age higher up in the trunk. The grain angle decreased faster in top logs than it did in the butt logs. The largest trees within a stand had a grain angle that turned to right in a slower way than smaller ones. The thinning strength and type of thinning regime also affected the character of <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> in the remaining trees in a stand. There was an indication that strong thinnings, where fast growing trees are retained, may lead to more individuals in a stand that exhibit high grain angles under bark. With knowledge of the size and direction of the grain angle under bark, and the diameter of the log, calculations can be made that show how twisted the sawn timber will be after drying. This can be used for deciding whether an individual log can profitably be sawn and processed further or not. The grain angle under bark can be used to remove trees showing the greatest degree of <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> already in the first thinning. Silvicultural methods aiming at even and dense Norway spruce stands, which normally is practised in Scandinavia, will probably result in timber with relatively low risk concerning large grain angle and subsequent risk for twist in sawn wood...|$|R

Timber does, however, have one important drawback when it is used in a modern mechanised building process - its lack of straightness.

The main objective of this work was to identify the cause of moisture-induced distortion and create statistical and analytical models to predict distortion on the basis of material parameters. The work also gives recommendations on the parameters that should be focused on in order to develop methods to remove material prone to distortion. Studies were conducted in which the distortion in a large number of studs was measured at several moisture content levels. The changes in moisture content were made without outer restraints in order to study the effect of the material without the effect of restraints. Several material parameters were also measured on the studs; <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle, annual ring curvature, juvenile wood, knots, annual ring width, compression wood, cracks, wane, density, shrinkage and skew sawing. <b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle and annual ring curvature together explain about 65 % of the variation in twist.

Detailed studies to determine how the longitudinal shrinkage varies within a stud were conducted.
