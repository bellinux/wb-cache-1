Also performing at Sunbury in 1974 were Skyhooks and, despite being booed off stage, Wilson recommended the band to Mushroom Records boss Michael Gudinski. In June / July 1974 Wilson took {{time off from}} Daddy Cool and produced Skyhook's breakthrough debut album Living in the Seventies, which overtook Daddy Cool's first album to become the biggest-selling Australian LP. He went on to produce their next two albums, Ego is not <b>a</b> <b>Dirty</b> <b>Word</b> (1975) and Straight in a Gay Gay World (1976), {{both of which were}} also successes in Australia.|$|E
500|$|Notorious {{scenes in}} the play include [...] "the china scene", a {{sustained}} double entendre dialogue mostly heard from off stage, where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection {{with two of his}} lady friends. The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and nodding in approval, failing to pick up the double meaning which is obvious to the audience. Lady Fidget has already explained to her husband that Horner [...] "knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will not let me see it lest I should beg some. But I will find it out, and have what I came for yet" [...] (IV.iii.110). Dialogue such as this made [...] "china" [...] <b>a</b> <b>dirty</b> <b>word</b> in common conversation, Wycherley later claimed.|$|E

Brandon Curtis of Secret Machines said, [...] "Songs like Paranoid Android made it OK to write music differently, to be more experimental... OK Computer was important because it reintroduced unconventional writing and song structures." [...] Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree added, [...] "I don't think ambition is <b>a</b> <b>dirty</b> <b>word</b> any more. Radiohead were the Trojan Horse in that respect. Here's a band that came from the indie rock tradition that snuck in under the radar when the journalists weren't looking and started making these absurdly ambitious and pretentious—and all the better for it—records." [...] In 2005, Q named OK Computer the tenth best progressive rock album ever.|$|E

[...] Defenders also point out she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief PPR should not have let Tom Ford go. Designers such as Alice Roi and Isabel Toledo have flourished without indulging Wintour or Vogue. Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep Vogue independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an Armani ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine's editorial pages, although she has also admitted if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Dan Povenmire, while Peter Shin contributed as supervising director. Various scenes in [...] "PTV" [...] were {{taken out of the}} episode due to Fox's international censors. As the writers worked on the episode the producers ended up, as the Chicago Tribune describes it, [...] "horse trading" [...] with Fox, removing a body-part reference in exchange for <b>a</b> <b>dirty</b> <b>word.</b> While the writing staff of the show was disappointed with the number of scenes that were removed from the episode, they were happy with the final result. The opening sequence, of which Family Guys creator Seth MacFarlane was particularly proud, was added into the episode after the producers discovered the episode ran three minutes short. The episode contained a montage which showcased the most bawdy moments of the previous seasons; Povenmire recalled the sequence; about it he stated that [...] "I just found those off the DVD and digitized them and edited them in. Basically because I didn't want to draw all those things! I found the most disgusting images from the first three seasons. And we actually got network notes on two of them saying, 'You're gonna have to cut that!' And I went, 'This has been on the air! And I'm only showing 8 frames of it!' And it turns out we cut them now when they're on the air. So apropos for the FCC episode." ...|$|E

40|$|Winner of the 2008 W J M Mackenzie Book Prize Politics {{was once}} a term {{with an array of}} broadly {{positive}} connotations, associated with public scrutiny, deliberation and accountability. Yet today it is <b>an</b> increasingly <b>dirty</b> <b>word,</b> typically synonymous with duplicity, corruption, inefficiency and undue interference in matters both public and private. How has this come to pass? Why do we hate politics and politicians so much? How pervasive is the contemporary condition of political disaffection? And what is politics anyway? In this lively and original work, Colin Hay provides a series of innovative and provocative answers to these questions. He begins by tracing the origins and development of the current climate of political disenchantment across a broad range of established democracies. Far from revealing a rising tide of apathy, however, he shows that a significant proportion of those who have withdrawn from formal politics are engaged in other modes of political activity. He goes on to develop and defend a broad and inclusive conception of politics and the political that is far less formal, less state–centric and less narrowly governmental than in most conventional accounts. By demonstrating how our expectations of politics and the political realities we witness are shaped decisively by the assumptions about human nature that we project onto political actors, Hay provides a powerful and highly distinctive account of contemporary political disenchantment. Why We Hate Politics will be essential reading for all those troubled by the contemporary political condition of the established democracies...|$|R

The nearness of Java and Madurese islands {{is one of the}} reasons why most of them choose to live in Surabaya including the writer's uncles' families and her relatives who live on Jalan Penjaringan Sari Surabaya. Based on that phenomenon, the writer is interested in observing their language. To be specific the writer would like to observe their <b>dirty</b> <b>words.</b> This study is done to find out what Madurese <b>dirty</b> <b>words</b> are often uttered by her uncles' families and relatives and the underlying factors which influence them to utter <b>dirty</b> <b>words.</b> To collect the data, the writer asks her consultants, her father, mother and eldest brother to record the subjects' conversations. The writer also provides questionnaires which have to be answered by the subjects. The writer finds out that Madurese <b>dirty</b> <b>words</b> used by her uncles families and relatives are 'colok' (mouth), 'burik ker-ker' (ass), 'pokke' (vagina or pussy), 'lorbok' (a condition that someone's vagina is worn), and 'pala' (penis). 'Colok" (mouth) is one of <b>dirty</b> <b>words</b> which is frequently used by the subjects. The underlying factors which influence the writer's uncles' families and her relatives to utter <b>dirty</b> <b>words</b> are: 1. They have close relationship, 2. They want to release their emotion, 3. The participants want to express their intimacy, 4. They want to show their personal attitudes.

The New Zealand government's planned acquisition of the Anzac-class frigates was a major point of debate and contention: researcher Peter Greener claims that it [...] "was possibly the most strongly debated defence purchase of the century". In New Zealand at the time, [...] "frigate" [...] was <b>a</b> <b>dirty</b> <b>word,</b> and attempts to make the replacement of the old navy ships more palatable to the public included using euphemisms like [...] "ocean combat ship" [...] and [...] "ocean surveillance vessel". The government's official stance was dedication to maintaining a blue-water navy, primarily in order to defend the nation and contribute to regional security. Despite this, the government was slow to respond to opponents of the project, which included peace campaigners, politicians (from both within and outside the Labour Party, and from both ends of the political spectrum), and military personnel. Most of the concern revolved around the cost of purchasing frigate-type ships, along with the idea that four high-capability warships would be too few and too overspecialised to operate in the roles envisioned for the RNZN.|$|E
