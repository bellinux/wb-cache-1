5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam, {{known in}} Japan as , , and , are three Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon {{franchise}} that are linked through evolution. Abra evolves into Kadabra after gaining enough experience in battle, and Kadabra evolves into Alakazam after being traded to another trainer. Created by Ken Sugimori, they {{first appeared in}} the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and later appear in subsequent sequels. They have appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Known as the Psi Pokémon, using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its abilities unless rested. This behavior ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. <b>Able</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> everything since its birth, Alakazam's IQ is around 5000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Alakazam {{is also one of the}} handful of Pokémon to be capable of undergoing Mega Evolution, which increases its strength and makes it appearance undergo a few noticeable changes.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, are {{sensitive}} to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).|$|E
5|$|When Sorceress Edea {{becomes the}} Galbadian ambassador, Balamb and Galbadia Gardens order Squall's team to assassinate her; Irvine is {{introduced}} as the sniper for the mission. Moments before the assassination attempt, he explains to Squall {{that he always}} chokes under pressure. In spite of his nerves and under intense pressure, he fires an accurate shot, but Edea uses magic to stop the bullet. At Trabia Garden, Irvine reveals that he {{and most of the}} other party members had lived in the same orphanage, run by Cid and Edea Kramer. However, the others could not remember this because of their use of Guardian Forces (GF), magical beings who cause severe long-term memory loss as a side effect. Because Irvine had not used a GF until he joined the party, he is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> his past. During the game, Irvine gradually draws closer to Selphie, acting on the feeling he has had since living with her at the orphanage.|$|E
50|$|To {{solve this}} task, an {{algorithm}} must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> both <b>remember</b> the last number 1 or 2 {{and the last}} letter A or B independently. We refer to this memory as the working memory. This memory must persist all other input.|$|R
30|$|Vygotsky (1997) {{describes}} {{the concept of}} <b>remembering</b> in relation <b>to</b> how children develop higher mental functions such as memory and how children are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> transition from <b>remembering,</b> <b>to</b> making new connections, to using verbal language (words) and to giving qualitative properties to what words signify.|$|R

5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. <b>Able</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E
25|$|Memory underpins and enables social {{interactions}} {{in a variety}} of ways. In order to engage in successful social interaction, people must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> how they should interact with one another, whom they have interacted with previously, and what occurred during those interactions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study showed}} that emotionally arousing stories {{generally}} predicted better memory recall than stories which were less so.

25|$|A {{study by}} Gathercole and Baddeley (1989) showed the {{importance}} of sound for early word meaning. They tested the phonological memory of 4- and 5-year-old children, i.e., how well these children were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> a sequence of unfamiliar sounds. They found that children with better phonological memory also had larger vocabularies at both ages. Moreover, phonological memory at age 4 predicted the children’s vocabulary at age 5, even with earlier vocabulary and nonverbal intelligence factored out.|$|E
50|$|Infants who are 5 {{months or}} older are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use {{emotions}} to influence their memories. However, at this age, infants {{will be more}} likely <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> things that were characterized by positive emotions. The way that researchers study the memory capabilities of infants in this age range is through measuring eye movements between test images presented. After doing this initial round of testing, the researchers would conduct follow-up tests both 5 minutes later and one day later. The follow-up tests shown to the infants included two geometric shapes: one from the original test, and a new shape. The researchers were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> record how long the infants looked at the images in the follow-up tests and measured how long the infants stared at each shape. The infants were more likely to gaze at the geometric shapes from the original tests if they had been paired with positive voices than if they had been paired with neutral or negative voices. This study indicated that infants at this age would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> better <b>remember</b> shapes and patterns of things if they were associated with positive emotions because positivity would increase the infants' interest and attention.|$|R
50|$|For the survivors, family, {{and friends}} of the victims of the violent crimes, The Eye That Cries {{memorial}} is a place where they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> mourn the loss of loved ones.

25|$|Studies using PET {{have come}} to the same {{conclusions}} regarding the use of the parahippocampal gyrus for prospective memory. The parahippocampal gyrus is activated in paired-associate prospective memory tasks, in which participants must learn a pair of words and be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> one half of the word pair in later trials. It is suspected that the parahippocampal gyrus is additionally involved in monitoring the novelty of presented stimuli. If not monitored properly, new stimuli can be distracting during attempts to remember intentions for the future.|$|E
25|$|Martin and Sugarman {{describe}} {{memory and}} imagination as two ontic (real) characteristics {{of human nature}} which are vital to humans' capacity for dialogue. According to Martin and Sugarman, it is through both that people are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the conversations that “we furnished with the symbolic and relational tools we require to consider past experiences and previous learning, and to entertain future possibilities” because memory allows humans to reconstruct their past while imagination allows them “to project selves into the future”. In other words, when humans converse with others, they recall memories and imagine future possibilities to help themselves mentally construct potential ways for understanding themselves (self-interpretation) and their world, and their place in it, so {{they know how to}} relate to others.|$|E
25|$|The preparatory attentional {{and memory}} (PAM) theory proposes {{two types of}} {{processes}} involved in successful prospective memory performance. The first component of this theory involves a monitoring process that begins when a person constructs an intention that is then maintained until it is performed. This monitoring component involves a capacity-consuming process, {{similar to those used}} when maintaining attention, because {{there is a need for}} the intention to be stored and maintained in memory. The second component involves the use of elements of retrospective memory processes. These elements are used to differentiate between the wanted prospective memory intention and unwanted thoughts, in an attempt to keep focus on the goal and not the other options surrounding it. Retrospective memory is also used to remember specifically what intention is supposed to be performed in the future, and the monitoring process is needed to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> to perform this action at the correct condition or time.|$|E

This {{ability of the}} brain has been a subject of {{interest}} for neuroscientists, psychologists and philosophers for many decades. Already 387 B. C. Plato describes that the brain is {{the seat of the}} mental process. In 1664 Thomas Willis publishes Cerebri anatome (in Latin) and in 1681 he coins the term Neurology. With the use of a silvernitrate staining method developed by Camillo Golgi in 1873, Santiago Ramon y Cajal described that neurons are independent elements. He proposed that memories might be formed by strengthening the connections between existing neurons to improve the effectiveness of their communication. Both Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramon y Cajal received a Nobel prize in 1906 for their contribution to the field...|$|R
40|$|Graphical {{passwords}} are {{an alternative}} form of authentication that use images for login, and leverage the picture superiority e↵ect for good usability and memorability. Categories of graphical passwords have been distinguished {{on the basis}} of di↵erent kinds of memory retrieval (recall, cued-recall, and recognition). Psychological research suggests that leveraging recognition memory should be best, but this remains an open question in the password literature. This paper examines how di↵erent kinds of memory retrieval a↵ect the memorability and usability of random assigned graphical passwords. A series of five studies of graphical and text passwords showed that participants were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> better <b>remember</b> recognition-based graphical passwords, but their usability was limited by slow login times. A graphical password scheme that leveraged recognition and recall memory was most successful at combining memorability and usability...|$|R

Lucky (then-Greg Vaughan) is recovering from a drug addiction and had an affair with Felicia's daughter Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms), Lulu has recently had an abortion, and Nikolas is raising a young son on his own. On October 26, 2006, Laura awakens, and is surprised that so much time has passed. While Laura bonds with her children, Luke flies to the Dominican Republic and appears to divorce Tracy in order to give Laura the wedding they had been planning before her mental illness.

25|$|Richard, Nicci, and Cara then {{travel to}} the People's Palace and learn that the boxes are missing {{and that they have}} been put into play. Richard finds the statue Kahlan left and figures out that the Sisters have stolen his wife and the boxes. With the proof in the Garden of Life, Nicci and Cara finally believe in the {{existence}} of Kahlan, despite not remembering her. While there, they learn that an older woman has been found fatally stabbed near the D'haran army; Nicci and Richard determine that it is Sister Tovi. Nicci uses deception to interrogate Tovi, discovering that it was Samuel who stabbed Tovi and took the Box of Orden she was carrying. She also learns about the Chainfire spell, about how it was used to obliterate everyone's memory about Kahlan, and that the Boxes of Orden were created in opposition to it. Later, Richard realizes that the Sword of Truth protected him from the Chainfire spell, which is why he was still <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> Kahlan.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} of {{anterograde}} amnesia, patients lose declarative memory, or the recollection of facts, but they retain nondeclarative memory, often called procedural memory. For instance, they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{and in some}} cases learn how to do things such as talking on the phone or riding a bicycle, but they may not remember what they had eaten earlier that day for lunch. One extensively studied anterograde amnesiac patient, codenamed H.M., demonstrated that despite his amnesia preventing him from learning new declarative information, procedural memory consolidation was still possible, albeit severely reduced in power. He, along with other patients with anterograde amnesia, were given the same maze to complete day after day. Despite having no memory of having completed the maze the day before, unconscious practice of completing the same maze over and over reduced the amount of time needed to complete it in subsequent trials. From these results, Corkin et al. concluded despite having no declarative memory (i.e. no conscious memory of completing the maze exists), the patients still had a working procedural memory (learning done unconsciously through practice). This supports the notion that declarative and procedural memory are consolidated in different areas of the brain. In addition, patients have a diminished ability to remember the temporal context in which objects were presented. Certain authors claim the deficit in temporal context memory is more significant than the deficit in semantic learning ability (described below).|$|E

IGN UK expressed a mixed opinion about the character, feeling his personality was sometimes annoying, although it served to contrast with the serious attitudes of the other main characters. Similarly, VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin-Poole called Zack Cloud's [...] "identical twin in all but hair colour," [...] and complained about his personality being [...] "annoying" [...] {{during the first half}} of the game. Destructoid agreed, telling players not to expect to enjoy Zack if they do not like [...] "cocky teenagers," [...] and even labelling him an [...] "annoying cockhole."
