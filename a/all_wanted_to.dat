Oarsmen tried beating them on their hands, but the slaves would not let go. The small boats made several trips back and forth to load those who wanted to leave.|$|E

500|$|Thomas {{described}} Amanda Seyfried, who {{portrayed the}} murdered Lilly Kane, as [...] "the biggest {{surprise of the}} year".

When casting Lilly Kane, who would only appear from time-to-time as [...] "the dead girl", Thomas did not receive the same standard of actors. Thomas said that he had [...] "never had a more cut and dry audition" [...] than he did with Seyfried. He said that she was [...] "about 100 times better than anyone else that we saw, she was just spectacular". He continued by saying that she ended up being so good in the series that he used her three or four more times than he initially planned.|$|E

[...] Kreisberg explained that since they are all comic book fans themselves, they have all debated the age-old question of which superhero would win in a fight; [...] "So, the idea that [...] would fight each other in one of these episodes was one of our earliest ideas, and that the cast members would have that Comic-Con argument on camera was one of our earliest ideas."

500|$|Vice President Henry Wallace {{was popular}} among Democratic voters, {{but he was}} viewed as {{too far to the}} left and too {{friendly}} to labor for some of Roosevelt's advisers. The President and several of his confidantes wanted to replace Wallace with someone more acceptable to Democratic Party leaders and Roosevelt's advisors, knowing that Roosevelt might not live out a fourth term. Outgoing Democratic National Committee chairman Frank C. Walker, incoming chairman Hannegan, party treasurer Edwin W. Pauley, strategist Ed Flynn, Chicago Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly, and lobbyist George E. Allen <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep Wallace off the ticket. Roosevelt told party leaders that he would accept either Truman or Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. State and city party leaders strongly preferred Truman, and Roosevelt agreed.

500|$|Hoppus and Barker {{decided to}} {{continue}} on without DeLonge, and enlisted Alkaline Trio vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba to [...] "fill in" [...] for three shows in March 2015. Hoppus and Skiba had been wanting to work together musically for several years, so {{he was the first}} and only person considered for the role. After legal battles with DeLonge were worked out, Skiba joined Blink-182 as an official member and began preparations for new music. The resulting album, California, was produced by John Feldmann. He was the group's first new producer since longtime collaborator Jerry Finn. California was recorded between January and March 2016. The band, as well as Feldmann, would regularly spend [...] "18 hours" [...] in the studio a day, aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe. [...] "We <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write the best record that we could [...] It does feel like a new beginning.

500|$|Several {{weeks before}} the gold {{certification}} of Fillmore East and their rehabilitation, the band headed to Miami's Criteria Studios with producer Tom Dowd {{to work on their}} third studio album. The band first began recording the album one month prior, when they laid down the initial tracks for [...] "Blue Sky". The band saved money on studio time by writing and debuting songs on the road. The band worked on three songs: [...] "Blue Sky", an instrumental titled [...] "The Road to Calico" [...] (which would eventually develop into [...] "Stand Back", with added vocals) and [...] "Little Martha", the only song solely credited to Duane Allman. The band laid down these three songs and went back on the road for a short run of shows, and at this point several checked into rehab. After Duane's death, the band held a meeting on their future; it was clear <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road. Drummer Butch Trucks later said, [...] "We all had this thing in us and Duane put it there. He was the teacher and he gave something to us—his disciples—that we had to play out".|$|E
