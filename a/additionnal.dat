40|$|The HESS {{project is}} a major {{international}} experiment currently performed in gamma astronomy. This project relies on a system of four Cherenkov telescopes enabling the observation of cosmic gamma rays. The outstanding performance obtained {{so far in the}} HESS experiment has lead the research labs involved in this project to improve the existing system: an <b>additionnal</b> telescope is currently being built and will soon take place within the previous telescope system. This telescope is designed to be more sensitive to the detection of low energy particles than the others, leading to an increase of the number of collected particle images. In this context which is tightly constrained in terms of latency, physicists have been compelled to design an <b>additionnal</b> L 2 trigger {{in order to deal with}} a huge amount of data. This trigger aims at selecting images of interest (ie. gamma particles) and rejecting all other events that are associated to noise. Contrary to classical methods that consist of strong cuts based on Hillas parameters, we propose an original approach based on artificial neural networks. In this approach, collected events are first handled by an intelligent preprocessing level whose purpose consists in applying images transformation algorithms. In a second step, a basic neural network ensures the classification of events within three classes (gamma, muon and proton). Several types of preprocessing and their associated neural classifier will be considered and compared in this presentation in terms of recognition capabilities...|$|E

The proof relies on a result of independent interest concerning the Hilbert-Einstein function of a triangulated convex polyhedron.

In particular, {{if there are no}} interior vertices, then the Hessian is negative definite. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} {{discretization}} of the Levermore's two moments and entropy {{model of the}} radiative transfer equation. We present a new approach for the discretization of this model: first we rewrite the moment equations as a Compressible Gas Dynamics equation by introducing an <b>additionnal</b> quantity that {{plays the role of}} a density. After that we discretize using a Lagrange-projection scheme. The Lagrange-projection scheme permits us to incorporate the source terms in the fluxes of an acoustic solver in the Lagrange step, using the well-known "piecewise steady approximation" and thus to capture correctly the diffusion regime. Moreover we show that the discretization is entropic and preserve the flux-limited property of the moment model. Numerical examples illustrate the feasability of our approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{time and}} field {{dependence}} of the magnetic domain structure at magnetization reversal were investigated by Kerr microscopy in interacting ferromagnetic Co/Pt multilayers with perpendicular anisotropy. Large local inhomogeneous magnetostatic fields favor mirroring domain structures and domain decoration by rings of opposite magnetization. The long range nature of these magnetostatic interactions gives rise to ultra-slow dynamics even in zero applied field, i. e. it affects the long time domain stability. Due to this <b>additionnal</b> interaction field, the magnetization reversal under short magnetic field pulses differs markedly from the well-known slow dynamic behavior. Namely, in high field, the magnetization of the coupled harder layer has been observed to reverse more rapidly by domain wall motion than the softer layer alone.
