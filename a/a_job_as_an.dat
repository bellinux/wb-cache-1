5|$|In May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as World War II {{broke out}} across Europe. Although Hergé briefly fled to France and {{considered}} a self-imposed exile, he ultimately {{decided to return}} to his occupied homeland.

In search of employment, he got <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> illustrator at Belgium's leading newspaper, Le Soir (The Evening), which was allowed to continue publication under German management. On 17 October 1940, he was made editor of the children's supplement, Le Soir Jeunesse, in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures. In this new, more repressive political climate of German-occupied Belgium, Hergé could no longer explore political themes in his Adventures of Tintin lest he be arrested by the Gestapo. As Harry Thompson noted, Tintin's role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his new role as an explorer.|$|E

Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E
