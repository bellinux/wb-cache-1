40|$|One of the {{proposed}} solutions {{to the issue of}} nuclear waste volume is to transition from once through nuclear <b>fuel</b> cycle to <b>advanced</b> <b>fuel</b> cycles with used fuel recycling option. In any <b>advanced</b> <b>fuel</b> cycles with recycling options, the type and amount of separation technology deployed {{play a crucial role in}} the overall performance of the fuel cycle. In this work, a scenario study involving two <b>advanced</b> <b>fuel</b> cycles in addition to the once through fuel cycle were evaluated using VISION nuclear fuel cycle simulation code. The <b>advanced</b> <b>fuel</b> cycles were setup to transition completely to full recycling without any light water reactor by assuming all LWR currently in operation will have 20 years of operating life extension and no new LWR will be constructed thereafter. Several different separation capacities (1 kT/yr, 2 kT/yr and 4 kT/yr) were deployed and the overall impact of these capacities was analyzed in terms of resources utilization, used fuel and waste material generated and the amount of storage space required. Economic parameter (LCOE, LFCC, etc) analysis was also performed using VISION. ECON. Results presented in this work suggest that the need for LWR-UNF storage can be minimized if sufficient separation capacity is deployed early in the fuel cycle. It can also be concluded that a FuRe system without LEU will not be feasible, thus SFRs must be designed for optional use of LEU fuel. Otherwise LWRs must continue to be part of the mix to keep the near term cost of generating electricity competitive. It was observed that the higher amount of separation capacity deployed in the <b>advanced</b> <b>fuel</b> cycles led to higher LFCC and LCOE, but also translates into less environmental impact on both front and back end of the fuel cycle.

5000|$|... "The {{operating}} envelope of the JT11D-20 engine requires special fuel. The fuel {{is not only}} the source of energy but is also used in the engine hydraulic system. During high Mach flight, the fuel is also a heat sink for the various aircraft and engine accessories which would otherwise overheat at the high temperatures encountered. This requires a fuel having high thermal stability so that it will not break down and deposit coke and varnishes in the fuel system passages. A high luminometer number (brightness of flame index) is required to minimize transfer of heat to the burner parts. Other items are also significant, such as the amount of sulfurimpurities tolerated. <b>Advanced</b> <b>fuels,</b> JP-7 (PWA 535) and PWA 523E, were developed to meet the above requirements." [...] SR-71A Flight Manual, Section I, page 4 Shell Oil developed JP-7 in 1955. Company vice president Jimmy Doolittle arranged for Shell to develop the fuel for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and United States Air Force's (USAF) secret Lockheed U-2 spy plane, which needed a low-volatility fuel that would not evaporate at high altitude. Manufacturing several hundred thousand gallons of the new fuel required the petroleum byproducts Shell normally used to make its Flit insecticide, causing a nationwide shortage of that product that year.|$|E
50|$|Reprocessing Development Laboratory was {{designed}} in early seventies and the commissioning of inactive facilities was carriedout in 1976. The plutonium handling facilities were cleared for operation in 1980. The reprocessing of irradiated thorium rods which {{was carried out}} during the period 1989 to 1992 in the concrete shielded cells, {{was the first major}} radioactive operation. The U-233 recovered during the operation was used in fabricating the fuel for the KAlpakkam MINI reactor (KAMINI). U-233 was also useful for the fuel development programme for carrying out the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor test fuel irradiation experiments in Fast Breeder Test Reactor. Apart from this, the operation aided in validating the equipment and design of system as well as the manpower training. Later a hot cell facility for reprocessing of Fast Breeder Test Reactor fuel was conceived which had the necessary features for delivering the product with all the uncertainties in the dissolution of irradiated fuel and process flowsheet. Added to this was the need for the deployment of the yet to be proven designs of centrifuge and centrifugal extractors without which the success of the PUREX process for fast reactor fuel reprocessing would be doubtful. With these minimal inputs, the hot cell facility, Lead Mini Cell (LMC) was created, which was later rechristened as CORAL (COmpact Reprocessing facility for <b>Advanced</b> <b>fuels</b> in Lead cells). Based on the dissolution experiments carried out on unirradiated single pellets and systematic studies related to the third phase formation, the flow sheet, prepared earlier for the oxide fuel was modified.|$|E
