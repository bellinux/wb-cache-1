5|$|The {{antibiotic}} {{of choice}} in the United States for streptococcal pharyngitis is penicillin V, due to safety, cost, and effectiveness. <b>Amoxicillin</b> is preferred in Europe. In India, where the risk of rheumatic fever is higher, intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is the first choice for treatment.|$|E
5|$|Several {{antibiotics}} {{have been}} used successfully to treat S.iniae infection in fish. Enrofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, {{has been used to}} great effect in hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops× M.saxatilis), although evidence suggested the development of a resistant strain. <b>Amoxicillin,</b> erythromycin, furazolidone, and oxytetracycline have also been used (the last with varying success, only in barramundi). Vaccination against S.iniae has been attempted with limited success as it only provides up to 6 months' immunity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amoxicillin</b> {{is one of}} the semisynthetic {{penicillins}} {{discovered by}} Beecham scientists. The patent for <b>amoxicillin</b> has expired, thus <b>amoxicillin</b> and co-amoxiclav preparations are marketed under hundreds of trade names and/or have several synonyms across the world.|$|E
25|$|Ampicillin {{can also}} be used instead of <b>amoxicillin</b> when person can't swallow and needs {{antibiotics}} as it has the same spectrum as <b>amoxicillin.</b>|$|E
25|$|When H. pylori {{infection}} is present, {{the most effective}} treatments are combinations of 2 antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin, <b>amoxicillin,</b> tetracycline, metronidazole) and a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), sometimes together with a bismuth compound. In complicated, treatment-resistant cases, 3 antibiotics (e.g. <b>amoxicillin</b> + clarithromycin + metronidazole) may be used together with a PPI and sometimes with bismuth compound. An effective first-line therapy for uncomplicated cases would be <b>amoxicillin</b> + metronidazole + pantoprazole (a PPI).|$|E
25|$|A nonallergic <b>amoxicillin</b> rash {{may also}} be an {{indicator}} of infectious mononucleosis. Some studies indicate about 80-90% of patients with acute Epstein Barr virus infection treated with <b>amoxicillin</b> or ampicillin develop such a rash.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous form is {{not sold}} in USA. In the USA when <b>amoxicillin</b> is needed intravenously, {{it is usually}} {{accomplished}} by adding <b>amoxicillin</b> powder to bags of Saline Solution. There are small saline bags that have a screw off cap {{on the top of}} them to allow the powder to be added, commonly called piggy back bags by medical staff. Powdered <b>Amoxicillin</b> can be mixed with saline solution or sterile water to be used in a syringe, but because of the slow delivery time that is needed to inject the solution (3–4 minutes for solution containing 1g of <b>amoxicillin</b> powder) this method is seldom used.|$|E
25|$|In general, Streptococcus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus, Haemophilus, Helicobacter, and Moraxella are {{susceptible}} to <b>amoxicillin,</b> whereas Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are resistant to it. Some E. coli and most clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus have developed resistance to <b>amoxicillin</b> to varying degrees.|$|E
25|$|Peptic ulcers may {{be treated}} with omeprazole. Treatment of H. pylori {{infection}} can be completed by taking a triple therapy combination of omeprazole, <b>amoxicillin,</b> and clarithromycin for 7–14 days. <b>Amoxicillin</b> may be replaced with metronidazole in patients who are allergic to penicillin.|$|E
25|$|Esomeprazole is {{combined}} with the antibiotics clarithromycin and <b>amoxicillin</b> (or metronidazole instead of <b>amoxicillin</b> in penicillin-hypersensitive patients) in a 10-day eradication triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori. Infection by H. pylori is a causative factor {{in the majority of}} peptic and duodenal ulcers.|$|E
25|$|The {{first line}} {{antibiotic}} treatment, if warranted, is <b>amoxicillin.</b> If there is resistance {{or use of}} <b>amoxicillin</b> in the last 30 days then amoxicillin-clavulanate or another penicillin derivative plus beta lactamase inhibitor is recommended. Taking <b>amoxicillin</b> once a day may {{be as effective as}} twice or three times a day. While less than 7 days of antibiotics have less side effects, more than seven days appear to be more effective. If there is no improvement after 2–3days of treatment a change in therapy may be considered.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amoxicillin</b> is {{recommended}} by the World Health Organization {{for the treatment of}} infants with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in resource-limited situations when the parents are unable or unwilling to accept hospitalization of the child. <b>Amoxicillin</b> in combination with gentamicin {{is recommended}} for the treatment of infants with signs of other severe infections when hospitalization is not an option.|$|E
25|$|Systemic {{antibiotics}} such as <b>amoxicillin</b> or metronidazole {{are sometimes}} used {{in addition to}} debridement based treatments.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amoxicillin</b> was {{discovered}} in 1958 and came into medical use in 1972. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It {{is one of the most}} commonly prescribed antibiotics in children. <b>Amoxicillin</b> is available as a generic medication. It has a wholesale cost in the developing world of between 0.02 and 0.05 USD per pill. In the United States ten days of treatment costs about 16 USD.|$|E
25|$|PPIs {{have been}} used {{successfully}} in triple-therapy regiments with clarithromycin and <b>amoxicillin</b> for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori with {{no significant difference between}} different PPI-based regimens.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{otitis media}} caused by H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis or S. pneumoniae. Azithromycin is not, however, a {{first-line}} agent for this condition. <b>Amoxicillin</b> or another beta lactam antibiotic is generally preferred.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amoxicillin</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of infections, including acute otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, skin infections, urinary tract infections, Salmonella infections, Lyme disease, and chlamydia infections.|$|E
25|$|Use of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid {{combination}} {{for more}} than one week has caused mild hepatitis in some patients. Young children having ingested acute overdoses of <b>amoxicillin</b> manifested lethargy, vomiting, and renal dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacteria}} that causes gingivitis {{can be controlled}} by using an oral irrigator daily with a mouthwash containing an antibiotic. Either <b>amoxicillin,</b> cephalexin, or minocycline in 16 ounces of a non-alcoholic fluoride mouthwash is an effective mixture.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amoxicillin</b> is {{occasionally}} {{used for}} the treatment of skin infections, such as acne vulgaris. It is often an effective treatment for cases of acne vulgaris that have responded poorly to other antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amoxicillin</b> is {{susceptible}} to degradation by β-lactamase-producing bacteria, which are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin. For this reason, it may be combined with clavulanic acid, a β-lactamase inhibitor. This drug combination is commonly called co-amoxiclav.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amoxicillin</b> was one {{of several}} semisynthetic {{derivatives}} of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) developed at Beecham, England in the 1960s. It became available in 1972 and was the second aminopenicillin to reach the market (after ampicillin in 1961). Co-amoxiclav became available in 1981.|$|E
25|$|NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, {{can be used}} to {{help with}} the pain. Topical {{lidocaine}} may also help. Strep throat is typically treated with antibiotics, such as either penicillin or <b>amoxicillin.</b> It is unclear if steroids are useful in acute pharyngitis, other than possibly in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amoxicillin,</b> also spelled amoxycillin, is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. It is the first line treatment for middle ear infections. It may also be used for strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, and urinary tract infections among others. It is taken by mouth, or less commonly by injection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amoxicillin</b> diffuses {{easily into}} tissues and body fluids. Penetration {{into the central}} nervous system {{increases}} in meningitis. It will cross the placenta and is excreted into breastmilk in small quantities. It is excreted into the urine and metabolized by the liver. It has an onset of 30 minutes and a half-life of 3.7 hours in newborns and 1.4 hours in adults.|$|E
25|$|More {{severe cases}} require oral antibiotics, such as dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, or erythromycin. Alternatively, <b>amoxicillin</b> {{combined}} with clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins (first-generation) {{and many others}} may {{also be used as}} an antibiotic treatment. Alternatives for people who are seriously allergic to penicillin or infections with MRSA include doxycycline, clindamycin, and SMX-TMP. When streptococci alone are the cause, penicillin is the drug of choice.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is {{typically}} with antibiotics taken by mouth, such as cephalexin, <b>amoxicillin,</b> or cloxacillin. In {{those who are}} seriously allergic to penicillin, erythromycin or clindamycin may be used. When methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a concern, doxycycline or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may, in addition, be recommended. Concern {{is related to the}} presence of pus or previous MRSA infections. Elevating the infected area may be useful, as may pain killers.|$|E
25|$|After the {{identification}} of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities, including tetracycline antibiotics, <b>amoxicillin,</b> cefuroxime axetil, intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone. The mechanism of tick transmission was also {{the subject of much}} discussion. B. burgdorferi spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} of benefit in terms of live birth rate of using hyaluronic acid as adherence medium for the embryo. Neither is there any evidence of benefit of having a full bladder, removal of cervical mucus, or flushing of the endometrial or endocervical cavity at the time of embryo transfer. Adjunctive antibiotics in the form of <b>amoxicillin</b> plus clavulanic acid does not increase the clinical pregnancy rate compared with no antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Outpatients with {{underlying}} {{illness or}} risk factors: Although this group {{does not require}} hospitalization, patients have underlying health problems (such as emphysema or heart failure) or {{are at risk for}} DRSP or enteric gram-negative bacteria. They are treated with a quinolone active against streptococcus pneumoniae (such as levofloxacin) or a β-lactam antibiotic (such as cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, <b>amoxicillin</b> or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and a macrolide antibiotic, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{prevented}} by hand washing, avoiding smoking, and immunization. Pain killers such as naproxen, nasal steroids, and nasal irrigation {{may be used}} to help with symptoms. Recommended initial treatment for ARS is watchful waiting. If symptoms do not improve in 7–10 days or get worse, then an antibiotic may be used or changed. In those in whom antibiotics are used, either <b>amoxicillin</b> or amoxicillin/clavulanate is recommended first line. Surgery may occasionally be used in people with chronic disease.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{avoiding}} things {{that cause the}} disease. Treatment includes medications such as antacids, H2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors. During an acute attack drinking viscous lidocaine may help. If gastritis is due to NSAIDs these may be stopped. If H. pylori is present it may be treated {{with a combination of}} antibiotics such as <b>amoxicillin</b> and clarithromycin. For those with pernicious anemia, vitamin B12 supplements are recommended either by mouth or by injection. People are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones, and a newer {{macrolide}} antibiotic such as clarithromycin or a tetracycline like doxycycline, {{are used}} in those who have severe allergies to penicillins. Because of increasing resistance to <b>amoxicillin</b> the 2012 guideline of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends amoxicillin-clavulanate as the initial treatment of choice for bacterial sinusitis. The guidelines also recommend against other commonly used antibiotics, including azithromycin, clarithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, because of growing drug resistance. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{finding of}} coccoid {{bacteria}} on a pap test {{is of no}} consequence with otherwise normal test findings and no infectious symptoms. However, if there is enough inflammation to obscure the detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous processes, it may indicate treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic for streptococci and anaerobic bacteria (such as metronidazole and <b>amoxicillin)</b> before repeating the smear. Alternatively, the test will be repeated at an earlier time than it would otherwise. If there are symptoms of vaginal discharge, bad odor or irritation, the presence of coccoid bacteria also may indicate treatment with antibiotics as per above.|$|E
25|$|Infectious {{vulvovaginitis}} can {{be caused}} by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (7-20% of cases), Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella, Yersinia, or common STI organisms (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus, and human papillomavirus). Symptoms and treatment of infectious vulvovaginitis vary depending on the organism causing it. Shigella infections of the reproductive tract usually coexist with infectious of the gastrointestinal tract and cause mucous, purulent discharge. They are treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Streptococcus infections cause similar symptoms to nonspecific vulvovaginitis and are treated with <b>amoxicillin.</b> STI-associated vulvovaginitis may be caused by sexual abuse or vertical transmission, and are treated and diagnosed like adult infections.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics are {{the primary}} treatment. The {{specific}} approach to their use {{is dependent on the}} individual affected and the stage of the disease. For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; alternatives to doxycycline are <b>amoxicillin,</b> cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin. Individuals with early disseminated or late infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, refractory Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like meningitis or encephalitis. Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives.|$|E
