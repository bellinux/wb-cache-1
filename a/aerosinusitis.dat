50|$|<b>Aerosinusitis,</b> {{also called}} barosinusitis, sinus squeeze or sinus {{barotrauma}} is a painful inflammation and sometimes bleeding of the membrane of the paranasal sinus cavities, normally the frontal sinus. It {{is caused by}} a difference in air pressures inside and outside the cavities.|$|E
50|$|Sinus {{barotrauma}} or <b>aerosinusitis</b> {{has been}} known since the early development of aviation medicine. However, it was during World War II that the subject first received serious attention and the pathogenesis of the disease was understood {{to be due to}} exposure to high altitude flights. Rapid altitude changes with accompanying changes in ambient pressure exposed the aircrews to an increasing number of episodes of sinus barotrauma.|$|E
40|$|Patients {{presenting}} before flight with {{an upper}} respiratory infection {{are at risk}} for <b>aerosinusitis.</b> Prophylaxis of this condition consists of an oral decongestant before flight and nasal decongestant spray during the flight just prior to descent. Evaluation of the patient presenting with <b>aerosinusitis</b> consists of a careful physical exam with emphasis on diagnosing treatable nasal and sinus pathology. Categorization of the patient into the Weissman classification is important for determining prognostic factors for recovery. Management of this condition is based on the Weissman stage. Stage I or II lesions are generally treated conservatively with a 1 -wk course of topical sprays, analgesics, a tapering course of steroids, and oral decongestants. Use of antibiotics is reserved for those cases initiated by bacterial sinusitis. Additionally, antihistamines are reserved for cases where allergies were the inciting cause. Stage III lesions are rarely seen in civilian air travelers due to the relatively low fluctuations in ambient air pressure. Aircrew that suffer Stage III <b>aerosinusitis</b> {{are at risk for}} recurrent sinus barotrauma that may require an expertly performed functional endoscopic sinus surgery to successfully manage it.
