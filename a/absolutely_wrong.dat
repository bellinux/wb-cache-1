500|$|For much of {{his final}} two decades, Romney {{had been out of}} the {{political}} eye, but he re-emerged to the general public when he campaigned for his son, Mitt Romney, during the younger Romney's bid to unseat Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the 1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. [...] Romney had urged Mitt to enter the race and moved into his son's house for its duration, serving as an unofficial advisor. [...] Romney was a vigorous surrogate for his son in public appearances and at fundraising events. [...] When Kennedy's campaign sought to bring up the LDS Church's past policy on blacks, Romney interrupted Mitt's press conference and said loudly, [...] "I think it is <b>absolutely</b> <b>wrong</b> to keep hammering on the religious issues. And what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture." [...] The father counseled the son to be relaxed in appearance and to pay less attention to his political consultants and more to his own instincts, a change that the younger Romney made late in the ultimately unsuccessful campaign.|$|E

Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review, though Noah Robischon from the same magazine complimented the title track, saying that Madonna had [...] "pushed synergy over the borderline." [...] Bill Lamb from About.com said that the songs were not among Madonna's best music. Taraborrelli commented that [...] "the soundtrack was once again the reminder of Madonna's power and status {{as one of the}} most important singers of the 80s, because it was only her songs which gained prominence, albeit not being her best, though 'The Look of Love' is an exotic ballad." [...] Author Mary Cross, in her biography Madonna: A Biography said that [...] "the soundtrack slips up because of the film." [...] Allen Metz and Carol Benson, authors of The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, said that [...] "Who's That Girl has done what it was released for, put money in Warner's pockets, but [...] nothing in Madonna's catalogue".

But it's just that it has the misfortune of being associated with such an unfortunate movie, that the album actually does not hold up to you well." [...] He added that [...] "The Look of Love" [...] was a hidden gem in Madonna's catalogue. Don Shewey from Rolling Stone commented that [...] "although essentially a Madonna album, the soundtrack does not boast a truly memorable song, rather there is the inclusion of the failed Warner artist songs, like the Coati Mundi song 'El Coco Loco' and Duncan Faure's uncannily Beatles-esque [...] "24 Hours". For most buyers though this album is the new Madonna album." ...|$|E

His God requires more than being good, he demands that he seek out an inner commitment to him. If Abraham were to blithely obey, his actions would have no meaning.

2500|$|Sahgal {{joined the}} staff of Amnesty International in 2002, and the {{following}} year became head of its gender unit. [...] She came to wide public attention in February 2010, after she was quoted by The Sunday Times in an article about Amnesty and suspended by the organization. She had criticised Amnesty for its high-profile associations with Moazzam Begg, the director of Cageprisoners, representing men in extrajudicial detention. [...] "To be appearing on platforms with Britain’s most famous supporter of the Taliban Begg, whom we treat as a human rights defender, is a gross error of judgment," [...] she said. Sahgal argued that by associating with Begg and Cageprisoners, Amnesty was risking its reputation on human rights. [...] "As a former Guantanamo detainee, it was legitimate to hear his experiences, but as {{a supporter of the}} Taliban it was <b>absolutely</b> <b>wrong</b> to legitimise him as a partner,” Sahgal said. [...] She said she repeatedly brought the matter up with Amnesty for two years, to no avail. [...] A few hours after the article was published, Saghal was suspended from her position. Amnesty's Senior Director of Law and Policy, Widney Brown, later said Sahgal raised concerns about Begg and Cageprisoners to her personally {{for the first time a}} few days before sharing them with the Sunday Times.|$|E
