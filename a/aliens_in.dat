5|$|Written by Robert Holmes, {{this story}} was pitched on 22 October 1968. The story was set in the 22nd Century and dealt with an {{outbreak}} of mutants with ESP powers. The plot was reused by Holmes in 1977 as the non-Doctor Who radio serial <b>Aliens</b> <b>in</b> the Mind.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist {{predator}} {{has come}} to Earth {{in response to a}} distress signal from a comrade's ship. Upon his arrival in the small Colorado town of Gunnison, he learns that Aliens have begun terrorizing the local populace. His mission is to destroy the Aliens and remove any trace of their activity. After reaching his comrades' ship and erasing its traces from Earth, the Predator's only mission is to exterminate all <b>Aliens</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|There were 19 British Army Commandos {{formed in}} the United Kingdom and the Middle East. The No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando was formed from volunteers from the {{occupied}} territories and enemy <b>aliens.</b> <b>In</b> February 1942 the Royal Marines were asked to organise commando units of their own; 6,000 men volunteered, forming nine commandos. In 1943 the Royal Naval Commandos and the Royal Air Force Commandos were formed from volunteers from the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force.|$|E
25|$|The British {{government}} in London {{was not pleased}} with legislation that discriminated against certain subjects of its Empire, but decided not to disallow the laws that were passed. Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain explained in 1897:We quite sympathise with the determination...of these colonies...that {{there should not be}} an influx of people <b>alien</b> <b>in</b> civilisation, <b>alien</b> <b>in</b> religion, <b>alien</b> <b>in</b> customs, whose influx, moreover, would seriously interfere with the legitimate rights of the existing labouring population.|$|R

Woodruff had {{previously}} played the <b>Alien</b> <b>in</b> <b>Alien</b> 3, and described the <b>Alien</b> <b>in</b> Resurrection as feeling [...] "much more like a dog. It's got dog legs, a more pointed nose, and a more vicious mouth." [...] Weaver praised Woodruff's work, saying that [...] "working with him is like working with Lon Chaney, only Tom's usually covered with K-Y Jelly."

In 2009, Copeland self-released the CD-R Rgag EP.|$|R
5|$|While {{promoting}} Stargate in Europe, Emmerich came up {{with the}} idea for the film when fielding a question about his own belief in the existence of alien life. He and Dean Devlin decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that <b>aliens</b> <b>in</b> most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began in July 1995 in New York City, and the film was officially completed on June 20, 1996.|$|E
5|$|A family {{goes to a}} {{hotel with}} their gran, (which would have been played by Helen Mirren.) Gran hates the family {{so much that she}} wants them to {{disappear}} as they then do. She's stuck in the hotel until the Doctor appears in a lift. Russell T Davies thought of this idea to pick for a potential Christmas Special for 2009 to give to Phil Ford to write. Phil decided to use some <b>aliens</b> <b>in</b> the plot he was given and a chase down Buckingham Palace. But Russell decided that the better choice was 'Christmas on Mars' which then became The Waters of Mars.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{overwhelmingly}} {{controlled by}} Protestant and Catholic missions, which were {{also responsible for}} providing limited medical and welfare support to the rural Congolese. Food remained unrationed during the war, with only the sales of tires and automobiles restricted by the government. One {{of the consequences of}} the Congo's economic mobilisation during the war, particularly for the black population, was significant urbanisation. Just 9% of the indigenous population lived in cities in 1938; by 1950, the figure stood at close to 20%. The colonial authorities arrested enemy <b>aliens</b> <b>in</b> the Congo and confiscated their property in 1940.|$|E

5|$|Hot Potato {{features}} seven {{missions and}} seven score challenges. Mission mode requires the player {{to clear out}} a set number of an alien species. There are multiple alien species in the mode and the mission does not finish until the player gets rid of enough of a certain species chosen by the game from the road. Score challenge mode tasks the player with clearing away {{a certain number of}} <b>aliens</b> <b>in</b> order to reach a pre-determined score. The game contains bonus levels which are longer than normal levels if the player is able to complete missions under a certain time period.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{lead singer}} and guitarist Matt Hammitt met guitarist Chris Rohman {{while they were}} tenth graders {{attending}} Toledo Christian School in Ohio. They led youth worship at their school and church, and began writing their own music that year. Drummer Mark Graalman and bassist Matt Kollar soon joined, forming the band's original line-up.

5|$|While at Brigham Young University, Eckhart {{appeared}} in the Mormon-themed film Godly Sorrow, and the role marked his professional debut. At this time he met director/writer Neil LaBute, who cast him in several of his own original plays. After graduating from BYU, Eckhart moved to New York City, acquired an agent, and took various occasional jobs, including bartending, bus driving, and construction work. His first television roles were in commercials. In 1994, he appeared as an extra on the television drama series Beverly Hills, 90210. Eckhart followed this small part with roles in documentary re-enactments (Ancient Secrets of the Bible: Samson), made-for-television movies, and short-lived programs like <b>Aliens</b> <b>in</b> the Family.|$|E

5|$|The Mew Project {{was started}} by Ryô's father, Dr. Shirogane, five years before Tokyo Mew Mew is set. The manga never {{explains}} why the project was started or how they knew about Chimera Animas and the aliens, but Dr. Shirogane does mention that they must learn how to inject animal genes into human DNA in order to fight the <b>aliens.</b> <b>In</b> the anime adaptation, Dr. Shirogane discovered the fossilized remains of an ancient civilization called the Chimera during an archaeological dig and began researching the race of people who lived there with his assistant Keiichirô Akasaka. This would eventually become the Mew Project. A laboratory explosion and a fire that kills Dr. Shirogane and his wife, leaving then 10-year-old Ryô orphaned. He moved back to Japan, with Keiichirô, to continue the Mew Project. According to the anime, the lab explosion {{was caused by a}} Chimera fossil that woke up setting the house on fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{four of them}} head to the warehouse, {{where they}} find the gas stored inside asthma inhalers. Suddenly, Mulder arrives to arrest them, but two dark-suited men come to take Susanne. They fire at Mulder, hitting the boxes behind him and exposing him to the gas. The {{exposure}} causes Mulder to strip naked, hide in the box, and hallucinate about seeing <b>aliens</b> <b>in</b> the warehouse. Susanne shoots the men and escapes. More men then arrive, led by X, who intimidates the Lone Gunmen. Byers confronts X, asking him about his actions and mentioning the supposed cover-up of the John F. Kennedy assassination. X's unconvincing denial—"I heard it was a lone gunman"—becomes {{the origin of the}} trio's name. X leaves, just as the police arrive and arrest the Lone Gunmen.|$|E
5|$|The first Quatermass film {{had been}} a major success for Hammer and, eager for a sequel, they {{purchased}} the rights to Nigel Kneale's follow-up before the BBC had even begun transmission of the new serial. For this adaptation, Nigel Kneale himself was allowed to write {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, although subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest. The plot is a condensed but largely faithful retelling of the original television serial. The main difference between the two versions is at the climax: in the television version Quatermass blasts off in a rocket to confront the <b>aliens</b> <b>in</b> outer space, whereas in the film the rocket is fired, unmanned, to destroy the aliens' asteroid base. Returning director Val Guest once again employed many cinema vérité techniques to present the fantastic elements of the plot with the greatest degree of realism. Nigel Kneale was critical of the final film, mainly on account of the return of Brian Donlevy in the lead role. Kneale was unhappy with Donlevy's interpretation of the character and also claimed the actor's performance was marred by his alcoholism, a claim denied by Val Guest.|$|E
