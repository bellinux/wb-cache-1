This was good for only third in the tightly contested Northeast Division, as Boston would have 104 and Toronto 103.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{troubles}} in 1878, it was <b>another</b> <b>good</b> season for Grace {{on the field}} as he completed a sixth successive double with 1,151 runs and 153 wickets. He made 24 first-class appearances, scoring 1,151 runs with a highest score of 116 {{at an average of}} 28.77. He completed one century and five half-centuries. In the field, he held 42 catches and took 153 wickets with a best analysis of 8–23. His bowling average was 14.43; he took five wickets in an innings 13 times and ten wickets in a match six times.|$|E
5|$|In their response, the Vipers' openers put on 78 runs {{together}} in just under 10 overs, before Edwards was dismissed for 24, bowled by Jodie Dibble. Suzie Bates was run out by Fran Wilson soon after for 52 from 46 balls. Georgia Adams added 15 runs {{before she was}} also run out, by Anya Shrubsole. <b>Another</b> <b>good</b> partnership, between Sara McGlashan (21*) and Lydia Greenway (17*), took the Vipers to their target with seven balls to spare. Taylor, who was named as player of the tournament, was the most effective bowler for the Storm, but even she could only limit the Vipers to six runs per over.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton got {{the better}} of his team mate during the third {{practice}} session on Saturday morning, as Rosberg only managed third behind Vettel, almost a second down on Hamilton. Both Williams and Ferrari had <b>another</b> <b>good</b> session, while Lotus got both their drivers in the top ten, raising hopes for a points finish on Sunday. Red Bull continued to struggle, with Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat down in 15th and 18th and Ricciardo's car stopping at the end of pit lane due to engine problems. Between them were the once more struggling McLaren drivers.|$|E

5|$|On Monday, 26 August, Gloucestershire met Lancashire {{again at}} the Clifton College Close Ground and, despite <b>another</b> <b>good</b> innings by Hornby, Gloucestershire this time were victorious by 8 wickets. Grace had won the toss and put Lancashire in to bat first. Grace the bowler was once more the star {{performer}} as he took 7–77 and 5–32, {{but this time he}} did well with the bat and made a good 49 in difficult conditions. His brother Fred scored 73 not out and this was crucial to the Gloucestershire success. Grace scored 20 not out in the second innings as Gloucestershire made 32–2 to win.|$|E
5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is <b>another</b> <b>good</b> example of the design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|Charles Doolittle Walcott {{found in}} the Burgess Shale nine almost {{complete}} fossils of Opabinia regalis {{and a few of}} what he classified as Opabinia media, and published a description of all of these in 1912. The generic name is derived from Opabin pass between Mount Hungabee and Mount Biddle, southeast of Lake O'Hara, British Columbia, Canada. In 1966–1967 Harry B. Whittington found <b>another</b> <b>good</b> specimen, and in 1975 he published a detailed description based on very thorough dissection of some specimens and photographs of these specimens lit from a variety of angles. Whittington's analysis did not cover Opabinia media: Walcott's specimens of this species could not be identified in his collection. In 1960 Russian paleontologists described specimens they {{found in the}} Norilsky region of Siberia and labelled Opabinia norilica, but these fossils were poorly preserved, and Whittington did not feel they provided enough information to be classified as members of the genus Opabinia.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>another</b> <b>good</b> all-round {{performance}} against Hampshire, top-scoring in {{the first}} innings and taking 5/25 in the second, Miller went into the First Test (at Trent Bridge) in fine form. On the first morning, Miller bowled Hutton and Compton {{on his way to}} 3/38, helping Australia dismiss England cheaply and seize the initiative. Miller scored a duck, but Australia took a 344-run lead on the first innings. In the second innings, he resumed his battle with Hutton and Compton, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd. The next day, he bowled Hutton for 74 and then bounced Compton, causing him to fall onto his stumps for 184. Australia won by eight wickets, Miller ending with 4/125 for the second innings and 7/163 for the match.|$|E
5|$|Following several poor performances, Nani criticised Sir Alex Ferguson for {{his lack}} of {{confidence}} in him. Despite this outburst, Nani was given a chance to shine and provided an assist for Rooney in the 4–0 league win over Hull City. Soon after this positive display, he put in <b>another</b> <b>good</b> performance in their League Cup semi-final victory over derby rivals Manchester City, revealing a heart-to-heart with Ferguson had resulted in a better display of form. On 31 January 2010, Nani scored the first goal and set up Rooney's 100th career Premier League strike in a 1–3 league victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Nani's goal was first thought of as a Manuel Almunia own goal by many sources, but was confirmed as belonging to Nani on 26 March by the Dubious Goals Panel. Following this performance, Nani then set up the second of a 5–0 home win over Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|Irish-American tycoon Ellis Short {{completed}} a full {{takeover of the}} club from the Irish Drumaville Consortium, and Steve Bruce was announced as the new manager on 3 June. One of his first signings, Darren Bent,cost a club record fee of £10 million. Sunderland started their first season under Bruce strongly, including victories against Arsenal and Liverpool, but then went 14 matches without a win over the winter, eventually finishing the 2009–10 season 13th. Sunderland completed the signing of Ghana international Asamoah Gyan in August 2010 for a fee around £13million, becoming their new record transfer fee. Sunderland started the next season strongly, {{this time with a}} seven match unbeaten run against teams including Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United. However, the run was ended with a 5–1 defeat to local rivals Newcastle United on 31 October 2010. Sunderland bounced back with <b>another</b> <b>good</b> run, the highlight being a 3–0 victory against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. This run left Sunderland challenging for a European qualification place by the end of 2010. However, striker Darren Bent left Sunderland for Aston Villa in January 2011 in a deal potentially worth £24 million (a record transfer fee received for the club). Following Bent's departure Sunderland suffered a mid-season slump and finished 10th— their highest top-flight finish for 10 years.|$|E
