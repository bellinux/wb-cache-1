However, most biological functions for oligosaccharides have been attributed to specific terminal sequences on these glycoside chains; yet, there have been few studies that examine the consequences of modifying terminal oligosaccharide structuresin vivo. To address this issue, mice were created bearing a targeted mutation in β 1, 4 -galactosyltransferase (GalTase), an enzyme responsible for elaboration of many of the proposed biologically active carbohydrate epitopes. Most GalTase-null mice died within the first few weeks after birth and were characterized by stunted growth, thin skin, sparse hair, and dehydration. In addition, spermatogenesis was delayed, the lungs were poorly developed, and the adrenal cortices were poorly stratified. The few surviving adults had puffy skin (myxedema) and difficulty delivering pups at birth (dystocia) and failed to lactate (<b>agalactosis).</b> All of these defects are consistent with endocrine insufficiency, which was confirmed by markedly decreased levels of serum thyroxine. The polyglandular nature of the endocrine insufficiency is indicative of a failure of the anterior pituitary gland to stimulate the target endocrine organs. Previousin vitrostudies have suggested that incomplete glycosylation of anterior pituitary hormones leads to the creation of hormone antagonists, which down-regulate subsequent endocrine function, producing polyglandular endocrine insufficiency. In GalTase-null mice, the anterior pituitary acquired a normal secretory phenotype during neonatal development indicative of normal glycoprotein hormone synthesis and secretion. However, as expected, the gland was devoid of GalTase activity. These results support a requirement for terminal oligosaccharide sequences for anterior pituitary hormone function. The fact that ∼ 10 % of the GalTase-null mice survive the neonatal period indicates the presence of a previously unrecognized compensatory pathway for glycoprotein hormone glycosylation and/or action...|$|E

Our understanding of oligosaccharide function in vivo has been limited {{to the use of}} reagents and targeted mutations that eliminate entire oligosaccharide chains. However, most, if not all biological functions for oligosaccharides have been attributed to specific terminal sequences on these oligosaccharides, yet there have been few studies to examine the consequences of modifying terminal oligosaccharide structures in vivo. To address this issue, mice were created bearing a targeted mutation in β 1, 4 -galactosyltransferase, an enzyme responsible for elaboration of many of the proposed biologically-active carbohydrate epitopes. Most galactosyltransferase-null mice died within the first few weeks after birth and were characterized by stunted growth, thin skin, sparse hair, and dehydration. In addition, the adrenal cortices were poorly stratified and spermatogenesis was delayed. The few surviving adults had puffy skin (myxedema), difficulty delivering pups at birth (dystocia), and failed to lactate (<b>agalactosis).</b> All of these defects are consistant with endocrine insufficiency, which was confirmed by markedly decreased levels of serum thyroxine. The anterior pituitary gland appeared functionally delayed in newborn mutant mice, since the constituent cells were quiescent and nonsecretory, unlike that of control littermates. However, the anterior pituitary acquired a normal secretory phenotype during neonatal development, although it remained abnormally small and its glycoprotein hormones were devoid of β 1, 4 -galactosyl residues. These results support in vitro studies suggesting that incomplete glycosylation of pituitary hormones leads to the creation of hormone antagonists that down regulate subsequent endocrine function producing polyglandular endocrine insufficiency. More surprisingly, the fact that some mice survive this neonatal period indicates the presence of a previously unrecognized compensatory pathway for glycoprotein hormone glycosylation and/or action. ^ In addition to its well-studied biosynthetic function in the Golgi complex, a GalTase isoform is also expressed on the sperm surface where it functions as a gamete receptor during fertilization by binding to its oligosaccharide ligand on the egg coat glycoprotein, ZP 3. Aggregation of GalTase by multivalent ZP 3 oligosaccharides activates a G-protein cascade leading to the acrosome reaction. Although GalTase-null males are fertile, the mutant sperm bind less ZP 3 than wild-type sperm, and are unable to undergo the acrosome reaction in response to either zona pellucida glycoproteins or to anti-GalTase anti-serum, as do wild-type sperm. However, mutant and wild-type sperm undergo the acrosome reaction normally in response to calcium ionophore which bypasses the requirement for ZP 3 binding. Interestingly, the phenotype of the GalTase-null sperm is reciprocal to that of sperm that overexpress surface GalTAse and which bind more ZP 3 leading to precocious acrosome reactions. These results confirm that GalTase functions as {{at least one of the}} sperm receptors for ZP 3, and that GalTase participates in the ZP 3 -induced signal transduction pathway during zona pellucida-induced acrosome reactions. ...|$|E
