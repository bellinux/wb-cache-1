40|$|Semantic {{interoperability}} {{is highly}} influenced by {{similarities and differences}} which exist between ontologies. Ontology matching as a solution for finding corresponding concepts among ontologies has emerged to facilitate semantic based negotiations of applications. This paper presents a method of ontology matching {{which is based on}} vectorizing ontologies and estimating their similarity degree. A post processing with two heuristic rules also has been employed to improve the results. The proposed method is successfully applied to the test suit of Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative 2005 [10] and compared to results obtained by other methods. In general the preliminary results are encouraging <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> with the results of some other ontology matchers...|$|R

One of such environments {{in which there is}} a prominent job for the agents would be e-marketplaces in which a user is able to give those agents the responsibility of buying and selling, instead of searching the e-marketplace himself. Making up a framework which has sufficient attention to the required roles and their relations, is the first step of achieving such e-markets. In this paper, we suggest a framework in order to establish such e-markets <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> investigating the roles such as seller or buyer and the relations in JADE environment in details.
