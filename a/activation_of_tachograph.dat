40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{technical}} report is to describe the proof-of-concept of the CEN-DSRC imple- mentation of the remote interrogation function of the new version <b>of</b> the digital <b>tachograph.</b> The current digital tachograph (DT) system to monitor the driving time in commercial ve- hicles above 3. 5 tons is governed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821 / 85 of 20 December 1985, which was modified at several occasions and more recently in 2006, when the digital tachograph was introduced, and in 2009, when it was updated to technical progress to avoid fraud and reduce the administrative burden. In July 2011 the Commission made a proposal (COM(2011) 451 final) to modify the tachograph regulation, {{which has been the}} object of discussions in Council and Parliament {{in the course of the}} ordinary legislative procedure. The final version of the approved regulation was published in February 2014 (Regulation 165 / 2014 (Commission, 2004)). The technical specifications <b>of</b> the smart <b>tachograph</b> were published as Regulation 799 / 2016 (Commission, 2011). One of the main functions is the remote interrogation <b>of</b> the Smart <b>Tachograph</b> (ST) installed in the commercial vehicle through the CEN-DSRC standard.

40|$|Our {{previous}} studies revealed that Docetaxelinduced apoptosis of melanoma cells is entirely dependent on <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> the JNK signalling pathway.

This was shown by Docetaxelinduced <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> proteins involved in ER stress signalling namely GRP 78, ATF 6, IRE 1 α, and PERK/eIF 2 α. Knockdown of IRE 1 α by siRNA markedly inhibited Docetaxel-induced JNK activation and downstream targets of JNK indicating that <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> IRE 1 α was upstream <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> the JNK.

40|$|Thrombin Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI) is a carboxy-peptidase B-like {{proenzyme}} {{that after}} activation by thrombin down regulates fibrinolysis. Thrombomodulin (TM) stimulates the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> both TAFI and protein C whereas activated protein C (APC) inhibits the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> TAFI by down regulating thrombin generation. Recently, protein C inhibitor (PCI) {{was identified as}} a potent inhibitor of thrombin bound to TM and it can thereby regulate the balance between TAFI <b>activation,</b> and inhibition <b>of</b> TAFI <b>activation</b> by APC. Both in a purified system and in plasma, <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> TAFI and protein C by [Ia-TM could be inhibited by PCI. Previously we found in plasma that at low concentrations (approximately 1 nM), TM predominantly stimulated the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> TAFI whereas at higher concentrations of TM (approximately 10 nM) the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> protein C resulted in inhibition <b>of</b> the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> TAFI.
