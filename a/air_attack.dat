Gruppe, Kampfgeschwader 76 on 2 July 1942 and moved to Poti shortly afterwards. She was so severely damaged again, or sunk, by another German <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> on 16 July 1942 at Poti that she was deemed non-repairable. She was disarmed in August—September 1942, her guns forming coast defense batteries at Tuapse, and hulked. If she was sunk, she was refloated at some point and on 10 October she was towed {{to the mouth of}} the Khobi river, just north of Poti, and sunk as a breakwater.|$|E

5|$|Up to {{the late}} spring of 1940, Fighter Command had been {{preparing}} to meet a possible <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> on the British Isles coming only from due east, from Germany itself; prior to the German victory in Western Europe. The possibility that France might fall and Britain would continue to fight on had not been considered. An <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> from Germany meant the Luftwaffe's bombers would operate beyond the range of their fighters and be vulnerable to attack. If twin-engine fighters, such as the Messerschmitt Bf 110s were used, they would be fighting at {{the limits of their}} range.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, the {{clientele}} of Salon Kitty decreased. In July 1942, {{the building was}} demolished during a British <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> and the brothel had to be relocated.

5|$|Cunningham, {{realising}} that an <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> could {{weaken the}} Italians, ordered {{an attack by}} the Formidables Albacore torpedo-bombers. A hit on the Vittorio Veneto slowed her temporarily and Iachino, realising his fleet was vulnerable without air cover, ordered his forces to retire. Cunningham gave the order to pursue the Italian Fleet.|$|E

5|$|IIIBritish admiral Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope led {{naval forces}} in several {{critical}} Mediterranean naval battles as Commander-in-Chief.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Cape Esperance, the Japanese Army opted to reinforce its troops on Guadalcanal. To protect their transport convoy from enemy <b>air</b> <b>attack,</b> Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto sent Haruna and Kongō, escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers, to bombard the American air base as Henderson Field. Because of their high speeds, these two battleships could bombard the airfield and then withdraw before being subjected to <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> from either land-based warplanes or American aircraft carriers. On the night of 13 – 14 October, these two battleships shelled the area of Henderson Field from a distance of about , firing 973 14-inch high-explosive shells. In the most successful Japanese battleship action of the war, the bombardment heavily damaged both runways, destroyed almost all of the U.S. Marines' aviation fuel, destroyed or damaged 48 of the Marines' 90 warplanes, and killed 41 Marines. A large Japanese troop and supply convoy reached Guadalcanal on the next day.|$|E

5|$|Next, Radford and his {{carriers}} {{took part}} in an <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> and cruiser bombardment of Wake Island on 5 to 6 October 1943.

5|$|The Allies had {{detected}} {{preparations for}} the convoy, and naval codebreakers in Melbourne (FRUMEL) and Washington, D.C., had decrypted and translated messages indicating the convoy’s intended destination and date of arrival. The Allied Air Forces had developed new techniques they hoped would improve the chances of successful <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> on ships. They detected and shadowed the convoy, which came under sustained <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> on 2–3 March 1943. Follow-up attacks by PT boats and aircraft were made on 4 March. All eight transports and four of the escorting destroyers were sunk. Out of 6,900 troops who were badly needed in New Guinea, only about 1,200 made it to Lae. Another 2,700 were rescued by destroyers and submarines and returned to Rabaul. The Japanese made no further attempts to reinforce Lae by ship, greatly hindering their ultimately unsuccessful efforts to stop Allied offensives in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|According to an anecdote, {{the idea}} arose after {{a group of}} Royal Navy {{officers}} saw a similar, but fictional, bomb depicted in the 1943 Walt Disney animated propaganda film Victory Through Air Power, and the name Disney was consequently given to the weapon. The Royal Navy developed the bomb even though the Fleet Air Arm operated no aircraft capable of carrying it. The navy was interested in a concrete-penetrating weapon due to the German navy's extensive use of fortified submarine pens to protect their U-boats and E-boats from <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> while docked.|$|E
5|$|Also on August 29, the ROK Capital Division, with American {{tank and}} {{artillery}} support, recaptured Kigye {{and held it}} during the night against North Korean counterattacks, only to lose it again at dawn.
