25|$|The autumn in Scania {{is a slow}} process, {{compared}} with more northern parts of Sweden (but a faster one, when comparing with {{any part of the}} British Isles). During the first half of September, temperatures usually <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> affected, but the sunset is obviously earlier {{compared with}} in June. Temperatures drop in steps. Every new period with sunny weather becomes a bit cooler than the last one. By the end of October the defoliation process becomes evident. But not until late November all trees have lost their leaves. The period when storms and even hurricanes becomes most likely to occur durates between November and February. Most of them are coming from the Atlantic Ocean and doesn't involve snow or temperatures below freezing point. Late Scanian autumn is in general benefited from the surrounding waters (the opposite effect early spring).|$|E

File-sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names.

The Guardians Geoffrey Cannon viewed Parks' lyrics as [...] "pretentious", believing that Parks [...] "messed Brian up" [...] during Smiley Smile.

In the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, the reviewer described Smiley Smile as [...] "inconsistent" [...] and said that, given the context of its release in September 1967, [...] "the album was like a strange throwback – it highlighted how out of touch these suburban California surfers had become with the psychedelic times." ...|$|E
500|$|In a biographical sketch {{written in}} 2004, the {{historian}} Jeffrey Richards characterises Reed's {{work as a}} mixing of the earlier school story traditions established by Dean Farrar and Thomas Hughes, crafted with a vivid readability. Reed dismissed Farrar's Eric, or, Little by Little as a religious tract thinly disguised as a school story, and sought to produce something more [...] "manly". Many of the incidents and characterisations introduced by Reed in St. Dominic's became standard elements in his subsequent stories, and in those of his imitators. Quigly lists among other recurrent features the stolen exam paper, the innocent who is wrongly accused and ultimately justified after much proud suffering, the boating accident, the group rivalries, the noble friendships. Adult characters are largely stereotypes: a headmaster known as [...] "the Doctor" [...] and modelled on Thomas Arnold of Rugby, [...] "the jabbering French master (pointed beard and two-tone shoes)", the popular games master, the dry pedant, the generally comic domestic staff. Reed established a tradition in which the fictional boarding school was peopled by such characters and was almost invariably represented in terms of [...] "dark passages, iron bedsteads, scratched desks, chill dormitories and cosy, shabby studies". Quigly suggests that {{one reason for the}} success of Reed's stories and their long-lasting appeal is that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> books about school as books about people. John Sime of the RTS, in a memorial tribute to Reed after his death, notes that the boys in the stories are recognisably of flesh and blood, with [...] "just that spice of wickedness... without which a boy is not a boy".|$|E
500|$|In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in 16mm by first-time American {{director}} Barbara Loden won {{the international}} critics' prize at the Venice Film Festival. Wanda {{is both a}} seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture. The crime-based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old-school B noir. The $115,000 production, for which Loden spent six years raising money, was praised by Vincent Canby for [...] "the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and... purity of technique." [...] Like Romero and Van Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary. The first three features directed by Larry Cohen, Bone (1972), Black Caesar (1973), and Hell Up in Harlem (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism. The gory horror film Deathdream (1974), directed by Bob Clark, is also an agonized protest {{of the war in}} Vietnam. Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> ideological as psychological and existential: Shivers (1975), Rabid (1977), The Brood (1979). An Easy Rider with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists' biker-themed Electra Glide in Blue (1973), directed by James William Guercio. The New York Times reviewer thought little of it: [...] "Under different intentions, it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio." ...|$|E

Later, in The King's Demons, Kamelion is controlled by the Master before the Doctor steals him away, with the Master regaining control of Kamelion in Planet of Fire. In the second episode of The Ultimate Foe, Sabalom Glitz chose to go with the Master in search of Time Lord secrets.|$|E
2500|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry, {{the concept}} of a curve can be extended to discrete geometries by taking the spectra of polynomial rings over finite fields to be models of the affine spaces over that field, and letting subvarieties or spectra of other rings provide the curves that lie in that space.

For example, every point of the form [...] for [...] a field can be studied either as , a point, or as the spectrum [...] of the local ring at (x-c), a point together with a neighborhood around it. Algebraic varieties also have a well-defined notion of tangent space called the Zariski tangent space, making many features of calculus applicable even in finite settings.|$|E

2500|$|In Mongolia, {{racing is}} a people's sport where {{everyone}} participates. [...] Each family selects the best horse from their herd and {{takes it to}} the fair to race. [...] However, in recent years, the introduction of fast foreign crossbreeds has changed the sport. [...] Only the richest breeder can afford to buy and raise a Thoroughbred/Mongolian mix, and such horses tend to win races. [...] This has led to complaints that ordinary people {{no longer have a}} chance to win, and that racing has become the province of the elite. Racing horses with a child in the saddle run in full gallop over 35km at a time. Children are used instead of adults because they are lighter. [...] Mongolians <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> concerned with the skill and experience of a jockey as the ability of the horse.|$|E
2500|$|Victor Kiernan, a Marxist {{scholar and}} historian, writes {{that it is}} for the greater sake of love that this loss of {{identity}} takes place and that individual characters are made to suffer accordingly: [...] "It was the more extravagant cult of love that struck sensible people as irrational, and likely to have dubious effects on its acolytes." [...] He believes that identities in the play <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> lost as they are blended together to create a type of haze through which distinction becomes nearly impossible. It is driven by a desire for new and more practical ties between characters as a means of coping with the strange world within the forest, even in relationships as diverse and seemingly unrealistic as the brief love between Titania and Bottom: [...] "It was the tidal force of this social need that lent energy to relationships." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{characters}} in An Island are parodies of Blake's friends and acquaintances, although there is considerable critical disagreement as to whom some characters represent.

[...] Peter Ackroyd also suggests that understanding whom the characters represent is less important than understanding the satire {{at the heart of the}} piece. Similarly, Nick Rawlinson argues that trying to attach the characters to specific people [...] "limits the scope of the work to the eighteenth-century equivalent of a scurrilous email [...] it is reasonable to assume that the various characters stand for something more than just amusing personality sketches [...] It may be more helpful to see the characters as a reflection not just of a real person but also of an attitude Blake wishes to question." ...|$|E
