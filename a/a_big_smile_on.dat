500|$|Blane {{was amazed}} by the {{recreation}} and understanding of her designs by fans. When she first heard that people were dressing up, {{she thought it would}} be tacky, but was surprised to see the depth to which the fans went to recreate her designs. Rocky Horror fan Mina Credeur, who designs costumes and performed as Columbia for Houston’s performance group, states that [...] "the best part is when everyone leaves with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> their face", noting that there's [...] "such a kitschiness and campiness that it seems to be winking at you". The film still plays at many theatre locations and Rocky Horror costumes are often made for Halloween, although many require much time and effort to make.|$|E
2500|$|From Kuwait, Lynch was {{transported to}} Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany, {{where she was}} {{expected}} to recover fully from her injuries. On the flight to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the military medics kept her sedated and hydrated. Her family flew to Germany on April 5 {{to be reunited with}} her. In a statement, the hospital said, [...] "Lynch had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> her face when her parents arrived." ...|$|E
2500|$|Actor Nick Berry {{was cast}} to play Wicksy with minimal delay. Smith has {{described}} his casting {{as one of}} the fastest on record. [...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately. Berry was whisked into costume and make-up and given a new haircut, which Berry claimed was because the producers wanted to smarten his appearance up. Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday I arrived in Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, whom I had enjoyed watching on the box for some time. For my first few episodes, I walked around with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> my face, grinning at everybody. It was funny." ...|$|E

Before her final match, Louis tells Rose that he had been lying and that he has secretly been recording that her typing speed is regularly faster than her opponent's best record. Angered by his lie, Rose is enraged into winning. Rose is ecstatic at winning and flashes Louis <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> from <b>on</b> stage. After initially being elated, Louis begins to feel inadequate for somewhat ambiguous reasons. He abandons her and their training sessions.|$|R
40|$|On {{his first}} visit to kindergarten, while mother was still with him, Bruce, age five, looked over the {{paintings}} on the wall and asked loudly, "Who made these ugly pictures?" Mother was embarrassed. She looked at her son disapprovingly, and hastened to tell him, "It's not nice to call the pictures ugly when they are so pretty. " The teacher, who understood the meaning of the question, smiled and said, "In here you don't have to paint pretty pictures. You can paint mean pictures if you feel like it. " <b>A</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> appeared <b>on</b> Bruce's face, for now he had the answer to his hidden question: "What happens to a boy who doesn't paint so well?"...|$|R
5000|$|... ‘A lord eh? Chairman eh? And {{what are}} you then, a banker or a lawyer or what?’ said Rickover. ‘What me? No, no, no, no, no! Me, I’m just a mechanic, just a bloody plumber.’ said Hives, with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> board <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> his face. Rickover was thrown, he had not {{expected}} that kind of answer. When Hives explained that he had known Henry Royce himself, had worked for him, and had absorbed from him his passion for engineering excellence Rickover’s mood an attitude started to improve. Hives {{spent much of the}} lunch telling a captivated Rickover about Royce’s obsession with achieving perfection. He then took Rickover on a personal tour of the works, not in a Rolls-Royce or Bentley but in a very modest Hillman.…when Hives returned after showing Rickover around… the Admiral was a changed man, subdued, pleasant, cooperative, uncritical, and no further put-downs or denigrations of British engineering escaped his lips... That hour of dialogue… changed everything in the British nuclear submarine programme.|$|R
2500|$|From {{his first}} {{appearance}} until his death five years later, Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf became a popular character on the show. Never afraid to express himself, Hank would come across completely unguarded. In terms of being belligerent, Hank's manager Doug Z. Goodstein explained that this tended to only occur when Hank was really drunk and people would heckle him. [...] He described Hank [...] "as a relatively soft-spoken polite guy who quite often had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> his face." [...] Behind Hank's public persona, an underlying [...] "good nature" [...] tended to shine through, which fans seemed to recognize. [...] During the first few years, Hank would take the bus from Boston each month {{as soon as he}} got his SSI disability check. [...] Hank was a member of the show's Wack Pack and soon attracted a large informal fan base.|$|E

5000|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} the episode was positive to mixed. Dan Martin of The Guardian praised the writing and acting, but criticised the more minor role of the Doctor in the episode, and the length, which did not do the mythology justice. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times called it [...] "a superb, witty, heart-warming encounter between two heroes," [...] praising Gatiss' [...] "elegant, hugely witty script that delivers a coherent plot," [...] and calling the Doctor and Robin Hood [...] "one of the funniest double acts ever seen in Doctor Who." [...] Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode five stars out of five. He said this was the episode in which [...] "Capaldi truly came into his own as The Doctor," [...] noting his channeling of Malcolm Tucker in his Doctor made for some truly comedic moments. Simon Brew of Den of Geek commended the lightness of the episode, in contrast to Capaldi's opening two episodes and called it [...] "hugely entertaining," [...] and [...] "wonderfully silly." [...] He writes that [...] "Robot of Sherwood" [...] is [...] "the kind of Doctor Who you reach for when you've got a spare hour, and {{just want to get}} <b>a</b> great <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> your face." ...|$|R
5000|$|Walking into a local establishment's {{drinking}} area, Adams sees Sam {{at the bar}} {{and tells}} him that training raw recruits is a thankless task. Sam asks, [...] "What's your rank, Seth?". [...] "Sergeant major, Sam", Adams answers. Sam tells him, [...] "You can lick boys, Seth, but you've got to lead men". Adams invites Sam {{to do a better job}} of training the raw recruits and Sam accepts. He stops drinking and, still wearing his tanner's apron, goes out and tells Adams to [...] "take your post" [...] in line with the men. He asks a man in uniform who has <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> wide <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> his face (unbilled Jack Pennick, who appeared in 41 Ford films 1928 and 1962, the highest number of any member of the Company), [...] "Is that you Tim Molloy?". [...] "Yes, sir", answers Molloy. Sam mentions how they served together in [...] "Mexico, Chapultepec" [...] and tells the men to observe how [...] "to execute the manual of arms" [...] as he puts Malloy through his paces and, over Adams's objections, tells him, [...] "Molloy, you are now acting first sergeant". As the men march through the streets of Galena, Adams' voice is heard narrating, [...] "In about a month, Sam had just worked wonders with that bunch of bedraggled misfits…heh…heh… they were ready for anything… and it was just in time, too, cause the Rebs had fired on Fort Sumter… and the Civil War was on".|$|R

5000|$|Kevin Smith {{gave the}} film a thumbs up during an {{appearance}} {{as a guest}} critic on Ebert and Roeper, saying: [...] "If your kids like poop jokes as much as I do, Open Season will put <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> their faces." [...] However, Richard Roeper gave the film a thumbs down, saying, [...] "It's just okay, the animation is uninspired." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviews for {{the film}} have been average so far. Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times rated it 2.5/5 and felt that the lead actor, Arjun Kapoor, was overshadowed by Anil Kapoor: [...] "It’s just that Anil Kapoor is a pro at it and steals all the limelight from him (Arjun).....You’ll be {{occasionally}} laughing, but probably won’t be leaving the theatre with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> your face.|$|E

5000|$|Captain Rufus Gaele is [...] "a <b>big</b> {{man with}} <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> and <b>a</b> deep laugh", with an infectiously jolly personality. His head was gravely {{injured in the}} {{rebellion}} of the Chiarrizi.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{recently}} interviewed by Lusso magazine. The writer, Oliver Walston, said [...] "He welcomed me with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile,</b> but {{perhaps this is}} because I already own two of his watches".|$|R
5000|$|The Electronic marquee {{situated}} at {{the first floor of}} Soochow University law school is also an attractive feature. The interesting scrolling text often changes with time and combine current events with encouragements to students, for instance, [...] "The FIFA world cup is Brazil's, however, the final exam is yours". Therefore, it is usual to see students stop to watch the scrolling text with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> their faces.|$|E
5000|$|Writing for AllMusic, Jim Newsom commented the [...] "music on this {{recording}} is heavily electronicized [...]. {{but it sure}} {{sounds like a lot}} of fun." [...] He summarised the eponymous track as [...] "a classic of the genre, an upbeat, joyous affirmation of life, featuring a backing vocal from old pal Steve Miller [...]. you'll find yourself walking down the street singing [...] "keep on searching, keep it on the cool side" [...] with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> your face." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bashur {{was pleased}} when this debate {{preparation}} paid a big dividend for Clements. The first question to Clements was about {{balancing the budget}} by cutting waste: [...] "You could just see it click with Clements. He had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> {{his face as he}} pulled the list out of the jacket, and he's got my piece of paper with the items. He doesn't just pick one or two; he reads all fifteen! White got beet red. Clements won the debate. White never got back on track." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{original}} {{image of}} the Sun-Maid Girl is modified for the first time, giving her <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>smile,</b> brighter colors, and a stylized sun. This contemporary look was in style with the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|Another serious {{disadvantage}} is {{that many}} systems are less effective if facial expressions vary. Even <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> can render the system less effective. For instance: Canada now allows only neutral facial expressions in passport photos.|$|R

5000|$|Zeppo's {{parts were}} always {{intended}} to be a parody of the juvenile role often found in sappy musicals of the 1920s-30s era. Sometimes, he would just have a few lines, and he would otherwise be reduced to standing in the background with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> his face. In these roles, he was a lampoon of the infamous extra, always grinning widely as a needless decoration, and always stiff and wooden. In other films, Zeppo would have a more significant role as the romantic lead, but he would still always be stiff, wooden, and, yes, with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> his face. Either way, he could never be considered a real straight man. He was a sappy distortion of the real thing, and sort of the gateway through which we connected with the other Brothers. We perceived him as the [...] "normal, good-looking" [...] one of the bunch, but was he really? Wasn't there something about that line from The Cocoanuts, 'You can depend upon me, Mr. Hammer,' that was a little too ... happy? Roger Ebert called Zeppo 'superfluous,' and that is the point of his character in the five Paramount films. He was the straight man only in pure Marxian sense—while his Brothers spat on movie clichés, he imitated them, proving in his own way to be quite a brilliant comedian.|$|E
5000|$|Atomic Popcorn stated: [...] "Hip-hop and country. Like the Hannah Montana's {{theme song}} says, [...] "You {{get the best}} of both worlds." [...] Ten minutes before the movie started, the two rows of what looked to be 14-year-old girls started singing the TV show theme song. Over and over again. The little 6- to 10-year-old girls that filled the rest of the theater were singing along and dancing in their seats. My 16-year-old {{daughter}} said with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> her face, 'Isn't this fun?' I said, with as much of a smile as I could muster, 'A little bit.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Sometime in the nineties, when a fan {{arrived at}} Sapienza’s house early for a con-planning meeting {{and found her}} gardening, he pitched in to help, {{and one by one}} the other {{committee}} members did so too, as they arrived. Joe Mayhew warned people that if Baltimore won the 1998 Worldcon, all the committee members would wind up mowing Peggy Rae's lawn. Thus was born the phrase “I mowed Peggy Rae's Lawn,” which indicated that people were sucked in when Peggy Rae looked at them and said, with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> her face, “You know, I think you would be good at…” ...|$|E

50|$|Pertry was {{transferred}} from his local team SK Vlamertinge to Cercle Brugge in 1943. He made his début in a 2-2 home draw against Lyra, scoring once. Pertry would especially remember his début {{because when he}} was waiting in Ieper for his train to Bruges, {{some members of the}} Flemish National Union's Black Brigade passed by. One stepped out of his group, went towards Pertry and hit him in the face, telling that the mockery with the Black Brigade should stop once and for all. Pertry didn't know what he had done wrong.
