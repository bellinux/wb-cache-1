We propose a categorization of human activity methodologies and discuss their advantages and limitations. In particular, we divide human activity classification methods into two large categories according to whether they use data from different modalities or not. Then, each of these categories is further analyzed into sub-categories, which reflect how they model {{human activities}} and what type of activities they are interested in. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing, publicly available human activity classification datasets and examine the requirements for an ideal human activity recognition dataset. Finally, we report the characteristics of future research directions and present some open issues on human activity recognition...|$|E
40|$|The {{connection}} between travel and translation is often evoked in contemporary critical theory, both practices seen as metaphors of mobility and flux linked to globalized 'post-modern' society. Travel is <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>activity,</b> encompassing temporary and voluntary displacement, repeated movement, exile, economic migration, diaspora. Places of origin are often plural and unstable, {{in spite of}} the enduring appeal of traditional labels such as 'mother country' or 'patrie'. The multiple interfaces between translation, travel and migration are the focus of all contributions in this special issue. Starting from different points of view, and using a variety of methodologies, the authors raise fundamental questions about {{the way in which we}} perceive the link between language, national or ethnic identity, and individual voice. Topics range from the interaction between travel, travel narratives and translation in early English representations of China, to the special role played by interpreters in mediating the first contact between a literate and a non-literate culture; from the multiple functions and audiences addressed by contemporary Romani literature and its translation, to the political as well a cultural implications of translating popular music across the Bosporus. A number of the articles focus on detailed textual analysis, covering the intersection between exile, self-translation and translingualism in the work of Manuel Puig; the uses and limitations of translation in the works of migrant authors; or the impact on figurations of Europe of experimental work embracing polylingualism. Collectively, these contributions also underline the importance of a closer examination of our assumptions about who the translators and the interpreters are, and what roles they play in our society...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the sport of}} Judo from historical, statistical and scientific perspectives. Modern Judo introduced in 1882 by Professor Jigoro Kano, used the combat element of Jujitsu, stressing the importance of mental and physical preparation. Judo rules evolved with changes in the scoring categories and style of Judo suit. Gradually Judo spread from Japan, and the International Judo Federation was created in 1951, initially consisting of only 12 countries, increasing to 157 in 1992. Statistical analysis of the 1991 World Championships and 1992 Olympic Games showed significant differences in scoring patterns between standing and groundwork techniques {{for male and female}} competitors. Groundwork techniques consistently resulted in Ippon. Uchi-Mata and Seoi-Nage were the most successful standing techniques, whilst Osae-Waza was the most successful groundwork technique for both genders. Based on these observations strength programmes to improve Uchi-Mata and Seoi-Nage were developed. A statistical comparison of the two championships indicated that all subgroups of competitors, except male non-medallists displayed the same scoring patterns. Judo can be considered as <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>activity</b> sport, where flurries of activity are interspersed with periods of recovery. Video analysis of the World Championship and Olympic Games showed that the average activity to recovery ratio was about 1 - 9 : 1. Exercise intensity was studied by measuring cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses to Judo practice and competition. The intensity of exercise, based on blood lactate concentration, during competition was higher than the intensity of exercise during practice. To supplement Judo practice a specifically designed rowing exercise was prescribed. An interval programme was based on the average activity-to-rest ratio determined from the video analysis. Blood lactate concentration was higher, and heart rate lower, for rowing compared to Judo practice. Rowing with short intervals of high intensity separated by short recoveries appears to be a good whole body exercise for conditioning the power endurance component of Judo. Further research is required to confirm this preliminary observation...|$|E

40|$|Small-scale {{fisheries}} {{in developing countries}} are often perceived as being a low-productivity and backward informal sector. As a result they are rarely considered in poverty reduction programmes and rural development planning.

Fishing in this very remote rural region of DRC is operated both by men and women, as part of <b>a</b> household <b>multiple</b> <b>activity</b> livelihood strategy. The data shows that poor households rely heavily on fishing for their supply of protein-rich food, in particular through women's subsistence catches.

40|$|International audienceData {{collection}} from unreachable {{terrain and}} then transmit {{the information to}} the sink is a fundamental task in periodic sensor networks. Energy is a major constraint for this network as the only source of energy is a battery with limited lifetime. Therefore, {{in order to keep the}} networks operating for long time, adaptive sampling approach to periodic data collection constitutes a fundamental mechanism for energy optimization. The key idea behind this approach is to allow each sensor node to adapt its sampling rates to the physical changing dynamics. In this way, over-sampling can be minimised and power efficiency of the overall network system can be further improved. In this paper, we present an efficient adaptive sampling approach based on the dependence of conditional variance on measurements varies over time.

30|$|RQ 2 : Kirsh [11] {{points out}} that {{artifact}} ecologies are never stable because artifacts, tasks, practices, and users constantly interact and co-evolve. This is even more true for personal calendar artifact ecologies which develop from the demands of <b>a</b> person’s <b>multiple</b> <b>activities.</b> The results show instances of minor and major changes of calendar work and corresponding adaptation or extraction processes of existing tools and appropriation processes of new tools respectively. The development of <b>multiple</b> reminders is <b>an</b> example of a minor change of the artifact ecology to strengthen the trigger mechanism for action. An example for a major change is Ben’s appropriation of the GCS offered by his company that first resulted in an expansion of his calendar artifact collection (paper calendar and GCS), and then in an artifact replacement (PDA instead of paper calendar). His use of the digital tool clearly contradicts the above mentioned claims made by Tomitsch et al. [15]. Generally, the appropriation of an artifact can result in an artifact expansion {{because it does not}} fully replace existing artifacts or it is complemented by other new tools, or it can result in a reduction of the artifact collection. Figure 10 illustrates effects of introducing calendar artifacts into, or extracting calendar artifacts from, personal collections.|$|R
