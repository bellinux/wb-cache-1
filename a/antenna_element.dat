25|$|This {{solution}} includes {{near field}} terms {{which are very}} strong near the source but which are not radiated. As seen in the accompanying animation, the E and H fields {{very close to the}} source are almost 90° out of phase, thus contributing very little to the Poynting vector by which radiated flux is computed. The near field solution for an <b>antenna</b> <b>element</b> (from the integral using this formula over the length of that element) is the field {{that can be used to}} compute the mutual impedance between it and another nearby element.|$|E
25|$|Phased array antennas are {{composed}} of evenly spaced similar antenna elements, such as aerials or rows of slotted waveguide. Each <b>antenna</b> <b>element</b> or group of antenna elements incorporates a discrete phase shift that produces a phase gradient across the array. For example, array elements producing a 5 degree phase shift for each wavelength across the array face will produce a beam pointed 5 degrees away from the centreline perpendicular to the array face. Signals travelling along that beam will be reinforced. Signals offset from that beam will be cancelled. The amount of reinforcement is antenna gain. The amount of cancellation is side-lobe suppression.|$|E

30|$|In the future, it is {{believed}} that the MIMO service area will become popular. Therefore, a MIMO relay system is considered. However, in a relay system with one relay, when the number of relay <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> is less than the number of transmitter and receiver <b>antenna</b> <b>elements,</b> the capacity of MIMO relay system is lower than that of the original MIMO system. In addition, when the number of relay <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> is equal to or more than the number of the transmitter and receiver <b>antenna</b> <b>elements,</b> a MIMO relay system can provide the same average capacity as an original MIMO system. In other words, although the number of relay <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> is larger than the transmitter and receiver <b>antenna</b> <b>elements,</b> the capacity of MIMO relay system cannot exceed the channel capacity of original MIMO system [1 – 3].|$|R

25|$|Understanding {{the channel}} allows for {{manipulation}} of the phase and amplitude of each transmitter in order to form a beam. To correctly form a beam, the transmitter needs to understand {{the characteristics of the}} channel. This process is called channel sounding or channel estimation. A known signal is sent to the mobile device that enables it to build a picture of the channel environment. The mobile device sends back the channel characteristics to the transmitter. The transmitter can then apply the correct phase and amplitude adjustments to form a beam directed at the mobile device. This is called a closed-loop MIMO system. For beamforming, it is required to adjust the phases and amplitude of each transmitter. In a beamformer optimized for spatial diversity or spatial multiplexing, each <b>antenna</b> <b>element</b> simultaneously transmits a weighted combination of two data symbols.|$|E
500|$|The term PIFA is {{reserved}} by many authors (e.g. Sánchez-Hernández) for the shorted patch antenna where the <b>antenna</b> <b>element</b> is wide {{with the ground}} plane underneath. [...] The thin line type of inverted-F antennae with the ground plane to one side like A and B in the diagram are just called IFA {{even if they are}} in planar format. [...] An author may even call an IFA of this type a printed inverted-F antenna but still reserve PIFA for the shorted patch type (e.g. Hall and Wang.) ...|$|E
500|$|A printed inverted-F antenna can be {{implemented}} in the classic inverted-F shape, usually {{to one side of}} the circuit board where the ground plane has been removed from underneath the antenna. [...] However, another approach is a modified patch antenna, the shorted patch antenna. [...] In this approach, one edge of the patch, or some intermediate point, is grounded with grounding pins or vias through to the ground plane. [...] This works on the same principle as an inverted-F; viewed sideways, the F shape can be seen, it is just that the <b>antenna</b> <b>element</b> is very wide in the horizontal plane. [...] The shorted patch antenna has a wider bandwidth than the thin line type due to the greater radiation area. [...] Like the thin line type, the shorted patch antenna can be printed on the same printed circuit board as the rest of the circuitry. [...] However, they are commonly printed on to their own board, or on to a dielectric fixed to the main board. [...] This is done so that the antenna, can be suspended and effectively be in air dielectric, is a greater distance from the ground plane than it would otherwise be, or the dielectric used is a more suitable material for RF performance.|$|E
40|$|A compact {{broadband}} {{microstrip antenna}} for mounting {{to one side}} of a ground plane comprises a closed (usually circular) array of <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> positioned {{to one side of}} a substrate for spacing the <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> a selected distance above the ground plane, the <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> being adapted to be electrically driven out of phase from one another to excite one or more spiral modes. In another form, a compact microstrip antenna comprises one or more <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> positioned to one side of a magnetic substrate for spacing the <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> a selected distance from a ground plane, the magnetic substrate being chosen to have a relative permittivity which is roughly equal to its relative permeability. In a third form, a microstrip antenna is adapted for operating in a single mode and radiation from other modes is suppressed by varying the spacing above the ground plane in the radiation zones so that only radiation in the desired mode is fostered. The disclosed antenna achieves a reduction in physical size at a sacrifice of bandwidth and gain. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

We compute the capacity of a 2 x 2 -MIMO system in a one path scenario for square half wavelength patch <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> and half wavelength dipole <b>antenna</b> <b>elements.</b> The capacity of the MIMO system with and without coupling increases compared to the single antenna transmission for the patch <b>antenna</b> <b>elements.</b> On the contrary for half wavelength dipole <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> we have found that the MIMO system degenerates to a one-transmitting, one-receiving antenna system due to mutual coupling...|$|R

2500|$|Another type of {{loading coil}} {{is used in}} radio antennas. [...] Monopole and dipole radio antennas are {{designed}} to act as resonators for radio waves; the power from the transmitter, applied to the antenna through the antenna's transmission line, excites standing waves [...] of voltage and current in the <b>antenna</b> <b>element.</b> [...] To be resonant, the antenna must have a physical length of {{one quarter of the}} wavelength of the radio waves used (or a multiple of that length).

30|$|Simulation {{results show}} that OT cannot always {{outperform}} MRT in a nonfading environment. The optimal technique using OT offers performance gain at high SNR {{when the number of}} interferers is small under the fading condition; however, its performance is degraded by the effect of noise enhancement when the number of receive antennas is relatively small. Moreover, it is preferable to distribute the more number of <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> to the receiver for OT given a fixed number of total <b>antenna</b> <b>elements,</b> unlike the MRT case or the case with interferers greater than total <b>antenna</b> <b>elements,</b> as discussed in [18].|$|R

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of antennas are linearly polarized. In fact it can be shown from considerations of symmetry that an antenna that lies entirely in a plane which also includes the observer, can only have its polarization {{in the direction of}} that plane. This applies to many cases, allowing one to easily infer such an antenna's polarization at an intended direction of propagation. So a typical rooftop Yagi or log-periodic antenna with horizontal conductors, as viewed from a second station toward the horizon, is necessarily horizontally polarized. But a vertical [...] "whip antenna" [...] or AM broadcast tower used as an <b>antenna</b> <b>element</b> (again, for observers horizontally displaced from it) will transmit in the vertical polarization. A turnstile antenna with its four arms in the horizontal plane, likewise transmits horizontally polarized radiation toward the horizon. However, when that same turnstile antenna is used in the [...] "axial mode" [...] (upwards, for the same horizontally-oriented structure) its radiation is circularly polarized. At intermediate elevations it is elliptically polarized.|$|E

Since the beamwidth is proportional to the inverse of effective array size [15], the random antenna selection gives a narrower beamwidth. Finally, the interference with the signals for other users can be mitigated. In the massive antenna array system, we can take advantage of large effective array size by random antenna selection.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transmitter}} module for each <b>antenna</b> <b>element</b> contains a phase shifter which {{can change the}} phase (relative timing) of the oscillating current applied to the antenna, under control of the central computer.

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} cancel the co-channel {{interference}} from all sensors that share the spectrum while achieving the diversity/multiplexing gains. The proposal algorithm uses the precoding at every transmitter; therefore, it is called as co-channel interference cancellation using precoding (CICP) for multiple hop MIMO relay systems. Similar to the smart antenna technology, in the proposed MHMRS, every relay transmits signals to bi-direction in the same channel. The performance of CICP algorithm is analyzed in case the number of <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> is two, the extension to another number of <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> is straightforward. However, the matched/orthogonal weight algorithm cannot perform with two <b>antenna</b> <b>elements.</b> Therefore, the proposal algorithm is compared to the TDMA-based smart antenna algorithm that is available to two <b>antenna</b> <b>elements.</b> The performance of proposal algorithm is analyzed in both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) and a validity is evaluated by numerical calculation of ergodic channel capacity.|$|R
