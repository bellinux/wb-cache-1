5|$|At {{his home}} in Much Hadham, Moore built up a {{collection}} of natural objects; skulls, driftwood, pebbles, rocks <b>and</b> <b>shells,</b> which he would use to provide inspiration for organic forms. For his largest works, he usually produced a half-scale, working model before scaling up for the final moulding and casting at a bronze foundry. Moore often refined the final full plaster shape and added surface marks before casting.|$|E
5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of powder <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had {{a conflict of interest}} in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in the explosion. After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated the explosion using an electrical or chemical detonator.|$|E
5|$|Stone carvings made of jade or serpentinite are in {{the form}} of {{ceremonial}} axe representing clan's strength and power. These were used to behead enemies during war and during ancestor celebrations known as Pilou. The bottom of the handle represents the particular clan and is embellished with stones <b>and</b> <b>shells.</b> The axe is polished smooth like a disc. Carvings made of soapstone are also popular.|$|E

5|$|U.S. {{aircraft}} and ships pounded {{the town with}} rockets, napalm <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> before South Korean troops from the 22nd and 23rd regiments swarmed the town. However, NK 5th Division forces were able to infiltrate the coastal road south of Yongdok at Hunghae. This effectively surrounded the ROK 3rd Division, trapping it several miles above P'ohang-dong. The NK 766th Independent Regiment advanced around the ROK 3rd Division and took the area around P'ohang-dong.|$|E
5|$|By 22 May Chacal was {{reassigned to}} the 2nd DCT when the unit was tasked to carry {{demolition}} teams to the northernmost French ports; the ship arrived at Calais that evening. Together with Léopard and eight smaller destroyers, Chacal bombarded advancing German troops {{as they approached}} the defenses of Boulogne-sur-Mer throughout the 23rd. During the night of 23–24 May, the ship was badly damaged by bombs from Heinkel He 111 bombers <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> from German artillery and had to be beached between Ambleteuse and Wimereux lest she sink.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{ammunition}} is {{a source}} of lead exposure. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 60,000 metric tons consumed in 2012, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can not regulate cartridges <b>and</b> <b>shells,</b> as a matter of law. Lead birdshot is banned in some areas, but this is primarily {{for the benefit of the}} birds and their predators, rather than humans. Non-lead alternatives include steel, tungsten-nickel-iron, bismuth-tin, and tungsten-polymer.|$|E

Animal bone <b>and</b> <b>shell</b> attached to prepared tree limbs were also used for hoes in their gardens. Animal bone was shaped for use as tools. These included awls, punches, fish hooks, bone needles, and hide scrapers. Their jewelry included beads, hair pins, pendants, tinklers, <b>and</b> <b>shell</b> gorgets. These were also made of both bone <b>and</b> <b>shell.</b> Gourds from their garden <b>and</b> turtle <b>shell</b> were used for ceremonial rattles.|$|R

5|$|Paleoclimatologists {{measure the}} ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to {{determine}} the climate {{millions of years ago}} (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> than they would in a warmer climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|Some species live separately, in {{vertical}} tubes {{embedded in}} soft sediment, while others form tangled masses buried in or encrusting rocks <b>and</b> <b>shells.</b> In some habitats populations of phoronids reach tens of thousand of individuals per square meter. The actinotroch larvae are familiar among plankton, and sometimes {{account for a}} significant proportion of the zooplankton biomass. Predators include fish, gastropods (snails), and nematodes (tiny roundworms). One phoronid species is unpalatable to many epibenthic predators. Various parasites infest phoronids' body cavities, digestive tract and tentacles. It is unknown whether phoronids have any significance for humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not listed any phoronid species as endangered.|$|E
5|$|The Somali Civil War {{spread through}} the country during 1990 and {{late in the year}} there was an {{increasing}} level of criminal violence in Mogadishu. By December, the security situation began to deteriorate significantly and on December 5, Ambassador Bishop told an audience at a standing-room only meeting that he was recommending the voluntary evacuation of all dependents (i.e. children and spouses of diplomatic staff) and non-essential personnel. By December 19, the number of official US personnel in the city was reduced from 147 to 37 and of the 90 private Americans in the city, half were estimated to have left. Small-arms fire became a daily occurrence and stray bullets <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> were landing in the embassy complex.|$|E

5|$|The {{enlisted men}} were leery {{of working with}} deadly {{explosives}} but were told by officers that the larger munitions were not active and could not explodethat they would be armed with their fuzes upon arrival at the combat theater. Handling of larger munitions, such as bombs <b>and</b> <b>shells,</b> involved using levers and crowbars from boxcars, {{in which they were}} packed tightly with dunnagelifting the heavy, grease-coated cylinders, rolling them along the wooden pier, packing them into nets, lifting them by winch and boom, lowering the bundle into the hold, then dropping individual munitions by hand a short distance into place. This series of actions was rough enough that damaged naval shells sometimes leaked identification dye from their ballistic caps.|$|E
5|$|These {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} different varieties of ceramics such as {{black and red}} ware, rouletted ware and Russet coated ware, both locally made and imported kinds. Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Other artifacts such as brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items, remains of seeds <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> provide clues {{about the nature of}} the settlements and the other aspects of life during the Sangam age. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in the material records of Tamilakam are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Great Sand Sea, {{the coastal}} {{portion of the}} Libyan Desert is stony rather than sandy, {{but it is no}} less arid, and {{supports}} little vegetation. Close to the coast, the ground was broken by wadis. Military vehicles could traverse the stony desert with little difficulty, although the heat, dust and wind caused their rapid deterioration. Because it was so thinly populated, bombs <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> could be used with minimal risk of civilian casualties. Winter nights could be bitterly cold, yet the days could still be uncomfortably hot. There was almost no food or water, and little shelter from the cold, the heat or the wind. The desert was, however, relatively free from disease.|$|E
40|$|Copernicus UV {{data are}} {{used to examine the}} rich shell {{absorption}} spectra between 1120 and 1140 A in 17 Be <b>and</b> <b>shell</b> stars. Previous observations of the program stars are reviewed, the general appearance of the shell spectra between 1120 and 1140 A is described, <b>and</b> the <b>shell</b> spectra are compared with the spectra of four bright B-type supergiants in the same wavelength region. The line strengths are analyzed to determine quantitative <b>shell</b> strengths <b>and</b> <b>shell</b> column densities; the shell line velocities are discussed in the context of different models. It is shown that UV shell lines can exist in stars with no visible-wavelength shell features, that Fe III shell lines dominate the spectra between 1120 and 1140 A in Be <b>and</b> <b>shell</b> stars with circumstellar absorption features, and that the spectra of Be <b>and</b> <b>shell</b> stars in this region strongly resemble those of supergiants of similar effective temperature...|$|R

5|$|While {{the layout}} of {{internal}} genital ducts and openings of the female genitalia depends upon the taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> of the eggs. Female insects have a system of receptacles and ducts in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts of the female join {{together to form a}} common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') which leads to the vagina.|$|E
5|$|Astorias bridge crew called general {{quarters}} upon sighting the flares {{south of}} Savo, around 01:49. At 01:52, {{shortly after the}} Japanese searchlights came on <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> began falling around the ship, Astorias main gun director crews spotted the Japanese cruisers and opened fire. Astorias captain, awakened to find his ship in action, rushed to the bridge and ordered a ceasefire, fearful that his ship might be firing on friendly forces. As shells continued to cascade around his ship, the captain ordered firing resumed {{less than a minute}} later. Chōkai, however, had found the range, and Astoria was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire. Between 02:00 and 02:15, Aoba, Kinugasa, and Kako joined Chōkai in pounding Astoria, destroying the cruiser's engine room and bringing the flaming ship to a halt. At 02:16, one of Astorias remaining operational main gun turrets fired at Kinugasas searchlight, but missed and hit Chōkais forward turret, putting the turret out of action and causing moderate damage to the ship.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of organisms' {{bodies are}} usually the most {{informative}} type of evidence. The most common types are wood, bones, <b>and</b> <b>shells.</b> Fossilisation is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by erosion or metamorphism {{before they can be}} observed. Hence the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so further back in time. Despite this, it is often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history. There are also biases in the fossil record: different environments are more favorable to the preservation of different types of organism or parts of organisms. Further, only the parts of organisms that were already mineralised are usually preserved, such as the shells of molluscs. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before they can become fossilised. As a result, although there are 30-plus phyla of living animals, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, while US battleships were {{standardized}} {{as much as}} possible, design improvements {{were incorporated}} whenever possible. Most {{of the changes in}} the Tennessees were incorporated prior to any of their keels being laid. However, plans for the underwater protection—the ships' main defense against torpedoes <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> that fell short of the ship but traveled through the water to hit underneath the waterline—could not be worked out in time. The problem was that tests in caissons—experiments that would eventually prove that a series of compartments divided between being filled with liquid and being left empty would be a very effective defense against torpedoes—were not yet complete. In order to commence construction of the ships as soon as possible, bids sent out to shipbuilding corporations noted that if they were selected to build the ships, an alteration to the design of the ships three months after their keels were laid must be allowed.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Woodland Indians {{of eastern}} Iowa participated {{at the edge}} of the Havana and Hopewell {{interaction}} networks. This cultural connection to the East is seen in the construction of large mounds, earthworks, and the trade of exotic goods over very long distances. There were several large earthwork enclosures in Iowa along the Mississippi that date to the Middle Woodland period, but none in the interior of the state, indicating Iowa is the western edge of Havana-Hopewell influence. The Toolesboro Mound Group in Louisa County included a large octagonal earthen enclosure that covered several acres; earthworks of this style are indicative of the monumental construction once seen in Havana, Illinois along the Illinois River and sites in the Ohio River drainage including Chillicothe and Newark, Ohio. Hopewell trading networks were quite extensive, with obsidian from the Yellowstone area, copper from Lake Superior, <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> from the Gulf Coast appearing in Middle Woodland Iowa sites. Sites in eastern Iowa appeared to nucleate, vacating much of the hinterlands. Western Iowa appears to have been not directly involved in this exchange network, and the Havana-Hopewell flourishing did not extend much above the Kansas City area of the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{within a}} coastal plain, the St. Johns River passes through {{an area that}} was at one time barrier islands, coastal dunes, and estuary marshes. The Florida Peninsula was created {{primarily}} by forces and minerals from the ocean. It lies so low that minor fluctuations in sea levels can have a dramatic effect on its geomorphology. Florida was once part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Lying underneath the visible rock formations is a basement of igneous granite and volcanic composition under a sedimentary layer formed during the Paleozoic era 542 to 251 million years ago. During the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years ago), the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by calcium carbonate and formations left by the evaporation of water called evaporites. What covers the peninsula {{is the result of}} simultaneous processes of deposits of sands, shells, and coral, and erosion from water and weather. As ocean water has retreated and progressed, the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times. Waves compressed sands, calcium carbonate, <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> into limestone; at the ocean's edge, beach ridges were created by this depositional forming. North-south axis rivers, such as the St. Johns, were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by swales. As ocean water retreated, lagoons formed in the swales, which were further eroded by acidic water. Barrier islands, furthermore, formed along the Atlantic Coast, surrounding the lagoon with land and forming a freshwater river.|$|E
