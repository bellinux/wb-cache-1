50|$|Ardévol's early {{compositions}} fall generally {{into the}} style of neoclassicism, but later in his life he began to explore the techniques of <b>aleatory</b> <b>music</b> and serialism. Some of his vocal works praise communism and address other political/revolutionary topics.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>aleatory</b> <b>music</b> {{was first}} coined by Werner Meyer-Eppler in 1955 to {{describe}} a course of sound events that is [...] "determined in general but depends on chance in detail". When his article was published in English, the translator mistakenly rendered his German noun Aleatorik as an adjective, and so inadvertently created a new English word, [...] "aleatoric". Pierre Boulez applied the term in this sense to his own pieces to distinguish them from the indeterminate music of John Cage. While Boulez purposefully composed his pieces to allow the performer certain liberties {{with regard to the}} sequencing and repetition of parts, Cage often composed through the application of chance operations without allowing the performer liberties. Another prolific composer of <b>aleatory</b> <b>music</b> was Karlheinz Stockhausen.|$|E
50|$|Shibata {{accepted}} a professorship at Tokyo University of the Arts in 1959, where he remained until 1969, {{and while there}} his compositions incorporated aspects of <b>aleatory</b> <b>music.</b> He wrote pieces which used graphic or artistic scoring notations and made use of microtonal sonorities. From 1973 he composed theater works which combined elements of Japanese folk music with European-derived song structures.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} much {{confusion}} of the terms <b>aleatory</b> and indeterminate/chance <b>music.</b> One of Cage's pieces, HPSCHD, itself composed using chance procedures, uses music from Mozart's Musikalisches Würfelspiel, referred to above, as well as original music.|$|R
5000|$|After World War II, Norwegian music {{began moving}} in a new direction, away from the Nordic and Germanic ideals of the past, and towards a more international, {{especially}} American, British and French, style. Norwegian composers were influenced by {{a wider variety of}} styles that included serialism, neo-expressionism, <b>aleatory</b> and electronic <b>music.</b> [...] New composers of this period included Johan Kvandal, Knut Nystedt, Edvard Hagerup Bull and Egil Hovland. Of especial importance was French neo-classicism, Paul Hindemith and Béla Bartók. During this period, serial music appeared in Norway, led by Finn Mortensen. Later, avant garde composers like Arne Nordheim took advantage of technological developments, using a variety of electronic effects and bizarre instrumentation. Arne Nordheim [...] "is the most important composer of the post-war era". Ever since 1950, Nordheim has had immense influence on Norwegian cultural life. His most famous pieces have served as milestone for contemporary Norwegian music.|$|R
40|$|The Brazilian {{composer}} Cláudio Santoro (1919 – 1989) {{is one of}} {{the major}} figures in twentieth-century Brazilian music. His musical legacy includes nearly five hundred compositions. Among them there are fourteen symphonies, several chamber works, concertos, vocal compositions, one opera, music for films, and seventy-three known works for piano solo. Beginning with his very first compositions, his intense and extremely idealistic personality, always searching for new ideas and new musical expressions, led him to explore diverse idioms in his music. His musical path began with an early twelve-tone period in the 1940 s, defying the traditional nationalistic musical environment in the country. From there came a drastic turn to a nationalistic idiom, motivated by his social ideals. A more subjective nationalistic idiom in the late 1950 s gradually led him to search for new musical paths. A period of experimentation with avant-garde techniques, including <b>aleatory</b> and electro-acoustic <b>music</b> brought him new resources and different colors to his music. In his late years Santoro integrated in his music all his personal searches into a deep and passionat...|$|R
5000|$|Aleatoric music (also <b>aleatory</b> <b>music</b> or chance music; {{from the}} Latin word alea, meaning [...] "dice") is music {{in which some}} element of the {{composition}} is left to chance, and/or some primary element of a composed work's realization is left to the determination of its performer(s). The term is most often associated with procedures in which the chance element involves a relatively limited number of possibilities.|$|E
5000|$|The Bibi-binary {{system for}} numeric {{notation}} (in French système Bibi-binaire, or abbreviated [...] "système Bibi") is a hexadecimal numeral system first described in 1968 by singer/mathematician Robert [...] "Boby" [...] Lapointe (1922-1972). At the time, it {{attracted the attention}} of André Lichnerowicz, then engaged in studies at the University of Lyon. It found some use in a variety of unforeseen applications: stochastic poetry, stochastic art, colour classification, <b>aleatory</b> <b>music,</b> architectural symbolism, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Other early European {{examples}} of <b>aleatory</b> <b>music</b> include Klavierstück XI (1956) by Karlheinz Stockhausen, which features 19 elements {{to be performed}} in a sequence to be determined in each case by the performer [...] A form of limited aleatory was used by Witold Lutosławski (beginning with Jeux Vénitiens in 1960-61) , where extensive passages of pitches and rhythms are fully specified, but the rhythmic coordination of parts within the ensemble is subject to an element of chance.|$|E
50|$|Unmeasured or non-measured prelude is {{a prelude}} {{in which the}} {{duration}} of each note is left to the performer. Typically the term is used for 17th century harpsichord compositions that are written without rhythm or metre indications, although various composers of the Classical music era were composing small preludes for woodwind instruments using non-measured notation well into the 19th century. The form resurfaced in the <b>aleatory</b> <b>music</b> of the 20th century, where various other aspects of performance are also left to free interpretation.|$|E

5000|$|The use of {{found objects}} in modern {{classical}} music is often connected to experiments in indeterminacy and <b>aleatory</b> <b>music</b> by such composers as John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen, {{although it has}} reached its ascendancy in those areas of popular music as well, such as the ambient works of Brian Eno. In Eno's influential work, found objects are credited on many tracks. [...] The ambient music movement which followed Eno's lead has also made use of such sounds, with notable exponents being performers such as Future Sound of London and Autechre, and natural sounds have also been incorporated into many pieces of new-age music.|$|E

He also studied Gregorian chant privately with Paul Anouilh, and Renaissance and Baroque music with Eta Harich-Schneider. He was one of the leading composers who introduced Japanese audiences to new musical styles and devices, including twelve-tone technique, serialism, and <b>aleatory</b> <b>music</b> (Kanazawa 2001). He {{was one of the first}} Japanese composers to embrace electronic music, and also introduced traditional Japanese instruments like the shakuhachi into his compositions. He died, aged 82, on 2 September 2013 (Anon. 2013).|$|E
5000|$|Dusapin {{rejects the}} hierarchical, binary forms of most European music, {{but neither is}} his music aleatory. Dusapin characterizes the European [...] "hierarchical" [...] form as {{thinking}} in terms of variations, so that certain parts are always of more importance than others. Instead of composing in this way, Dusapin seems to compose measure by measure, deciding what he wants to happen next when he gets there. This process slightly alludes to the chance-like aspect of <b>aleatory</b> <b>music,</b> but Dusapin’s music is so precisely composed that it cannot truly be aleatoric. Stoïnova writes, [...] "With regard to Dusapin’s music we can observe a principle of auto-organization and complexity in the compositional system through the integration or assimilation of aleatory disturbances." [...] In other words, Dusapin lets the music go where it will, often evoking aleatory idioms, while still notating everything and maintaining control of his music. He avoids repetition and rejects stability and redundancy in music, which is yet another distinguishing feature of his music.|$|E
5000|$|Rochberg’s String Quartet No. 3 was {{immediately}} controversial. Its aesthetic, {{which appeared to}} draw from older tonal music, was heavily criticized by Rochberg’s academic colleagues. The composer's work was described by some major critics, such as Andrew Porter of The New Yorker, as “almost irrelevant.” At the time, the new music scene in America was dominated by the strict serialism championed by Milton Babbitt, and <b>aleatory</b> <b>music,</b> as championed by John Cage. Rochberg’s music rejected both approaches, focusing instead on a style revolving around expressionism and detailed notation. Describing the controversy that surrounded his music, Rochberg told the Philadelphia Inquirer that [...] "I was accused of betraying, in the following order, {{the church and the}} state, I was a traitor, a renegade." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "If you're going to be a composer you have to have an iron stomach, fire in the belly, and fire in the brain." ...|$|E
40|$|Black and White n. 2 is a {{collection}} of 120 exercises for keyboard instrument(s) written by the Italian composer Franco Donatoni. Conceived as <b>aleatory</b> <b>music,</b> this composition adopts a non-conventional way to encode the score where some parameters are fixed and others are left to chance. In this work, we will describe a Web-based framework that, after inserting user-defined scores in Donatoni's notation, is able to automatically produce score versions compatible with the composer's constraints and executable by a human player. This application produces modern staff notation and can perform it via the Web Audio API. The goal is on one side to revive the interest towards <b>aleatory</b> <b>music</b> literature, and Donatoni's repertoire in particular, and on the other to investigate the compositional and computational process that originate a given score out of many aleatory variants...|$|E

The last - third - chapter deals with improvisation inartificial music of {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, particularly the <b>aleatory</b> <b>music</b> and the so called improvised music. The thesis concentrates on the improvised music phenomenon in detail. Several subchapters explain the relation between improvised music and composition, space, visual arts, written scores, and the usage of traditional and nontraditional musical instruments in this music, and also form, feedback system and the improvised music reduction. The conclusion of this thesis reflects the use of improvisation in an original composition...|$|E
40|$|Background in Audio Processing. Voice {{has been}} widely studied in the Audio Processing field, where {{researchers}} have principally addressed jointly analysis/synthesis {{with the aim of}} creating human-like singing synthesis. However, an appropriate analysis of the voice signal, let us also explore other musical uses. One example are voice-controlled digital synthesizers that use nonsense syllables. Looking at the literature, Sundberg [1] has studied the use of syllables in spontaneous nonsense text singing, which revealed some points about the choice of syllables in syllabling. In the context of Music Information Retrieval, studies such as [2] addressed the use of syllables in Query by Humming systems. Concerning automatic syllabling analysis, we should refer to research in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), where reliable systems use Machine Learning, combining acoustic models with language models. Background in Music history, ethnomusicology and education. Nonsense text singing is often referred as voice instrumental. The voice can represent the aesthetic goal itself where all the possibilities of the voice are used with expressive intentions. Some manifestations are found in contemporary classical music, such as Carl Orff´s use of the voice and Arnold Schoenberg´s ”Sprechstimme”. Luciano Berio and Steve Reich used the voice in <b>aleatory</b> <b>music.</b> In traditional cultures, nonsense voice is used in Carnatic music of South India, Tuvinian throat singing and Hasidic Jews in ”nigunim”. Popular music, mainly jazz, uses the voice as an instrument, such as famous Louis Armstrongs and Ella Fitzgerald´s ”scat singing”[3] and hip-hop uses ”beatboxing ” which involves creating beats, rhythms, vocal scratchin...|$|E
40|$|Title: The {{relationship}} between improvisation and written {{music from the}} galant period to the beginnings of <b>aleatory</b> <b>music.</b> The practice of composing music by improvising on an instrument is rooted in antiquity. By means of musical notation, many works from the past have been preserved from oblivion; but improvisations have been irredeemably lost, {{at least until the}} invention of sonic reproduction. The present study aims to recapture improvised music and the bases from which it developed, ranging in time from the late eighteenth century until {{the first half of the}} twentieth century. The study is focused in particular on keyboard music, since this received the greatest attention from composers who were also great improvisors, and offered the greatest possibilities for polyphonic treatment. Examination of a number of historical documents has made it possible to confirm the continuity of the art of improvisation throughout the entire period studied. This is a period rich in musical personalities who have been studied in their contexts and institutions important to the history of improvisation. Important treatises, such as those by Kalkbrenner, Czerny and TÅrk, have been consulted, in order to comprehend the methods of learning the art of improvisation by means of models. Two elements stand out among the various uses of improvisation required in performance: the cadenza and the prelude. A close analysis and comparison of the models given in the treatises with a representative body of printed works has shown that there is a great similarity of language, harmonic structure, decorative formulas and a series of gestures that reflect an intimate relation between hand and keyboard instrument. These comparisons show that, in spite of an improvisation's intrinsic character of unpredictability, there exists an underlying similarity of formulas. A number of documents dealing the with improvisatory elements in French organ music, and especially the fundamental importance this has had for many authoritative personalities in this field, has shown how improvisation has affected the development of the musical language at the beginning of the twentieth century. A concrete confirmation of the practice, technique and expressive possibilities of improvisation is offered through an analysis of five improvisations at the piano by the French composer Raphael Fumet. ...|$|E

This in turn dictates what some may consider the conservativestyle of most of the music. That is not to say that I believe the music should stand still in terms of some kind of musical 'time-warp'. I have a particular sympathy with the view held by Philip Wilby, that: Composing for brass bands demands that there is a consensus between the composer, players and audience. With each new test-piece the composer can provide the audience with increasing demands without repelling them. If you break this consensus then I'm afraid it doesn't work and you are back to square one. 3 In deciding which works to include in the collection, a number of factors came into play. The degree 'by published works' is without precedent at Salford and, perhaps inevitably, the publications bestride the previously mentioned musical time-line of around fifteen years. Another factor in determining the choice of material was the decision that the collection should be seen to both relate to current Music Department teaching and research, and satisfy the criteria outlined in the University Regulations: 1. That the collection be a "coherent" body of work and a natural extension of the portfolio requirements of the MA compositional studies programme at Salford; 2. That the collection be seen to foster an ethos in which band styles are seen as susceptible to the same serious and dedicated study as accorded to classical "art" music genres. Both brass and wind works are included, the brass music being genre type contest pieces of the kind previously discussed. The characteristics of the latter include the exploitation of specific instrumental techniques (triple-tonguing etc.) and wide dynamic, stylistic and tempo ranges. These parameters are dictated by the rules and pragmatics of contests and may appear to present an unacceptable restriction of compositional freedom. Ironically, my experience has been that, confronted with such a wide range of constraints, the creative process is actually strengthened. This experience is one which is not uncommon to composers of all kinds: [...] my freedom will be so much the greater and more meaningful the more narrowly I limit my field of action and the more I surround myself with obstacles. Whatever diminishes constraint, diminishes strength. The more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one's self of the chains that shackle the spirit. 4 Technical challenges aside, the works demonstrate a range of compositional techniques including exploration of colour and texture, symphonic argument embracing tonal conflicts and resolutions and (briefly) more contemporary techniques including minimalism and <b>aleatory</b> <b>music.</b> It is with these points in mind that the following works are presented: Brass Band Dimensions (1983) 9 ' Symphonic Study No. 1 Boosey & Hawkes Prisms (1988) 13 ' Symphonic Study No. 2 Rosehill Music Publishing The Essence of Time (1990) 13 ' Variations Rosehill Music Publishing On Alderley Edge (1997) IT Tone Poem Gramercy Music Publishing Wind Band Symphony for Winds (1998) 17 ' Rosehill Music Publishing Pentium (1998) 6 ' Overture Gramercy Music Publishin...|$|E
