5|$|On May 3, 1808, Taylor {{joined the}} U.S. Army, {{receiving}} a commission {{as a first}} lieutenant of the Seventh Infantry Regiment. He was among the new officers commissioned by Congress {{in response to the}} Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, in which an American frigate had been boarded by the crew of a British warship, sparking calls for war. Taylor spent much of 1809 in the dilapidated camps of New Orleans and nearby Terre aux Boeufs. Under the command of James Wilkinson, the soldiers at Terre aux Boeufs suffered greatly from disease and lack of supplies, and Taylor was given an extended leave, returning to Louisville to recover. Taylor was promoted to captain in November 1810. His army duties were limited at this time, and he attended to his personal finances. Over the next several years, he began to purchase slaves <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of bank stock in Louisville. He bought a plantation in Louisville for $95,000 that had 83 slaves attached to it, as well as the Cypress Grove Plantation near Rodney, Jefferson County, Mississippi, bringing the total number of slaves under him above 200. In July 1811 he was called to the Indiana Territory, where he assumed control of Fort Knox after the commandant fled. In only a few weeks, he was able to restore order in the garrison, for which he was lauded by Governor William Henry Harrison. Taylor was temporarily called to Washington to testify for Wilkinson as a witness in a court-martial, and so he did not take part in the November 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe against the forces of Tecumseh, a Shawnee chief.|$|E
25|$|Experience in India gave Stephen {{opportunity}} {{for his next}} activity. The government of India had been driven by {{the conditions of the}} Indian judicial system to recast a considerable part of the English law which had been informally imported. Criminal law procedure, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of commercial law, had been or were being put into easily understood language, intelligible to civilian magistrates. The rational substance of the law was preserved, while disorder and excessive technicalities were removed. Using Jeremy Bentham's ideal of codification, he attempted to get the same principles put into practice in the United Kingdom. In spite of six years of effort on this task, Stephen was largely unsuccessful in making any reforms. Stephen also privately published digests in code form of the law of evidence and criminal law.|$|E
25|$|The long {{reign of}} Louis XIV saw {{a series of}} conflicts: the War of Devolution, the Franco-Dutch War, the War of the Reunions, the Nine Years War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. Few of these wars were either clear {{victories}} or definite defeats, but French borders expanded steadily anyway. The {{west bank of the}} Rhine, much of the Spanish Netherlands, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of Luxembourg were annexed while the War of the Spanish Succession saw the grandson of Louis placed on the throne of Spain. The French strategic situation, however, changed decisively with the Glorious Revolution in England, which replaced a pro-French king with an enemy of Louis, the Dutch William of Orange. After a period of two centuries seeing only rare hostilities with France, England now became a consistent enemy again, and remained so until the 19th century. To stop French advances, England formed coalitions with several other European powers, most notably the Habsburgs. While these armies had difficulties against the French on land, the British Royal Navy dominated the seas, and France lost many of its colonial holdings. The British economy also became Europe's most powerful, and British money funded the campaigns of their continental allies.|$|E

500|$|Day took {{advantage}} of the monopoly clause, reestablishing his Edwardian patent for The ABC with Little Catechism. In 1559, he obtained a patent for The Whole Booke of Psalmes, Collected into English Meter, a metrical psalter, compiled mostly by Thomas Sternhold and John Hopkins, that Day first published in 1562. The Stationers' Company guaranteed Day the right to print all [...] "psalmes in metre with note", in other words, psalms with music. Despite the fact that psalmes had usually been learned by rote, the business proved lucrative, reflecting a rise in musical literacy during the period. The Whole Booke of Psalmes became the period's best-selling book and the standard English psalter of its time. Day's monopolies on these perennially popular works would be the basis of great wealth over the years <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of conflict between him and his fellow stationers. In legal proceedings towards the end of Day's life, it was estimated that these particular patents were worth between £200 and £500 per year.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, it was {{announced}} that Conker was retooled into a controversial game titled Conker's Bad Fur Day with a large amount of scatological humour. According to the developers, [...] "We already had the main character (although he was eventually remodeled) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of code already written, so the best option seemed to be to change the game's direction. Mature humor was a key element." [...] Several aspects of the game were designed to attract an adult audience. Unlike in Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, item collecting was mostly discarded and character abilities were simplified with [...] "context sensitive" [...] pads. The game also relies heavily on cutscenes and features a large number of film parodies. Some offensive content was censored under the supervision of Nintendo, including cutscenes with Pokémon and a joke {{at the expense of the}} Ku Klux Klan. Seavor, however, remarked that [...] "pretty much 99.9% of the game remained." ...|$|E

500|$|In London, Grainger's charm, {{good looks}} and talent (with some {{assistance}} from the local Australian community) ensured that he was quickly taken up as a pianist by wealthy patrons, and was soon performing in concerts in private homes. The Times critic recorded after one such appearance that Grainger's playing [...] "revealed rare intelligence <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of artistic insight". [...] In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to Queen Alexandra, who thereafter frequently attended [...] his London recitals. Lowrey, 20 years Grainger's senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours – he termed the relationship a [...] "love-serve job". She {{was the first woman}} with whom he had sex; he later wrote of this initial encounter that he had experienced [...] "an overpowering landslide" [...] of feeling, and that [...] "I thought I was about to die. If I remember correctly, I only experienced fear of death. I don't think that any joy entered into it".|$|E
500|$|During the war, McKinley also {{pursued the}} {{annexation}} of the Republic of Hawaii. The new republic, dominated by business interests, had overthrown the Queen in 1893 when she rejected a limited role for herself. There was strong American support for annexation, {{and the need}} for Pacific bases in wartime became clear after the Battle of Manila. McKinley came to office as a supporter of annexation, and lobbied Congress to act, warning that to do nothing would invite a royalist counter-revolution or a Japanese takeover. Foreseeing difficulty in getting two-thirds of the Senate to approve a treaty of annexation, McKinley instead supported the effort of Democratic Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada to accomplish the result by joint resolution of both houses of Congress. The resulting Newlands Resolution passed both houses by wide margins, and McKinley signed it into law on July 8, 1898. McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan notes, [...] "McKinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of Hawaii, showing... a firmness in pursuing it"; the President told Cortelyou, [...] "We need Hawaii just as much <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> more than we did California. It is manifest destiny." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, Iron Duke was {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet. During 191920, the ship operated in the Black Sea in support of the White Russians during the Russian Civil War. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 mandated that Iron Duke be removed from the active roster. However, she remained with the fleet for a short time, having been transferred to the Atlantic Fleet in 1926. This duty assignment lasted 3 years, after which she was removed from active service. She was demilitarised, {{to be used as a}} training ship. Two of her gun turrets <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of her armour were removed, and her speed was reduced to [...] through the removal of some of her boilers. She was later used as a depot ship in Scapa Flow, starting in 1939. After the outbreak of the Second World War that year, her remaining guns were removed to be used in shore defences. Luftwaffe bombers attacked her on 17 October 1939; while they scored no direct hits, several near misses caused significant damage. After repairs were effected, the ship resumed her duties as a depot vessel until {{the end of the}} war. She was finally sold for scrapping in 1946.|$|E

500|$|White Dog {{quickly became}} a bestseller in the United States after its English release. Phoebe Adams of The Atlantic felt the story was ironic, and noted that it was [...] "presumably" [...] true. She felt the {{depiction}} of Marlon Brando was [...] "tartly funny" [...] and that story as a whole served [...] "as an excuse for Mr. Gary's comments on racial affairs in this country, a matter on which is somewhat less pessimistic than the natives <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> more sensible." [...] The Globe and Mails H. J. Kirchhoff considered it a [...] "riveting, thoughtful work" [...] {{that serves as a}} metaphor for American racism. Julien Roumette felt Romain's depiction of the racial tensions in America at the time was [...] "meticulously reconstituted, with a realistic, even documentary, rather exceptional dimension." [...] Julia Weldon of Harper's Magazine remarked with amusement that the events of the novel were ones that [...] "only a Frenchman" [...] could have found himself in. She felt the novel was a [...] "decathlon event" [...] in which Gary turned a [...] "household crisis into a full-scale allegory." [...] Overall, she praised the book as a [...] "memorable portrait of guilt and largess in black and white", noting she felt Gary had lived to [...] "witness his own maturity" [...] though she also wondered if he stretched the truth to [...] "make himself a legend in his own time." [...] It should be noted that all of these commentators are white and not in the least African-American nor have they lived the Black experience.|$|E
500|$|In 2004 she starred as TV {{journalist}} Romila Dutta in Farhan Akhtar's war drama Lakshya, alongside Hrithik Roshan. The {{film was}} based on the historical events of the 1999 Kargil War; Zinta's character was modelled after TV journalist Barkha Dutt, the only female reporter who covered the conflict. The film was a critical success, yet her performance received mixed reviews; Namarata Joshi of Outlook likened her to [...] "a teenybopper trying to do a TV newsreading skit for her college fest" [...] and Rediff.com concluded, [...] "Zinta has quite a good role <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of footage in the film, and she does a fairly decent job of it without ever being spectacular." [...] Later that year, Yash Chopra cast her opposite Shahrukh Khan as the female lead in the love saga Veer-Zaara, the top-grossing Hindi film of that year both in India and abroad, with revenues of over [...] worldwide. The film, which relates the love story of an Indian officer, Veer Pratap Singh, and a Pakistani woman, Zaara Haayat Khan, had a strong international release, including a screening at the Berlin Film Festival, and won several Best Movie awards at major Indian award functions. For her portrayal of Zaara, a role which required her to master the fine nuances of the Urdu language, Zinta received her fourth Filmfare Best Actress nomination. Variety hailed her as [...] "the most interesting young actress of her generation," [...] writing that she [...] "is her usual lively self as thewillful Zaara." [...] Veer-Zaara was Zinta's second highest-grossing film and third major success in two consecutive years. It marked the beginning of her work with Yash Raj Films, one of the largest production houses in Bollywood.|$|E
500|$|While {{primarily}} {{inspired by}} {{the music of the}} Beatles and other British Invasion bands, acknowledging too the jangle pop and power pop of the period, Big Star also incorporated dark, nihilistic themes to produce a striking blend of musical and lyrical styles. The body of work resulting from the first era was a precursor of the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s, at the same time yielding material today considered an outstanding example of power pop. [...] The stylistic range is evident from modern day critiques. Bogdanov et al., commenting on #1Record in their All Music Guide to Rock, perceive in [...] "The Ballad of El Goodo" [...] a [...] "luminous, melancholy ballad", whereas John Borack's Ultimate Power Pop Guide singles out Radio Citys [...] "September Gurls" [...] as a [...] "glorious, glittering jewel" [...] of power pop. Borack notes too that Third/Sister Lovers is [...] "slower, darker <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> weirder" [...] than the first two albums, identifying [...] "Holocaust" [...] as [...] "Alex Chilton at his haunting best", yet finds [...] "Thank You Friends" [...] exemplifying [...] "left-field gems" [...] also present in which [...] "the hooks are every bit as undeniable" [...] as before. Jovanovic writes that when recording what Peter Buckley in his Rough Guide to Rock terms the [...] "snarling guitar rock" [...] of the first album's [...] "Don't Lie To Me", the band, deeming conventional instruments inadequate for the task, wheeled two Norton Commando motorcycles into the studio and gunned the engines to intensify the song's bridge. Bogdanov et al. reserve [...] "snarl" [...] for a Radio City song, [...] "Mod Lang"; here Buckley writes that [...] "the power of the performance and the erratic mix gave a sense of chaos which only added to the thrill".|$|E
