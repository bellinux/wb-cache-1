50|$|On Laysan Island {{this plant}} {{provides}} the main nesting habitat for the rare Laysan finch (Telespiza cantans). The bird hides its nest in clumps of the grass. The grass also provides important nesting {{cover for the}} rare Laysan duck (<b>Anas</b> <b>laysanensis).</b> It is used by other bird species, such as the brown noddy (Anous stolidus), wedge-tailed shearwater (Puffinus pacificus), and red-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda).|$|R
50|$|The Laysan finch is a generalist, {{feeding on}} seeds, small insects, fruit, carrion (of seabirds and Hawaiian monk seals), and the eggs of nesting seabirds. While unable {{to break into}} the eggs of the larger seabirds (such as {{albatross}} and boobies) they will scavenge from them. They actively take the eggs of smaller seabirds such as those of white tern (Gygis alba) and the endemic Laysan duck (<b>Anas</b> <b>laysanensis).</b>|$|R
50|$|On its {{discovery}} the Laysan finch was an endemic {{resident of}} the small island of Laysan, along with the Laysan rail (Porzana palmeri), the Laysan honeycreeper (Himatione fraithii), the Laysan duck (<b>Anas</b> <b>laysanensis),</b> and the Laysan millerbird (Acrocephalus familiaris familiaris). Populations were introduced to several islands, including Pearl and Hermes Atoll, where the species persists, and Midway Atoll, where it survived until the introduction of rats. The fossil record shows that the finch once had a greater range in Hawaii, reaching as far as Oahu, and that birds on Laysan represent a relict population.|$|R

40|$|The Laysan Teal <b>Anas</b> <b>laysanensis</b> is {{endemic to}} the Hawaiian Islands, {{where it has}} been {{restricted}} to Laysan Island over the last 150 years. Individuals of this endangered species have recently been translocated to the two largest islands that comprise Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, {{to reduce the risk of}} the Laysan Teal becoming extinct. Post-release monitoring with the aid of radio-telemetry was conducted to determine the success of the reintroduction attempt during October 2004 – 2007. The population was found to have increased after three breeding seasons, from forty-two founders sourced directly from Laysan, to a population of ≥ 192 post-fledglings juveniles and adults. Many island ecosystems have undergone catastrophic species losses, largely due to the effects of introduced species. Fortunately, an “insurance policy ” is being implemented for one member of the world’s rapidly disappearing island birds. Hawaii has lost at least seven of its 10 known endemic waterfowl species since humans colonised the islands, and the remaining three specie...|$|R
5000|$|The Hawaiian duck (Anas wyvilliana) or koloa is {{a species}} of bird in the family Anatidae that is endemic to the large islands of Hawaii. Taxonomically, the koloa is closely allied with the mallard (A. platyrhynchos),. It differs {{in that it is}} {{monochromatic}} (with similarly marked males and females) and non-migratory. As with many duck species in the genus Anas, Hawaiian duck and mallards can interbreed and produce viable offspring, and the koloa has previously been considered an island subspecies of the mallard. However, all major authorities now consider this form to be a distinct species within the mallard complex. Recent analyses indicate that this is a distinct species that arose through ancient hybridization between mallard and Laysan duck (<b>Anas</b> <b>laysanensis).</b> The native Hawaiian name for this duck is koloa maoli (meaning [...] "native duck"), or simply koloa. This species is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and its population trend is decreasing.|$|R
2500|$|The Laysan duck (<b>Anas</b> <b>laysanensis),</b> {{also known}} as the Laysan teal, is a dabbling duck endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. [...] Fossil {{evidence}} reveals that Laysan ducks once lived across the entire archipelago, but today survive only on Laysan Island. The duck has evolved several behavioral traits linked to the absence of ground-based predators in its habitat; these include freezing or running to escape danger rather than flying, which made the duck vulnerable to hunting by humans, and the pigs, rats and mongooses they brought with them to Hawaii. By 1860, the ducks had disappeared from everywhere except Laysan Island. The introduction of rabbits brought the bird to the brink of extinction in 1912 with twelve surviving individuals. Rabbits were eradicated from the island in 1923 and numbers of Laysan ducks began to rise, reaching 500 by the 1950s. In an effort to ensure the long-term future of this duck, 42 birds were translocated to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in 2002. These thrived in their new surroundings, and another group were later relocated to Kure Atoll.|$|R
50|$|As the {{vegetation}} disappeared, the bird suffered increased egg predation by Laysan finches (Telespiza cantans), ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and bristle-thighed curlews (Numenius tahitiensis), {{as well as}} increased competition for food and nesting habitat; {{a small patch of}} tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca) was the only locality left where the millerbird, the Laysan rail (Porzana palmeri) and the Laysan honeycreeper (Himatione fraithii) could nest with a reasonable chance of success. Additionally, the moths which formed its main food source became likewise extinct or exceedingly rare as their food plants were eaten by the rabbits, and thus the only significant food left were brine flies, which, though abundant, would also be utilized by the other land birds and the Laysan duck (<b>Anas</b> <b>laysanensis),</b> all of which were more aggressive than the millerbird. It is most likely that the Laysan millerbird {{was the first of the}} three avian taxa to have gone extinct on Laysan, the last individuals of the apapane disappearing in a sandstorm around April 24, 1923 and the rail also disappearing around that time.|$|R

40|$|Early nineteenth-century {{accounts}} {{suggest that}} there were ducks and rails on Lisianski Island, although neither were present in 1891 when the first ornithological collector visited the island. Excavations and surface searches on the island in 1990 uncovered numerous bones of the Laysan Duck (<b>Anas</b> <b>laysanensis</b> Rothschild), indicating that there once was a resident population. A single coracoid of a small rail (Porzana) probably came {{from one of the}} 45 individuals of Laysan Rail (P. palmeri Frohawk) that were introduced in 1913 and quickly died out, because no further evidence of rails or other land birds was found. Extinction of the duck may have been due to predation by survivors of mid-nineteenth-century shipwrecks and possibly to competition for food from introduced House Mice (Mus musculus Linnaeus). The land birds of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands were derived partly from Asia and partly from species that were formerly widespread in the lowlands of the main Hawaiian Islands. They are not, therefore, a collection of ancient relicts of a montane biota as has been hypothesized. The terrestrial avifauna of Nihoa is depauperate even for an island of its size and may have suffered prehistoric human-caused extinctions...|$|R
40|$|The Laysan Teal <b>Anas</b> <b>laysanensis</b> is an {{endangered}} anatid of the Hawaiian Islands, currently restricted to an emergent atoll, Laysan Island. Laysan Island lacks terrestrial mammalian predators, which permits {{the examination of}} mortality rates and causes without the anthropogenic effects of introduced predators. Mass and morphometrics were measured during the colour-marking of 297 Laysan Teal between 1998 and 2001. Intensive mark-resighting and recovery methods were used to estimate adult and juvenile mortality. One hundred and nineteen carcasses were collected on Laysan between 1998 and 2003, and systematic gross and microscopic examinations were undertaken on 63 of these. Causes of mortality were categorised as trauma, emaciation, miscellaneous or undetermined. Annual adult mortality rates were low, 0. 05 – 0. 10 (s. e. < 0. 01), but duckling mortality was much higher, varying from approximately 0. 7 - 0. 9 during 1998 – 2000 and 2003. Body condition of both sexes deteriorates during the breeding season, and most adult mortality (88 %) occurred during or post-breeding (May–October). Cause of mortality was determined via necropsy in 22 ducks. Of three adults, one died from bacterial infections, one was egg bound, and one died from botulism concomitant with nematode infestation. Fourteen ducklings died from acute trauma, four from emaciation sometimes associated with nematode infection, and one from bacterial pneumonia. Trauma is {{a significant factor in}} Laysan duckling mortalities, and elucidating the cause of and preventing such trauma may allow for management measures to enhance duckling survivability. High duckling mortality rates and emaciation also indicate that habitat on Laysan Island may have limited capacity to support broods...|$|R
40|$|The Laysan teal (<b>Anas</b> <b>laysanensis)</b> is an {{endangered}} dabbling duck endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago but currently restricted {{to a single}} breeding population on Laysan Island. We studied its diet using fecal analysis and behavioral observations. Laysan teal fecal samples (N= 118) contained prey items in 15 primary prey categories {{with a mean of}} 2. 9 (range 0 - 7) taxa per sample. Sixty-two of these fecal samples were quantified with 2, 270 prey items identified (mean items per sample 37; range 0 - 205). Based on fecal analysis and behavioral observations, we learned that the Laysan teal is not strictly a macroinsectivore as previously reported, but consumed seeds, succulent leaves, and algae, in addition to adult and larval diptera, ants, lepidoptera, coleoptera, and Artemia. We compared abundance of invertebrates from two terrestrial foraging substrates, soil and standing vegetation, to the abundance of invertebrate prey items counted in fecal samples collected from these habitats for the same period. In the soil substrate, Laysan teal selected two of the most abundant invertebrates, lepidoptera larvae and coleoptera. In the standing vegetation, Laysan teal selected the most abundant taxa: coleoptera. Amphipods were consumed in proportion to their abundance, and small gastropods (Tornatellides sp.), isopods, and arachnids were avoided or were identified in fecal matter in disproportion to their abundance in the foraging habitat. We compared fecal composition of samples collected in aquatic and terrestrial habitats and detected significant differences in samples’ species compositions. The conservation implications of the adult Laysan teal’s diet are positive, since results indicate that the Laysan teal are opportunistic insectivores, and exhibit dietary flexibility that includes seeds and other food. Dietary flexibility improves the possibility of successfully reestablishing populations on other predator-free islands...|$|R
40|$|Conservation biology {{strives to}} {{conserve}} biodiversity and biological processes in ecosystems, of which genetic variation {{is a key}} component. Genetic variation is the underlying foundation of higher levels of biodiversity (e. g. populations and species). Without genetic variation, populations could not evolve and adapt to future environmental changes. Because DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is fundamental to all biological systems, the practice of conservation often requires genetic studies. Beyond the measurement and conservation of genetic variation per se, the uses of molecular genetic techniques in conservation biology include: 1. identification of individuals, species, populations and conservation units; 2. detection of hybrid zones and admixed populations; 3. quantification of dispersal and gene flow; 4. estimation of current and historical population size; 5. assessment of parentage, relatedness, reproductive success, mating systems and social organization. Molecular markers also assist forensic detection of illegally killed and trafficked plants and animals or their body parts. Finally, markers that are under selection (and thus influence fitness) can identify locally adapted populations that could have special value for conservation. Two developments in molecular biology have had unprecedented significance for conservation biology: the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) process and the discovery of microsatellites. Since its development in 1985, PCR has transformed the life sciences, including conservation biology, due to the ease (and still declining cost) with which it generates millions of copies of any DNA fragment from minuscule quantities. The PCR technique has allowed the non-destructive study of living specimens and their long-dead ancestors. A surge of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence studies on phylogeny, hybridization and gene flow among populations ensued, including some based on fragments of museum skins and specimens preserved in ethanol (Brown 2 ̆ 6 Brown 1994). For example, ancient bones of the Laysan duck (<b>Anas</b> <b>laysanensis)</b> were identified by mtDNA analysis from lava tubes on the main Hawaiian islands, where they apparently had become extinct (Cooper et al. 1996). These data justified reintroduction and suggested that many island endemics may be relics of former cosmopolitan species (Wayne et al. 1999). Microsatellites consist of a length of DNA in which sequences of one to four nucleotides are repeated many times (e. g. [AC]n, where n = 5 to 50 repeats). The number of repeats defines an allele at a locus. Microsatellites are typically highly variable, often with 3 ̆e 10 alleles per locus in a population. They are widely dispersed in eukaryotic genomes and inherited in a Mendelian fashion. They can be amplified by PCR from only tiny amounts (one-to-several molecules) of DNA and thus can be salvaged from partially degraded DNA, such as in museum skins, dried faeces or fossil bones. Because of these features, microsatellites have become {{the most widely used}} molecular genetic marker. Numerous other PCR-based molecular markers and analysis systems exist, including SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), and direct sequencing of PCR products (see Sunnucks (2000), Morin et al. (2004) and (Schlotterer 2004) for reviews). Genetics is a key component of many aspects of conservation biology. From the design of reserves to the management of breeding programmes, molecular techniques are indispensable and are increasingly being used to address questions of conservation relevance. Molecular biology is undoubtedly the fastest evolving field of science. Conservation biologists can make use of these emerging techniques, which are rapidly transforming the field to one that is more molecular oriented. Conservation biology is an inexact science because new crises emerge every day and in most cases solutions are but extrapolations from related cases. Molecular biology is helping to change that trend by allowing conservation biologists to quickly scan a wide range of individual and population characteristics at a given site. Genetic data are most useful in conjunction with more traditional data, such as demographics, life history, distribution, etc. Rapid gain of detailed information on a population at risk may allow better understanding of the system at hand, and more sound recommendations for the decision makers...|$|R
