5|$|Cirrus clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} and moon. Halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds, which, depending on their shape <b>and</b> <b>orientation,</b> {{can result in a}} wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky. Common halo varieties are the 22° halo, sun dogs, the circumzenithal arc and the circumhorizontal arc (also known as fire rainbows). Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{stars have}} been {{important}} to civilizations throughout the world. They {{have been part of}} religious practices and used for celestial navigation <b>and</b> <b>orientation.</b> Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Termites use {{sophisticated}} {{means to}} control the temperatures of their mounds. As discussed above, the shape <b>and</b> <b>orientation</b> of the mounds of the Australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during the day. As the towers heat up, the solar chimney effect (stack effect) creates an updraft of air within the mound. Wind blowing across {{the tops of the}} towers enhances the circulation of air through the mounds, which also include side vents in their construction. The solar chimney effect has been in use for centuries in the Middle East and Near East for passive cooling, as well as in Europe by the Romans. It is only relatively recently, however, that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture. Especially in Africa, the stack effect has become a popular means to achieve natural ventilation and passive cooling in modern buildings.|$|E

To conduct the analysis, the study applies structural equation modeling (SEM) to understand the direct effects of entrepreneurial on market <b>and</b> technology <b>orientations</b> <b>and</b> the direct effects of market <b>and</b> technology <b>orientations</b> on firm performance. This research {{is based on a}} study of 347 technologies intensive Korean SMEs and the major results are as follows: The results indicate that entrepreneurial orientation directly affects market <b>and</b> technology <b>orientations.</b> This result implies that entrepreneurial orientation is key factors that influence market <b>and</b> technology <b>orientation</b> in Korean SMEs. Another finding suggests that market <b>and</b> technology <b>orientations</b> positively affect firm performance. It appears that Korean companies require the capability to serve technology well, but also need to recognize new business opportunities from within their current market relationships. The implication here is that for Korean technology intensive small firms, entrepreneurial orientation can improve market <b>and</b> technology <b>orientations.</b> The results suggest that to achieve high levels of firm performance, Korean companies need t...|$|R

5|$|A known {{historical}} {{resident of}} Zaprešić was Count Josip Jelačić of Bužim (1801–59), the Ban of Croatia from 1848 until his death. Although born in Novi Sad, Serbia (then Habsburg Monarchy), {{he received an}} estate in Zaprešić together with his title. He is responsible for abolishing serfdom in Croatia in 1848, but also for an infamous suppression of Croatian intelligentsia, and the Illyrian movement during his reign under the orders of Baron Alexander von Bach, and Emperor Franz Joseph I. A statue of Jelačić riding a horse was constructed by Anton Dominik Fernkorn, and placed on the Zagreb's central square, Ban Jelačić Square. The statue has been repeatedly removed, and reinstated during changes in political power <b>and</b> <b>orientation</b> in Croatia, from monarchist, through ultra-nationalist, and communist, up to democratic. After the Croatian declaration of independence, marking {{the start of the}} democratic era, the statue was returned to the square, and Zaprešić credits Jelačić with a major arterial road named in his honor.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFrom the resource-based perspective, {{entrepreneurial}} <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> market <b>orientation</b> are {{two separate}} but complementary strategic orientations that emphasize the business philosophy and behavior in proactively detecting industrial environment, including market information and competitors strategy, {{in order to}} innovate {{and respond to the}} customers needs timely. Empirical studies have separately discussed the variables of entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> market <b>orientation</b> in relation to firm-level innovation performance. However, there is limited research simultaneously examined the direct effect of entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> market <b>orientation</b> on innovation performance, especially individual-level innovation performance. Scholars have suggested that future research may examine strategic human resource practices to explore if organizational factors may enhance or diminish the entrepreneurial orientation on innovation. Both entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> market <b>orientation</b> still require organizational learning practices to facilitate higher-order learning and innovation. Although scholars are interested in figuring out if additional moderator variables simultaneously affect market <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> on firm performance, limited empirical studies have existed. An organization with high degree of entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> market <b>orientation</b> still require learning orientation mechanism to create an environment where mutually beneficial relationships between employees and their organizations to facilitate learning and innovation. Therefore, learning orientation may make an organization innovate effectively. As a result, the overall {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the influence learning orientation on relationships between entrepreneurial <b>orientation,</b> market <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> individual-level job related performance variable, employee innovative behaviors...|$|R

After this the Agena would be used as fuel to put the SAINT in a co-orbit with its target, and then the SAINT would locate the target using its long range radar, and jettison its Agena once it had acquired the target. Then within the next 8 to 12 minutes the SAINT's radar <b>and</b> <b>orientation</b> systems would guide it to within 39ft (12m) of the target. If a SAINT was launched from Cape Canaveral, it {{would be able to}} provide initial video of the target and data dumps to the NORAD station in Rhodesia. A full inspection of the target would take two hours, and be recorded, then sent to a ground station as soon as it came within the range of the station.
