5|$|On the {{day they}} set out, Australian airmen {{reported}} that the garrisons at El Arish and Maghara Hills, in {{the centre of the}} Sinai, <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, as Travers {{recovered}} in hospital, the second survivor Des McAlea gave the police {{a description of}} McDowell as the gunman with a moustache and wearing dark glasses who <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{the leader of the}} patrol.|$|E
50|$|Bullet <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> near superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and durability. He also <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an {{immunity}} <b>to</b> {{toxic chemical}} waste.|$|R
50|$|Dancie's {{work does}} not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been reprinted after 1623, {{nor does he}} <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{referenced}} in any future text.|$|R
25|$|This virus <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{evolved in}} the Pacific Northwest of North America. It <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> diverged into several strains ~300 years ago.|$|R
5|$|As First Lady, {{she became}} influential. She stirred {{controversy}} after {{an assassination attempt}} against her occurred on 7 December 1972, when an assailant tried to stab her with a bolo knife but was shot by the police.The motive <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been her role in her husband's presidency but human rights dissidents believed it was staged by the government.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Prime Minister Holt {{vanished}} while {{swimming in}} rough seas near Melbourne; his body was never recovered. John McEwen, {{as leader of the}} junior Coalition partner, the Country Party, took over as prime minister for three weeks until the Liberals could elect a new leader. Senator John Gorton won the vote and became prime minister. The leadership campaign was conducted mostly by television, and Gorton <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the visual appeal needed to keep Whitlam out of office. Gorton resigned his seat in the Senate, and in February 1968 won the by-election for Holt's seat of Higgins in Victoria. For the remainder of the year, Gorton <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the better of Whitlam in the House of Representatives. In his chronicle of the Whitlam years, however, speechwriter Graham Freudenberg asserts that Gorton's erratic behaviour, Whitlam's strengthening of his party, and events outside Australia (such as the Vietnam War) ate away at Liberal dominance.|$|E
5|$|Enron was {{estimated}} to have about $23 billion in liabilities from both debt outstanding and guaranteed loans. Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase in particular <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> significant amounts to lose with Enron's bankruptcy. Additionally, many of Enron's major assets were pledged to lenders {{in order to secure}} loans, causing doubt about what, if anything, unsecured creditors and eventually stockholders might receive in bankruptcy proceedings.|$|E
50|$|The virus <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{evolved in}} North America. European strains <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{evolved from a}} single {{genotype}} (M) suggesting a single introductory event.|$|R
50|$|Internally {{ceilings}} {{are lined}} with v-jointed boards but walls <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been re-lined when refurbishments have taken place. Some internal walls <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been removed.|$|R
50|$|The family <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{originated}} in the east, likely on Kosrae, and spread westwards. Kosrae <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been settled from the south, {{in the region of}} northern Vanuatu.|$|R
5|$|For example, in the 17th century, {{the solar}} cycle <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were {{observed}} {{during a period}} known as the Maunder minimum. This coincided {{in time with the}} era of the Little Ice Age, when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures. Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|From early childhood, Johnson {{suffered}} from poor eyesight, especially {{in his left}} eye, which interfered with his education. There were somewhat contradictory reports about his eyesight from his contemporaries. He <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been near-sighted, yet he did not use eyeglasses. His eyesight became worse with age; still, his handwriting remained quite legible.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, Icke {{launched}} an internet television station, The People's Voice, broadcast from London. He founded the station after crowdsourcing over £300,000 {{and worked for}} it as a volunteer until March 2014. As of that year, the station <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> stopped broadcasting.|$|E
50|$|They <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{evolved from}} the Eugregarinorida. Merogony {{as part of the}} life cycle {{separates}} them from the Eugregarinorida and <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been derived as a secondary characteristic.|$|R
50|$|The strains {{circulating}} in Latvia <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> originated from both Russia and Western Europe while those in Estonia <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> originated in Russia. The Lithuanian strains <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> {{be related to}} those from Western Europe.|$|R
50|$|Immediately as the {{war ended}} the group {{headquarters}} was at Heliopolis, and it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> included the Lancasters which at that time formed MEDME's strike force. The squadrons concerned <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been Nos 37 and 38 Squadrons, both located at Ein Shemer in Palestine. Both squadrons <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been moved <b>to</b> Malta as the final withdrawal from Palestine began after October 1947.|$|R
5|$|It was {{the first}} time the court had {{considered}} an entrapment case from outside the realm of controlled-substance enforcement, or one involving conduct that had only recently been criminalized. By relying exclusively on whether the defendant had a predisposition to commit the crime, the court <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> finally resolved a lingering issue in its previous decisions on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Just as the furore <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> died down, in April 1952 Sydney's Daily Mirror {{published}} {{a letter from}} a reader, Jacob Raith. Responding to a letter in support of Barnes, Raith sided with the Board and suggested that his character was to blame for the omission. Acting on legal advice, Barnes sued Raith for libel and engaged Sydney's leading barrister, Jack Shand KC, as counsel.|$|E
5|$|Like modern crocodilians, pterosaurs <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had {{a hepatic}} piston, seeing as their shoulder-pectoral girdles were too {{inflexible}} {{to move the}} sternum as in birds, and they possessed strong gastralia. Thus, their respiratory system had characteristics comparable to both modern archosaur clades.|$|E
50|$|The Samhan are {{generally}} considered loose confederations of walled-town states. Each <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had a ruling elite, whose power was {{a mix of}} politics and shamanism. Although each state <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had its own ruler, {{there is no evidence}} of systematic succession.|$|R
50|$|In primary biliary {{cirrhosis}} DQ6.2 <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a negative}} association with disease. DQ6.2 also <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a protective effect in juvenile diabetes. DQ6.2 is also protective against infantile spasms in mestizos.|$|R
5000|$|There <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a {{selective}} sweep in Africa which reduced {{the incidence of}} this antigen there. This sweep <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> occurred between 6,500 and 97,200 years ago (95% confidence interval) ...|$|R
5|$|On 20 October 1778, Boyle Roche married Mary Frankland of Great Thirkleby Hall, near Thirsk, Yorkshire, {{daughter}} of Admiral Sir Thomas Frankland, Bt, whose family name {{goes back to}} the time of William the Conqueror. Although childless, Boyle and Lady Mary <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lived a life of uninterrupted happiness.|$|E
5|$|Police, who {{normally}} {{are not known}} to carry fire extinguishers on duty, <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> used almost 25 pieces of fire-fighting equipment on hand {{on the day of}} the self-immolations. The nearest building is 10 minutes away and footage shows that only two police vehicles were at the scene. The flames were put out in less than a minute's time.|$|E
5|$|The {{driving force}} behind the {{government}} assault on the Buddhists <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> come from senior military commanders acting without consulting the civilian government. Immediately after the attacks, posters were erected across Saigon under the aegis of ARVN, but the language was recognized as that of Nhu.|$|E
25|$|El Zotz <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{passed through}} a period of renewed {{prosperity}} during the Late Classic and the city would have had close interactions with its near neighbours, such as Tikal, Uaxactun, Motul de San José and El Tintal. El Zotz <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been particularly densely inhabited during the Terminal Classic. Although El Zotz <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> received strong influences from Tikal, it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> taken its place in the larger political rivalry between Tikal and Calakmul and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> aligned itself with Tikal's great enemy in order to gain local advantage. When Tikal recovered from its misfortunes it appears that El Zotz was unable to survive its attentions.|$|R
50|$|The {{myrosinase}} from Brevicoryne brassicae <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> evolved {{separately from}} myrosinases found in plants, possibly {{a case of}} convergent evolution. Aphid myrosinase <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> greater similarity <b>to</b> animal beta-O-glucosidases than to plant myrosinases.|$|R
25|$|The Old World and New World viruses <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> diverged between 2000 and 3000 years ago. Divergence {{between the}} Venezuelan equine {{encephalitis}} virus {{and the eastern}} equine virus <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been ~1400 years ago.|$|R
5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with them about {{the success of their}} {{performance}} that night. As Crozier took down the information, a car pulled up and another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal fall out of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was further criticised by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> greater performance capabilities, and would be cheaper to implement.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:00pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon {{returned home}} from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon {{had been trying to}} contact her by phone and text, but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon called her again, but her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat, which was still in the flat. He found that her purse and keys were also at the flat, and that their cat <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E
50|$|Compounding <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a {{much more}} {{productive}} process at an earlier stage of the language. It now has very limited productivity, and in many cases, it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been completely lexicalized it it occurs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{high point}} of {{individual}} memberships <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been in 1950, when SNPJ had 71,554 members. The {{high point of}} lodge membership <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been in 1946, when SNPJ was composed of 614 active lodges.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} some {{differences}} in the propensity of individual agents to cause gastrointestinal ADRs. Indomethacin, ketoprofen and piroxicam <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the highest prevalence of gastric ADRs, while ibuprofen (lower doses) and diclofenac <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lower rates.|$|R
