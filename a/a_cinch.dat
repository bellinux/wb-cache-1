25|$|You {{hear a lot}} {{of third}} baseman raving about the hard chances they get, but any time the shortstop is looking for a berth that is nice and quiet and restful in {{comparison}} to his own he casts longing glances at third. Look up the records and see what becomes of the shortstops who get too old to cover all the ground between second base and the foul line. A lot of them camp on third for a while. And why shouldn't they? A man can play third when he can't play short. That's <b>a</b> <b>cinch.</b>|$|E
500|$|Regardless of her {{popularity}} and sex appeal, Monroe wished to present {{more of her}} acting range, and {{in the summer of}} 1952 she appeared in two commercially successful dramas. The first was Fritz Lang's Clash by Night, for which she was loaned to RKO and played a fish cannery worker; to prepare, she spent time in a real fish cannery in Monterey. She received positive reviews for her performance: The Hollywood Reporter stated that [...] "she deserves starring status with her excellent interpretation", and Variety wrote that she [...] "has an ease of delivery which makes her <b>a</b> <b>cinch</b> for popularity". The second film was the thriller Don't Bother to Knock, in which she starred as a mentally disturbed babysitter and which Zanuck had assigned for her to test her abilities in a heavier dramatic role. It received mixed reviews from critics, with Crowther deeming her too inexperienced for the difficult role, and Variety blaming the script for the film's problems.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{surviving}} synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Julia Seaton, a rich heiress, has two suitors, Dr. John Seymour, a wealthy physician, and Richard Calhoun, a poor lawyer. They both propose in the same evening, but while inclined to prefer John, Julia has not yet made a definite choice, and tells both {{to come back in}} a month for their answer. The scene shifts to the squalid home of the charwoman, Mrs. Smith, who, ill in bed and unable to earn the rent money, is about to be evicted with her tiny daughter May. The mother faints from weakness, and May rushes for a doctor. She sees Seymour's sign in a window, and asks him to help her mother. Then the man shows his caliber. Because she has no money, he turns her away. Calhoun, the lawyer, meets May, learns of her plight, and, although poor, pays the overdue rent, and the family moved back in the house. But the privation she has suffered proved fatal to the mother and tiny May is left an orphan. On her death bed, Mrs. Smith is found by Miss Seaton, who is visiting the poor quarters on charity work, and on the charwoman's passing, society girl adopts poor little May. The child becomes a happy member of the Seaton family {{and at the end of}} the month is a fast friend of the kind-hearted Julia. At the end of a month, too, Julia prepares to decide who shall be her life partner, as promised. But it is little May who really decides. At sight of Seymour, she recalls the physician who turned her away, and denounces him to his own and Miss Julia's face. May recognizes Calhoun as the friend in need, and tells Miss Julia so. The latter feels that Calhoun is a real man and would make a splendid husband, so it's <b>a</b> <b>cinch</b> that 'the best man wins.'" ...|$|E

The padded shoulder, tubular, boxy line, and short skirt (that had been around since before the war and was identified with uniforms) was gone.

There was substantial functional improvement (assessed by New York Heart Association functional class, 6 -minute walk test, and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire) at 1 -month and 6 -month follow-up.
