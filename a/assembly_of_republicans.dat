5000|$|In 1793, {{political}} chaos reigned. The Jacobins, {{the leading}} political {{force of the}} era, now allied with the sans-culottes and the Cordeliers, a radical political club in Paris. The coalition took the extreme left position, supporting price controls and ruthless punishments against those who disputed their views. Rivaling them was the Girondins, who maintained support for a free market. In February 1793, {{a group of women}} from the Section des Quatre Nations requested the use of the meeting hall of the Jacobins for a meeting of their own. The Jacobins refused. Some say that they feared a [...] "massive women's protest". The group of women, who now called themselves the <b>Assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> Women, persisted and received permission from the Fraternal Society of Patriots of Both Sexes to use their meeting hall. This Assembly's main aim was toward economic stability. However, for some this was not enough. They wanted more political activity. On May 10, 1793, the Society <b>of</b> Revolutionary <b>Republican</b> Women was formed; it was a feminist society, yet saw its role of defending the revolution. Founders of this society Pauline Léon and Claire Lancombe officially registered The Society <b>of</b> Revolutionary <b>Republican</b> Women at the Paris Commune: [...] "Several citoyennes presented themselves to the secretariat of the municipality and…declared their intention of assembling and forming a society which admits only women. The Society has for its objective deliberation on the means of frustrating the projects of the republic's enemies. It will bear the name of Revolutionary Republic Society and will meet in the library of the Jacobins, rue Saint-Honoré" ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{appearance}} of the Count of Chambord provoked a political crisis, which worked {{to the advantage of}} Thiers. He persuaded the republicans that he was the least monarchist of the monarchists, and persuaded the monarchists that he was the least <b>republican</b> <b>of</b> the <b>republicans.</b> On 30 August 1871, the Assembly voted 494 to 94 to change the title of Thiers from Chief of the Executive Power to President of the Republic, under the authority <b>of</b> the National <b>Assembly.</b> It was a remarkable political achievement; the Third Republic had been created with the votes of the anti-republican monarchists. In private, he was not very kind to the assembly; he told a friend that [...] "I have an <b>Assembly</b> <b>of</b> 150 insurgents <b>republicans</b> and four hundred poltrons (chicken-hearts). One could say that the real founder of the Republic is the Count of Chambord." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an article, [...] "Feminine Solidarity", {{published}} 26 April 1907, Quaresma {{condemned the}} cloistered life most Portuguese women {{were forced to}} lead and argued that the country {{had an obligation to}} improve the situation of women. Though in favor of the development of the Portuguese Republic, she approached the argument for Republicanism in feminist terms, arguing in the General <b>Assembly</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Republican</b> League <b>of</b> Portuguese Women for passage of the Divorce Law in 1909, and in 1910 for the economic independence and education of women. In 1910, when Manuel Guimarães left O Século, to found A Capital (The Capital), he encouraged Quaresma to follow him there. She accepted the new post, covering the most important happenings along with her colleague Hermano Neves. These two newspapers were the most important papers in the capital city at the time, and Quaresma used the platform to argue for coeducational schooling, a radical topic at the time. She also recognized the importance of marketing and used her newspaper contacts to create the first advertising agency to be run by a woman, one of the few such agencies in the country at the time.|$|R

2500|$|For years, Jones was an intra-party adversary <b>of</b> <b>Assembly</b> <b>Republican</b> Leader Ross Johnson, {{and nearly}} ousted {{him from the}} party leadership. [...] After {{authoring}} Proposition 184, Jones was elected the Assembly Republican Leader in 1991. In that capacity, Jones worked with the newly elected Republican Governor Pete Wilson, supporting Wilson's plans to limit gerrymandering and raise taxes to cut the budget deficit. Due to more competitive districts, Republicans expected large gains in the 1992 election. However, the coattails of Democratic Presidential nominee Bill Clinton and the general strength of the Democratic Party in California led to disappointing results for Republican candidates. After the Republicans' weak showing in the November 1992 elections, Jones stepped down as Republican Leader, despite having easily won re-election in his own district.|$|R
