In Australian, Canadian, U.K., South African, Indian and U.S. legal doctrines, ex parte means a legal proceeding brought by one person in the <b>absence</b> of <b>and</b> without <b>representation</b> or notification of other parties. It is also used more loosely to refer to improper unilateral contacts with a court, arbitrator or represented party without notice to the other party or counsel for that party.|$|R

The solution I feel most authorized to give is to focus not on an <b>absence</b> of <b>representation</b> <b>and</b> ask “where are all the women in this room?”, but to actively support the women in academia and practice by supporting assertiveness, technology, and leadership amongst anyone who wishes to succeed...|$|R

40|$|The {{yearning for}} {{historical}} justice {{has become a}} defining feature of our age. The article discusses the extent and manifestations of this yearning for the redress of the wrongs of the past. It notes that, paradoxically, historians have not had a major influence on debates about historical justice. Referring to the seven other contributions to this themed issue of Rethinking History, the article suggests that historians have, however, made contributions in five crucial respects. They have provided critical analyses of processes of memorialising and historicising historic wrongs, highlighted silences <b>and</b> <b>absences</b> in <b>representations</b> of past injustices, drawn attention to pasts that have been largely forgotten, engaged with seemingly unbidden intrusions of the past into the present and identified and analysed the motives and desires of individual actors. Sketching promising future directions for relevant historical scholarship, the article proposes that historians problematise the idea that all historic wrongs need to be remembered comprehensively, and that historians reflect on the particular responsibilities and obligations of their discipline. Finally, this introduction suggests that practitioners of a critical history be cognisant of their emotional investment when writing about historic wrongs and historical justice...|$|R

What is presence? How {{are these}} two {{phenomena}} related? Is absence merely not being present? This book examines {{these and other}} questions relating {{to the role of}} <b>absence</b> <b>and</b> presence in everyday politics. <b>Absence</b> <b>and</b> presence are used as political tools in global events and everyday life to reinforce ideas about space, society, and belonging. The Politics of Hiding, Invisibility, and Silence contains six empirically-focussed chapters introducing case study locations and contexts from around the world. These studies examine how particular groups? relationships with places and spaces are characterized by experiences that are neither wholly present nor wholly absent.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the use of}} humor {{in the work of}} Luiseno artist James Luna. Utilizing the media of performance, photography and installation, using himself as the object of representation, Luna has created a recognizable artistic style that addresses the complex issues of American Indian identity <b>and</b> <b>representation.</b> His installations The End of the Frail (1990 - 91) and The Artifact Piece (1987, 1990) both point at the constructed nature of Native identity. Whereas the former employs satire, self-stereotyping, parody and humor to expose and confront the colonial myths, distorted attitudes <b>and</b> pictographic <b>representations</b> of Native Americans, the latter addresses the issues of Native <b>absence</b> <b>and</b> invisibility in the dominant culture. Representing himself as an artifact to provoke laughter, shock and discomfort, in The Artifact Piece Luna clearly disclosed the relationship between Western institutions of knowledge and the culture of the spectacle. Both installations draw attention to the tie between imperialism and material forms of production <b>and</b> <b>representation,</b> indicating the still ongoing institutional investment in Native allegorization through commodification and scientific practices, the fact that even today Native American identity is compromised by the colonial discourse and its disciplinary practices and imagination. Using Bhabha’s concepts of mimicry and hybridity, Bakhtin’s theory of humor and Vizenor’s trickster holotrope, our analysis discusses the subversive potential of Luna’s auto-ethnographic project, its potential to deconstruct the meta-narratives of Otherness and colonization, and create new spaces for social dialogue and cultural survival...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} made up of a 35 mm film, reinsertion, and a praxis paper that {{investigated}} my film processes and research, concerning the missing and murdered women of Vancouver. The catalyst was my experience living in a city in shock during the Pickton Trial. In 2007 Robert Pickton was charged with 26 counts of First Degree Murder. He was tried and found guilty for six out of a possible 26 murders that took place on his pig farm in Coquitlam. My goal was to create a film that positions the responsibility of the murders on the City of Vancouver, its police, City Hall and residents. My research focused on my personal experiences in the community and feminist discourse. Through the creation of an experimental film about the murders, I explored ideas such as authorship, experiential art <b>and</b> <b>absence</b> as <b>representation.</b> Simultaneously, the film subliminally communicates the trauma of the aforementioned women. This thesis pursues several key questions: Can a city be a sexual predator? Who has the right to tell a story? Can film emote without narrative? It concludes that a society, by inaction, can condone atrocities, that the stories we tell are inherently our own and that trauma can be communicated through subtle movements, gestures or objects.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} philosophical, {{linguistic}} and textual interplay of <b>absence</b> <b>and</b> presence in Margaret Atwood's novel Cat's Eye.

It is through frameworks which both establish states of <b>absence</b> <b>and</b> presence as well as destroy binary oppositions between the two that Cat's Eye conveys its positions about language. Thus, textual and extra-textual discourses about the natures of language and linguistic meaning are situated within recurrent thematic and formal attention to relationships between <b>absence</b> <b>and</b> presence. By exploring the roles of <b>absence</b> <b>and</b> presence in various phenomenological and linguistic contexts, this study concludes that absence/presence is a paradigm in Cat's Eye for {{the way in which}} words are (alternately as well as simultaneously) spoken and silent, understood and misunderstood, opposed and united...|$|R
