25|$|The US Preventive Service Task Force {{reported}} {{that not all}} children with a high BMI need to lose weight though. High BMI can identify a possible weight problem, but does not differentiate between fat or lean tissue. Additionally, BMI may mistakenly rule out some children who do have excess adipose tissue. It is therefore beneficial to supplement the reliability of a BMI diagnosis with <b>additional</b> <b>screening</b> tools such as adipose tissue or skin fold measurements.|$|E
25|$|All cars, taxis, {{buses and}} trucks {{go through a}} {{preliminary}} security checkpoint before entering the airport compound. Armed guards spot-check the vehicles by looking into cars, taxis and boarding buses, exchanging a few words with the driver and passengers. Armed security personnel stationed at the terminal entrances keep a close watch on those who enter the buildings. If someone arouses their suspicion or looks nervous, they may {{strike up a conversation}} to further assess the person's intent. Plainclothes armed personnel patrol the area outside the building, and hidden surveillance cameras operate at all times. Inside the building, both uniformed and plainclothes security officers are on constant patrol. Departing passengers are personally questioned by security agents even before arriving at the check-in desk. This interview can last as little as a minute, or as long as an hour if a passenger is selected for <b>additional</b> <b>screening.</b> Luggage and body searches may be conducted.|$|E
25|$|Firstly all men {{between the}} ages of 15 and 45 were taken to the National Police {{headquarters}} in nearby Phu Cuong for <b>additional</b> <b>screening</b> before returning if their papers were in order. The festival, which was designed to display the concern of the Vietnamese government for the welfare of the people, began. The proceedings were launched by the Bình Dương Provinceband at 0830. By 0900 hamlet residents began arriving in the central area and were greeted by personnel from province headquarters. Of the villagers, 740 men were sent for screening. Of these, 29 were found to be Viet Cong suspects, 9 were ARVN deserters, 4 possessed false identification cards, 13 were former Viet Cong who had violated their probation conditions, and 62 were evading conscription. The search of the village had uncovered 25 more communist suspects, including 3 women carrying medical supplies and 10 men hiding in haystacks and wooded areas. The anti-communist sniffer dogs had discovered two tunnels in the village. During the day 325 people were interrogated at the identification stations. Two of these were identified as Viet Cong, one allegedly the communists' village secretary.|$|E

For high frequencies, [...] when the current is uniformly distributed {{over the surface of}} the wire (skin effect), [...] when the current is uniformly distributed over the cross section of the wire (very low frequencies).

2500|$|Evans was {{expected}} to face Tim Kennedy in a middleweight bout on November 12, 2016 at UFC 205. However, on November 8, Evans was pulled from the fight after an undisclosed irregularity was found during his pre-fight medical exam. Subsequently, Kennedy {{was removed from the}} card as well. The bout was quickly rescheduled and {{was expected}} to take place a month later at UFC 206. Once again, Evans was unable to obtain medical clearance to compete on the card and was pulled from the bout on November 21. An irregularity in his pre-fight tests was responsible for both removals and he is expected to undergo an <b>additional</b> <b>screening</b> with an neurologist to prove he is healthy enough to fight, before possibly returning to the cage in January or February, according to his manager. [...] middleweight winner Kelvin Gastelum was his eventual replacement on the card.|$|E
50|$|CAPPS I {{was first}} {{implemented}} in the late 1990s, {{in response to the}} perceived threat of U.S. domestic and international terrorism. CAPPS I was administered by the FBI and FAA.

Methodology. The analysis of distribution of magnetic field of the short-circuit current limiter of inductive type with superconducting high-temperature coil and superconducting main and <b>additional</b> <b>screens,</b> using mathematical modeling by the finite element method in math software package FEMM for different modes of operation is carried out. Results. The calculations of magnetic field dissipation in operational modes are carried out. Originality.
