25|$|The Rams {{were the}} first team in the NFL to play in Los Angeles (the 1926 Los Angeles Buccaneers were {{strictly}} a road team), {{but they were not}} the only professional football team to play its home games in the Coliseum between 1946 and 1949. The upstart All-America Football Conference had the Los Angeles Dons compete there as well. Reeves was taking a gamble that Los Angeles was ready for its own professional football team – <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> were two in the City of Angels. Reeves was proven to be correct when the Rams played their first pre-season game against the Washington Redskins in front of a crowd of 95,000 fans. The team finished their first season in L.A. with a 6–4–1 record, second place behind the Chicago Bears. At {{the end of the season}} Walsh was fired as head coach. The Coliseum would be the home of the Rams for more than 30 years, but the facility was already over 20 years old on the day of the first kickoff.|$|E

500|$|Rakeysh {{said the}} {{following}} in a scriptwriter's conference {{conducted by the}} Film Writers Association in the year 2008, [...] "I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. We were sitting in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> were a couple of film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E

6000|$|Sammy Jay kept {{right on}} screaming. He made such a noise that Reddy didn't hear {{footsteps}} coming nearer <b>and</b> nearer. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>there</b> was a great roar right behind him. [...] "Bow, wow, wow! Bow, wow, wow, wow!"-- just like that.|$|R
2500|$|In a January, 2007, {{interview}} with the Boston Globe, Connor Finnegan recalled his experience as an [...] player the previous summer: [...] "At first it was weird being filmed all the time. You'd be talking <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> would be a camera or microphone shoved into your face. The big rule with reality TV is never {{to look at the}} camera." ...|$|E
60|$|At that Whitefoot felt better. <b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> was a queer {{swelling}} in his heart. It {{was the beginning}} of pride, pride in those wonderful babies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Brumley," [...] she repeated, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> {{were tears}} of honest vexation {{in her voice}} and eyes. [...] "You know I cannot do without you." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Cliffe sat up <b>suddenly,</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> was {{an angry}} sparkle in her eyes.|$|R

60|$|Worry {{had planted}} {{himself at the}} foot of the {{stairway}} in front of Ken. The boys stood silent <b>and</b> aghast. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>there</b> came thumps upon the stairs, and Raymond appeared, jumping down three steps at a time. He dodged under Worry's arm and plunged at Ken to hold him with both hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Virginia {{has used}} him shamefully, sir," [...] I answered, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> came {{flooding}} {{to my mind}} things I had heard the Colonel say in the campaign.|$|E
60|$|She hesitated, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> {{swept across}} her face a strange expression, old as the hills, yet with {{something}} eternally young about it. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> {{was with}} the angel a {{multitude}} of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.|$|E
6000|$|From the innumerable {{images of}} gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams, I select for record but a solitary vision. Methought I was {{immersed}} in a cataleptic trance of more than usual duration <b>and</b> profundity. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>there</b> came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibbering voice whispered the word [...] "Arise!" [...] within my ear.|$|R
60|$|The {{song of the}} men broke <b>suddenly</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> was a hubbub of {{many voices}} as he whirled the old woman roughly to her couch of skins.|$|R
60|$|He {{received}} this {{with his usual}} stoicism, {{and for a moment}} I was sorry I was his father and not his mother, <b>and</b> so couldn't <b>suddenly</b> <b>there,</b> coram publico, in our hansom, kiss him. After all, I thought, the thing wasn't so very bad.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> {{shot through}} me {{the fear that}} he might burst {{one of those little}} blue veins in his pale forehead, so vehement had he become; and hastily I changed the subject.|$|E

60|$|<b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> was quiet, {{but it did}} {{not come}} from that individual's call. A cowboy had {{detached}} himself from the group of curious onlookers and had confronted the council with two big guns held low.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> was a {{burst of}} hearty cheering from the deck, and then the crash of a gun above his head, and then the {{answering}} booming of guns from far over the water. Craddock sat up and strained his ears. Was the ship in action? Only the one gun had been fired, and though many had answered there were none of the crashings which told of a shot coming home.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> was a bustle at the door. Amid {{the grey}} swirl of the tobacco-smoke I could {{catch a glimpse}} of a blue coat and gold epaulettes, with a crowd {{gathering}} thickly round them, while a hoarse murmur rose from the group which thickened into a deep-chested cheer. Every one was on his feet, peering and asking each other what it might mean. And still the crowd seethed and the cheering swelled.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> then <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> came a frown {{across his}} face, {{as she stood}} looking at him. She was {{getting to know the}} manner of that frown. Now she stooped down to kiss it away from his brow. It was a brave thing to do; but she did it with a {{consciousness}} of her courage. [...] "Now I may burn the letter," [...] she said, as though she were about to depart upon the errand.|$|R
60|$|Nothing spurred his hurt {{memory to}} a {{recollection}} of past familiarity with his surroundings.

60|$|She {{left the}} window and started to cross the room. <b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> came over her a feeling of utter weakness.

60|$|<b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> burst a song. It {{was like}} nothing Joan {{had ever heard}} before. So clear and loud and near that all the night seemed filled with harmony. It sank into a tender yearning cry {{throbbing}} with passionate desire, and then it rose again in thrilling ecstasy: a song of hope, of victory.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was an {{incredible}} crowd. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>and</b> violently <b>there</b> was forced upon my attention the vast amount of difference there is amongst these beings of the moon.|$|R
50|$|Navarro {{was accused}} of alleged {{attempted}} rape which he accepted. In an interview with TV host Boy Abunda on Buzz ng Bayan, Navarro said he was apparently taking the clothes of the model <b>and</b> then <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> are many armed guy beaten him.

But the National Bureau of Investigation said it was unlikely that there was an attempted rape on Cornejo, based on the CCTV footage.|$|R
6000|$|He started like a somnambulist awakened <b>suddenly,</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> was {{now some}} meaning in his stare; {{a sort of}} alarmed speculation. He opened his mouth slowly. Flora struck in with forced gaiety. [...] "You would never guess." ...|$|R
60|$|Their {{eyes met}} <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> descended on Ashe confidence. He felt cool and alert, sure of himself, {{as in the}} old days he had felt when he ran races and, the nerve-racking hours of waiting past, he listened for the starter's gun. Subconsciously he was aware he had always been a little afraid of Joan, and that now he was no longer afraid.|$|E
6000|$|... "It leapt upon me for {{the third}} time--as I was driving to Paddington {{on my way to}} Oxford and a scholarship. I had just one {{momentary}} glimpse. I was leaning over the apron of my hansom smoking a cigarette, and no doubt thinking myself no end of a man of the world, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> was the door, the wall, the dear sense of unforgettable and still attainable things.|$|E
6000|$|Then come two short-bearded men in {{careless}} indigo blue raiment, {{both of them}} convulsed with laughter--men {{outside the}} Rule, who practise, perhaps, some art--and {{then one of the}} samurai, in cheerful altercation with a blue-robed girl of eight. [...] "But you could have come back yesterday, Dadda," [...] she persists. He is deeply sunburnt, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> passes before my mind the picture of a snowy mountain waste at night-fall and a solitary small figure under the stars....|$|E
50|$|He died <b>suddenly,</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> {{is further}} {{speculation}} {{that he was}} in fact poisoned by boyars who resented his vast, unrealistic and dangerous projects. His descendants include members of the Rosetti family, and the Romanian actor, Șerban Cantacuzino.|$|R

6000|$|The man rose half upright, stumbled, and, {{straightening}} himself, moved {{towards the}} open gangway with a lurch. Then he vanished <b>suddenly</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> was a crash below. Austin leaned {{out through the}} opening, and his voice rose harsh and strained: ...|$|R
