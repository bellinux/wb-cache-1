2500|$|... "I Want to Be Your Man" [...] is a ballad {{featuring}} Roger's vocals {{filtered through}} a vocoder. According to Roger, {{he had never}} mixed his [...] "human" [...] voice with the talk box before, and recording the vocals was tedious because he could only play one note at a time on the vocoder. To layer six-part harmonies, he spoke the lyric while playing a melody line then rewound the tape and repeated the process for the harmonizing part while playing together with the previously recorded one. After he finished layering tracks, if he didn't like the result he had to scrap everything and start over. Larry Troutman recommended Nicole Cottom, {{a friend of his}} daughter, to help sing background vocals. Roger recalled her being in the studio one day while he was recording his vocals: [...] "There was a spot in the song where there was a hole <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> to do something. It was so good, {{there was no need to}} take it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tubridy met his wife, the {{producer}} Anne Marie Power at RTÉ in 1997 {{when he spotted}} her in a recording studio. He later spoke of the moment they met: [...] "She was going in to make a programme, I was going out. My head turned and my life changed. I pursued her relentlessly. She used to sashay down the corridor and I was quite taken by her. She was very erudite and she made documentaries on flamenco. She was much brighter than I am and continues to be, which isn't that hard really if you dig deep enough, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> out." [...] The couple had a daughter, Ella, and later married in 2003. Tubridy proposed in the Abbeyglen Hotel (a [...] "favourite haunt" [...] of his) in Clifden, County Galway. The engagement was announced in The Irish Times with the words [...] "Ella Tubridy is delighted to announce the engagement of her parents Ryan and Anne Marie".|$|E

60|$|Cre. My hurt is nothing, sir; but I appeal To wise Tiresias, if my {{accusation}} Be {{not most}} true. The first of Laius' blood Gave him his death. Is there a prince before her? Then she is faultless, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> pardon. <b>And</b> may this blood ne'er cease to drop, O Thebes, If pity of thy sufferings {{did not move}} me, To shew the cure which heaven itself prescribed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, she's amazing--she's amazing," [...] I repeated; [...] "but so are you." [...] <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> {{what she}} had said to my boy.|$|R
60|$|She seemed rather {{surprised}} to find me inquiring about art <b>and</b> artists. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> where one might go to study that subject most profitably, and her answer was, in Munich.|$|R
6000|$|... "No! Mrs. Bowie. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> {{to let me}} {{have you}} at table. And here's my chance. Everybody's talking. Listen, and don't interrupt. You know Mono Creek?" ...|$|E
60|$|To this Mrs. Ambient {{had made}} answer {{that it would}} be very awkward when he was about fifteen; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> husband if it was his opinion in general, then, that young people should not read novels.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{never spoke}} but once, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> if {{she felt a}} little more easy, {{and she told me}} to hold my stupid tongue. Oh, Miss B., I never thought to have seen this day!" [...] And the water-works again began to play.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is your sister, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> how she {{is after}} the ball;" [...] and so saying he trotted back in the {{direction}} of the road.|$|R
6000|$|She was an earnest, hearty girl. She {{was always}} in a good humor, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> to do anything, she assented in a bright, cheerful way, and in a loud tone full of good-fellowship, as though she would say: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' {{said the}} old woman, 'that I do not, but the Moon will be here presently, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>ask</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> she will know. She can easily see it, for she shines on all things.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And this is La Fleur," [...] said Miss Panney; [...] "Mrs. Tolbridge {{has been}} talking about you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> to let me come in and see you. I want to speak to you for a few minutes, and I will sit down here. Don't you stand up." ...|$|E
60|$|Such letters--such witty, sparkling, clever, womanly, {{delightful}} letters! They {{completed the}} conquest her picture had begun. Before we had corresponded six months I was besottedly {{in love with}} this woman whom I had never seen. Finally, I wrote and told her so, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> to be my wife.|$|E
60|$|She rose as I {{came close}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> my way. She {{immediately}} commenced a conversation; {{and it occurred}} to me that here in the very centre of the Kingdom of Dust was the place to gather details of the history of Parisian rag-picking--particularly as I could do so from the lips of one who looked like the oldest inhabitant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good Heaven--I wish I {{had more}} to give you! Here's--wretched--the merest trifle. It is every farthing I have left. I have none but what my wife gives me, you know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> now." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{passed the}} bridge, {{and soon after}} that <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> if she saw the lock. She said no, {{she did not see}} any lock; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said, “Oh!” <b>and</b> pulled on. Another five minutes went by, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> to look again.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you will, Constance; but I {{must also}} write <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> for myself. <b>I</b> cannot go {{to live on}} them, knowing that they are poor, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> to let me pay her a weekly sum." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{one evening}} I got {{her away from}} the smell of halibut and {{linoleum}} long enough to read to her the manuscript of this story, which then ended before her entrance into it. I read it to her because I knew that all the printing-presses in the world were running to try to please her and some others. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> about it.|$|E
60|$|I {{took her}} hand, which she relinquished to me quite freely and frankly with an innocence {{as great as}} my own; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> who she was and how she came to Mondolfo. It was then that I learnt that her name was Luisina, {{that she was the}} {{daughter}} of one of the women employed in the castle kitchen, who had brought her to help there a week ago from Borgo Taro, where she had been living with an aunt.|$|E
6000|$|Matilda (Mrs. Eyrecourt's maid) {{followed}} me downstairs {{to open the}} door. I suppose I looked, as I felt, wretchedly enough. The good creature tried to cheer me. [...] "Don't be anxious about them," [...] she said; [...] "I am used to traveling, sir--and I'll take care of them." [...] She is a woman to be thoroughly depended on, a faithful and attached servant. I made her a little present at parting, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> if she would write to me from time to time.|$|E
6000|$|... "So do I--on the whole. <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> {{what about}} woman. And {{then she said}} with a woman it wasn't fear, it was just boredom. A woman is like a violinist: any fiddle, any {{instrument}} rather than empty hands and no tune going." ...|$|R
60|$|On the {{outskirts}} of the crowd I met Susan, who was almost overpowered with joy at seeing me safe again. I shook her by the hand, but, without replying to her warm-hearted protestations of thankfulness <b>and</b> delight, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> if she had seen Miss Havelot.|$|R
60|$|By {{now we were}} drawing near to Mameena, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> greeted <b>her,</b> <b>asking</b> if {{she wanted}} anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{handed them}} all over to another of the Professor's assistants, so we need not bother about them. I told aunt that I should not be down for an hour. Mrs. Brown is looking after her, and getting her a cup of tea, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> to bring two cups up here. I thought that you would prefer {{for us to have}} a chat by ourselves. Now tell me all about it, dear; that is, if there is {{anything}} fresh since you wrote." ...|$|E
6000|$|EVA. She {{would have}} persuaded {{me to come}} back here, but I couldn't. Then she got me a place as nursery governess, and when the {{children}} grew too old for me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> once more to help me, once more she said, 'Go home;' but I hadn't the heart or face to do it. And then-- what would Father say? I sank so low that I went into service--the drudge of a lodging-house--and when the mistress died, and I appealed to the Sister again, her answer--I think I have it about me--yes, there it is! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{yet she was}} so well spoken," [...] {{said the}} girl, {{looking at me with}} wide open eyes, [...] "that it made a person's heart bleed. And so she said to me, did I know the way to the burying ground? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> which burying ground. And she said, the poor burying ground. And so I told her I had been a poor child myself, and it was {{according}} to parishes. But she said she meant a poor burying ground not very far from here, where there was an archway, and a step, and an iron gate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have a frien', la veuve Gravois, {{who lives}} ver' quiet. She have one room, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> tek you in, Davy." [...] He {{led the way}} through the empty Rue Chartres, turned to the right at the Rue Bienville, and stopped before an unpretentious house some three doors from the corner. Madame Gravois, elderly, wizened, primp in a starched cotton gown, opened the door herself, fell upon Monsieur Vigo in the Creole fashion; and within {{a quarter of an hour}} I was {{installed}} in her best room, which gave out on a little court behind. Monsieur Vigo promised to send his servant with my baggage, told me his address, bade me call on him for what <b>I</b> wanted, <b>and</b> took his leave.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{write to}} you, Sir Henry, {{in order that}} your Queen may {{preserve}} for me my country, it being in her hands. The Boers are coming into it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do not like them. Their actions are cruel among us black people. We are like money, they sell us <b>and</b> our children. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Her</b> Majesty to pity me, and to hear that which I write quickly. I wish to hear upon what conditions Her Majesty will receive me, and my country and my people, under her protection. I am weary with fighting. I do not like war, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Her</b> Majesty to give me peace. I am very much distressed that my people are being destroyed by war, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wish them to obtain peace. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Her</b> Majesty to defend me, as she defends all her people. There are three things which distress me very much--war, selling people, and drink. All these things I shall find in the Boers, and it is these things which destroy people to make an end {{of them in the}} country. The custom of the Boers has always been to cause people to be sold, and to-day they are still selling people. Last year I saw them pass with two waggons full of people whom they had bought at the river at Tanane" [...] (Lake Ngate).|$|R
6000|$|... "As if {{it mattered}} what SHE thought or said or did! It's her {{place to be}} useful if we want her, and we needn't worry about spoiling a girl like that. She can't be any prouder or more saucy than she is, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> if only to see the airs she will put on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't say I got {{it out of}} her," [...] {{returned}} the other a little sharply. [...] "I did not question her about her affairs, of course. She gave me that information quite spontaneously. I can't {{remember what it was}} that brought the subject up." [...] Here he paused to reflect, remarking mentally, [...] "This fellow is teaching me to be as great a liar as he is himself." [...] Then he continued--"Ah, yes, I remember now; we were talking about books, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> why she had not read all the popular novels I mentioned, and then she explained her position." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{direction}} in which she turned prevented her from seeing me. She was quite unaware that I had discovered her; and I have said nothing about it since. But I noticed something unusual {{in the manner in}} which her watch-chain was hanging, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> what o'clock it was. She said, [...] "You have got your own watch." [...] I told her my watch had stopped. [...] "So has mine," [...] she said. There is no doubt about it now; she has pawned her watch. What for? She lives here for nothing, and she has not had a new dress since I have known her. Why does she want money? ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} later, while I {{sat in my}} chamber at the prison writing a paper {{concerning}} a prisoner who had died, the porter at the gate announced that a messenger from the Augusta wished to see me. I bade him show in the messenger, and presently there entered no chamberlain or eunuch, but a woman wrapped in a dark cloak. When the man had gone and the door was shut, she threw off the cloak and I saw that my visitor was Martina, the favourite waiting-lady of the Empress. We greeted each other warmly, who were always friends, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> tidings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} have Miss Delano's red brocade for the Queen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> for the yellow-satin dress for Merry when I go to get mine, and tell her how mean you are," [...] said Juliet, {{frowning}} under her gilt-paper crown as she swept about in a red table-cloth for train till the brocade arrived.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,--yes. I {{have said}} as much as that, but I have never got an answer. <b>And</b> when <b>I</b> did <b>ask</b> <b>her,</b> she merely left me. She is not much given to talking.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{other members}} of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, <b>and</b> {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> questions about her native country; but she was not of a descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.|$|R
