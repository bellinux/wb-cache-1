5|$|The {{following}} day, the Aggies {{upset the}} Texas Longhorns, winning 20–16 {{in the annual}} rivalry game. The game began with a flyover of F-16 jets, all piloted by former A students, in the missing man formation. This flyover was donated by Senator Phil Gramm who, as an elected official, had {{the title of a}} fly-over reserved for his death and asked that the fly-over be given instead in the honor of the 12 Aggies that died. At halftime, the Texas Longhorn Band dedicated their performance to the students lost and injured in the collapse, and ended by playing <b>Amazing</b> <b>Grace</b> and Taps, then removing their white hats in a show of respect as they walked off the field. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band also played a tribute to the fallen and, contrary to the usual tradition, marched off the field in a silent cadence. Aggie students, who normally sit only when the opposing band plays, stood throughout both performances and gave both standing ovations.|$|E

5|$|What's So <b>Amazing</b> About <b>Grace?</b> sold well at {{secular and}} Christian stores.

In 1998, Christianity Today compared What's So <b>Amazing</b> About <b>Grace?</b> to Joel A. Carpenter's Revive Us Again, writing that both books productively analyze Christian fundamentalism.

25|$|During his childhood, Bernstein {{performed}} professionally as {{a dancer}} and an actor, {{in the latter case}} playing the part of Caliban in The Tempest on Broadway, and he also won several prizes for his painting. He attended Manhattan's progressive Walden School and gravitated toward music at the age of twelve, at which time he was given a scholarship in piano by Henriette Michelson, a Juilliard teacher who guided him throughout his entire career as a pianist. She took him to play some of his improvisations for composer Aaron Copland, who was encouraging and selected Israel Citkowitz as a teacher for the young boy. Bernstein's music has some stylistic similarities to Copland's music, most notably in his western scores, particularly sections of Big Jake, in the Gregory Peck film <b>Amazing</b> <b>Grace</b> and Chuck, and in his spirited score for the 1958 film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell's novel God's Little Acre.|$|E
