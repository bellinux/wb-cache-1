With the {{development}} of IC manufacturing technology, the machining precision and surface quality of silicon wafer are proposed much higher, but now the planarization techniques of silicon wafer using free abrasive and bonded abrasive have the disadvantage of poor profile accuracy, environmental pollution, deep damage layer, etc. A soft <b>abrasive</b> <b>wheel</b> combining chemical and medical effect was developed in this paper, it could get super smooth, low damage wafer surface by utilizing mechanical friction of abrasives and chemical reaction among abrasives, additives, silicon. A comparison experiment between # 3000 soft <b>abrasive</b> <b>wheel</b> and # 3000 diamond <b>abrasive</b> <b>wheel</b> was given to study on the grinding performance of soft <b>abrasive</b> <b>wheel.</b> The results showed that: wafer surface roughness ground by soft <b>abrasive</b> <b>wheel</b> was sub-nanometer and its sub-surface damage was only 0. 01 µm amorphous layer, which were much better than silicon wafer ground by diamond <b>abrasive</b> <b>wheel,</b> but material removal rate and grinding ratio of soft <b>abrasive</b> <b>wheel</b> were lower than diamond wheel. The wafer surface ground by soft <b>abrasive</b> <b>wheel</b> included Ce 4 +, Ce 3 +, Si 4 +, Ca 2 + and Si, which indicated that the chemical reaction really occurred during grinding process...|$|R

They made their first public appearance at a friend's party in 1977, which {{was followed by a}} Rock Against Racism gig at Leeds Polytechnic.

Martin left the band after several appearances on the Slaughter and the Dogs tour support to pursue his own musical projects. At this time they employed the services of a mutual friend on Bass, eventually both were replaced by Mark Holmes and Dave Hawkridge. With this line-up the band recorded their first demo, and toured with Slaughter & the Dogs. After losing money trying to get a record released by a London label Dave and Rzonca financed their own EP, releasing it on their Abrasive Records label.

The band then signed to Riot City Records and issued the Vicious Circle EP, which was followed by a re-release of their debut EP, both again indie hits. Their debut album, When the Punks Go Marching In, was released later in 1982. They then signed to Clay Records, and released a cover version of Elvis Presley's [...] "Jailhouse Rock". Their second album,> Black Leather Girl was released in March 1984, displaying a much slicker and glossier sound with vocal harmonies, but after a further single, the band split later that year after a lengthy international tour.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a circuit {{of a plant}} for preliminary grinding of balls made of brittle non-metalic materials. Cubes are used as blanks for the balls. The peculiar design feature of the plant is an inclined location of an <b>abrasive</b> <b>wheel</b> and placement of a charging container having section-shape form {{in that part of}} the wheel where a vertical component of linear speed of its points is directed upward. The executed theoretical investigations have made it possible to determine a range of inclination angles of end surface of an <b>abrasive</b> <b>wheel.</b> This range ensures a blank circulation in the charging container. It has been established that the blanks being in contact with the <b>abrasive</b> <b>wheel</b> are slowly moving upward along its inclined end surface and then having reached the maximum top position they are rolling downward along the surface of a slope formed by the blanks. In the machining zone the blanks are making rotary motion and in this case the most intensive rotation is observed in the blanks that are located in the top part of the container. Speed of blank translational motion is small and due to this contact loadings affecting the balls in the grinding process are insignificant and machining process is carried without application of a separator.

By utilizing the common <b>abrasive</b> <b>wheel</b> newly redressed to damage the finished surface of silicon nitride and comparing the finished surface with the damaged surface in aspects of their scanning electronic microscope (SEM) pattern and surface roughness, the existence of cutting and micro-cutting actions in the unsteady-state grinding process was confirmed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.
