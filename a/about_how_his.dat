5|$|Branham's {{father was}} an alcoholic, and William Branham often talked <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> {{upbringing}} was difficult and impoverished. As a child, he would often wear a coat, held closed by safety pins, without a shirt underneath. Some have called his claims of poverty into question, because, among other things, {{he was able to}} purchase a new car when he was 18 years old.|$|E
25|$|Adam Copeland (Edge) and Chavo Guerrero, Jr. spoke openly on the Monday Night Raw tribute show to Benoit <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> death {{affected}} them. Copeland {{broke down}} whilst describing how Benoit {{was one of}} the three people he was close to in the WWE, and how he took great pride in his wrestling work. Guerrero discussed how Benoit was a very private person yet a close friend to the Guerrero family, and how he was as heartbroken by Benoit's death as he was by his uncle Eddie's 19 months earlier.|$|E
25|$|Pioneer newspaperman John Houston {{arrived in}} South Fort George {{in the fall}} of 1909 and began the Fort George Tribune. The first edition was {{published}} on November 6th, 1909. Unfortunately, other than land claims notices there was little local news for his paper to report. John's articles were often humorous and included notices as to whose cow recently had a calf and what he'd had to pay for eggs that week. He commented in one article <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> socks often froze to the floor while he sat at his printing press and worked on the newspaper.|$|E

25|$|After Crow reluctantly allows Guiteau to {{come along}} with him, he tells the priest some of his past, <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> father was bitten by a vampire, killed his mother and came after Jack, who ended up killing him. He then asks what it is Valek is after and Guiteau tells him that Valek is seeking an ancient relic called the Black Cross of Berziers and that Valek was once a fallen priest who was {{thought to have been}} possessed by demons. The Bérziers Cross was used in an {{exorcism}} that was cut short but the result was that Valek was forever changed into the first vampire.|$|E
25|$|The {{two films}} {{established}} Farley {{as a relatively}} bankable star and {{he was given the}} title role of Beverly Hills Ninja, which finished in first place at the box office on its opening weekend. Drug and alcohol abuse related problems interfered with Farley's film work at this time. Production of his final film, Almost Heroes, was held up several times so Farley could enter rehab. He was known among comedic contemporaries and friends to be sensitive <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> comedy was perceived ("fatty falls down, everybody goes home happy"), and was particularly hurt by harsh critical reactions to Tommy Boy, a film he enjoyed making.|$|E
25|$|The day of {{the fight}} finally comes, but when Brendon goes to engage Shannon, he is knocked to the ground after just three punches. Despite this, Shannon calls Brendon {{the next day and}} invites him, Jason, and their friend Melissa to his {{birthday}} party, which Brendon resentfully accepts. When the kids arrive at Shannon's party, they see that no one has arrived. Shannon laments <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> bullying ways have caused no one he knows to actually like him, and the kids sympathize with the bully. However, Shannon then reveals that there are several kids at the party, who come out from hiding spots and ridicule Brendon, Jason, and Melissa for being swindled. As their retaliation, the children steal Shannon's lawn gnome and depart from the party.|$|E

25|$|Against Philadelphia, Ryan Callahan {{scored a}} goal to earn his 200th career point, but {{suffered}} a left shoulder subluxation during a third period fight with Maxime Talbot, an injury that was expected to make him miss up to 14 days. The Flyers only goal came on the power play shortly after Callahan left, raising concerns <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> absence would affect the Ranger's penalty killing and defensive forward play. The Rangers ended the month with a 0–3 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 31, the team's first shutout loss in 31 regular season games. New York failed to score on four power plays without Callahan and surrendered seven penalties, including their fourth penalty for too many men on the ice in seven games, {{the most of any}} team in the league.|$|E
25|$|From {{the time}} of these encounters, the style and pace of the film quicken. Interspersed with shots of his enchanting baby {{daughter}} as she takes her first steps and grows into childhood, Van Gasteren turns his attention to his art, to meeting artists, intellectuals, and scientists of the ’60s in the United States and Canada, and puts on several exhibits of his own photography and sculpture. He purchases an Opel automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. Marshall McLuhan introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer Mal Waldron <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> music expresses his protest against the lack of communication in our world. And {{to the accompaniment of}} live jazz and slides of his art, Louis recites his own Beat poetry in English.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} person, as if quoting himself, William speaks <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> {{disagreement}} with his king troubles him; {{he tries to}} be faithful to his king, but he is above all faithful to his conscience: to serve God and the Dutch people. Therefore, the last two lines of the first stanza, indicate that the leader of the Dutch civil war against the Spanish Empire of which they were part, had no specific quarrel with king Philip II of Spain, but rather with his emissaries in the Low Countries, like Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. This may have been because at the time (late 16th century) it was uncommon to publicly doubt the Divine Right of Kings, who was accountable to God alone. In 1581 the Netherlands nevertheless rejected the legitimacy of the king of Spain's rule over it in the Act of Abjuration.|$|E

25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had put his arm around Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E
500|$|Oda was [...] "sensitive" [...] <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> {{work would}} be translated. In many instances, the English version of the One Piece manga uses one onomatopoeia for {{multiple}} onomatopoeia used in the Japanese version. For instance, [...] "saaa" [...] (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and [...] "zaaa" [...] (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as [...] "fshhhhhhh". Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn.|$|E
500|$|... "Occupation", and {{following}} episode [...] "Precipice" [...] {{were written by}} series creator Ronald D. Moore. The Cylon occupation of New Caprica, and the human resistance fighting them, was inspired by wars and military occupations from history, including the Quartering Acts, World War II, and the more recent occupation in Iraq. In the original writing, Moore did not originally consider including Tigh with an eye removed until the final drafts were written. Portraying actor Michael Hogan was initially hesitant with the idea. He recalled that when the producers called him to talk <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> character would be maimed, they suggested having an eye removed. Hogan responded by laughing, and the producers assumed he agreed.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{was alone}} with his mother at the end, author Joshua Greene writes, and {{when she began to}} slip into unconsciousness, he [...] "put down the book and began {{chanting}} softly into her ear". Inglis views the lyrics to [...] "Deep Blue" [...] as exemplifying Harrison's [...] "fondness for family". Pattie Boyd, Harrison's wife at the time, recalls that Louise had withheld the seriousness of her condition from him for eight weeks before September 1969, [...] "in case George was busy" [...] with his career, and that, following her death, Harrison was anxious <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> father would manage alone. Keen to strengthen the familial bond, Harrison invited his brothers Harold and Pete to live on his Friar Park estate in Oxfordshire, along with their father.|$|E
500|$|Additional {{allusions to}} films and film history abound in Barton Fink. At one point a {{character}} discusses [...] "Victor Soderberg"; {{the name is}} a reference to Victor Sjöström, a Swedish director who worked in Hollywood under the name Victor Seastrom. Charlie's line <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> troubles [...] "don't amount to a hill of beans" [...] is a probable homage to the film Casablanca (1942). Another similarity is that of Barton Finks beach scene to the final moment in La Dolce Vita (1960), wherein a young woman's final line of dialogue is obliterated by {{the noise of the}} ocean. The unsettling emptiness of the Hotel Earle has also been compared to the living spaces in Key Largo (1948) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).|$|E

500|$|Decades later, {{after the}} {{practical}} demonstration of motorjets and turbojets, Coandă {{began to tell}} various conflicting stories <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> early experiments were precursors to the jet, even that his turbo-propulseur was the first motorjet engine with fuel combustion in the airstream. He also claimed {{to have made a}} single brief flight in December 1910, crashing just after takeoff, the aircraft being destroyed by fire. Two aviation historians countered Coandă's version of events, saying there was no proof that the engine had combustion in the airstream, and no proof that the aircraft ever flew. In 1965, Coandă brought drawings forward to prove his claim of combustion ducting but these were shown to be reworked, differing substantially from the originals. Many aviation historians were dismissive, saying that Coandă's turbo-propulseur design involved a weak stream of [...] "plain air", not a powerful jet of air expanding from fuel combustion.|$|E
500|$|As {{children}} {{coming of}} age, Scout and Jem face hard realities {{and learn from}} them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie {{the day after the}} trial, [...] "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like". This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be." ...|$|E
500|$|At Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but {{he kills}} her as Roy returns. Roy's body begins to fail {{as the end}} of his {{lifespan}} approaches.

Roy makes the jump with ease, and as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof, saving him. Before Roy dies, he delivers a monologue <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> memories [...] "will be lost in time, like tears in rain". Gaff arrives and shouts to Deckard about Rachael: [...] "It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?" [...] Deckard returns to his apartment and finds Rachael asleep in his bed.
