50|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is composed of}} 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. Since oxygen is exchanged at the alveoli-capillary membrane, nitrogen is a major component for the alveoli's state of inflation. If a large volume of nitrogen in the lungs is replaced with oxygen, the oxygen may subsequently be absorbed into the blood, reducing {{the volume of the}} alveoli, resulting in a form of alveolar collapse known as <b>absorption</b> <b>atelectasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because the {{exchange}} of gases between the blood and airspace of the lungs is independent of the movement of gas {{to and from the}} lungs, enough oxygen can be delivered to the circulation even if a person is apneic. With the onset of apnea, low pressure develops in the airspace of the lungs, because more oxygen is absorbed than CO2 is released. With the airways closed or obstructed, this will lead to a gradual collapse of the lungs. However, if the airways are open, any gas supplied to the upper airways will follow the pressure gradient and flow into the lungs to replace the oxygen consumed. If pure oxygen is supplied, this process will serve to replenish the oxygen stored in the lungs. The uptake of oxygen into the blood will then remain at the usual level and the normal functioning of the organs will not be affected. A detriment to this hyperoxygenation is possible nitrogen washout occurring which can lead to <b>absorption</b> <b>atelectasis.</b>|$|E

40|$|The lungs {{oxygenate}} blood less efficiently in the anaesthetized {{than the}} awake subject. Defective arterial oxygenation after pulmonary resection was reported {{as early as}} 1943 by Maier and Cournand [25], and in 1958 Campbell and co-workers [7] showed that anaesthesia was often associated with increased alveolar-arterial oxygen partial pressure difference. However, despite almost 50 years ' awareness of impaired gas exchange during anaesthesia, the causes under-lying this impairment have remained unclear until recently. This review considers the different mechanisms by which arterial oxygenation may be impaired. Compliance and functional residual capacity (FRC) In 1955, Nims and co-workers [29] found that the static compliance of the total respiratory system (lungs and chest wall) was reduced in the anaesthetized subject, and in succeeding studies lung compliance was shown to be lower in the anaesthetized than in awake subjects (for a review, see [9]). Bendixen and co-workers [1] reported continuously decreasing compliance during an-aesthesia, accompanied by a similarly decreasing arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pa^). Fol-lowing large inflations of the lungs, compliance and PZQ increased. The authors considered that this indicated slow development of <b>absorption</b> <b>atelectasis.</b> However, other research groups were unable to confirm the findings of Bendixen's group [31, 41]; and atelectasis could not be seen by conventional chest x-ray. Atelectasis as a mechanism of impaired gas exchange was rejected, therefore. In {{the same year as}} Bendixen and co-workers proposed the concept of atelectasis, Bergman [2...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} sudden {{onset of}} generalized pulmonary atelectasis following thoracic lavage in 3 dogs. Series Summary: Thoracic lavage was performed following ligation of a {{patent ductus arteriosus}} in case 1, prior to closure of a large traumatic full thickness wound in the chest wall in case 2, and during investigation of an idiopathic spontaneous pneumothorax in case 3. In each case anesthesia and surgery were uneventful until thoracic lavage was performed, after which sudden generalized pulmonary atelectasis was observed. The atelectasis was visualized and was associated with oxyhemoglobin desaturation, decreased end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (ETCO 2), and a marked increase in the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) required to achieve visible lung inflation. Occlusion of the endotracheal tube and cervical trachea was directly eliminated {{as the cause of}} atelectasis in cases 1 and 2, and indirectly eliminated in case 3. Improvement in pulmonary function occurred in all cases in response to increased PIP ± positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). New or Unique Information Provided: Generalized atelectasis should be considered a possible complication of thoracic lavage performed during thoracotomy. In the cases presented here, it is suspected that pre-existing reduction in lung volume (due to inadequate ventilation, surgical compression, <b>absorption</b> <b>atelectasis)</b> was exacerbated by the addition of the lavage fluid to the thoracic cavity. This pre-existing lung collapse is believed to have resulted in reduction of lung volume and that further reduction below the critical closing volume occurred following instillation of saline into the thorax resulting in the subsequent development of generalized atelectasis. The performance of regular arterial blood gas analyses and different ventilation protocols may have prevented the marked atelectasis that was observed in these cases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of 0. 5 {{fraction}} of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) and > 0. 95 FiO 2 on pulmonary gas exchange, shunt fraction and oxygen delivery (DO 2) in dorsally recumbent horses during inhalant anesthesia. The use of 0. 5 FiO 2 has the potential to reduce <b>absorption</b> <b>atelectasis</b> (compared to maximal FiO 2) and augment alveolar oxygen (O 2) tensions (compared to ambient air) thereby improving gas exchange and DO 2. Our hypothesis was that 0. 5 FiO 2 would reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatching and increase the fraction of pulmonary blood flow that is oxygenated, thus improving arterial oxygen content and DO 2. Results Arterial partial pressures of O 2 were significantly higher than preanesthetic levels at all times during anesthesia in the > 0. 95 FiO 2 group. Arterial partial pressures of O 2 did not change from preanesthetic levels in the 0. 5 FiO 2 group but were significantly lower than in the > 0. 95 FiO 2 group from 15 to 90 min of anesthesia. Alveolar to arterial O 2 tension difference was increased significantly in both groups during anesthesia compared to preanesthetic values. The alveolar to arterial O 2 tension difference was significantly higher at all times in the > 0. 95 FiO 2 group compared to the 0. 5 FiO 2 group. Oxygen delivery did not change from preanesthetic values in either group during anesthesia but was significantly lower than preanesthetic values 10 min after anesthesia in the 0. 5 FiO 2 group. Shunt fraction increased in both groups during anesthesia attaining statistical significance at varying times. Shunt fraction was significantly increased in both groups 10 min after anesthesia but was not different between groups. Alveolar dead space ventilation increased after 3 hr of anesthesia in both groups. Conclusions Reducing FiO 2 did not change alveolar dead space ventilation or shunt fraction in dorsally recumbent, mechanically ventilated horses during 3 hr of isoflurane anesthesia. Reducing FiO 2 in dorsally recumbent isoflurane anesthetized horses does not improve oxygenation or oxygen delivery. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background Flying high {{performance}} aircraft subjects the pilot to physical stress {{beyond the limits}} of human tolerance. The pilot faces challenges such as G-forces, low pressure environment and hypoxic air. Some research was done in the mid- 1900 s to explore the effects of flying on the human body. However, most research focused on topics relevant for enhancing the pilot s performance in the working situation in cockpit, less on pathologic effects of flying. Knowing {{that a lot of the}} physical stress on the pilot during {{high performance}} flying is directly affecting the lungs, the aim of this paper has been to answer the following question: How does high performance flying affect pulmonary function, both in the short and long term? Method I did a systematic search on PubMed and read titles and abstracts of 597 articles, selecting 11 relevant articles for a critical review. Further I did non-systematic searches in the NATO AGARD-library, UpToDate, and reference lists. I also used Ernsting s Aviation Medicine (4 th ed., 2006), one of the most renowned textbooks of aviation medicine. Results There is good evidence that increasing G-forces change the ventilation-perfusion equilibrium in the lungs. Breathing 100 % oxygen results in <b>absorption</b> <b>atelectasis.</b> G-forces, 100 % oxygen and G-suits all contribute to acceleration atelectasis and reduced vital capacity (VC). There is also evidence that poisonous gases and ozone present in cockpit may cause inflammation in the airways. The potential pathological effects of Positive Pressure Breathing (PPB) are unknown. As for long term effects only a few studies exist and the results are inconsistent. The research is more than 20 years old – thus it has not taken into account effects of fourth generation fighter planes introduced in the 80 s and 90 s. In addition these studies lack certain quality requirements that apply to research today. Conclusion High performance flying has immediate effects on lung function, both as a result of the flying itself and by the variety of aids that help the pilot maintain his function in a physically demanding situation. There is a great lack of knowledge about high performance flying and long term pathologic effects on pulmonary function. Further research on the topic is required...|$|E
