5|$|The {{following}} sequence demonstrates mapping a band configuration to a counting symmetry equivalence class. Begin with a valid band configuration (1). Build column triplets {{by ordering}} the column values within each column. This {{is not a}} valid Sudoku band, but does place the same constraints on the lower bands as the example (2). Construct an equivalence class ID from the B2, B3 column triplet values. Use column <b>and</b> <b>box</b> swaps to achieve the lowest lexicographical ID. The last figure shows the column <b>and</b> <b>box</b> ordering for the ID: 124 369 578 138 267 459. All Band1 permutations with this counting symmetry ID {{will have the same}} number of grid completions as the original example. An extension of this process can be used to build the largest possible band counting symmetry equivalence classes (3).|$|E

It was {{to document the}} founding of the Scouting movement but was left unfinished after DeMille died in January 1959.

After DeMille's death, associate producer Henry Wilcoxon continued to work on the film until 1962, hiring Sydney Box to assist with the script. Starting in 2001, producers Jerry Molen and Robert Starling began work to finish DeMille's project, using an updated screenplay by Starling based on the earlier work of Lasky <b>and</b> <b>Box.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver <b>and</b> <b>box</b> volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} years of the project, workers were {{regularly}} treated to prime rib, steak dinners, and other exotic fare due to a cost-plus contract between the food preparers and the subcontractors. In later years, these cost-plus contracts were replaced, and institutional cooking <b>and</b> <b>box</b> lunches became common, but the food on the project was prized by many workers. As soon as the haul road, later named the Dalton Highway, was built, the food and the overtime for some unions changed. The highway construction was charged to the federal and state governments and was supposed to be cost plus. There were no more steak nights one to two times a week and the Australian rock lobster tails disappeared. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) LU 1547 was one union that had overtime on Sundays changed from double time to time-and-one-half upon completion of the haul road.|$|E

5|$|Paul prefers {{playing in}} the half court versus playing up-tempo.
