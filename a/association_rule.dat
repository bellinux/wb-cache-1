40|$|Business {{workflow}} analysis has become crucial in strategizing {{how to create}} competitive edge. Consequently, deriving a series of positively correlated <b>association</b> <b>rules</b> from workflows is essential to identify strong relationships among key business activities. These rules can subsequently, serve as best practices. We have addressed this problem by hybridizing genetic algorithm with <b>association</b> <b>rules.</b> First, we used correlation to replace support-confidence in genetic algorithm to enable dynamic data-driven determination of support and confidence, i. e., use correlation to optimize the derivation of positively correlated <b>association</b> <b>rules.</b> Second, we used correlation as fitness function to support upward closure in <b>association</b> <b>rules</b> (hitherto, <b>association</b> <b>rules</b> support only downward closure). The ability to support upward closure allows derivation of the most specific <b>association</b> <b>rules</b> (business model) from less specific <b>association</b> <b>rules</b> (business meta-model) and generic <b>association</b> <b>rules</b> (reference meta-model). Downward closure allows the opposite. Upward-downward closures allow the manager to drill-down and analyze based {{on the degree of}} dependency among business activities. Subsequently, <b>association</b> <b>rules</b> can be used to describe best practices at the model, meta-model and reference meta-model levels with the most general positively dependent <b>association</b> <b>rules</b> as reference meta-model.
