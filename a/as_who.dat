They kept the framework of government but made changes in the personnel, although at first the new king attempted to keep some natives in office.

The forest laws were introduced, leading to the setting aside of large sections of England as royal forest. The Domesday survey was an administrative catalogue of the landholdings of the kingdom, and was unique to medieval Europe. It was divided into sections based on the shires, and listed all the landholdings of each tenant-in-chief of the king as well <b>as</b> <b>who</b> had held the land before the conquest.|$|E
