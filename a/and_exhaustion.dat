5|$|Bojić's {{popularity}} grew exponentially {{following his}} death. Many of his poems received widespread critical acclaim for their {{portrayal of the}} Serbian Army's retreat {{during the winter of}} 1915–16 and its stay on Corfu, where thousands of soldiers succumbed to disease <b>and</b> <b>exhaustion</b> and were buried at sea. Bojić's work remained popular in Yugoslavia for much of the 20th century, cementing his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest Serbian poets of the Romantic period.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. Burnout is a {{state of}} work-related {{emotional}} <b>and</b> physical <b>exhaustion.</b> Burnout is related to sleep complaints. By contrast, people with optimistic attitude seem to be less vulnerable to stress and burnout. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the relation between burnout, depressive symptoms, satisfaction with life, and sleep complaints. Methods. A total of 2231 participants (age [years]: M= 40. 8; 1183 females and 1048 males) took part in the study. Participants completed a series of questionnaires such as the Tedium Measure, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Satisfaction with Life-questionnaire. For statistical analyses, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) was applied. Results. Pessimism, emotional <b>and</b> physical <b>exhaustion,</b> depressive symptoms, <b>and</b> low satisfaction with life were interrelated. Emotional <b>and</b> physical <b>exhaustion</b> was related to sleep complaints, whereas sleep complaints were not related to depressive symptoms and pessimism. Satisfaction with life was related to low sleep complaints, though mediated via low emotional <b>and</b> physical <b>exhaustion,</b> <b>and</b> low pessimism. Conclusions. Results suggest that among burnout symptoms emotional <b>and</b> physical <b>exhaustion,</b> but not depressive symptoms, are related to sleep complaints. Satisfaction with life, via low emotional <b>and</b> physical <b>exhaustion,</b> <b>and</b> low pessimism, further contributes to favourable sleep...|$|R

Banza's mistress, Julienne Kombo, who entered the Palais de la Renaissance crying hysterically after her lover's death, was arrested and jailed until 24 June 1972. Banza's father was sent to jail, where he died of hunger <b>and</b> <b>exhaustion</b> on 24 April 1970 at Ngaragba Central Prison. Banza's two younger brothers, Beuoane and Gouboulo, were dismissed from the gendarmerie in July and sent to Ngaragba Prison.

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the links between empathy, emotional labor (both surface and deep acting), <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion</b> as well as determine if emotional labor mediates the relationship between empathy <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion</b> in teachers. It was assumed that emotional labor can take two opposite directions (positive mood induction and negative mood induction). Thus, the additional aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the mediating role of mood regulation strategies in the relationship between empathy <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion.</b> Materials <b>and</b> Methods: A sample of 168 teachers from Łódź and its surroundings completed a set of questionnaires: Emotional Labor Scale; Mood Regulation Scales, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Empathic Sensitivity Scale. Results: The results provided mixed support for the hypotheses indicating that both types of emotional labor, negative mood induction <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion</b> were positively intercorrelated. Moreover, deep acting was a significant mediator in the relationship between empathy <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion.</b> The analyzed link was also mediated by negative mood induction, whereas positive mood induction did not emerge as a significant mediator. Conclusions: The study provided insight into the role of empathy and emotional labor in the development of teacher burnout. It also confirmed that deep acting and negative mood induction mediate the relationship between empathy <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion</b> in teachers...|$|R

40|$|Background: Anesthesiology may be {{stressful}} {{and most}} anesthesiologists develop mechanisms for coping. However, inexperienced trainee anesthesiologists {{seem to be}} vulnerable. We studied stress perception and job burnout in trainee anesthesiologists. Methods: Responses to perceived stress scale (PSS) and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) were evaluated in 159 trainee anesthesiologists. Results: In our results, when perceived stress was increased, emotional <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> depersonalization increased but personal accomplishment decreased, as expected. Perceived stress was very high {{in the early years}} of training. There was a negative correlation between age <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> depersonalization, but positive correlation with personal accomplishment. Female anesthesiologists had higher personal accomplishment, but lower depersonalization points than male anesthesiologists in our study. There was no statistical association between marital status, PSS, and MBI; ≥ 2 children group had a significant high personal accomplishment but low depersonalization <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion</b> scores. Line regression analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between PSS <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> between age and depersonalization.

5|$|As the SS Panzer Corps {{began to}} emerge from the city, they engaged Soviet units {{positioned}} directly southwest of the city, including the 17th NKVD Brigade, 19th Rifle Division and 25th Guards Rifle Division. Attempts by the Red Army to re-establish communication with the remnants of the 3rd Tank Army continued, although in vain. On 14–15 March these forces were given permission to withdraw to the northern Donets River. The Soviet 40th and 69th armies had been engaged since 13 March with the Großdeutschland Panzergrenadier Division, and had been split by the German drive. After the fall of Kharkov the Soviet defense of the Donets had collapsed, allowing Manstein's forces to drive to Belgorod on 17 March, and take it by the next day. However, weather <b>and</b> <b>exhaustion</b> forced Manstein's counterstroke to end soon thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{managed to}} {{accomplish}} their objectives; the Japanese withdrew, while the Australians exacted a terrible toll. The balance of losses was overwhelmingly against the Japanese, {{both in terms}} of men and equipment. It seems that only about 4,300 of the 7,000 troops under the command of the Japanese 20th Division who had originally been forward of Sio survived the withdrawal, and many of them were rendered ineffective through wounds, sickness, malnutrition <b>and</b> <b>exhaustion.</b> The opportunity to destroy the Japanese 51st Division was not seized. These troops lived to fight the Americans at the Battle of Driniumor River later in the year, and the Australians in the Aitape–Wewak campaign in 1945. On the other hand, the new base at Finschhafen was no longer threatened by the Japanese, and became an important staging point for the Western New Guinea campaign. The capture of the Japanese ciphers at Sio allowed General MacArthur to carry out Operations Reckless and Persecution with a plan based upon sound intelligence rather than just his own intuition.|$|E
5|$|Battle {{losses of}} horses were {{approximately}} 25percent of all war-related equine deaths between 1914 and 1916. Disease <b>and</b> <b>exhaustion</b> {{accounted for the}} remainder and the Germans specifically targeted horses with gunfire. The highest death rates were in East Africa, where in 1916 alone deaths of the original mounts and remounts accounted for 290% of the initial stock numbers, mainly due to infection from the tsetse fly. On average, Britain lost about 15 percent (of the initial military stock) of its animals each year of the war (killed, missing, died or abandoned), with losses at 17 percent in the French theatre. This compared to 80 percent in the Crimean War, 120 percent in the Boer War and 10 percent in peacetime. During some periods of the war, 1,000horses per day were arriving in Europe as remounts for British troops, to replace horses lost. Some horses, having collapsed from exhaustion, drowned in ankle-deep mud, too tired to lift their heads high enough to breathe. Equine casualties were especially high during battles of attrition, such as the 1916 Battle of Verdun between French and German forces. In one day in March, 7,000 horses were killed by long-range shelling on both sides, including 97 killed by a single shot from a French naval gun. By 1917, Britain had over a million horses and mules in service, but harsh conditions, especially during winter, resulted in heavy losses, particularly amongst the Clydesdale horses, the main breed used to haul the guns. Over {{the course of the}} war, Britain lost over 484,000horses, one horse for every two men. A small number of these, 210, were killed by poison gas.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased {{upon the}} revised Job Demands and Resources Model (2008) we aim first, {{to test the}} {{relations}} between work-family conflict <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion</b> across time <b>and</b> second, to determine the role of professional self-efficacy in this relation. A longitudinal {{study was conducted in}} two times, with a year of interval in a Spanish Army sample (n= 242). To test the causal relations between work-family <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion</b> three models are tested: normal causal, reversed causal, and causal reciprocal. To test the role of professional self-efficacy in the relation between work-family conflict <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion</b> four alternative models are tested: independence, antecedent, mediation, and independence plus antecedent models. Structural Equation Modeling results confirm the simultaneous reciprocal effects model as it fits the data better than the normal causal or the reverse causal models. This result suggests a spiral process, where work-family conflict predicts emotional <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> at the same time emotional exhaustion increases work-family conflict. Likewise, this article contributes to clarifying the role of self-efficacy in the complex relationship between work-family conflict <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although prison {{officers}} {{experience the}} working conditions associated with work-life conflict, {{little research has}} explored this issue. This study draws upon the work-home resources model (ten Brummelhuis & Bakker, 2012) to investigate relationships between working conditions (demands and experiences of aggression) and time-based, strain-based and behavior-based work-life conflict in UK prison officers (n = 1, 682). Associations between working conditions, work-life conflict, <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion</b> were also examined. Two recovery behaviors (affective rumination and detachment) were considered as potential moderators of associations between working conditions <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion.</b> High levels of all work-life conflict dimensions were found which were related to working conditions <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion.</b> Some evidence was found that higher rumination and lower detachment exacerbated the positive association between both job demands and aggression <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion.</b> The implications of the findings for the wellbeing and professional functioning of prison officers are discussed, together with key areas for future research...|$|R
40|$|Emotional labour {{could have}} {{negative}} {{as well as}} positive effects on the employees' psychological well-being. In this cross-sectional study among 149 high school teachers, the relationship between emotional labour – in this study conceptualized as emotional demands – <b>and</b> emotional <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> work engagement respectively was studied. First of all, it was examined whether emotional dissonance mediates the relationship between emotional demands <b>and</b> both emotional <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> work engagement. Next, the possible moderating effect of two emotion regulation strategies, surface acting and deep acting, {{on the relationship between}} emotional dissonance and the two outcome variables was studied.
