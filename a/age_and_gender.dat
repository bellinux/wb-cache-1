5|$|The birthday-number {{effect is}} the {{unconscious}} tendency {{of people to}} prefer the numbers in the date of their birthday over other numbers. First reported in 1997 by Japanese psychologists Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa, the birthday-number effect has been replicated in various countries. It holds across <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender.</b> The effect is most prominent for numbers over 12.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian {{psychologist}} Jozef Nuttin, the name-letter {{effect has}} been replicated {{in dozens of}} studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender.</b> People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for initials, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both given and family names still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.|$|E
5|$|Many {{surviving}} funerary busts reached Western museums {{during the}} 19th century. Palmyra provided {{the most convenient}} Eastern examples bolstering an art-history controversy {{at the turn of}} the 20th century: to what extent Eastern influence on Roman art replaced idealized classicism with frontal, hieratic and simplified figures (as believed by Josef Strzygowski and others). This transition is seen as a response to cultural changes in the Western Roman Empire, rather than artistic influence from the East. Palmyrene bust reliefs, unlike Roman sculptures, are rudimentary portraits; although many reflect high quality individuality, the majority vary little across figures of similar <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender.</b>|$|E

5|$|Camping is {{available}} at local recreational vehicle parks (RV parks), including Carl Precht Memorial RV Park, Sunset Lakes RV Park (adjacent to Duck Lake), and Margie's R.V. Park. There are over a half-dozen campgrounds in proximity to Omak. The Omak–Okanogan region has been well known for its rock climbing structures since the early 1970s. Nearby communities in Okanogan County offer horseback riding and hunting. Fishing and boating is achievable within short distance, at the nearby Omak Lake. The Omak Pioneers represent Omak High School as their baseball, basketball, football, soccer, volleyball, and wrestling teams. There are separate teams based on <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender.</b> There are all-terrain vehicle (ATV) courses located nearby, specifically in the Loup Loup Ski Bowl.|$|E

For leafy greens, such as lettuce and spinach, a single serving is typically a full cup. A variety of products should be chosen as no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients needed for health.|$|E

40|$|Unless (2002) is Canadian author Carol Shields’s final novel, a text {{concerned}} with the mother-daughter relationship and a woman’s place in a patriarchal world. It is also a novel about <b>ageing</b> <b>and,</b> particularly, with its forty-three to forty-four-year-old protagonist, about middle age. Attention to the novel’s representation of time, <b>ageing,</b> <b>and</b> generational identity suggests that this text, which is usually read as Shields’s most feminist work, does not propound a clear and certain feminist narrative. Reta’s story demonstrates that, despite the often strident feminist politics of this novel, the implications and effects of the intersection of <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender</b> cannot be fully articulated. Following on from the proliferation of writing in English about women <b>and</b> <b>ageing</b> in the 1990 s, Unless {{can be seen as}} part of an emerging – and not necessarily coherent – conversation about <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender</b> in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century...|$|R

25|$|Weregild, {{which was}} a murder fine based on a victim's worth, was {{intended}} to prevent blood feuds. Some wrongs in later law codes were botleas 'without remedy' (e.g. theft, open murder, arson, treason against one's lord), that is, unable to be compensated, and those convicted of a botleas crime were at the king's mercy. Items or creatures which caused death were also destroyed as deodands. Assessing intention was a matter for the court, but Alfred the Great's Doom book did distinguish unintentional injuries from intentional ones, whereas culpability depended on status, <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender.</b>|$|E

In particular, books and magazines sold to boys (shōnen) and girls (shōjo) have distinctive cover-art, and most bookstores place them on different shelves. Due to cross-readership, consumer response is not limited by demographics. For example, male readers may subscribe to a series intended for female readers, and so on. Japan has manga cafés, or manga kissa (kissa is an abbreviation of kissaten). At a manga kissa, people drink coffee, read manga and sometimes stay overnight.|$|E

Men wore trousers either as outer garments or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear their pants (termed sokgot) without a covering skirt.

25|$|Childhood on the American {{frontier}} is contested territory. One {{group of}} scholars, {{following the lead}} of novelists Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder, argue the rural environment was beneficial to the child's upbringing. Historians Katherine Harris and Elliott West write that rural upbringing allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender,</b> promoted family interdependence, and in the end produced children who were more self-reliant, mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts. On the other hand, historians Elizabeth Hampsten and Lillian Schlissel offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age. Riney-Kehrberg takes a middle position.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} samples t-test is used when two separate sets of independent and identically distributed samples are obtained, one {{from each of}} the two populations being compared.

In this case, we have two {{independent samples}} and would use the unpaired form of the t-test. The randomization is not essential here – if we contacted 100people by phone and obtained each person's <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender,</b> and then used a two-sample t-test to see whether the mean ages differ by gender, this would also be an independent samples t-test, even though the data are observational.|$|E
