5|$|Jeopardy! was not {{the first}} game show to give contestants the <b>answers</b> <b>and</b> require the questions. That format had {{previously}} been used by the Gil Fates-hosted program CBS Television Quiz, which aired from July 1941 until May 1942.|$|E
5|$|The {{third round}} {{consists}} of two questions. In season 1, the first required the team to rank three answers in a stated order and started with a value of $15,000. The second had an opening value of $25,000 and {{any or all of}} the answers could have been correct; the contestants had select all correct <b>answers,</b> <b>and</b> only the correct answers in order to get credit. Starting in season 2, the $15,000 question has two or all three answers being correct, and the team must select all of the correct <b>answers,</b> <b>and</b> only the correct answers; the $25,000 question requires the team to rank the three answers in the correct order.|$|E

Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 4, with a 4 representing the most complete response. Communication and clarity in the answers receive a lot of emphasis in the grading.|$|E
5|$|The game is Barlow's first project {{since his}} {{departure}} from Climax Studios, {{after which he}} became independent. He wanted to develop a game that was dependent on the narrative, and avoided working on the game until he was settled on an idea that was possible to execute. Barlow eventually decided to create a police procedural game, and incorporate live action footage. He conducted research for the game by watching existing police interviews. Upon doing so, he discovered recurring themes in the suspects' <b>answers,</b> <b>and</b> decided to incorporate ambiguity to the investigation in the game.|$|E

5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible <b>answers,</b> <b>and</b> also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the broadcast of Part One, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where callers who dialed 1-800-COLLECT were eligible and they then guessed who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 {{and was one of}} the first contests to tie together elements of television and the Internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a random sample of entries. The sample did not contain any correct <b>answers,</b> <b>and</b> so a winner (who had the wrong answer) was chosen at random. However, the winner, Fayla Gibson of Washington D.C., did not watch the show and opted to accept a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E

When he discovers that Xion is a replica of Sora created by Xemnas, Roxas is compelled to defect from Organization XIII to find <b>answers</b> <b>and</b> meet Sora. After doing so, he encounters Xion, who tries to absorb him {{so that she can}} become a complete replica of Sora; however, the fight ends with Xion's defeat, and she entrusts Roxas with the task of freeing the hearts the Organization captured.

5|$|On Halloween, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is carving a jack-o'-lantern while {{preparing}} {{to take his}} daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) trick-or-treating. As he leaves to collect her, he notices a demonic figure watching him from across the street. That night, Jordan deliberately passes by one house, telling Black that it is haunted. Black tells her {{there are no such}} thing as ghosts, but is reminded of a moment from his past. In a flashback, we see a five-year-old Black being dared by his friends to knock the door of the same house; a man named Crocell (Dean Winters) <b>answers</b> <b>and</b> invites Black inside. Crocell is a Second World War veteran, and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black, telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living. Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war, and is dismayed when the young Black dismisses the possibility of ghosts.|$|E

5|$|The International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially {{launched}} the bid {{process for the}} 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on May 16, 2007. All then 203 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) were invited to submit {{the name of a}} city within their jurisdiction until September 13, 2007. On September 14, the IOC recognized seven cities—Baku, Chicago, Doha, Madrid, Prague, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo—which had been put forward by their respective NOCs to bid. On October 1, 2007, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee paid the required fee of USD 150,000 to the IOC and signed the Candidature Acceptance Procedure. Soon after, from October 15 to 19, Rio officials attended the 2016 Applicant cities' Seminar organized by the IOC at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, where they learnt more about technical areas that would be analyzed throughout the application process. On January 14, 2008, the seven Applicant cities returned documents, known as the Application Files, containing the <b>answers</b> <b>and</b> guarantees requested by the 2016 Candidature Acceptance Procedure, which provided to the IOC an overview of each city's project. The responses were studied by the IOC Working Group for months and served as the basis to the shortlist of Chicago, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and Madrid on June 4, 2008, becoming Candidate cities during a meeting of the IOC Executive Board at the 2008 SportAccord Convention in Athens, Greece.|$|E
5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, democracy was satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to actually use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling them all together {{in a short period}} of time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick <b>answers,</b> <b>and</b> three-hundred senators were more capable of quick action than were thousands of electors. The questions were also more complex than were the questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, and the fact that they had income sources that were independent of their political roles made it easier for them to involve themselves in policy questions over extended periods of time.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{discovers that}} Kyle's adoptive parents have died. She and Victoria attend the funeral {{to see if}} Kyle is there and see him at the wake with his adoptive grandmother, Joanie Wright (Denise Black). When Kyle drops his toy, Amy {{picks it up and}} tries to give it back but Joanie doesn't hear her so she keeps it. Amy returns the next day and a barmaid gives her Joanie's address. Amy plans to return the toy but changes her mind and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is {{studying}} childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it is a bad idea and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother. Disgusted, Joanie refuses to let Amy see Kyle again but is eventually persuaded to change her mind. Sadly, while Amy and Kyle are on a picnic together, Kyle almost drowns and Joanie blames Amy. She promptly bans her from seeing Kyle and refuses to even consider changing her mind, even calling the police when Amy visits repeatedly, who warn her to stay away. Desperate to see her son, Amy and Andy (who she is now dating) call Social Services to see if she can get custody but the social worker tells her that being awarded custody is very unlikely. Feeling now that the adoption was a mistake, Amy decides to snatch Kyle and go on the run. Kerry, understanding how Amy feels, tries to talk her out of it but when she can't, decides to help her. They go to Kyle's playgroup and kidnap him and Kerry drives them to the docks. During the drive, Val phones repeatedly but they don't answer. Eventually Kerry <b>answers</b> <b>and</b> Amy tearfully reveals her plans before throwing the phone away. Eric checks the computer's internet history and finds out where Amy is going. Cain, Andy, Val, Eric and Joanie all rush to the docks. In the end, Cain persuades Amy to return Kyle, warning her of the complications of the life on the run and how Kyle might be affected. She says goodbye to Kyle and gives him to Cain but fearing she'll be sent to prison, Amy leaves, devastating Val. Val later gets a call from Amy and learns that she is living in Ireland with her aunt.|$|E
