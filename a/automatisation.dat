25|$|In 2008, S Heim et al. {{was one of}} {{the first}} studies not to just compare {{dyslexic}}s with a non dyslexic control, but to go further and compare the different cognitive sub groups with a non dyslexic control group. Different theories conceptualise dyslexia as either a phonological, attentional, auditory, magnocellular, or <b>automatisation</b> deficit. Such heterogeneity suggests the existence of yet unrecognised subtypes of dyslexics suffering from distinguishable deficits. The purpose of the study was to identify cognitive subtypes of dyslexia. Out of 642 children screened for reading ability 49 dyslexics and 48 controls were tested for phonological awareness, auditory discrimination, motion detection, visual attention, and rhythm imitation. A combined cluster and discriminant analysis approach revealed three clusters of dyslexics with different cognitive deficits. Compared to reading-unimpaired children cluster no. 1 had worse phonological awareness; cluster no. 2 had higher attentional costs; cluster no. 3 performed worse in the phonological, auditory, and magnocellular tasks. These results indicate that dyslexia may result from distinct cognitive impairments. As a consequence, prevention and remediation programmes should be specifically targeted for the individual child's deficit pattern.|$|E

50|$|The {{cerebellar}} {{theory of}} dyslexia asserts that a mildly dysfunctional cerebellum can cause dyslexia. This theory was initially proposed by Harold Levinson and Jan Frank in 1973 and further developed by Levinson and other researchers. Angela Fawcett and Rod Nicolson later {{proposed that the}} cerebellum contributes to motor control during the articulation of speech, and that articulation problems {{can contribute to the}} phonological processing deficits that can cause dyslexia. They also reasoned that the cerebellum contributes to the <b>automatisation</b> of learned behaviors, which may include learning the grapheme-phoneme relationships when reading text.|$|E

But the technology of testing that followed, with its major emphasis on reliability and the <b>automatisation</b> of marking, has been an uncomfortable partner for some areas of educational achievement: assessing writing or speaking, and other kinds of performance need something more qualitative and judgemental.|$|E

Apropos of his axiom, [...] "The medium is the message," [...] McLuhan argues that technologies are not simply inventions which people employ but are the means by which people are re-invented. The invention of movable type was the decisive moment in the change from a culture in which all the senses partook of a common interplay to a tyranny of the visual. He also argued that the development of the printing press {{led to the creation of}} nationalism, dualism, domination of rationalism, <b>automatisation</b> of scientific research, uniformation and standardisation of culture and alienation of individuals.|$|E
50|$|Vivant is {{economically}} liberal, {{advocating a}} basic income guarantee for all citizens. Vivant considers the basic income as an inalienable {{part of the}} legal minimum wage (approximately half of it for full-time employment). In order to tax goods more evenly, wherever they are manufactured in order to respond to <b>automatisation,</b> globalization and an ageing population, Vivant proposes to shift taxes from labour to final consumption. (All taxes {{in the chain of}} production are an inclusive part of the price paid by the consumers and could be considered as a consumption tax, each tax in each stage with its specific side effects.) Vivant also proposes a flat tax on income in two steps, 0% on to 1350 Euro and 50% from there. The VLD doesn't support all of these measures. Vivant also has direct democracy as one of its key points.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s {{researchers}} Angela Fawcett and Rod Nicolson {{also supported}} {{the idea that}} dyslexia and other mental disabilities were caused by problems in the cerebellum. Their research focused {{on the role of}} the cerebellum in motor control and its effects on speech articulation, which could in turn lead to poor phonological representations. The second thing that they focused on was the role of the cerebellum in the <b>automatisation</b> of learned tasks, which could affect the ability of an individual to form sound-letter correlations as easily as others, making it more difficult to read. Later research showed their first hypothesis to be unlikely, but did not disprove their second hypothesis. It also showed that while difficulty with balance associated with an impaired cerebellum could be found in individuals with dyslexia, it was also found within individuals having ADHD or intelligence impairment. Therefore, a direct correlation between dyslexia and balance was not clear.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the roots}} of formalised logic go back to Aristotle, {{the end of the}} 19th and early 20th centuries saw the {{development}} of modern logic and formalised mathematics. Frege's Begriffsschrift (1879) introduced both a complete propositional calculus and what is essentially modern predicate logic. [...] His Foundations of Arithmetic, published 1884, expressed (parts of) mathematics in formal logic. This approach was continued by Russell and Whitehead in their influential Principia Mathematica, first published 1910-1913, and with a revised second edition in 1927. Russell and Whitehead thought they could derive all mathematical truth using axioms and inference rules of formal logic, in principle opening up the process to <b>automatisation.</b> In 1920, Thoralf Skolem simplified a previous result by Leopold Löwenheim, leading to the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem and, in 1930, to the notion of a Herbrand universe and a Herbrand interpretation that allowed (un)satisfiability of first-order formulas (and hence the validity of a theorem) to be reduced to (potentially infinitely many) propositional satisfiability problems.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explored {{different aspects}} of bilingual word recognition. First, bilingual auditory word recognition was examined using interlingual homophones in a cross-modal priming task. Bilinguals were found to activate word candidates in both languages, but were also sensitive to sublexical differences between cross-linguistically phonologically similar words (e. g., LIEF, Dutch, and LEAF, English). Second, the development of cognitive control and <b>automatisation</b> with increasing proficiency was examined in a lexical decision study. Unexpectedly, cognitive control did not vary much with language proficiency. When items of the native language {{were present in the}} experiment, different proficiency groups were unable to exclude interference by that language. Proficiency differences were only reflected in slower reactions and more errors in less proficient bilinguals. <b>Automatisation</b> was operationalized using the Coefficient of Variability (CV) by Segalowitz, defined as the mean standard deviation of a participant's RTs divided by the mean RT. However, the observed pattern of CV was not in accordance with Segalowitz's predictions. The only observed differences in <b>automatisation</b> across proficiency groups were in terms of speed and error rates. Third, the effects of the second language on the mother tongue were examined using masked priming with interlingual neighbors. A brief (unconscious) presentation of the prime 'large' slowed down the word recognition response on the following target word 'LARVE', compared to an orthographically unrelated prime. Nonword primes that shared all but one letter with the target (e. g., lorve - larve) also produced interference. However, repeated presentation of the target word led to a diminished interference effect, and ultimately to no effect at al...|$|E

S tem je podjetje primorano izdelke prilagajati avtomatizirani montaži. Z avtomatiziranimi montažami znižujejo proizvodnje stroške in stremijo k večji učinkovitosti. Prav tako zmanjšujejo čas izdelave produkta in s tem povečujejo količino proizvodov.
