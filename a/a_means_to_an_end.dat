5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that}} we can never treat a human as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
5|$|This {{formulation}} {{requires that}} actions {{be considered as}} if their maxim {{is to provide a}} law for a hypothetical Kingdom of Ends. Accordingly, people have an obligation to act upon principles that a community of rational agents would accept as laws. In such a community, each individual would only accept maxims that can govern every member of the community without treating any member merely as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end.</b> Although the Kingdom of Ends is an ideal—the actions of other people and events of nature ensure that actions with good intentions sometimes result in harm—we are still required to act categorically, as legislators of this ideal kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Ethicist Tom Regan {{rejected}} Kant's {{assessment of}} the moral worth of animals on three main points: First, he rejected Kant's claim that animals are not self-conscious. He then challenged Kant's claim that animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make a moral judgment. Regan argued that, if a being's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgment, then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration. Regan finally argued that Kant's assertion that animals exist merely as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> is unsupported; the fact that animals have a life that can go well or badly suggests that, like humans, {{they have their own}} ends.|$|E

5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E
5|$|Quantrill's Raiders had {{a support}} network in Missouri, that {{provided}} them with numerous hiding places. Anderson's sisters aided the guerrillas by gathering information inside Union territory. In August 1863, however, Union General Thomas Ewing, Jr., attempted to thwart the guerrillas by arresting their female relatives, and Anderson's sisters were confined in a three-story building on Grand Avenue in Kansas City {{with a number of}} other girls. While they were confined, the building collapsed, killing one of Anderson's sisters. In the aftermath, rumors that the building had been intentionally sabotaged by Union soldiers spread quickly; Anderson was convinced that it had been a deliberate act. Biographer Larry Wood wrote that Anderson's motivation shifted {{after the death of his}} sister, arguing that killing then became his focus—and an enjoyable act. Castel and Goodrich maintain that killing became more than <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> at that point for Anderson: it became an end in itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} all humans are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed on anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they treat women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: {{because there is a}} perfect duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E

25|$|The {{assumptions}} of Maslow and Herzberg were challenged by a classic study at Vauxhall Motors' UK manufacturing plant.

Therefore, non-cooperation in Satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the cooperation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice.|$|E

25|$|Whereas Singer is {{primarily}} concerned with improving the treatment of animals and accepts that, in some hypothetical scenarios, individual animals might be used legitimately to further human or nonhuman ends, Regan believes we ought to treat nonhuman animals as we would humans.

25|$|The {{capabilities}} approach – {{sometimes called}} the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of “capability deprivation”.

Its goal is to “wid people’s choices {{and the level of}} their achieved well-being” through increasing functionings (the things a person values doing), capabilities (the freedom to enjoy functionings) and agency (the ability to pursue valued goals).|$|E
25|$|Asturias {{was one of}} {{the first}} Latin American novelists to realize the {{enormous}} potential of language in literature.

His personal behaviour towards both his own men and French prisoners was eccentric and cruel.|$|E

In The Schlieffen Plan (1956, trans. 1958), Ritter published the Schlieffen Memorandum and described the six drafts that were necessary before Schlieffen was satisfied with it, demonstrating his difficulty of finding a way to win the anticipated war on two fronts and that until late in the process, Schlieffen had doubts about how to deploy the armies.

25|$|On 14 October, Egypt began {{a limited}} {{offensive}} against Israel for political reasons. Sadat needed Assad {{on his side}} for his peace policy with Israel to succeed, and military action was <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end.</b> The renewed Egyptian military offensive was ill-conceived. A week later, due to Egyptian inactivity, the Israelis had organised and the Arabs had lost their most important advantage. While the military offensive gave Assad hope, this was an illusion; the Arabs had already lost the war militarily. Egypt's behavior during the war caused friction between Assad and Sadat. Assad, still inexperienced in foreign policy, believed that the Egyptian–Syrian alliance was based on trust and failed to understand Egypt's duplicity. Although {{it was not until}} after the war that Assad would learn that Sadat was in contact with American National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger almost daily during the war, the seeds of distrust had been sown. Around this time, Sadat called for an American-led ceasefire agreement between Egypt, Syria and Israel; however, he was unaware that under Kissinger's tenure the United States had become a staunch supporter of Israel.|$|E
25|$|On 27 January, Manstein {{was sacked}} as Chief of Staff of Army Group A and {{appointed}} commander {{of an army}} corps in East Prussia. To silence Manstein, Halder had instigated his transfer to Stettin on 9 February.

On 2 February, Hitler was told of Manstein's plan and on 17 February, Hitler summoned Manstein, generals Rudolf Schmundt (Chief of Personnel of the German army) and Alfred Jodl, the Chief of Operations at Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, German armed forces high command), to attend a conference. The next day, Hitler ordered Manstein's thinking to be adopted, because it offered the possibility of decisive victory. Hitler recognised the breakthrough at Sedan only in tactical terms, whereas Manstein saw it as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end.</b> He envisaged an operation to the English Channel and the encirclement of the Allied armies in Belgium; if the plan succeeded, it could have a strategic effect.|$|E
25|$|One {{area where}} data access {{is likely to}} be {{difficult}} is flows from the technosphere. The technosphere is more simply defined as the man-made world. Considered by geologists as secondary resources, these resources are in theory 100% recyclable; however, in a practical sense, the primary goal is salvage. For an LCI, these technosphere products (supply chain products) are those that have been produced by man and unfortunately those completing a questionnaire about a process which uses a man-made product as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> will be unable to specify how much of a given input they use. Typically, they will not have access to data concerning inputs and outputs for previous production processes of the product. The entity undertaking the LCA must then turn to secondary sources if it does not already have that data from its own previous studies. National databases or data sets that come with LCA-practitioner tools, or that can be readily accessed, are the usual sources for that information. Care must then be taken to ensure that the secondary data source properly reflects regional or national conditions.|$|E
