50|$|He applied Cartesian {{principles}} {{to the question}} of <b>women</b> <b>and</b> wrote many texts of social philosophy which denounced injustice <b>against</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> by the inequality of the female condition. Opposing the discrimination they experienced and as one of the champions of social equality between <b>women</b> <b>and</b> men, he is a precursor of the feminists.|$|R
5|$|Lépine's {{actions have}} been {{variously}} ascribed to psychiatric diagnoses such as personality disorder, psychosis, or attachment disorder, or societal {{factors such as}} poverty, isolation, powerlessness, and violence in the media. The massacre is regarded by criminologists {{as an example of}} a hate crime <b>against</b> <b>women,</b> <b>and</b> by feminists and government officials as misogynist attack and an example of the larger issue of violence against women.|$|E
5|$|Fonda was {{a visible}} {{political}} activist in the counterculture era during the Vietnam War {{and later became}} involved in advocacy for women. She was famously and controversially photographed sitting on an anti-aircraft gun on a 1972 visit to Hanoi. She has also protested the Iraq War and violence <b>against</b> <b>women,</b> <b>and</b> describes herself as a feminist. In 2005, she, Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices {{of women in the}} media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda serves {{on the board of the}} organization.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} requires foreign domestic helpers {{to leave}} Hong Kong {{within two weeks}} of the termination of their employment contract, unless they find another employer (the two-week rule). According to Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, this is a form of discrimination against foreign domestic helpers (who are almost all Southeast Asian); this limitation is not enforced for other foreign workers. The two-week rule has been condemned by two United Nations committees: the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination <b>Against</b> <b>Women</b> <b>and</b> the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.|$|E

5|$|The index gauges global peace {{using three}} broad themes: {{the level of}} safety and {{security}} in society, the extent of domestic and international conflict {{and the degree of}} militarization. Factors are both internal such as levels of violence and crime within the country and external such as military expenditure and wars. It has been criticised by Riane Eisler for not including indicators specifically relating to violence <b>against</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children.|$|E
5|$|In {{the book}} and the lectures, Lewis argues that {{significant}} changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination <b>against</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise.|$|E
5|$|The {{amendment}} defined pornography as a {{civil rights}} violation <b>against</b> <b>women,</b> <b>and</b> allowed women who claimed harm from pornography to sue the producers and distributors in civil court for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council, but vetoed both times by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered {{the wording of the}} ordinance to be too vague. Another version of the ordinance passed in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, but was overturned as unconstitutional under the First Amendment by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the case American Booksellers v. Hudnut. Dworkin continued to support the civil rights approach in her writing and activism, and supported anti-pornography feminists who organized later campaigns in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1985) and Bellingham, Washington (1988) to pass versions of the ordinance by voter initiative.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence <b>against</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E
