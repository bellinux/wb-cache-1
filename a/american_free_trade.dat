Despite these deepening economic ties, which are emblematic of the globalization era, and the rules that will bind their interactions, countries will retain their sovereignty and domestic institutions.

40|$|Many {{regional}} organisations in Latin America {{are currently}} in crisis. Trade agreements, however, have made progress in the region. Today, 80 per cent of intra-regional trade is already under preferences. In March 2017 several international financial organisations - the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) - each independently proposed {{the creation of a}} Latin <b>American</b> and Caribbean <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> area. Although ideological polarisation and the economic crisis led to a stagnation of high-flying regional cooperation projects, regional projects with more pragmatic and issue-specific objectives, such as the Pacific Alliance (PA), are gaining ground. In contrast to Trump's protectionist policies, an overwhelming majority of Latin <b>Americans</b> support <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> with neighbouring countries and regional economic integration. Tariffs are no longer the main obstacles to increasing trade in Latin America. The existing network of preferential trade agreements in Latin America provides a platform for the implementation of a regional <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> area. The elimination of non-tariff measures, the harmonisation of rules of origin, and the lowering of transport costs by improving the infrastructure and the interoperability of national customs systems can increase intra-regional trade. Pragmatic regionalism strives for a harmonisation of rules and standards but does not aspire to create supranational institutions. The advances of Latin American economic regionalism have been underrated; they should be more capitalised because the economic strength of a country's region conditions the success of global integration strategies. Hence, Latin America needs to develop a policy that combines efforts to integrate both at the regional level and globally. The European Union should both support Latin American economic integration and open its markets to competitive Latin American export products...|$|R

The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against).

5|$|Canada's {{economic}} integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E

The accuracy of these reports has been debated by both the Obama campaign and the Canadian Government. The news came at a key time nearing the Ohio and Texas primaries, where perceptions among Democratic voters was (and is) that the benefits of the NAFTA agreement are dubious. Thus the appearance that Obama was not being completely forthright was attacked by his opponent Hillary Clinton.|$|E

40|$|This article {{with minor}} revisions, was {{originally}} {{presented as a}} paper {{at the annual meeting}} of the Canadian Political Science Association in Victoria, B. C., May 27, 1990. Since then, Canada has been accused of simply following Washington's lead in sending troops to the Gulfand in seeking to join United States-Mexico <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> negotiations. These developments do not alter the paper's challenging conclusion : namely, that the current bilateral free-trade regime neither obliges nor justifies a subordinate Canadian foreign policy — however much the terms of the <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Agreement may impinge on the international dimensions of some Canadian policies (e. g., on energy and investment), and notwithstanding the potential momentum (but uncertain prospects) of North <b>American</b> integration. <b>Free</b> <b>trade,</b> in fact seems to have increased, not reduced, the salience of the national question in Canada. As well, the Gulf crisis is a test more of United Nations resolve than bilateral solidarity. And on the trade front, Canada has been reminded of the extent to which it remains on its own. U. S. negotiators were angered by Canada's middle-ground position on agricultural subsidies - the issue over which GATT talks collapsed, increasing Canadian vulnerability. Moreover, Canadian participation in U. S. Mexico trade negotiations has been privately less welcome than the official public rhetoric suggests.

On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E
