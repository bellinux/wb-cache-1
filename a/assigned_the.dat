40|$|The {{use of the}} {{constant}} sum paired comparison method and a PC software package are demonstrated for <b>assigning</b> <b>the</b> weights of importance to the non-monetary system requirements in the preliminary design phase of the system design process. Current methods of <b>assigning</b> <b>the</b> overall importance weight to the non-monetary system requirements appear to be inadequate in terms of accuracy and validation. The constant sum paired comparison method, investigated in this paper {{proved to be an}} explicit and simple method of <b>assigning</b> <b>the</b> overall importance weights. The relationship between the importance weights and <b>the</b> <b>assigned</b> comparison scores can be expressed by a linear hct ion. A PC software package utilizing {{the constant}} sum paired comparison method to <b>assign</b> <b>the</b> overall importance weight to non-monetary system requirements was developed for solving two distinct problem situations: 1) single set of requirements and 2) multiple sets of requirements...|$|R
