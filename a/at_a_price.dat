50|$|Similar to {{real estate}} {{flipping}}, car flipping {{is the process of}} buying automobiles <b>at</b> <b>a</b> low <b>price</b> and selling such vehicle <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>price.</b> <b>A</b> car flipper will identify reasonably priced vehicles that can be sold <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>price</b> after reconditioning and marketing to a larger market.|$|R
5000|$|Outside of {{real estate}} and cars, all {{consumer}} products can be flipped. Product flipping entails buying products <b>at</b> <b>a</b> low <b>price</b> and selling it <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>price</b> for profit. Products can be new or used items. Many times, product flippers buy products at dollar stores, thrift stores, garage sales and estate auctions and resell them <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>price</b> on online marketplaces or locally.|$|R

5|$|UK Chinook {{procurement}} ambitions were revived in 1978 with an announced {{requirement for}} a new heavy-lift helicopter to replace the Westland Wessex. Thirty Chinooks were ordered <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> of US$200 million. These helicopters, comparable to the CH-47C with Lycoming T55-L-11E engines, were again designated Chinook HC Mk1, and entered service in December 1980. Eight more Mk1s were delivered from 1984 to 1986 with the CH-47D's Lycoming T55-L-712 turboshafts.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the release of Mughal-e-Azam, a typical Bollywood film would garner a {{distribution}} fee of 300,000–400,000 (about US$63,000–84,000 in 1960) per territory. Asif insisted that he would sell his film to the distributors at no less than 700,000 per territory. Subsequently, the film was actually sold <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> of 1.7million (US$356,000) per territory, surprising Asif and the producers. Thus, it set the record for the highest distribution fee received by any Bollywood film at that time.|$|E

5|$|Bungie {{released}} a demo on May 24, 2010, featuring a single player level from the game's story mode, a multiplayer competitive map, and a cooperative firefight mission. Microsoft later listed Reach as an Xbox Live Marketplace download on August 12, 2010, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> of 99999 Microsoft Points (~US$1250). A spokesperson confirmed the download was for media review purposes, {{and that there}} were no plans to distribute the game to the public through Games on Demand. Four days later, hackers managed to access, download, and distribute the game online; Microsoft stated they were investigating the matter. Halo 2, Halo 3, and ODST were similarly leaked ahead of their planned release.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E
5|$|Held <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> of C$829 million, the Calgary Olympics {{cost more}} to stage than any {{previous}} Games, summer or winter. The high cost was anticipated, as organizers were aware {{at the outset of}} their bid that most facilities would have to be constructed. The venues, constructed primarily with public money, were designed to have lasting use beyond the Games and were planned to become the home of several of Canada's national winter sports teams.|$|E
50|$|Laddering also {{describes}} a process where, {{in order to}} purchase shares <b>at</b> <b>a</b> given <b>price,</b> investors must also agree to purchase additional shares <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>price.</b> This artificially inflates {{the price of the}} stock and allows insiders to buy at the lower <b>price,</b> with <b>a</b> guarantee {{that they will be able}} to sell <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>price.</b> This practice has resulted in investigations of national and global banks by the SEC after the stock market collapse.|$|R
50|$|No trader {{will sell}} the {{commodity}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>price</b> than the market maker's bid-level or buy <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>price</b> than the market maker's offer-level.

5|$|In 1993, Lum Chang Holdings {{sold the}} {{building}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> of S$25 million to Yu Kwok Chun, {{who was the}} head of a Hong Kong-based multinational corporation with its flagship department store, Yue Hwa Chinese Products Emporium. The company, set up by Yu's father in 1959, is a global corporation of 35 companies involved in investments, travel and general trading. Yue Hwa's three department stores in Hong Kong are popular with both Hong Kongers and tourists. Besides agricultural produce from various provinces of China, the stores also sell jade carvings, handicrafts, antiques and medical products such as ginseng, antlers and cordyceps.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the company's former test pilot, Lou Leavitt, had {{purchased}} {{the wreckage of}} the XR-1A <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> of 4 cents per pound. Leavitt had formed a new company, Helicopter Air Transport, intending to provide helicopter flight training in anticipation of a postwar aviation boom, and he returned the XR-1A to flying condition. The projected boom failed to materialise, however, and HAT quickly entered bankruptcy, Leavitt selling the XR-1A to Frank Piasecki, another former Platt-LePage employee who had now started his own helicopter company. Piasecki soon grounded the aircraft due to airworthiness concerns, and used the airframe {{in the development of the}} PA-2B, a planned tiltrotor which failed to proceed beyond the mock-up stage.|$|E
5|$|Pricing {{was central}} to the {{marketing}} strategy, {{as it had been}} through Sinclair's career. The ZX81 had been designed to meet a £70 price point and was launched <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> of £69.95 (built) or £49.95 (kit). One Sinclair brochure presented a side-by-side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals – the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS-80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost, from £630 {{in the case of the}} Apple II Plus to just £70 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair's own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine.|$|E

5|$|Rescued by Rover {{is often}} {{considered}} to be the United Kingdom's first major fiction film. Some four hundred prints were sold <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> of £8 each, and they circulated for at least four or five years. The character of Rover the dog, played by Hepworth's family dog Blair, became a household name and is considered the world's first canine film star. This first appearance of a dog in a narrative based film caused the uncommon name of Rover to become popular for dogs.|$|E

Designed to bring down the manufacturing costs of the Sega CD, the newer model is smaller and does not contain the motorized disc tray used in the initial model. A limited number of games were also later developed that utilized both the Sega CD and the 32X add-ons, the latter of which was released in November 1994.|$|E
5|$|The auction was {{organised}} by the Ministry of Colonies, {{which sent}} five officers to Senegal for evaluation.

The Faidherbe Bridge Committee and the technical committee in Paris {{agreed that the}} Société de Construction de Levallois-Perret project was the best for the site.
