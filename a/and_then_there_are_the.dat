500|$|Fox Mulder and Dana Scully's {{fight in}} the episode where Scully gets upset due to Mulder always driving grew out of nitpicking from fans {{about the fact that}} Mulder always seems to be the one driving the car. Mulder's joke about Scully's [...] "little feet" [...] was a joke that Carter had made before at an X-Files {{convention}} in Pasadena, California. Gillian Anderson stated that these have been things that fans on the internet have been nitpicking about {{since the beginning of the}} show. David Duchovny later explained that the comedic episodes of the series were often more ludicrous than the other episodes in the show. He noted, [...] "There's The X-Files of the stand-alone, and then there's The X-Files of the mythology, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> comedic X-Files as well, in which the characters are really not quite the characters that we know." ...|$|E

She added: [...] "Shonda gave me smart notes that enhanced the writing and then the wonderful director Ed Ornelas and the amazing DP Herb Davis and the whole crew that support them made it visually beautiful and then the actors… damn, did they all bring their A game to this scene. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> editors and music folks {{and the people who}} color correct everything and mix the sound… It's a collaboration. What it takes to make good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists. What it takes to make great TV is all that plus a little magic and a little luck. And that’s what I feel like we had with this scene. It's so funny and so bittersweet and so, so sad." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{population}} of Malacca consists of several races. The ubiquitous Chinese {{are perhaps the}} most numerous, keeping up their manners, customs, and language; the indigenous Malays are next in point of numbers, and their language is the Lingua-franca of the place. Next come the descendants of the Portuguese--a mixed, degraded, and degenerate race, but who still keep up the use of their mother tongue, though ruefully mutilated in grammar; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> English rulers, and the descendants of the Dutch, who all speak English. The Portuguese spoken at Malacca is a useful philological phenomenon. The verbs have mostly lost their inflections, and one form does for all moods, tenses, numbers, and persons. Eu vai, serves for [...] "I go," [...] "I went," [...] or, [...] "I will go." [...] Adjectives, too, have been deprived of their feminine and plural terminations, so that the language is reduced to a marvellous simplicity, and, with the admixture of a few Malay words, becomes rather puzzling to one who has heard only the pure Lusitanian.|$|E

To make up for this, indeed, there has been expressed by the piquant newspapers of the day an opinion that ladies are taking up the game which gentlemen no longer care to play. It may be doubted whether either expression has in it much of truth. We do not see ladies drunk, certainly, and we do not see gentlemen tumbling about as they used to do, because their fashion of drinking is not that of their grandfathers. But the love of wine has not gone out from among men; and men now are as prone as ever to indulge their loves. Our black sheep was very fond of wine,--and also of brandy, though he was wolf enough to hide his taste when occasion required it.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yeovil," [...] {{said the}} doctor, [...] "you must {{bear in mind}} two things. First, the {{necessity}} {{for the life of}} the country going on as if nothing had happened. It is true that many thousands of our working men and women have emigrated and thousands of our upper and middle class too; they were the people who were not tied down by business, or who could afford to cut those ties. But those represent comparatively a few out of the many. The great businesses and the small businesses must go on, people must be fed and clothed and housed and medically treated, and their thousand-and-one wants and necessities supplied. Look at me, for instance; however much I loathe coming under a foreign domination and paying taxes to an alien government, I can't abandon my practice and my patients, and set up anew in Toronto or Allahabad, and if I could, some other doctor would have to take my place here. I or that other doctor must have our servants and motors and food and furniture and newspapers, even our sport. The golf links and the hunting field have been well-nigh deserted since the war, but they are beginning to get back their votaries because out-door sport has become a necessity, and a very rational necessity, with numbers of men who have to work otherwise under unnatural and exacting conditions. That is one factor of the situation. The other affects London more especially, but through London it influences the rest of the country to a certain extent. You will see around you here much that will strike you as indications of heartless indifference to the calamity that has befallen our nation. Well, you must remember that many things in modern life, especially in the big cities, are not national but international. In the world of music and art and the drama, for instance, the foreign names are legion, they confront you at every turn, and some of our British devotees of such arts are more acclimatised to the ways of Munich or Moscow than they are familiar with the life, say, of Stirling or York. For years they have lived and thought and spoken in an atmosphere and jargon of denationalised culture--even those of them who have never left our shores. They would take pains to be intimately familiar with the domestic affairs and views of life of some Galician gipsy dramatist, and gravely quote and discuss his opinions on debts and mistresses and cookery, while they would shudder at 'D'ye ken John Peel?' as a piece of uncouth barbarity. You cannot expect a world of that sort to be permanently concerned or downcast because the Crown of Charlemagne takes its place now on the top of the Royal box in the theatres, or at the head of programmes at State concerts. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Jews." ...|$|E
