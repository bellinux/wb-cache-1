Factors such as dose (0. 025 and 0. 1 mg <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> or thiamethoxam/cm(2)), exposure interval (1, 3 and 7 d), and formulation (<b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> SC and thiamethoxam WG) were evaluated. Apart from immediate assessment at end of exposure, an assessment of delayed mortality was performed with the survivors of the 7 -d exposure by removing them from the treated substrate and keeping them on untreated surfaces for 7 more days. After the 7 -d exposure, more T. granarium adults were dead on dishes treated with <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> than with thiamethoxam. Small larvae were generally less susceptible than adults. After 7 d, small larval mortality reached 64. 4 % for <b>alpha-cypermethrin,</b> while for thiamethoxam it was < 6 %. Large T. granarium larvae were more tolerant than the small ones. Delayed mortality of T. granarium adults was generally high for both insecticides and doses, and ranged between 43. 3 and 63. 3 % of those that were still alive immediately after the 7 -d treatment. For both larval categories, delayed mortality was higher for larvae that had been previously exposed to <b>alpha-cypermethrin,</b> than with thiamethoxam. For T. molitor, after the 7 -d exposure, significantly more adults were dead on dishes treated with <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> than with thiamethoxam. For small larvae mortality was 38. 9 % at the lowest thiamethoxam dose, but in the other cases ranged between 88. 9 and 95. 6 %. In the case of large larvae, the overall mortality was low in all tested combinations. Regarding delayed mortality of this species, it remained at low levels, for both adults and small larvae.

No soot was produced during the reaction ruling out the {{de novo synthesis}} of PCDD/F. The results span the effect of temperature (300 - 650 °C) and fuel equivalence ratio (of 0. 01 - 7. 0), at a residence time of 1 s.

The reactor walls appear to have no noticeable effect on the initiation of the gas-phase oxidation reactions. The decomposition of <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> produces two types of PCDD/F precursors, chlorinated benzenes (CBz) /chlorinated phenols (CP) and two-ring species, mainly diphenyl ether and chlorinated diphenyl ethers (CDPE).

40|$|Background: Nowadays {{long-lasting}} insecticidal mosquito nets (LNs) {{are frequently}} used {{around the world}} to protect people against malaria vectors. As they contain insecticide, laboratory control is needed to check whether the content of the active ingredient follows the conditions of the manufacturer and also if the active ingredient is still present after some time of use. For this purpose, an analytical method had to be developed. The fact that LNs include a range of polymers for the yarn and use coated or incorporated technologies for the active ingredient, it is a challenge to find only one analytical method determining the active ingredient in LNs, which takes into account both impregnation technologies. Some methods are provided by international organizations but are limited by the determination of only one pesticide per method. The aim {{of this study was to}} optimize a short time extraction method for deltamethrin and <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> from coated and incorporated mosquito nets and also to detect both insecticides in one analytical run, using gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-mu ECD). Methods: Based on the literature, the most suitable solvent and the adequate extraction process for the insecticides used for net making were identified and adapted for the new multi-residue method. Results: The validation data of the multi-residue method to determine deltamethrin and <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> in mosquito nets by GC-mu ECD are given. Depending on the concentration of the active ingredient spiked on the nets, the mean recovery for <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> ranged between 86 % and 107 % with a relative standard deviation below 3. 5 %. For deltamethrin it ranged between 90 % and 108 % with a relative standard deviation also below 3. 5 %. The limit of detection is 0. 009 g. a. i/kg of net (0. 3 mg a. i. /m(2) of net) both for <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> and deltamethrin. Conclusions: Data obtained are excellent. A 30 minutes reflux extraction method with xylene was developed to determine <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> and deltamethrin in long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets (LNs) by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-mu ECD).

Synergism (SF) comparisons were obtained using lethal concentration (LC 50) and lethal dose (LD 50) ratios of insecticides individually and in their respective synergistic combinations with essential oil and PBO. Dose/concentration-mortality slope curves were used to establish relative toxicity increase promoted by synergism. They also determined homogeneity response. Residual contact revealed significant potentiation for commercial insecticides formulated with beta-cypermethrin (SF= 9. 05 - 0. 5) and fenpropathrin (SF= 34. 05 - 49. 77) when combined with the P. aduncum essential oil.

Mixtures of two insecticides with contrasting mode of action have the potential to kill resistant vectors and restore transmission control provided the formulation can withstand regular washing over the net’s life span. METHOD: The efficacy of a novel mixture LN, Interceptor® G 2, that combines the pyrrole chlorfenapyr and pyrethroid <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> was evaluated under controlled household conditions (experimental hut trial) and by laboratory bioassay against pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae in Benin before and after standardized washing. Comparison arms included standard <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> LN, nets hand-treated with chlorfenapyr-only and untreated nets. RESULTS: The chlorfenapyr-alphacypermethrin LN demonstrated improved efficacy and wash resistance compared to a standard <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> LN against pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes (resistance ratio 207). In experimental hut trial <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> LN killed only 20 % (95 % CI 15 – 26 %) of host-seeking An. gambiae whilst mixture LN killed 71 % (95 % CI 65 – 77 %). Mixture LN washed 20 times killed 65 % (95 % CI 58 – 71 %), and thus intensive washing reduced efficacy by only 6 % (95 % CI 1. 3 – 11 %). The chlorfenapyr net killed 76 % (95 % CI 70 – 81 %). Personal protection and blood feeding inhibition did not differ between mixture and pyrethroid LN; however, the mixture LN was 2. 5 (95 % CI: 2. 1 – 3. 1) times more protective than untreated nets.

40|$|The {{physiological}} {{susceptibility to}} insecticides and the behavioral responses of four wild-caught populations of female Anopheles epiroticus to synthetic pyrethroids (deltamethrin, permethrin, and <b>alpha-cypermethrin)</b> were assessed. Test populations {{were collected from}} different localities along the eastern coast, Trat (TR), Songkhla (SK), and Surat Thani (ST) and one population from the western coast, Phang Nga (PN). Results showed that all four populations of An. epiroticus were susceptible to all three synthetic pyrethroids tested. Behavioral responses to test compounds were characterized for all four populations using an excito-repellency test system. TR displayed the strongest contact excitation ('irritancy') escape response (76. 8 % exposed to deltamethrin, 74. 1 % permethrin, and 78. 4 % <b>alpha-cypermethrin),</b> followed by the PN population (24. 4 % deltamethrin, 35 % permethrin, and 34. 4 % for <b>alpha-cypermethrin)</b> by rapidly escaping test chambers after direct contact with surfaces treated with each active ingredient compared with match-paired untreated controls. Moderate non-contact repellency responses to all three compounds were observed in the TR population but were comparatively weaker than paired contact tests.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In this thesis, we have {{investigated}} the thermal decomposition of the pyrethroid, <b>alpha-cypermethrin,</b> and two cognate molecules of biphenyl and dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD), into toxic products including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/F, dioxins). <b>Alpha-cypermethrin</b> has widespread indoor and outdoor applications while biphenyl is mostly used as a fungicide and termiticide. Based on these results, a mechanism has been developed in which the key reaction steps occurring during pyrolysis and oxidation of <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> are outlined. With the aim of gaining better and more comprehensive understanding {{of the formation of}} PCDD/F and destruction of DD, we examined a range of reaction conditions using a bench type tubular reactor facility, with particular focus on varying oxygen levels, temperatures and residence times. Stable reaction products were identified and quantitated using a range of analytical techniques and equipment, including micro gas chromatograph (µGC), triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QQQMS), ion trap mass spectrometer (ITMS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. For some key reaction steps, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were deployed to help unravel the reaction mechanism. Initially, we studied the pyrolysis of <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> in the temperature range of 300 to 600 °C. We identified five main gaseous species including hydrogen chloride, hydrogen cyanide, methyl cyanide, acetaldehyde and crotonaldehyde. We identified two major pathways, one at low temperatures (two species form only at 450 °C) and the other at higher temperatures (formation of naphthalene and ethylbenzene, possibly by reaction with radicals, expulsion of CO and internal rearrangement, rather than by breaking of ether bridges). The unimolecular rearrangement of <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> was observed at low temperatures, dominating over the alternative pathway which involves the recombination of the initial products. To gain further understanding of this pathway, we performed DFT computations, at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) level of theory, to understand the role of the CN group in O-CH(CN) bond fission in <b>alpha-cypermethrin,</b> in comparison to fission of the same bond in permethrin. There is a significant lowering of the bond energy which is due to considerable stabilisation of the CH(CN) C₆H₅ radical compared with the benzyl radical formed in the permethrin model case. Consequently, the activation energy for O—CHCN fission in cypermethrin is relatively similar to the activation energy for internal rearrangement and aromatisation. Hence, bond fission in <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> should predominate at a much lower temperature than in permethrin itself, exactly as observed in the present experiments. The oxidative pyrolysis of <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> generates substantially more PCDF than PCDD under all experimental conditions (temperatures, residence times and equivalence ratio), with the maximum emission factor of PCDD/F being observed at 550 °C, a residence time of 5 s and an equivalence ratio of 0. 03. As indicated by the homologue distribution of PCDD/F, all the chlorinated congeners were detected with the exception of octachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and octachlorinated furans (OCDD/F) in our measurements. The VOC analysis revealed the production of benzene, phenol, chlorotoluenes, trichlorophenols, tetrachlorophenols. The formation of PCDD/F from the gas-phase oxidation of <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> may proceed through the coupling of chlorophenoxy radicals to benzene or chlorinated benzenes, and the self-condensation of chlorophenoxy radicals. This study combines the results of experimental measurements and theoretical computations to investigate the initial steps in the oxidation of dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD). The analyses of VOC, performed on a high resolution gas chromatograph-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (HRGC-QQQMS), identified 2 -methylbenzofuran and 2, 3 -dihydro- 2 -methylenebenzofuran as the initial products. This has been confirmed by injection of authentic standards and the application of collision induced dissociation that fragmented the isolated parent ions into specific product ions affording the identification of parent species. The oxidative decomposition of DD initiated at around 450 °C, with the evolution of VOC being maximum between 650 and 700 °C. At temperatures in excess of 750 °C, all VOCs were completely oxidised. The potential energy surface, based on the density functional theory of B 3 LYP, mapped the initial steps involved in the oxidation of DD, and yielded a detailed reaction scheme for the onset of oxidation of DD that results in the formation of 2 -methylbenzofuran and 2, 3 -dihydro- 2 -methylenebenzofuran. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of the oxidation of biphenyl at low temperatures. Although it has been known for several years that combustion of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in accidental fires of electrical equipment and in municipal waste can lead to significant emissions of dioxins, understanding of the mechanism of the oxidation process is quite limited. Oxidation of biphenyl (as a prototype model compound for PCB) in an alumina reactor at 490 ºC yields the initial products dibenzofuran and benzaldehyde which have been confirmed in GC/MS studies. It is postulated that O₂ (¹Δg) whose formation is catalysed by the reactor surfaces, initiates the reaction at this relatively low temperature. Quantum chemical computations of the reaction potential energy surfaces suggest low energy pathways to the observed initial products...|$|E

Its control in Greece {{has been based on}} organophosphates (OPs), but their intense use has {{led to the development of}} resistance. A test previously developed to monitor the trait may not be as robust as originally thought. The pyrethroid <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> has recently been registered for bait sprays, as an alternative to OPs. RESULTS: The susceptibility of 20 B. oleae populations to <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> was examined. Variation was observed in their response, with LD 50 ranging from 0. 14 to 3. 28 ng insect(- 1) and resistance factors from 2. 3 to 54. 7. Resistance mechanisms were investigated. Cytochrome P 450 monoxygenase activities showed an association with resistance. Sequences in the domain IIS 4 -IIS 6 of the B. oleae para-type sodium channel were also analysed, but no resistance-associated mutations were identified. Finally, a novel diagnostic assay able to reliably monitor the frequency of the iAChE G 488 S resistance mutation was developed. CONCLUSION: This is the first attempt to evaluate the efficacy of <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> against B. oleae from Greece. Data showed that it can be used effectively, but also highlighted the importance of continuous monitoring. The IIS 4 -IIS 6 sodium channel region is the default area in which to look for resistance mutations if target-site resistance to pyrethroids arises.

One of the main tick control measures is the use of acaricides, which have been indiscriminately used worldwide and in Ecuador. In this country, no studies on acaricide resistance in Rhipicephalus microplus have been published. The current study aims to characterise the level of resistance of R. microplus against three main acaricides commonly used in Ecuador i. e. amitraz, <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> and ivermectin to determine the level and pattern of dose-responses for R. microplus in 12 field populations (farms). The level of acaricide resistance was evaluated using three different bioassays: adult immersion test (AIT), larval package test (LPT) and larval immersion test (LIT), as recommended by the FAO. The predictive dose-responses were analysed by binomial logistics regression of the larval survival rate (resistance). In general, we found resistance of 67 % for amitraz; 50 % for <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> and from 25 to 42 % for ivermectin in the twelve field populations analysed. Resistance levels were studied in larval and adult bioassays, respectively, which were slightly modified for this study. For larval bioassays based on corrected mortality i. e. high (above 51 %), medium (21 - 50 %) and low (11 - 20 %) resistance, percentages less than 10 % were considered as susceptible. For the adult test, two resistance levels were used i. e. high (more than 76 %) and medium (51 to 75 %) resistance. Percentages lower than 50 % were considered as susceptible. In this context, for larval bioassays, amitraz showed 21 %, 38 % and 8 % for high, medium and low resistance, respectively. <b>Alpha-cypermethrin</b> presented 8 %, 4 and 38 % for high, medium and low resistance, respectively. Ivermectin presented 8 %, 25 % and 8 % for high, medium and low resistance, respectively. For adult tests with amitraz 50 % and 17 % of the field populations showed average and high resistance, with evidences of average resistance to <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> in 50 % of the samples and average resistance against ivermectin in 25 % of the farms. No statistical difference amongst the three bioassays was found and acaricide resistance was confirmed by logistic regression analysis; hence resistance (dose-responses) in each field populations differed, depending on the choice of the acaricide, frequent usage, frequency of treatment and farm management. The effective estimated dose needed to eliminate 99 % of ticks is higher than dose recommended by the manufacturer. In conclusion, amitraz showed the highest resistance followed by ivermectin and <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> and reveals differences on resistance in each individual field population. This information is important in order to establish the monitoring of resistance on each farm individually, contributing to the rational use of acaricides included in an integrated control program for R. microplus...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} knockdown {{caused by}} four insecticides: <b>alpha-cypermethrin,</b> chlorfenapyr, pirimiphos-methyl and fipronil against adults of Tribolium confusum Jacquelin Duval, the confused flour beetle and Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), the sawtoothed grain beetle. Bioassays {{were conducted on}} concrete and metal surfaces. Adults of the tested species were exposed on both surfaces treated with the above insecticides at two doses (low and high). Knockdown assessment was done after 15, 30 and 60 min of adult exposure in the treated surfaces. Also, after 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 d of exposure, a lethality index was calculated with an equation resulting to values from 0 to 100, where 100 indicated complete mortality and 0 complete survival. We also developed a lethality index by ranking each adult on each surface from 0 to 4, 0 : adults moved normally, 1 : adults were knocked down, but were able to walk for short intervals, 2 : adults were knocked down and unable to walk, but with visible movement of antennae etc., 3 : adults were knocked down, with very minimal movement of the tarsi and the antennae and 4 : adults were dead (no movement). Knockdown of adults immediately after exposure (15 - 60 min) was higher for pirimiphos-methyl followed by <b>alpha-cypermethrin,</b> for both dose rates tested and species, but only on the metal surface. The lethality index was nearly 100 for all insecticides after 5 d of exposure for O. surinamensis, while for T. confusum the adult lethality index was considerably lower for <b>alpha-cypermethrin,</b> suggesting that that recovery from knockdown occurred. Chlorfenapyr was the only insecticide that was more effective on concrete than on metal, while the reverse was noted for the other three insecticides. These results show that knockdown has different levels, {{which can be used}} as indicators of insect mortality or recovery...|$|E
40|$|Background: From 2006 to 2011, {{biological}} activity of insecticides for Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), conventional treatment of nets (CTNs) or long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) was evaluated before their approval in Cameroon. The {{objective of the}} study was to select the best tools for universal malaria vector control coverage. Methodology: Bioassays were performed using WHO cones and the Kisumu susceptible strain of Anopheles gambiae s. s [...] Among tested products, residual activity and wash resistance of <b>Alpha-cypermethrin</b> LLINs (Interceptor) and CTNs (Fendona) were assessed during 5 months in the Ntougou neighborhood. Principal Findings: All the 14 tested products were found effective (95 – 100 % knockdown and mortality rates), although a significant decrease of efficacy was seen with lambda-cyhalothrinWP IRS, <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> CTNs and LLINs (p, 0. 05). However, the efficacy of Interceptor nets did not decrease during the 5 months evaluation, even after 25 washes (0. 07,p, 0. 9).

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of seven pyrethroid insecticides for impregnation of mosquito nets, six currently recommended by WHO and one candidate (bifenthrin), under laboratory conditions. Methods: Tests were conducted using pyrethroid-susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus. Knock-down effect, irritancy and mortality were measured using standard WHO cone tests. Mortality and blood-feeding inhibition were also measured using a baited tunnel device. Findings: For susceptible A. gambiae, <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> had the fastest knock-down effect. For resistant A. gambiae, the knock- down effect was slightly slower with <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> and much reduced following exposure to the other insecticides, particularly bifenthrin and permethrin. For susceptible C. quinquefasciatus, the knock-down effect was significantly slower than in A. gambiae, particularly with bifenthrin, and no knock-down effect was observed {{with any of the}} pyrethroids against the resistant strain. Bifenthrin was significantly less irritant than the other pyrethroids to susceptible and resistant A. gambiae but there was no clear ranking of pyrethroid irritancy against C. quinquefasciatus. In tunnels, all insecticides were less toxic against C. quinquefasciatus than against A. gambiae for susceptible strains. For resistant strains, mortality was significant with all the pyrethroids with A. gambiae but not with C. quinquefasciatus. Inhibition of blood-feeding was also high for susceptible strains of both species and for resistant A. gambiae but lower for resistant C. quinquefasciatus; bifenthrin had the greatest impact. Conclusions: Efficacy for impregnation of mosquito nets against A. gambiae was greatest with <b>alpha-cypermethrin.</b> Bifenthrin is likely to have a significant comparative advantage over other pyrethroids in areas with pyrethroid resistance because of its much stronger impact on the nuisance mosquito, C. quinquefasciatus, despite its slower knock-down effect and irritancy. Selection of pyrethroids for mosquito vector control and personal protection should take into account the different effects of these insecticides, the status of pyrethroid resistance in the target area, and the importance of nuisance mosquitoes, such as C. quinquefasciatus...|$|E
40|$|Indoor {{spraying}} {{of walls}} and ceilings with residual insecticide remains a primary method of malaria control. Insecticide resistance in malaria vectors {{is a growing}} problem. Novel insecticides for indoor residual spraying (IRS) which can improve the control of pyrethroid resistant malaria vectors are urgently needed. Insecticide mixtures {{have the potential to}} improve efficacy or even to manage resistance in some situations but this possibility remains underexplored experimentally. Chlorfenapyr is a novel pyrrole insecticide which has shown potential to improve the control of mosquitoes which are resistant to current WHO-approved insecticides. The efficacy of IRS with chlorfenapyr applied alone or as a mixture with alpha-cypermeththrin (a pyrethroid) was evaluated in experimental huts in Cove, Southern Benin against wild free flying pyrethroid resistant Anopheles gambiae sl. Comparison was made with IRS with <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> alone. Fortnightly 30 -minute in situ cone bioassays were performed to assess the residual efficacy of the insecticides on the treated hut walls. Survival rates of wild An gambiae from the Cove hut site in WHO resistance bioassays performed during the trial were > 90 % with permethrin and deltamethrin treated papers. Mortality of free-flying mosquitoes entering the experimental huts was 4 % in the control hut. Mortality with <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> IRS did not differ from the control (5 %, P> 0. 656). The highest mortality was achieved with chlorfenapyr alone (63 %). The <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> + chlorfenapyr mixture killed fewer mosquitoes than chlorfenapyr alone (43 % vs. 63 %, P< 0. 001). While the cone bioassays showed a more rapid decline in residual mortality with chlorfenapyr IRS to < 30 % after only 2 weeks, fortnightly mortality rates of wild free-flying An gambiae entering the chlorfenapyr IRS huts were consistently high (50 - 70 %) and prolonged, lasting over 4 months. IRS with chlorfenapyr shows potential to significantly improve the control of malaria transmission in pyrethroid resistant areas compared to pyrethroid IRS or the mixture. Thirty minute in situ cone bioassays are not predictive of the performance of chlorfenapyr IRS under field conditions...|$|E

Bednets were impregnated with the above mentioned compounds and randomly allocated to the huts. On the 40 consecutive mornings, after sleepers had occupied the huts overnight, mosquitoes were collected from the huts, identified and scored as live or dead (including delayed mortality). #An. gambiae$ s. l. that had been collected were tested for the presence of the kdr allele in heterozygous or homozygous form. Both non-pyrethroid treatments caused very high mortality, whereas mortality with <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> and etofenprox generally did not differ from the levels observed with untreated control nets in this experiment. The nets had holes cut in them and there was considerable bloodfeeding on the sleepers, which was only significantly reduced for #An. gambiae$ by carbosulfan and <b>alpha-cypermethrin.</b> PCR genotyping suggested that there was selection for the kdr resistance allele by the pyrethroid treated nets. Organophosphates and carbamates may therefore present an alternative to be used on bednets especially in areas of pyrethroid resistance, but the safety of these insecticides will have to be carefully considered.

40|$|Abstract Background By 2008, the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) {{recommended}} five long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) for {{the prevention}} of malaria: Olyset ®, PermaNet 2. 0 ®, Netprotect ®, Duranet ® and Interceptor ®. Field information is available for both Olyset ® and PermaNet ®, with limited data on the newer LLINs. To address this gap, a field evaluation was carried out to determine the acceptability and durability of Interceptor ® LLINs. Methods A one-year prospective field study was conducted in eight rural returnee villages in Liberia. Households were randomized to receive Interceptor ® LLINs or conventionally treated nets (CTNs). Primary outcomes were levels of residual <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> measured by HPLC and participant utilization/acceptability of the ITNs. Results A total of 398 nets were analysed for residual <b>alpha-cypermethrin.</b> The median baseline concentrations of insecticide were 175. 5 mg/m 2 for the Interceptor ® LLIN and 21. 8 mg/m 2 for the CTN. Chemical residue loss after a one year follow-up period was 22 % and 93 % respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) are now {{standard}} {{for the prevention of}} malaria. However, only products with recommendation for public use from the World Health Organization should be used and this evaluation includes the assessment of net effectiveness after three years of field use. Results for one of the polyester-based products, Interceptor ® is presented. Methods In five villages, 190 LLIN and 90 nets conventionally treated with the insecticide <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> at 25 mg/m 2 were distributed randomly and used by the families. Following a baseline household survey a net survey was carried out every six months to capture use, washing habits and physical condition of the nets. Randomly selected nets were collected after 6, 12, 24, 36 and 42 months and tested for remaining insecticide content and ability to knock-down and kill malaria transmitting mosquitoes. Results During the {{three and a half years}} of observation only 16 nets were lost to follow-up resulting in an estimated attrition rate of 12 % after three and 20 /% after 3. 5 years. Nets were used regularly and washed on average 1. 5 times per year. After three and a half years 29 % of the nets were still in good condition while 13 % were seriously torn with no difference between the LLIN and control nets. The conventionally treated nets quickly lost insecticide and after 24 months only 7 % of the original dose remained (1. 6 mg/m 2). Baseline median concentration of <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> for LLIN was 194. 5 mg/m 2 or 97 % of the target dose with between and within net variation of 11 % and 4 % respectively (relative standard deviation). On the LLIN 73. 8 mg/m 2 <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> remained after three years of use and 56. 2 mg/m 2 after three and a half and 94 % and 81 % of the LLIN still had > 15 mg/m 2 left respectively. Optimal effectiveness in bio-assays (≥ 95 % 60 minute knock-down or ≥ 80 % 24 hour mortality) was found in 83 % of the sampled LLIN after three and 71 % after three and a half years. Conclusions Under conditions in Western Uganda the tested long-lasting insecticidal net Interceptor ® fulfilled the criteria for phase III of WHO evaluations and, based on preliminary criteria of the useful life, this product is estimated to last on average between three and four years. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Given the {{increase}} in cases of visceral leishmaniasis in recent years, associated with the socio-economic impact of this disease, {{as well as the}} wide distribution of Lutzomyia longipalpis in Brazil and the likelihood that this vector may develop resistance to insecticides used for control, the Ministry of Health considers as crucial the creation of a network in order to study and monitor the resistance of this vector to insecticides used for control. In this sense, this study aimed: 1) to characterize the susceptibility of L. longipalpis from Lapinha Cave (Lagoa Santa, MG- Brazil) to Alfateck SC 200 in field bioassays, and 2) to define the susceptibility baseline to <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> in laboratory bioassays, checking the possibility of using it as susceptibility reference lineage (SRL). Findings: The field bioassays revealed that the tested population was highly susceptible to <b>alpha-cypermethrin</b> in all time periods with high mortality (~ 100 %) in all treated surfaces before six months after spraying. In the laboratory bioassays, the studied population presented LD 50, LD 95 and LD 99 to 0. 78013, 10. 5580 and 31. 067 mg/m 2, respectively. The slope was 1. 454121. Conclusions: The studied population of L. longipalpis was considered as adequate for SRL according criterion recommended by Pan-American Health Organization and has proven susceptibility to tested insecticide in the field.
