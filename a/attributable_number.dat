40|$|Objectives of {{the present}} study are to provide {{quantitative}} estimations of air pollution health impacts and monetary burden on people living in Agra city, the fourth most populated city in Uttar Pradesh, India. To estimate the direct health impacts of air pollution in Agra city during year 2002 to 2014, 'Risk of Mortality/Morbidity due to Air Pollution' model was used which is adopted from air quality health impact assessment software, developed by world health organization (WHO). Concentrations of NO 2, SO 2 and PM 10 have been used to assess human health impacts in terms of attributable proportion of the health outcome as- annual number of excess cases of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, hospital admission chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hospital admission respiratory disease and hospital admission cardiovascular disease and it was observed that <b>attributable</b> <b>number</b> of cases were 1325, 908, 155, 138, 1230 and 348 respectively in year 2002. However, after thirteen years these figures increased to 1607, 1095, 189, 167, 1568 and 394 respectively. From these results, it was observed that from 2002 to 2014, the <b>attributable</b> <b>number</b> of cases increased almost by 13. 43 to 27. 52 %. As a result, the monetary cost burden due to air pollution related health effects also increased very highly; it was 67. 99 million US$ in 2002, which transformed into 254. 52 million US$ in 2014. In future, if air quality continues to follow current pollutant concentration trend, the monetary cost burden will reach a level of US$ 570. 12 million in year 2020, which is not only a thoughtful matter but also a threatful matter and it signifies the importance of rectification measures for air quality in Agra city...|$|E
40|$|In many {{calculations}} of attributable risk (AR), {{there are a}} number of parameters (excess risks, exposure rates, and so on) that are not known accurately, and one should take into account the variability in these parameters in determining a range of "plausible values" of the <b>attributable</b> <b>number</b> (AN) of incidences due to the exposure. This is often done through simple tabulation of extreme combinations of the factors, but this can give a spurious picture of the real dimensions of the attributable risk.

40|$|Particulate air {{pollution}} {{is becoming a}} serious public health concern in urban cities in India due to {{air pollution}}related health effects associated with disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and economic loss. To obtain the quantitative result of health impact of particulate matter (PM) in most populated Mumbai City and most polluted Delhi City in India, an epidemiology-based exposure-response function {{has been used to}} calculate the <b>attributable</b> <b>number</b> of mortality and morbidity cases from 1991 to 2015 in a 5 -year interval and the subsequent DALYs, and economic cost is estimated of the health damage based on unit values of the health outcomes. Here, we report the <b>attributable</b> <b>number</b> of mortality due to PM 10 in Mumbai and Delhi increased to 32, 014 and 48, 651 in 2015 compared with 19, 291 and 19, 716 in year 1995. And annual average mortality due to PM 2. 5 in Mumbai and Delhi was 10, 880 and 10, 900. Premature cerebrovascular disease (CEV), ischemic heart disease (IHD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) causes are about 35. 3, 33. 3, and 22. 9 % of PM 2. 5 -attributable mortalities. Total DALYs due to PM 10 increased from 0. 34 million to 0. 51 million in Mumbai and 0. 34 million to 0. 75 million in Delhi from average year 1995 to 2015. Among all health outcomes, mortality and chronic bronchitis shared about 95 % of the total DALYs. Due to PM 10, the estimated total economic cost at constant price year 2005 US$ increased from 2680. 87 million to 4269. 60 million for Mumbai City and 2714. 10 million to 6394. 74 million for Delhi City, from 1995 to 2015, and the total amount accounting about 1. 01 % of India's gross domestic product (GDP). A crucial presumption is that in 2030, PM 10 levels would have to decline by 44 % (Mumbai) and 67 % (Delhi) absolutely to maintain the same health outcomes in year 2015 levels. The results will help policy makers from pollution control board for further costbenefit analyses of air pollution management programs in Mumbai and Delhi...|$|E

40|$|Exposure to air pollution, {{especially}} from particulate matter, is generally ac-cepted {{to be one}} of the most important public health problems in Europe and worldwide. The effects caused in the general population are associated with relatively small relative risks, but if the ubiquity of exposure is considered, the <b>attributable</b> <b>number</b> of events is large. Furthermore, there is evidence that the effects in sensitive population subgroups (such as the elderly, those with chro-nic diseases and children) are stronger. Within large European Union funded collaborative projects (such as the Air Pollution and Health: a European Ap-proach- APHEA), effect modification by geographical characteristics has been investigated and it was found that in warmer countries, in locations where par-ticles come from traffic and where the proportion of the elderly is greater, par-ticle toxicity is increased. These characteristics are particularly relevant to Southern European locations. From other projects we know that meteorolo-gical, climatic, environmental and socioeconomic factors are effect modifiers of the effects of specific air pollutants. In this presentation we will show the evi-dence on the short-term health effects of particulate and gaseous air pollutants and emphasize particularly results concerning southern Europe and potential effect modifiers. The gaps in knowledge and the need to study air pollution in Southern European countries more extensively will be demonstrated.

40|$|Summary of main {{findings}} for Innsbruck In 2002 the PM 10 annual mean (SD) was 30 (25) µg/m 3, above the 1999 / 30 /EC Directive limit value for 2010 (20 µg/m 3), and below that established for 2005 (40 µg/m 3). For the summer {{period of the}} same year, the mean (SD), P 5 (5 th percentile) and P 95 of the maximum daily 8 -hour moving average concentration of ozone (O 3) were 90 (26), 37 and 128 µg/m 3. Regarding children, infant mortality in Europe is quite low and consequently, the expected <b>attributable</b> <b>number</b> of deaths related to air pollution is also very low.

40|$|AIMS: To {{explore the}} impact of {{occupational}} exposure to whole body vibration (WBV) on low back pain (LBP) {{in the general population}} and to estimate the burden of LBP attributable to occupational WBV in comparison with that due to occupational lifting. METHODS: A questionnaire including sections on WBV at work, LBP, and potential risk factors was mailed to a community sample of 22 194 men and women of working age. Sources and durations of exposure to occupational WBV were ascertained for the past week and personal vibration doses (eVDV) were estimated. Analysis was confined to subjects reporting exposures in the past week as typical of their work. Associations of LBP with eVDV, driving industrial vehicles, and occupational lifting were explored by logistic regression and <b>attributable</b> <b>numbers</b> were calculated. RESULTS: Significant associations were found between daily lifting of weights greater than 10 kg at work and LBP, troublesome LBP (which made it difficult to put on hosiery), and sciatica (prevalence ratios 1. 3 to 1. 7); but the risk of these outcomes in both sexes varied little by eVDV and only weak associations were found with riding on industrial vehicles. Assuming causal associations, the numbers of cases of LBP in Britain attributable to occupational WBV were estimated to be 444 000 in men and 95 000 in women. This compared with an estimated 940 000 male cases and 370 000 female cases of LBP from occupational lifting.

40|$|Almost half of {{the child}} {{population}} is involuntarily exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). The problem starts before conception since active smoking reduces the sperm count and fertility. The fetus is affected if the pregnant woman is passively exposed to tobacco smoke but even more so if she herself smokes cigarettes. The infant and toddler cannot actively prevent his or her exposure and even school-age children are usually powerless against smoking adults. In adolescence active smoking is often perceived {{as a sort of}} initiation rite. Discos and other meeting places of youngsters range highest in nicotine concentrations. Numerous health effects of all these various exposures are well established. This paper sets out to summarize existing exposure data (focusing mainly on European studies) and established exposure-effect estimates. This allows to calculate attributable risks for low birth weight, respiratory illness, middle ear diseases and mortality. Per 1000 live births in Europe there are to be expected approximately 5 births with low birth weight at term, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm delivery due to smoking in pregnancy each. The <b>attributable</b> <b>number</b> of cases of stillbirth and sudden infants’ death syndrome are about one magnitude lower. Odds Ratios of children's diseases associated with passive smoking (ETS exposure) by their mothers are substantially lower. But since the number of exposed pregnancies are higher the number of attributable cases is in the same order of magnitude as for active smoking in pregnancy. Postnatal exposure of children to parental smoking causes approximately 10 % of respiratory and middle ear diseases...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Statistics from Labour Force Surveys {{are widely}} quoted as {{evidence}} for the scale of occupational illness in Europe. However, occupational attribution depends on whether participants believe their health problem is caused or aggravated by work, and personal beliefs may be unreliable. The authors assessed the potential for error for work-associated arm pain. METHODS: A questionnaire was emailed to working-aged adults, randomly chosen from five British general practices. They were asked about: occupational activities; mental health; self-rated health; arm pain; and beliefs about its causation. Those in work (n = 1769) were asked about activities likely to cause arm pain, from which the authors derived a variable for exposure to any "arm-straining" occupational activity. The authors estimated the relative risk (RR) from arm-straining activity, using a modified Cox model, and derived the population attributable fraction (PAF). They compared the proportion of arm pain cases reporting their symptom as caused or made worse by work with the calculated PAF, overall and for subsets defined by demographic and other characteristics. RESULTS: Arm pain {{in the past year}} was more common in the 1143 subjects who reported exposure to arm-straining occupational activity (RR 1. 2, 95 % CI 1. 1 to 1. 5). In the study sample as a whole, 53. 9 % of 817 cases reported their arm pain as work-associated, whereas the PAF for arm-straining occupational activity was only 13. 9 %. The ratio of cases reported as work-related to the calculated <b>attributable</b> <b>number</b> was substantially higher below 50 years (5. 4) than at older ages (3. 0) and higher in those with worse self-rated and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Counting people with arm pain which they believe to be work-related can overestimate the number of cases attributable to work substantially. This casts doubt on the validity of a major source of information used by European governments to evaluate their occupational health strategies...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Within the {{framework}} of the APHEA 2 (Air Pollution on Health: a European Approach) project, the effects of ambient particles on mortality among persons o 65 yrs were investigated. Daily measurements for particles with a 50 % cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 mm (PM 10) and black smoke (BS), as well as the daily number of deaths among persons o 65 yrs of age, from 29 European cities, have been collected. Data on other pollutants and meteorological variables, to adjust for confounding effects and data on city characteristics, to investigate potential effect modification, were also recorded. For individual city analysis, generalised additive models extending Poisson regression, using a locally weighted regression (LOESS) smoother to control for seasonal effects, were applied. To combine individual city results and explore effect modification, second stage regression models were applied. The per cent increase (95 % confidence intervals), associated with a 10 mg?m- 3 increase in PM 10, in the elderly daily number of deaths was 0. 8 % (0. 7 – 0. 9 %) and the corresponding number for BS was 0. 6 % (0. 5 – 0. 8 %). The effect size was modified by the long-term average levels of nitrogen dioxide (higher levels were associated with larger effects), temperature (larger effects were observed in warmer countries), and by the proportion of the elderly in each city (a larger proportion was associated with higher effects). These results indicate that ambient particles have effects on mortality among the elderly, with relative risks comparable or slightly higher than those observed for total mortality and similar effect modification patterns. The effects among the older persons are of particular importance, since the <b>attributable</b> <b>number</b> of events will be much larger, compared to the number of deaths among the younger population...|$|E

Given such importance, systematic methods to assess the variability of the <b>attributable</b> <b>number</b> of deaths (AND), including the standard errors and confidence intervals, need to be developed. In this article, we develop two statistical methods of the estimation of the standard errors and confidence intervals for the ANDs, one using multinomial distribution and the other using bootstrap sampling, and study the effect {{of the size of the}} mortality through simulations. Both methods are easy to implement and provide valid and efficient estimation of the standard errors and confidence intervals. While AND estimates and their standard errors increase with the size of the mortality, the ratio of the standard error to the AND estimate decreases. We demonstrate the methods with two data sets, the US national mortality data during the year 2006 and the mortality data of Chaoyang district of Beijing, China during the year 2007. We conclude that assessment of the variability is needed for small size mortality as the uncertainty is relatively large, but not for large size mortality.

40|$|Adverse {{health effects}} of human {{exposure}} to particulate matter (PM) in indoor environments and the associated costs have been of interest in recent studies conducted outside Canada. It was, therefore, necessary to investigate these effects in a Canadian environment. This study investigated the effects of building construction and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems on the indoor concentration of airborne PM of outdoor origin and the related health impacts and cost savings in Ontario. Due {{to the complexity of}} the investigation, the study has been limited to the metropolitan areas of Toronto and Hamilton which represent much of the population of Ontario and a significant portion of all Canada. The main objective of the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was to analyze and evaluate the effects of pollution in monetary equivalents. The modeling integrated the various models using the Impact Pathway Approach. The approach consisted of four steps: First, identify the sources and emissions of PM. Although the study focused on indoor environments, outdoor sources such as incomplete combustion from rush hour traffic were identified for the geographical areas of the study. Secondly, evaluate the dispersion or the concentration of PM on the site of interest. In order to achieve this goal, building modeling was first established that was applicable to Ontario. There were three homes and two commercial building scenarios: Existing homes (resExist), new homes constructed under minimum building code requirements (resBC), and under R 2000 standard (resR 2000); commercial buildings with 40 % (school 40) and 85 % (school 85) ASHRAE air filters. Air flow rates were calculated from building and HVAC sizing calculations. These flow rates were used to calculate input parameters for well-established mass balanced indoor PM concentration models. In addition, indoor exposure needed to account for time activity in each micro-environment in Ontario. This was accomplished by using time-weighted exposure modeling. Thirdly and lastly in the Impact Pathway Approach, evaluate the health impact and its monetary equivalent, respectively. In order to evaluate the health effects and monetary equivalents, the study considered fourteen retrofit cases which consisted of improving factors such as building construction, distribution system, and air filtration efficiency. Because input parameters were selected from data applicable to Ontario, the study provided a model setup that could be applied to future work in Canada. The study demonstrated that Canadian building construction provided significant protection from time-weighted PM exposure (Toronto, ambient vs. resExist/school 40 win, PM 2. 5 10. 00 vs. 4. 20 μg/m 3). For this scenario, the prevented <b>attributable</b> <b>number</b> of cases (ANCs) was 721 for Toronto related to equivalent PM 10. Cost savings due to building envelope protection of mortality alone much outweighed costs in investment scenario for new home construction (Toronto, $ 1, 671 million vs. $ 21. 6 million). Therefore, recommendations were made to invest in home construction. Similarly, the morbidity effects were very significant, especially for chronic bronchitis endpoints which were along the same magnitude as mortality for most of the cases. Similar results were obtained for Hamilton in proportion to their relative population at risk. In addition, Canadian building construction and HVAC systems showed larger time-weighted PM exposure in the summer compared to the winter conditions due to the various HVAC operating conditions such as air flow rates (Toronto, resExist/school 40 sum, PM 2. 5 5. 18 μg/m 3; resExist/school 40 win, PM 2. 5 4. 20 μg/m 3). Furthermore, cost savings from retrofits from existing home to forced air with air filtration were very significant. It was demonstrated that the cost savings related to reduction of equivalent PM 10 exposure due to mortality alone much outweighed costs in retrofit investment scenarios (R 2000, Toronto, $ 574 million vs. $ 4. 96 million). Therefore, the government would be wise to promote more energy efficient homes by offering more incentive programs. Factors such as wall insulation, air flow rate changes of less than 600 cfm, and HRV installation type did not played a major role. In addition, the effect of air filtration was more intense in homes compared to commercial buildings. Similarly, the impact of simultaneously retrofitting both, homes and commercial buildings, where children and adults spent most of the daily activities produced the greatest reduction of outdoor PM exposure. Installing high efficient air filtration in both homes and commercial buildings resulted in optimal reduced effects. The cost savings from the retrofit due to mortality alone much outweighed the investment scenario costs justifying the retrofit (Toronto, $ 470 million vs. $ 1. 8 million). This demonstrated that PM concentration exposure reduction is a collective effort that needed to be regulated not only in ambient air level but in the work environment and in homes as well. It was identified that results were limited to model assumptions and input parameter data used. Since some of the parameters used, such as ambient PM concentrations, were average values, the results may not represent the exact actual conditions. Nevertheless, they provided a starting point since they were tailored to Ontario. Therefore, this study provided model simulation data that related to the Canadian environment having many factors in common such as weather, building construction, building systems, and government regulations. Therefore, the results are part of useful data for policy decisions as well {{as a starting point for}} future related work...|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} self reported hearing difficulties and tinnitus in working aged people from the general population, and to estimate the risks from occupational exposure to noise and the <b>number</b> of <b>attributable</b> cases nationally. Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to 22 194 adults of working age selected at random from the age–sex registers of 34 British general practices (21 201 subjects) and from the central pay records of the British armed services (993 subjects). Information was collected on years of employment in a noisy job; and whether the respondent wore a hearing aid, had difficulty in hearing conversation, or had experienced persistent tinnitus over the past year. Associations of hearing difficulty and tinnitus with noise exposure were examined by logistic regression, with adjustment for age, sex, smoking habits, and frequent complaints of headaches, tiredness, or stress. The findings were expressed as prevalence ratios (PRs) with associated 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). <b>Attributable</b> <b>numbers</b> were calculated from the relevant PRs and {{an estimate of the}} prevalence of occupational exposure to noise nationally. Results: Some 2 % of subjects reported severe hearing difficulties (wearing a hearing aid or having great difficulty in both ears in hearing conversation in a quiet room). In men, the prevalence of this outcome rose steeply with age, from below 1 % in those aged 16 – 24 years to 8 % in those aged 55 – 64. The pattern was similar in women, but severe hearing loss was only about half as prevalent in the oldest age band. Tinnitus was far more common in subjects with hearing difficulties. In both sexes, after adjustment for age, the risk of severe hearing difficulty and persistent tinnitus rose with years spent in a noisy job. In men older than 35 years with 10 or more years of exposure, the PR for severe hearing difficulty was 3. 8 (95 % CI 2. 4 to 6. 2) and that for persistent tinnitus 2. 6 (95 % CI 2. 0 to 3. 4) in comparison with those who had never had a noisy job. Nationally, some 153 000 men and 26 000 women aged 35 – 64 years were estimated to have severe hearing difficulties attributable to noise at work. For persistent tinnitus the corresponding numbers were 266 000 and 84 000. Conclusions: Significant hearing difficulties and tinnitus are quite common in men from the older working age range. Both are strongly associated with years spent in a noisy occupation—a predominantly male exposure. The national burden of hearing difficulties attributable to noise at work is substantial. <br/...|$|R

We published several papers covering each of the main topics within the scope of the journal from cell-free DNA, circulating tumour cells and extracellular vesicles to circulating proteins. In addition, we opened a new technology forum presenting the latest technology and published its first article entitled, “Analytical Validation and Capabilities of the Epic CTC Platform: Enrichment-Free Circulating Tumour Cell Detection and Characterization” by Shannon Werner and her colleagues...|$|R
40|$|Childhood obesity {{can also}} lead to {{life-threatening}} conditions including Type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep problems, cancer, and other disorders. Overweight prevalence is higher in boys (32. 7 percent) than girls (27. 8 percent). In adolescents, overweight prevalence is about the same for females (30. 2 percent) and males (30. 5 percent). Global rise in obesity is <b>attributable</b> to a <b>number</b> of factors. Being a lifestyle disease, and how they may be responsible for obesity. The prevention and treatment of excess weight is critical for the health of both individuals and our society. Multilevel interventions are needed if we are to stem the pandemic and prevent the growing negative consequences of overweight and obesity in our youth...|$|R
40|$|This work {{performs}} {{an extensive}} charterisation of precision targeted throwing in professional and recreational darts. The {{goal is to}} identify the contributing factors for lateral drift or throwing inaccuracy in the horizontal plane. A multitechnology approach is adopted whereby a custom built body area network of wireless inertial measurement devices monitor tilt, force and timing, an optical 3 D motion capture system provides a complete kinematic model of the subject, electromyography sensors monitor muscle activation patterns and a force plate and pressure mat capture tactile pressure and force measurements. The study introduces the concept of constant throwing rhythm and highlights how landing errors in the horizontal plane can be <b>attributable</b> to a <b>number</b> of variations in arm force and speed, centre of gravity and the movements {{of some of the}} bodies non throw related extremities...|$|R
50|$|The {{spread of}} {{baseball}} and the craze {{for it in}} Nettuno is <b>attributable</b> to the <b>number</b> of U.S. military bases present in the area {{after the end of}} World War II. U.S. soldiers stationed at the bases often played baseball and softball and involved many local Italians in their games. One of the Italian baseball pioneers, Alberto Fasano, was a Nettunese. He and his friend Julius Zerella eventually founded Nettuno's first softball team - called Neptune PS. The team's first players were: John Petrelli, Luciano Serpe, Luciano Verlezza, Manrico David, Fulvio Verlezza, Tonino Marcucci and Sergio Serpe. Their official debut was in 1946 in the First Division Male Softball championship against Milan. The nettunesi won by a score of 32-7. Neptune PS won its first title in 1949.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This article {{examines}} approaches by academic libraries in demonstrating {{return on investment}} (RoI). Design/Methodology/Approach: As a participant in a recent international RoI study, the author reviews the various difficulties in developing a suitable methodology.

40|$|Abstract: The Estate Surveyor and Valuer is a special-class {{professional}} adequately {{equipped to}} guide and guard investments of diverse classification {{with the aim}} of garnering optimum returns. The tourism sector of Nigeria remains largely underdeveloped. This is <b>attributable</b> to a <b>number</b> of factors such as unstable economy, monetary inflation, insecurity, corruption and such other factors. Whereas government intervention is required in the area of general overhauling of the national economy as a means of addressing those rather untoward factors, the Estate Surveyor and Valuer on his part shall provide expertise, knowledge, leadership and finesse in organizing, coordinating and managing the economic system with a view to ensuring the realization of the expected level of value and benefit in the overall economy. This will bring about the much desired rejuvenation of Nigeria’s tourism sector to the benefit of all and sundry...|$|R

40|$|The Bangladesh {{securities}} {{market has}} failed to achieve any significant growth {{since its inception in}} 1954. This stagnation is <b>attributable</b> to a <b>number</b> of factors that include, inter alia, the existence of weak legal and regulatory frameworks, the absence of active market professionals, the predominance of individual investors, and a serious dearth of foreign and institutional investors. Legal and regulatory weaknesses are considered to have critically hindered the market’s potential growth. Some important laws are outdated, and the regulator has introduced some unrealistic reforms over the years. Most of the reforms accomplished thus far concentrate on incentives to investors and issuers alike, but nothing significant has been done for investor protection. This article argues that effective legal protection to investors is indispensable for the development of, and the restoration of public confidence in, the infant securities market of Bangladesh...|$|R
50|$|In the United States alone—before {{initiation}} of the rotavirus vaccination programme—over 2.7 million cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred annually, 60,000 children were hospitalised and around 37 {{died from the}} results of the infection. The major role of rotavirus in causing diarrhoea is not widely recognised within the public health community, particularly in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. It is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, being responsible for about 20% of cases, and accounts for 50% of the cases requiring hospitalisation. Rotavirus causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital.Rotavirus infections occur primarily during cool, dry seasons. The <b>number</b> <b>attributable</b> to food contamination is unknown.|$|R
