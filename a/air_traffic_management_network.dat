40|$|Databases {{have been}} {{proposed}} as the chosen platform to develop automated control systems for environments where {{the state of the}} system changes rapidly, and actions need to be taken with timing constraints, such as stock trading, <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control, <b>network</b> <b>management</b> and process control to name a few. The workload in such systems consist primarily of two types: (a) updates, which report the state of the environment to the database and arrive very frequently, and (b) transactions which arrive with deadlines. In this paper we develop algorithms to install these updates rapidly enough to ensure "state recency" while allocating sufficient resources to transactions to minimize tardiness. We also require that these transactions read temporally consistent data. In summary, this paper contributes in the following three interrelated issues: 1. First and foremost, we look at some interesting problems regarding amalgamating temporal and real-time databases 2. We look at simultaneous satisfacti [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, {{standards}} {{of quality and}} safety requirements is increasingly demanding in numerous industrial and scientific areas. Thus, the estimation of probability of rare events is become of great interest. Two popular methods in this regards are the splitting algorithm [6] and a weighted importance resampling algorithm (WIR) [3]. Despite a deep theoretical study of these two algorithms, the practical side has not been handled completely. The choice of a good tuning often proves to be fastidious and may decrease their usefulness. This study aims at answering this point. More precisely, we propose some adaptive methods to make {{the implementation of the}} splitting algorithm and the WIR algorithm automatic. Furthermore, we enlarge the area of application of the WIR algorithm to make WIR and the splitting estimating the same kind of probability. Firstly, we focus on the splitting algorithm. The main goal of this algorithm is to estimate the probability that a Markov process Xt enters a critical set B before some stopping time T. Namely, it gives some numerical approximations of P(TB ≤ T) = P(Xt ∈ B, for some t ∈ [0, T]), (1) where TB is the first time Xt enters B. This kind of problems typically arises in <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> [7], telecommunication <b>networks</b> [4] and electrical grid reliability estimation [8]...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} a slot allocation heuristic algorithm close to Eurocontrol‘ s Computer-Aided-Slot-Allocation. The heuristic algorithm represents a First-Planned- First-Serve approach for tactical Air Traffic Flow Management slot allocation in order to balance air traffic demand with network capacities. It is part of DLR‘s Network Flow Environment (NFE) introduced in this paper, which allocates tactical Air Traffic Flow Management slots throughout the whole European <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Network</b> by satisfying the objective of optimal network delay minimization. In order to quantify delay cost reduction applying a binary integer programming approach, the First-Planned- First-Serve heuristic serves as delay allocation reference for individual adverse impact scenarios. Short-term convective forecasts (nowcasts) serve as use-case to generate demand-capacityimbalances. It shows, that the First-Planned- First-Serve heuristic is capable to generate representative slot allocation data for operational scenario setups. In terms of delay performance, results can be improved by optimization for largescale Air Traffic Flow Management problems...|$|E
40|$|The {{popularity}} of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) {{is growing at}} an increasing rate {{as an alternative to}} manned aviation for different purposes and applications. So far, most of their operations have been of military character, but the demand for civil and commercial applications is growing exponentially. RPAS have been allowed to operate in segregated airspace by restricting other users from entering the volume associated to the operation of the RPAS. This temporary solution based on accommodating their operations on a case-by-case basis is not feasible on the long-term. Moreover, the latest forecast carried out by SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU) reveals that by 2050 RPAS will represent 20 % of the fleet. The available airspace is a scarce resource and is already saturated, which means that additional unmanned operations would not be possible simultaneously. Integration in non-segregated airspace is the only manner in which the full benefits and capabilities of RPAS will be achieved, while maintaining the same levels of safety and efficiency as manned aviation. In order to achieve a safe, efficient and transparent integration, a common regulatory framework and new technologies are currently under investigation. However, neither operational nor performance standards of RPAS integration have been addressed properly. For that reason, this project is focused on the development of a methodology to determine minimum operational and performance requirements by assessing the impact of RPAS operations on the <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Management</b> (ATM) <b>Network.</b> The scope is limited to the en-route phase as a starting point since none of the flight phases have been analysed yet. This project is carried out in collaboration with EUROCONTROL. RPAS are well known for presenting a wide range of performance characteristics, especially in terms of cruise speed and rate of climb. Thus, two different unmanned performance models have been chosen from the available performance models in the EUROCONTROL database: RP 01 (MQ- 9), which presents a similar performance to commercial aviation aircraft, and RP 02 (RQ 4 A), which is considered a low-performance RPAS in terms of cruise speed and rate of climb. Building on a base scenario in the Paris Control Terminal Area (CTA),Monte Carlo simulations of the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> have been performed in order to randomly vary the main input variable: the set of en-route flights that is substituted by unmanned aircraft. Two different scenarios have been analysed separately in order to establish the requirements: one for same-performance RPAS, and the other for low-performance RPAS. In order to assess the impact, three different Key Performance Areas (KPAs) have been selected: capacity, efficiency and safety. These KPAs are in turn characterized by their corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), namely sector capacity, sector overload, flight time efficiency, flight path efficiency and number of potential conflicts. Based on an analysis of the current occupancy of the flight levels, operational requirements are defined in terms of altitude segregation. RPAS are not allowed to operate in the most occupied flight levels (FL) : from FL 300 to FL 400. Therefore, depending on their operation and performance characteristics (i. e. ceiling), they will adapt their cruise FL to operate below FL 300 or above FL 400. The optimal value of performance requirements for same-performance RPAS {{has been found to be}} a minimum cruise speed of 390 kts, while for low-performance RPAS this minimum cruise speed is of 280 kts. Additionally, for low-performance RPAS, it is found that the rate of climb of 1, 000 fpm results in the best performing case when changes in FL are required. The results show that the values of the key performance indicators for the base scenario are difficult to reach when RPAS are sharing the airspace. However, the establishment of minimum operational and performance requirements contributes to a significant reduction of the negative impact that the integration of RPAS operations implies. The development of this methodology and its application to the characteristics of each airspace sector will contribute to the full integration of RPAS in non-segregated airspace...|$|R

40|$|System wide {{information}} management (SWIM) – as {{envisioned by the}} Single European Sky <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Management</b> Research (SESAR) program – is the application of service oriented architectures to the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> domain. Service oriented architectures are widely deployed in business and finance but usually tied to one specific technological implementation. SWIM goes one step further by defining only the semantic layer of the application integration and leaving {{the implementation of the}} communication layer open to the implementer. The shift from legacy communication patterns to SWIM is fundamental for the expected evolution of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> in the next decades. However, the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> simulators currently in use do not reflect this, yet. SWIM compliance is defined by semantic compatibility to the <b>Air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> Information Reference Model (AIRM) and a SWIM service may implement one or more communication profiles, which specify a communication layer implementation. This work proposes a SWIM-compliant communication profile suitable to integrate SWIM-compliant tools into human-in-the-loop simulations for <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> research. We achieve this objective by implementing a SWIM communication profile using XML-based multicast messaging, and extending the message format to support distributed human-in-the-loop simulations.
