25|$|In its call-and-response singing set to ostinato-based rhythms {{played on}} {{two or three}} squat drums (barriles), bomba resembles other neo-African genres in the Caribbean. Of clear African {{provenance}} is its format in which a single person emerges from an informal circle of singers to dance {{in front of the}} drummers, engaging the lead drummer in a sort of playful duel; after dancing for <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>that</b> person is then replaced by another. While various such elements can be traced to origins in Africa or elsewhere, bomba must be regarded as a local Afro-Puerto Rican creation. Its rhythms (e.g. seis corrido, yubá, leró, etc.), dance moves, and song lyrics that sometimes mimic farm animals(in Spanish, with some French creole words in eastern Puerto Rico) collectively constitute a unique Puerto Rican genre.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} civil wars, the internecine {{conflict}} left a bitter legacy, {{which continues to}} influence Irish politics to this day. The two largest political parties in the republic through most of its history (until the 2011 Irish General Election) were Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the descendants respectively of the anti-treaty and pro-treaty forces of 1922. Until the 1970s, almost all of Ireland's prominent politicians were veterans of the Civil War, a fact which poisoned the relationship between Ireland's two biggest parties. Examples of Civil War veterans include: Republicans Éamon de Valera, Frank Aiken, Todd Andrews, and Seán Lemass; and Free State supporters W. T. Cosgrave, Richard Mulcahy and Kevin O'Higgins. Moreover, many of these men's sons and daughters also became politicians, meaning that the personal wounds {{of the civil war}} were felt over three generations. In the 1930s, after Fianna Fáil took power for the first time, it looked possible for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> the Civil War might break out again between the IRA and the pro-Free State Blueshirts. Fortunately, this crisis was averted, and by the 1950s violence was no longer prominent in politics in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

500|$|The next concept, Dark Camelot, still {{focused on}} sword combat. Its plot—an {{inversion}} of Arthurian legend—featured Mordred as a misunderstood hero, King Arthur as a tyrannical villain and Merlin as a psychopath. According to Church, the game featured Morgan le Fay as Mordred's [...] "sort of good" [...] advisor and Guinevere as a lesbian who would betray Lancelot and help Mordred {{to break into}} Camelot and steal the Holy Grail. The game's design combined a first-person perspective with action, role-playing and adventure elements. Warren Spector, who had recently left Origin Systems to found Looking Glass Studios Austin, became Dark Camelots producer after his predecessor departed. Artist Dan Thron said: [...] "For a good long time, {{we had no idea}} what the game was about, until somebody stumbled upon the whole thief game play where you're not just running out trying to chop people up." [...] Church recalled that [...] "the basic stealth model was [...] having the guard looking the other way and you going past pretty quickly.

[...] The March 1968 issue contained the third instalment of Norman Spinrad's novel Bug Jack Barron, which included some fairly explicit sex scenes. [...] A member of parliament complained in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom that the Arts Council was [...] "sponsoring filth"; and soon W.H.

The complaints came {{at the time when}} the Arts Council was considering renewing the grant for another year, and it appeared for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> New Worlds would have to cease publication, but eventually the grant was renewed. [...] Some private donations also came in, and with money from advertising, and a substantial contribution from Moorcock himself, the magazine was able to survive. [...] The loss of revenue caused by the withdrawal from sale of the March 1968 issue was exacerbated by a temporary ban on the magazine in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, and by John Menzies' subsequent decision not to stock New Worlds. [...] W.H. Smith left it to their individual branch managers {{to decide whether or not}} to carry the magazine. [...] Stonehart were unhappy with developments and refused to pay the printers, who in turn withheld the printed copies. [...] The Arts Council money had been intended for the contributors, but a disagreement over the grant led to Stonehart's refusal to pay them as well. [...] Some negative coverage appeared in the press as a consequence of the distribution ban. [...] The grant was eventually renewed, but by late that year Stein had had enough and Stonehart ceased their involvement with New Worlds after the July 1968 issue.|$|E

2500|$|The {{indefinite}} boundary {{was resolved}} by the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819, which established the Sabine River as the boundary from the Gulf to the 32nd parallel.

[...] The United States, {{at the insistence of}} Anthony Butler, claimed for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> the names of the Sabine and Neches had been reversed, and thus claimed that the treaty established the boundary at the Neches. [...] The first Anglo-American settlers began arriving in the region in the 1820s, soon outnumbering the Mexicans by ten to one. After the independence of the Republic of Texas from Mexico in 1836, the boundary between the U.S. and Texas was firmly established at the Sabine in accordance with the Adams-Onis Treaty. The river served as the western boundary of the United States until it annexed Texas in 1845.|$|E

The match was put in jeopardy due to economic disagreements but was later confirmed to be on April 10, 2010, at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. When asked about his upcoming bout, the four-time world heavyweight champion said: [...] "I've been hearing for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> I can't do it.

2500|$|Although Ranetti {{continued}} {{to be published by}} the right-wing traditionalist press, and most notably by Iorga's Sămănătorul and Ramuri reviews (1905–1907), his Furnica was viewed by the culturally conservative as rather distasteful. Iorga, a noted target of Murnu's satire, argued in 1922: [...] "For <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>that</b> is to say {{for as long as they}} could maintain evident independence and choose between easy jokes and social–political satire for some definite purpose, the magazine Furnica, of Messrs. Gh Ranetti and Țăranu, could exercise real influence over a superficial layer of Romanian society." [...] However, Iorga's coauthor, Constantin Bacalbașa (Tony's brother), qualified such statements: [...] "Various attempts at putting out all sorts of papers, some of them pornographic in content, could not take hold [...] Only in 1904 [...] did there emerge a humorous paper that showed promise, and that survived to this day. [...] Leaving behind the old habit of turning a humorous gazette into a purely opposition newspaper, Messrs. G. Ranetti and N. D. Țăranu have created themselves a weekly newspaper of varied content, with very little politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] {{proved to}} be a {{crossover}} hit, charting across several different radio formats; in addition to peaking at number one on the Alternative Songs chart in June and number three on the Rock Songs chart in July, the song broke into the top 40 of the Hot 100 in late July and appeared on the Adult Top 40 and Mainstream Top 40 charts. Columbia senior VP of promotion Lee Leipsner said, [...] "It was one of the only alternative bands I remember in <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> you could actually dance to. And the fact that the record has a groove and rhythmic feel to it—not heavy guitar-based at all—gave us a wide opportunity to cross the record." [...] He credits the song's crossover success and push into the top 40 to a June presentation of new music by Tom Poleman of Clear Channel. According to Leipsner, [...] "After we showed our presentation, we had so many Clear Channel major-market programmers come up to us and say, 'The record I want to play besides Adele is Foster the People.'" [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] peaked at number three on the Hot 100, spending eight consecutive weeks at the position. According to Nielsen Soundscan, over 321,000 copies of Torches have been sold in the US.

2500|$|... "The Honeymooners" [...] {{made its}} debut on October 5, 1951, as a six-minute sketch. Ensemble cast member Art Carney made a brief {{appearance}} {{as a police officer}} who gets hit with flour Ralph had thrown out the window. The tone of these early sketches was much darker than the later series, with Ralph exhibiting extreme bitterness and frustration with his marriage to an equally bitter and argumentative middle-aged woman (Kelton was nine years older than Gleason). The Kramdens' financial struggles mirrored those of Gleason's early life in Brooklyn, and he took great pains to duplicate on set the interior of the apartment where he grew up (right down to his boyhood address of 328 Chauncey Street). The Kramdens—and later the Nortons when those characters are added—are childless, an issue only occasionally explored, but a condition on which Gleason insisted. Ralph and Alice did legally adopt a baby girl whom they named Ralphina (because he actually wanted a baby boy he could name after himself but {{fell in love with the}} baby girl the agency had placed with them). However, the biological mother requested to have her baby returned, and the agency asked whether the Kramdens would be willing to do so even though they were the legal parents. Ralph agreed and stated that they would visit her and she would have a real-life Santa Claus every Christmas. A few later skits had ralph mistakenly believe for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> Alice was pregnant.|$|E
