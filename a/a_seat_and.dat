5|$|Following the C-5 crash, {{and with}} the cause still unknown, the C-5 fleet was {{grounded}} and the MAC airlift was reduced to using C-141s and C-130s; rather than loading as many evacuees as possible, each evacuee required <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> a seatbelt, {{reducing the number of}} passengers that could be carried on each flight. Each C-141 would carry 94 passengers while each C-130 would carry 75, although these restrictions were relaxed, and then ignored altogether as the pace of the evacuation quickened. Armed guards were also present on each flight to prevent the possibility of hijacking. American commercial and contract carriers continued to fly out of Tan Son Nhut, but with decreasing frequency. In addition, military aircraft from Australia, Indonesia, Iran, Poland, UK, France, and other countries flew in to evacuate their embassy personnel.|$|E

25|$|Result: Platinum {{ended up}} with an {{umbrella}} that doubled up as <b>a</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>and</b> a cardboard toilet. Odyssey also wanted the toilet, but lost out due to Steven and Lucy spending their entire pitch haggling on the price and showing no real enthusiasm for the product. They therefore {{ended up with}} novelty onesies and a pedal-powered washing machine. The teams found all their products hard to sell, in particular Odyssey, who ended up failing to sell a single washing machine. Platinum ultimately edged Odyssey in the final figures, winning by around just £30.|$|E
25|$|In the 2011 {{parliamentary}} election, she was re-elected to parliament. Although {{the ruling}} Liberal Party became the largest party and gained <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> the Social Democrats lost a seat, {{the opposition parties}} combined obtained more seats than the government coalition. Her four-party bloc gained a majority of 89 seats in the 179-seat parliament against 86 for the sitting Prime Minister and his center-right parliamentary supporters. Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen formally tendered his resignation to Queen Margrethe on 16 September 2011. Rasmussen's cabinet remained in office as a caretaker government until 3 October, when Helle Thorning-Schmidt was appointed Prime Minister by the Queen following negotiations with the other opposition parties.|$|E
25|$|After Virginia {{ratified}} the constitution, Madison returned to New York {{to resume his}} duties in the Congress of the Confederation. At the request of Washington, Madison sought {{a seat in the}} United States Senate, but his election was blocked by Patrick Henry. Madison then decided to run for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. At Henry's behest, the Virginia legislature created congressional districts designed to deny Madison <b>a</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>and</b> Henry recruited a strong challenger to Madison in James Monroe. Locked in a difficult race against Monroe, Madison promised to support a series of constitutional amendments to protect individual liberties. Madison's promise paid off, as he won election to Congress with 57% of the vote. He would continue to serve in the House until 1797, when Madison briefly left public office to preside over his plantation. Early in his tenure, Madison became an ally of President Washington, who looked to Madison as the person who best understood the constitution.|$|E

25|$|Despite being {{admitted}} to the United States, Utah was initially unsuccessful in having its elected representatives and senators seated in the United States Congress. In 1898, Utah elected general authority B.H. Roberts to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat. Roberts, however, was denied a seat there because he was practicing polygamy. In 1903, the Utah legislature selected Reed Smoot, also an LDS general authority but also a monogamist, as its first senator. From 1904 to 1907, the United States Senate {{conducted a series of}} Congressional hearings on whether Smoot should be seated. Eventually, the Senate granted Smoot <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> allowed him to vote. However, the hearings raised controversy as to whether polygamy had actually been abandoned as claimed in the 1890 Manifesto, and whether the LDS Church continued to exercise influence on Utah politics. In response to these hearings, President of the Church Joseph F. Smith issued a Second Manifesto denying that any post-Manifesto marriages had the church's sanction, and announcing that those entering such marriages in the future would be excommunicated.|$|E

500|$|The overall impression, as critic Alex Ross {{writes in}} his book The Rest is Noise, was that [...] "Copland {{was no longer in}} an ingratiating mood; some sudden rage welled up in him, some urge to confront the gala Lincoln Center {{audience}} with an old whiff of revolutionary mystique." [...] Copland himself remembers, [...] "The acidulous harmonies of my score... upset a good many people, especially those who were expecting another Appalachian Spring." [...] Jacqueline Kennedy was left unable to say anything other than [...] "Oh, Mr. Copland" [...] when taken backstage during intermission to meet with the composer. When Copland later asked Verna Fine, wife of American composer Irving Fine, what this meant, Fine answered, [...] "Oh, Aaron, it's obvious. She hated your piece!" [...] In Variety, Robert J. Landry called Connotations [...] "an assault on [...] nervous systems" [...] and added, [...] "Seldom has this reviewer heard such outspoken comment in the lobbies after such dull response. It is strictly accurate to declare that an audience paying $100 <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> in mood for self-congratulation and schmaltz hated Copland's reminder of the ugly realities of industrialization, inflation and cold war—which his music seems to be talking about." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} Liberal leadership, Macdonald {{travelled}} the province on speaking tours helping organize party support in every constituency. As Liberal leader, he {{proved to be}} an effective platform speaker. According to biographer John Hawkins, Macdonald's [...] "plain talk and simplicity" [...] persuaded audiences of his honesty. He developed the ability to explain political issues with a [...] "clarity that every voter could understand". When the legislature was in session, he led the Liberals from the public galleries because he had no seat in the House. There were six vacancies, but the Conservatives refused to call by-elections fearing they would lose their five-seat majority. Macdonald publicly criticized Premier Gordon Harrington for depriving so many Nova Scotians of representation. He deplored what he called [...] "the loss of responsible government." [...] It was a message that struck a chord in the province that had been the first in Canada to achieve responsible government in 1848 thanks to the efforts of the great liberal Reformer Joseph Howe. Privately however, Macdonald rejoiced that the government couldn't risk calling a by-election telling one supporter years later, [...] "If the truth must be told, I was sometimes afraid that they would open up <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> deprive me of this sort of ammunition".|$|E
500|$|The MSP {{building}} {{is connected to}} the Tower Buildings by way of the Garden Lobby and stands at the western end of the parliamentary complex, adjoining Reid's Close. The block contains offices for each MSP and two members of staff, fitted out with custom-designed furniture. The {{building is}} between four and six storeys in height, and is clad in granite. MSPs occupy 108 of the total 114 rooms in the building. [...] Each office is divided into two parts—one for the MSP, with a floor space of 15squaremetres (160sqft) and another part for their staff, which has a floor space of 12squaremetres (130sqft). [...] The most distinctive feature of the MSP block are the unusual windows which project out from the building onto the western elevation of the parliamentary complex, inspired by a combination of the repeated leaf motif and the traditional Scottish stepped gable. In each office, these bay windows have <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> shelving and are intended as [...] "contemplation spaces". Constructed from stainless steel and framed in oak, with oak lattices covering the glass, the windows are designed to provide MSPs with privacy and shade from the sun. Ahead of the opening of the Parliament, some MSPs who questioned whether the design would allow sufficient natural light into their offices. To remove the uniformity from the western side of the building, the windows jut out at different widths and angles. At its north end, the building is six storeys high (ground floor plus five) stepping down to four storeys (ground floor plus three) at the south end.|$|E
