40|$|This work aims at the {{determination}} of the climatological of absolute the maximum and <b>minimum</b> air <b>temperatures</b> for the implementation in the quality control of data gathered from the SONDA network over the Brazilian territory. This approach employs orbital data and multiple regression techniques. The data of <b>absolute</b> maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> were observed between the years of 1961 and 1990 in 204 meteorological stations. Information on the topography was obtained from the program Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The outputs from the multiple regression models were validated with observation values of a subset of 30 meteorological sites that {{were not included in the}} original dataset used in the multiple regression. The statistical analysis was carried out using bootstrap techniques. The results show that the multiple regression for <b>absolute</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> presented good agreement with the observed data (R² = 0. 86) not presenting trends to overestimation. For the absolute maximum temperatures the results were not as satisfactory. The <b>absolute</b> <b>minimum</b> varied between - 12 to 25 °C and the absolute maximum between 31 and 42 °C.

40|$|<b>Minimum</b> <b>temperature</b> {{is assumed}} to be an {{important}} driver of tree species range limits. We investigated during which period of the year trees are most vulnerable to freezing damage and whether the pressure of freezing events increases with increasing elevation. We assessed the course of freezing resistance of buds and leaves from winter to summer at the upper elevational limits of eight deciduous tree species in the Swiss Alps. By reconstructing the spring phenology of these species over the last eight decades using a thermal time model, we linked freezing resistance with long-term <b>minimum</b> <b>temperature</b> data along elevational gradients. Counter-intuitively, the pressure of freeze events does not increase with elevation, but deciduous temperate tree species exhibit a constant safety margin (5 – 8. 5  K) against damage by spring freeze events along elevational gradients, {{as a result of the}} later flushing at higher elevation. <b>Absolute</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> in winter and summer are unlikely to critically injure trees. Our study shows that freezing temperatures in spring are the main selective pressure controlling the timing of flushing, leading to a shorter growing season at higher elevation and potentially driving species distribution limits.

40|$|Temperature is {{the most}} {{important}} factor driving the cold edge distribution limit of temperate trees. Here, we identified the <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> for root growth in seven broad-leaved tree species, compared them with the species’ natural elevational limits and identified morphological changes in roots produced near their physiological cold limit. Seedlings were exposed to a vertical soil-temperature gradient from 20 to 2 °C along the rooting zone for 18 weeks. In all species, the bulk of roots was produced at temperatures above 5 °C. However, the <b>absolute</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> for root growth differed among species between 2. 3 and 4. 2 °C, with those species that reach their natural distribution limits at higher elevations also tending to have lower thermal limits for root tissue formation. In all investigated species, the roots produced at temperatures close to the thermal limit were pale, thick, unbranched and of reduced mechanical strength. Across species, the specific root length (m g− 1 root) was reduced by, on average, 60 % at temperatures below 7 °C. A significant correlation of <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> for root growth with the natural high elevation limits of the investigated species indicates species-specific ther- mal requirements for basic physiological processes. Although these limits are not necessarily directly causative for the upper distribution limit of a species, they seem to belong to a syndrome of adaptive processes for life at low temperatures.
