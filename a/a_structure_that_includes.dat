50|$|Linguist Noam Chomsky {{among many}} others {{has argued that the}} lack of an upper bound on the number of {{grammatical}} sentences in a language, and the lack of an upper bound on grammatical sentence length (beyond practical constraints such as the time available to utter one), can be explained as the consequence of recursion in natural language. This can be understood in terms of a recursive definition of a syntactic category, such as a sentence. A sentence can have a structure in which what follows the verb is another sentence: Dorothy thinks witches are dangerous, in which the sentence witches are dangerous occurs in the larger one. So a sentence can be defined recursively (very roughly) as something with <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> a noun phrase, a verb, and optionally another sentence. This is really just a special case of the mathematical definition of recursion.|$|E

40|$|Although {{proteins}} and lipids have been {{assumed to be}} distributed homogeneously in the plasma membrane (PM), recent {{studies suggest that the}} PM is non-uniform, forming <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> a number of lateral domains enriched in specific components, such as sterols, sphingolipids, and integral and surface-bound proteins.

Microdomains can be extracted as detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions, and such fractions have been isolated from some plant species and used for proteomic and other biochemical characterizations to gain understanding of microdomain functions. Profiling sterol-dependent proteins using a putative microdomain-disrupting agent suggests specific lipid-protein interactions in microdomains. Furthermore, in some plant species, DRM proteomes dynamically respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. Taken together, these results suggest that DRM proteomic studies provide important information for understanding microdomain physiological functions that are critical to the successful prosecution of a plant’s life cycle, particularly in its development and stress responses...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integral {{solution of the}} overvoltage problem caused by mismatched conditions when DC-DC converter outputs of PV systems are connected in series, and a distributed {{maximum power point tracking}} architecture is implemented. The operating conditions that cause the overvoltage problem are discussed in detail and the consequences of the overvoltage problem are illustrated. The proposed solution is based on <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> a non-linear controller, two linear controllers, and a maximum power point tracking algorithm. Such a solution makes it possible to regulate the PV voltage according to the MPPT controller commands and to limit the DC-DC converter output voltage to avoid damages. The non-linear control structure is experimentally validated with a boost converter and a BP 585 PV panel. Simulation results show that the proposed integral solution allows the operation of PV panels in the feasible maximum power point and protects the integrity of the DC-DC converters, avoiding the overvoltage problem caused by mismatched conditions...|$|E

40|$|The fuel spray in direct-injection Diesel engines has <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> {{an intact}} liquid core which sheds drops from it.

Recently, serious limitations related to the numerical treatment of the drop dynamics which, in turn, affect the computed liquid penetration and vaporization rates have been found. In this work, these limitations will be discussed. Results of computed and measured liquid penetrations will be presented {{for a wide range of}} Diesel conditions. It has also been shown that, under conditions where the liquid penetration is short relative to the penetration of the overall jet and the mass of fuel in the chamber that is in liquid phase is small relative to the total mass of fuel present, the liquid phase may be represented by a Virtual Liquid Source (VLS) model.

40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} to reason about utilities, and {{inspired}} by the success of bayesian networks in representing and reasoning about probabilities, we introduce the notion of utility distributions, in which utilities have the structure of probabilities. We furthermore define the notion of a bi-distribution, <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> in a symmetric fashion both a probability distribution and a utility distribution. We give several examples of bi-distributions. We also show that every state space with standard probability distribution and utility function can be embedded in a bi-distribution, and provide bounds on the size requirements of this bi-distribution. Finally, we suggest a reinterpretation of the von-Neumann and Morgenstern theorem in light of this new model. 1 introduction AI enjoys a rich arsenal of tools with which to represent shades of certainty. One can formally represent varieties of certainty using logics of knowledge, nonmonotonic logics, and, importantly, probability theory. One reason the latter is particularly significant is that one has tools for efficiently representing and reasoning about probabilities, notably in the form of bayesian networks. Of course, AI is interested in uncertainty in general, and in probability in particular, {{only to the extent that}} it provides help with decision making. While wildly successful, bayesian networks constitute a mechanism to reason purely about probabilities. In contrast, AI has been fairly impoverished when it comes to mechanisms for reasoning about the motivational components of decision making, such as preferences, goals, and, importantly, utilities...|$|E
40|$|TEENAGE KICKS is a {{multimodal}} {{project that}} describes certain problems that lie within {{the margins of}} human thought, time, material, and rocks. It focuses primarily on the decay function that is established when these components converge around {{a specific set of}} actions. The actions are nodes in constant flux, the time is expandable but not compressible, the material is molecularly fixed, and the thought behaves as a generator governor does when it begins to fail. The rock, of course, is inert. The oscillation itself starts oscillating and eventually a new superfrequency arises – removed by at least three orders of magnitude from the baseline 60 Hertz – that describes how we produce and destroy material whose half-life outstrips any of our physical terrestrial limits.

40|$|A prática clínica com aqueles que não falam pode ser fundamentada no campo da psicanálise, ainda que com a criança, e mais especificamente com o bebê, ela tenha sido interrogada em seus fundamentos. A clínica com o bebê não somente pode ser lida pela psicanálise, como pode vir a ser sua forma mais radical de apresentação: a psicanálise como uma prática de discurso sem palavras. Para isso, contudo, é necessário que essa clínica possa ser pensada para além do espaço euclidiano, afastando-se da idéia biunívoca de um lado e outro lado entre personagens e passando para uma clínica que toma a transferência numa estrutura que inclui o analista. A imagem com apoio da letra são elementos da psicanálise imprescindíveis para a viabilidade das leituras dessa clínica. Algumas leituras como a tradução, a transcrição e a transliteração são efetivas em relação à imagem e à letra, e mais ainda: a transcrição transitiva é outra leitura que, do lado daquele que não fala, favorece o manejo clínico. Não se trata então de tomar o bebê como conseqüência das marcas de seus cuidadores, mas de verificar os efeitos de real que o bebê provoca em seus cuidadores que, tomados juntamente com o bebê em seu espaço também de não fala, marcam, de modo particular, o encontro do infans com a linguagemThe {{clinical}} practice {{with those who}} do not speak can be grounded in the field of psychoanalysis, even though it has been questioned in its fundamentals, when it refers to the child and more specifically, to the baby. Not only can the {{clinical practice}} with infants be read by the psychoanalysis, {{but it can also be}} presented in its most radical form: the psychoanalysis as a practice of discourse without words. However, for this to happen, it is necessary to conceive this practice beyond the Euclidean space, dismissing the biunivocal idea of one side and another side between people, and moving to a clinical practice that places the transference in <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> the analyst. Imagery, with the support of the letter, is an indispensable element in psychoanalysis to make the readings in this clinical practice viable. Some readings such as translation, transcription and transliteration are effective in relation to the image and the letter, especially the transitive transcription, as another reading that, on the side of the one who does not speak, favors the clinical management. Its not the case of seeing the infant as a consequence of the marks caused by his or her caretakers.
