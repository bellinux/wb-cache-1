5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies {{has been that}} most of the SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins.

5|$|Multi-platform {{releases}} {{were common}} {{in the early days}} of RPGs, but there was a period during the 1990s when this was not generally the case. The sixth generation of home gaming consoles led many game developers to resume the practice, and some opted to develop primarily or exclusively for consoles.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not listed any phoronid species as endangered.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium has {{no known}} {{biological}} function, although fungi can incorporate {{it in place}} of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as telluro-cysteine and telluro-methionine. Organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tellurium compounds. Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, take up tellurite and reduce it to elemental tellurium, which accumulates and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells. In yeast, this reduction is mediated by the sulfate assimilation pathway. Tellurium accumulation seems to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{major part of the}} toxicity effects. Many organisms also metabolize tellurium partly to form dimethyl telluride, although dimethyl ditelluride is also formed by some species.

5|$|The {{origin of}} the two moons is not well understood. Their low albedo and {{carbonaceous}} chondrite composition have been regarded as similar to asteroids, supporting the capture theory.

There are 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands, encompassing {{a total of}} 1,172,790 people. Canada's indigenous population is growing at almost twice the national rate, and four percent of Canada's population claimed an indigenous identity in 2006.

Between 2001 and 2006, the visible minority population rose by 27.2 percent. In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members of visible minority groups. By 2007, almost one in five (19.8%) were foreign-born, with nearly 60 percent of new immigrants coming from Asia (including the Middle East).

5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms).

The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius nordmanensis was {{described}} by Alexander Smith in 1960 to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> North American species closely resembling L.torminosus in appearance, but with a slightly larger range of spore sizes (9–11 by 6.5–8μm). In contrast to the unchanging latex of L.torminosus, L.nordmanensis has whitish latex that slowly changes to pale yellow upon exposure to air; the latex also stains mushroom tissues and paper yellow. Hesler and Smith reduced L.nordmanensis {{to the status of}} a variety under L.torminosus in 1979. Lactarius torminosus var. nordmanensis has been recorded from California, Idaho, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the United States, Quebec in Canada, and Switzerland. The variety resembles Lactarius pubescens var. betulae, but differs in its longer pleurocystidia, larger spores with slightly different spore ornamentation, and strongly burning acrid taste. The holotype specimen of L.torminosus var. nordmanensis was collected by Smith in 1956 near Nordman, Idaho.|$|E
