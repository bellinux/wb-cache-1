25|$|In {{southern}} Saskatchewan {{there was}} one main group of plains Indians who were called Assiniboine. They moved around the area that is modern day Willow Bunch. This band {{is thought to have}} arrived 11,000 years ago, just after the last glacier retreated. Like most bands at the time, this group moved where their food went. They depended on the bison for almost everything. They used the bison to make clothing, build their shelter and to make tools. Since they moved around a lot they made <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>smart</b> way of transporting their tipis. The poles of the tipis would make a sled of sort that was called a travois and would be pulled by dogs. This carried all that they needed and transported their home at the same time.|$|E

Gray stated in an interview with TV Guide, [...] "The producers said, 'But you're doing so well.' I thought, 'Oh, look out! I'm on the warpath now.' It was a struggle, though, because it was a man's show. And they fired me. When I finally told Larry, he went with me into the office and said, 'If she doesn't come back, I don't come back. I can't be playing J.R. Ewing without Sue Ellen.' He was very loyal and, honestly, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>smart</b> businessman. He knew that truly, it was a huge relationship to the show."

Everybody had dibs and dabs of knowledge of self, I brought him in to be a mentor to these men like, 'I love them and you the only person I know that have the intelligence to keep them in sync with knowledge.'
