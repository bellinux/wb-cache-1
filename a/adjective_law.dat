5000|$|Procedural law or <b>adjective</b> <b>law</b> {{comprises}} the rules {{by which a}} court hears and determines what happens in civil, lawsuit, criminal or administrative s. The rules are designed to ensure a fair and consistent application of due process (in the U.S.) or fundamental justice (in other common law countries) to all cases that come before a court.|$|E
5000|$|Under the {{approach}} in Hanna v. Plumer, {{the federal court}} of a state hearing a case based on diversity jurisdiction should apply state law {{in the event of}} conflict between state and federal law if the state law deals with substantive rights of state citizens. The Supreme Court has defined substantive rights as, [...] "rights conferred by the law to be protected and enforced by the <b>adjective</b> <b>law</b> of judicial procedure." [...] An example of a substantive right would be a state law on fraud, which may vary widely in composition depending on the jurisdiction. If the state law is merely procedural, or relating merely to the form and mode of judicial operations, then the federal court does not have to apply the conflicting state law. However, the substance-procedure distinction is a generality as the Court rejected any test based upon [...] "litmus paper criterion." [...] Thus, a choice between state and federal law must be made with reference to the underlying policy of the Erie decision. The Court announced a modification of the [...] "outcome-determinative" [...] test in York, whereby the test must be applied in light of the twin aims of Erie, which are the discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws. Under this rule, state procedural law would not supplant federal procedural law if the differences in the outcome are nonsubstantial or trivial, fail to raise Equal Protection concerns, and are unlikely to influence the choice of forum.|$|E

The use of serious games in the undergraduate and vocational legal education is still relative rare and, most of all, still lacks solid theoretical guidelines concerning the overall design of learning experience. On the base of an experimental research focused {{on the development of}} a serious game for teaching civil <b>adjective</b> <b>law,</b> the paper analyses the emerging paradigm of transmediality (transmedia storytelling and transmedia interaction) and its possible connections with the instructional design of a legal serious game, considering the specific needs and features of legal education. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of the basic maxim of substantive law, that no man may be deprived of his property without his consent, and the correlative maxim of <b>adjective</b> <b>law,</b> that the courts will give exact compensation for property taken or destroyed, together with the more or less mechanical rules of damages depending upon the form of action used, have in their outcome gone far toward justifying the somewhat grandiloquent utterance of our legal forbears of {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries, that the 2 ̆ 2 Common Law is the perfection of human wisdom. 2 ̆ 2 The final stage in this development is shown in the late cases of Polk County v. Parker, (Iowa, Dec., 1916), 160 N. W. 320 and Warren Stove Co. v. Hardy, et al., (Ark., Oct., 1917), 198 S. W. 99...|$|E
40|$|Historic Preservation Law {{has come}} to mean that {{combination}} of regulations, common-law property principles, tax incentives, and <b>adjective</b> <b>law</b> in administrative proceedings, governing historic sites and property within the United States. Although Congress first recognized a need to conserve the nation 2 ̆ 7 s wealth of historic amenities in 1906 when it adopted The Antiquities Act, it was only with the nation 2 ̆ 7 s bicentennial that the volume and diversity of laws designed to maintain, protect and preserve historic America grew {{to the point where}} it could be said that a new field of law had emerged. The symposium which follows this essay represents the first attempt to comprehensively delineate the elements of this new field. The conference entitled 2 ̆ 2 Historic Preservation and the Law: The Metes 2 ̆ 6 Bounds of a New Field 2 ̆ 2 gathered 500 persons for two days at the House of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York in September of 1978. s Organized by the Association and the New York Landmarks Conservancy, this conference traversed the entire range of preservation legal issues, from asking 2 ̆ 2 what is historic? 2 ̆ 2 to identifying the need for law reform already apparent in this new field. The proceedings of this conference comprise this symposium. By way of introduction, this essay provides background and a conceptual framework for the presentations which follow. This essay can best introduce the symposium by delineating first the scope of regulation by exercise of the police power and the definitions for what resources are 2 ̆ 2 historic, 2 ̆ 2 then the elements of real property law which transect these regulations, and thereafter the operation of municipal ordinances and federal procedural statutes which are the body of historic preservation law. The essay will then raise several of the thorny issues currently in dispute within this evolving field...|$|E
40|$|The {{simplification}} and {{acceleration of}} the method to obtain building permission {{is an important part}} of the discussion concerning deregulation, de-bureaucratisation, and the delegation of federal tasks that has been regularly held for decades. The aim of the investigation, within the frame of this preliminary study, is to check if and to what extent these recent deregulatory approaches are compatible with the safeguarding of environmental protection standards, which in the meantime has become the explicitly stated goal in the majority of the state building orders. It is to clarify if and to what degree approaches of this sort can lead to an improvement of environmental protection in the building permit procedure and in the building industry. Deregulation can be understood as a 'catch-all' term which includes the efforts to reduce present regulations, as well as efforts to simplify complex regulations to make then more effective. In regard to a typology of deregulation, the three main areas of deregulation to be distinguished are: in norm setting, in administration, and in legal control. Tendencies of further deregulation under <b>adjective</b> <b>law</b> of the building order law are recognisable, to the effect, that even for projects with an increasing degree of difficulty, the obligation to implement a normal building permit procedure are increasingly replaced in favor of the simplified permit procedure or notification procedure. Completely unlike the adjective building order law, the substantive building order law proves to be extraordinarily resistant to attempts at deregulation. There exists a considerable need for analysis and concept development. A main study could and should contribute to the clarification of essential questions. The main study should cover a wide spectrum of questions and should consist of the following four elements: Systematic empirical evaluation of the results of deregulation up-to-the-present, more in-depth analysis of substantive deregulatory possibilities and necessities relevant to environmental protection, development of requirements for auditing concepts in the scope of the state building orders considering aspects of environmental protection, development of requirements for future technical notaries.
