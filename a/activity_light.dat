40|$|Objectives Recent {{research}} has shown that machine learning techniques can accurately predict activity classes from accelerometer data in adolescents and adults. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop and test machine learning models for predicting activity type in preschool-aged children. Design Participants completed 12 standardised activity trials (TV, reading, tablet game, quiet play, art, treasure hunt, cleaning up, active game, obstacle course, bicycle riding) over two laboratory visits. Methods Eleven children aged 3 - 6 years (mean age = 4. 8 ± 0. 87; 55 % girls) completed the activity trials while wearing an ActiGraph GT 3 X+ accelerometer on the right hip. Activities were categorised into five activity classes: sedentary <b>activities,</b> <b>light</b> <b>activities,</b> moderate to vigorous activities, walking, and running. A standard feed-forward Artificial Neural Network and a Deep Learning Ensemble Network were trained on features in the accelerometer data used in previous investigations (10 th, 25 th, 50 th, 75 th and 90 th percentiles and the lag-one autocorrelation). Results Overall recognition accuracy for the standard feed forward Artificial Neural Network was 69. 7 %. Recognition accuracy for sedentary <b>activities,</b> <b>light</b> <b>activities</b> and games, moderate-to-vigorous activities, walking, and running was 82 %, 79 %, 64 %, 36 % and 46 %, respectively. In comparison, overall recognition accuracy for the Deep Learning Ensemble Network was 82. 6 %. For sedentary <b>activities,</b> <b>light</b> <b>activities</b> and games, moderate-to-vigorous activities, walking, and running recognition accuracy was 84 %, 91 %, 79 %, 73 % and 73 %, respectively.

5000|$|Physical {{colors are}} temporary. They exist when light {{combines}} with cloudy transparent or translucent media, such as smoke, fog, or a glass prism. They are comprehensible {{because we know}} that they result from part of the qualitative division of retinal <b>activity.</b> <b>Light</b> is the external physical stimulus of the retina's activity. The more that we know about the effect (color as physiological fact), the more we can know a priori about its external cause. (1) The external stimulus can only excite color, which is the retina's polar division. (2) There are no individual colors. Colors come in pairs because each color is the qualitative part of the retina's full activity. The remaining part is the color's complementary color. (3) There are an infinite number of colors. Three pairs are distinguished by names of their own, however, because the retina's activity is bipartitioned in a rational proportion that consists of simple numbers. (4) A color's external cause, acting as a stimulus, must be capable of being changed and infinitely modified as much as the retina's activity can be infinitely divided qualitatively. (5) In the eye, color is a cloudy shade of white. This shadiness is the retina's resting part while the other retinal part is active. Newton's theory asserts that each prismatic color is 1/7 of the whole of light. If an infinite number, instead of seven, of light rays is assumed, then each color would be an infinitely small fraction of the whole of light. Schopenhauer's theory, however, claims that yellow is ¾ as bright as white. Orange is 2/3, red is ½, green is ½, blue is 1/3, and violet is ¼ as bright as white. The external cause of color is a diminished light that imparts just as much light to the color as it imparts darkness to the color's complement. Unlike Goethe, for Schopenhauer the primary phenomenon, or limit of explanation, is not an external cause, but the [...] "organic capacity of the retina to let its nervous activity appear in two qualitatively opposite halves, sometimes equal, sometimes unequal...." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractUsing {{a sample}} of English school children, we use accelerometery and global {{positioning}} systems to identify whether different intensities of <b>activity</b> (<b>light,</b> moderate, and vigorous) occur in different environments, and whether environments for bouts of moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA) vary from those for non-bout MVPA. We find that land uses such as buildings and roads and pavements were generally used for light activity, whilst green environments such as gardens, parks, grassland and farmland appear supportive of vigorous activity. Built land uses such as hard surface play areas were particularly used for activity of short duration. Future work may consider differentiating light activity from moderate and vigorous, and separating bout and non-bout MVPA to better identify environmental supportiveness for activity in children...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of load on upper limb muscles and brain <b>activities</b> in <b>light</b> assembly task. The task was conducted at two levels of load (Low and high). Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to measure upper limb muscle activities of six subjects. The results found that the Mean Power Frequency (MPF) of the brachioradialis and upper trapezius activities were higher on the low-load task compared to high-load task. The EMG MPF also tended to decrease as time increases, that reflects muscle fatigue. Electroencephalography (EEG) was simultaneously recorded with EMG to record brain activities from Fz, Pz, O 1 and O 2 channels. Mean power of the EEG alpha bands from the channels were found to be higher on the low-load task compared to high-load task. The results indicated that high-load task require more brain activitie than the low-load task. It is also found that there was relation between upper limb muscles and brain <b>activities</b> while performing <b>light</b> assembly task. Thus these results can would be potentially useful in the management of fatigue, especially related to muscle and mental workload.
