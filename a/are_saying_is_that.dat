40|$|Abstract. It is argued, using a {{relativistic}} space-time {{view of the}} Universe, that Reichenbach’s “principle of {{the common}} cause ” provides a good basis for understanding the time direction {{of a variety of}} time-asymmetric physical processes. Most of the mathematical formulation is based on a probabilistic model using classical mechanics, but the extension to quantum mechanics is also considered. 1. 1 Does time have a direction? When we speak of “the direction of time ” we are not really saying that time itself has a direction, any more than we would say that space itself has a direction. What we <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the events and processes that take place in time have a direction (i. e. they are not symmetrical under time reversal) and, moreover, that this time direction is the same for all the events. To see the distinction, imagine that you look into a body of water and see some fish all facing in the same (spatial) direction. You would not attribute the directedness of this fish population to any “direction of space”; it would be much more natural, assuming the body of water to be a river, to attribute th...|$|E

30|$|Instead, {{the concept}} of co-existence is offered (McGregor 2004 b), which {{suggests}} the importance of balancing indigenous and non-indigenous aspirations of governance into the evaluation of collaboration. In this case, one might be inclined to think cynically that {{it is all about}} labels. But there is much more going on than preferences about labels. We need to consider the role played by concepts like co-management and co-existence in facilitating or discouraging collaboration. People who reject {{the concept of}} co-management based on the contexts they are familiar with see in it problematic assumptions about how indigenous and non-indigenous institutions should work together. Non-indigenous people may not see how the concept of co-management might encourage these assumptions, even though, perhaps, co-management is the preferred concept in some contexts. Those who reject the concept of co-management and wish to replace it with the concept of co-existence are inviting non-indigenous people to learn more about cross-cultural and cross-situational divides. This is the role that concepts like co-management and co-existence play. The concept of co-existence does not in itself contain enough meaning for non-indigenous persons to suggest in advance exactly how a collaborative process should play out. What proponents of co-existence <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is much learning to do. The concept of co-existence suggests a very different possibility for collaboration than what non-indigenous peoples may be used to. Work on co-existence expresses an invitation to learn about cross-cultural and cross-situational divides so as to achieve better collaborations in particular contexts.|$|E
40|$|At {{a conference}} {{recently}} a speaker was advocating that {{the efficiency of}} automobiles could be improved {{by a factor of}} 20 and, by implication, if this was achieved then environmental limits would not be breached. This short note seeks to respond to such a proposition and proceeds along three lines. First, exactly what factor 20 entails is outlined. Second, an evaluation of whether or not factor 20 will be sufficient given our environmental challenges will be explored. Finally, we will suggest that factors of efficiency (regardless of whether then are sufficiently large given our environmental challenges) miss important secondary questions of equity, among other things. Weisacker, Lovins and Lovins ’ (1998, p. xiv) outline “ 50 examples of quadrupling resource productivity … [to demonstrate the] broad feasibility of Factor Four ” efficiency gains. What they <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> where currently a single unit of resource might give a single unit of output, an efficiency gain of factor four would give four units of output for the one unit of input. Weisacker, Lovins and Lovins (1998) suggest that this means that “we can live twice as well – yet use half as much ” (ibid: xviii). The following table demonstrates this using numbers. Following Weisacker, Lovins and Lovins’s (1998) reasoning for factor four, a factor 20 efficiency gain would result in realising 20 times output for each unit of input. Assuming that it is technologically feasible to achieve factor 20 gains, whether or not factor 20 is a sufficient level of gain needs to be addressed. In this context, our example wil...|$|E

GILLIAN CALVERT outlines some of the challenges facing communities, researchers and policy makers.

This Australian Institute of Family Studies Conference is about family futures, but in many ways we are barely managing to research families present and, more disturbingly, our policies and programs seem often locked into families past. The world has changed, and much of the infrastructure that supported families in the past is often no longer there as a result of the macro changes that have happened in society over the last 50 years or so. I do not want to pretend that there were ever ‘good old days ’ when things were wonderful in families and people could bring up their kids without any problems. But we do know that in the past the task of parents in raising children was probably eased by the informal supports that came from being surrounded by extended family, from having a network of friends among your neighbours, and from living in a community that shared your interests and aspirations. Nowdays, as individuals and families, we are very mobile. We travel around the country and overseas for work, for affordable housing and for fun.

40|$|Morality is {{a source}} of reasons for action, what {{philosophers}} call practical reasons. Kantians say that it ‘gives ’ reasons to everyone. We can even think of moral requirements as amounting to particularly strong or stringent reasons, in an effort to demystify deontological views like Kant’s, with its insistence on inescapable or ‘binding ’ moral requirements or ‘oughts. ’ When we say that someone morally ought not to harm others, perhaps all we <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he has a certain kind of reason not to, one that wins out against any opposing reasons such as those touting benefits to him of ignoring others ’ concerns. Philosophers may feel the need for a deeper understanding of reasons, but interpreted essentially as facts relating acts and agents—considerations counting in favor of or against someone’s performing a certain act—moral reasons at any rate would not seem to involve any intrinsic moral properties of acts, of the sort that people used to worry about even for less extreme examples than Kant’s of a deontological approach to ethics. We need to refer to reasons in any case to understand ordinary non-moral cases of rational deliberation and action. So it is now common, for instance, to substitute for Ross’s notion of prima facie duties talk of pro tanto reasons, reasons counting in favor of or against some act as far as they go, but capable of being defeated by opposing reasons. The explanation of moral ‘ought ’ in terms of practical reasons might seem to lend support, though, to contemporary Kantian arguments that practical rationality is all one needs to supply the impulse to be moral, with Nagel’s The Possibility of Altruism as a primary source. Even granting that an agent might be rational and yet not fully aware of the reasons bearing Because the term ‘obligation ’ has some implications that do not pertain to ‘ought,’ let me deviate from English idiom and use the verb ‘ought ’ as a noun. An ought is what we have when the verb applies, i. e. when we ought to do something. Henceforth I use quotes only when referring to the word or concept...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} animals have {{feelings}} {{is something that}} is commonly agreed. Many authors show how animals' views of their environment is quite similar with human views. Animals, which are slaughtered without prior stunning, find the moment of slaughter unpleasant and stressing. This is shown in numerous of scientific studies. The cognitive ability of animals can be compared to how they experience feelings and scientists have shown how the structures in the brain that involves feelings and cognitive behaviours in animals are very much the same as the structures in human brains. Because of this, some scientists consider that behaviour in animals can be directly interpreted into human feelings. Halal- and kosher slaughter comes from traditions. These traditions come from interpretations of religious texts. The texts were written in a time when there was little knowledge of animal welfare and food hygiene. What the texts <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> animals should be treated with respect and that they should not suffer. Some animals are, according to the texts, not clean and should therefore not be consumed. This also applies for some parts of the animals' body. If an animal somehow is injured, the meat can not be eaten according to the religious texts. This causes trouble, when in modern times; animals are stunned prior to slaughter. For some religious groups, stunning is concerned to be an injury and the meat can therefore not be consumed. In Sweden it is not allowed to slaughter animals without prior stunning. The European laws say the same, but there is a possibility to slaughter animals without prior stunning for religious purposes. According to sources in the EU more and more animals are slaughtered without prior stunning. This is because it is easier to have one way to produce instead of two. The meat that is not sold to the religious groups is in some cases sold as "regular" meat. I {{have not been able to}} get answers to the questions if the Swedish food chains sell meat of this kind or not. But I have hopefully awoken an interest in the question and I am hoping, thorough this, that they make considerable research in where the meat comes from and how the animals are treated at slaughter...|$|E
40|$|Demonstrating {{ideas for}} better {{varieties}} Cue: Year-by-year farmers have more seeds {{to choose from}} as seed companies bring new varieties to the market. And {{what better way to}} see what you will get for your money - than a demonstration plot. In a demonstration, farmers and seed merchants or researchers work together. They collect a good selection of improved - and local - seeds. They decide on a plot where the seed can be grown, and then they invite farmers from the local community to come and see and discuss the results. If, as the saying goes ?seeing is believing?, then seeing the results on the demonstration plots makes seed choice - and the results of storing seed correctly - crystal clear. In Malawi, Wed Chipungu runs dozens of seed demonstration plots in his work with the Pannar Seed Company. As he tells Patrick Mphaka, he believes the benefits can be greatest if farmers are involved in managing the whole thing. IN:		?What we do, we do not manage the demo plots? OUT:		?So that is my advice. ? DUR?N:	 2 ? 26 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Wed Chipungu works with the Pannar Seed Company Limited in Malawi to promote demonstration field days. He was speaking to Patrick Mphaka. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Chipungu	What we do, we do not manage the demo plots, it is the local farmers themselves that manage the demos. So the people around that farm can learn from that farmer how to manage the crop and they can choose the variety which is doing better in that area. Mphaka	So in other words what you <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is not the seeds which we see but the way they can perform after we have planted them that will tell a good story? Chipungu	Yes a good story because on seed we cannot just say this is a good variety without showing a farmer how it performs. But farmers have to know, to see it performing himself not just telling him. That is why we do give some seed to local farmers in the villages to see how it performs themselves. Mphaka	Once you have given that seed to some farmers in the villages to what extent do you think other farmers who have not been given the seed can also learn from the farmer whom you have given the seed to demonstrate? Chipungu	What we do is we distribute some trial seeds in all districts of the country, then during a certain time of the year we conduct field days and we do invite local villages, farmers around that area to attend that field day. So on that day it is when the farmers see themselves, how the varieties are performing and we do ask them to choose which variety they think is better. We want to see the actual thing happening in the field. Mphaka	Taking what you do as a model, what tips would you give farmers? Chipungu	First of all I have to say that a seed is a living thing, they have bought that seed, they have to keep it properly so that it should not die because if they put it on a wet place or at a hot place it will die. So the first thing is to keep the seed safely. 	It is an advice to local farmers, they must not buy seed from, I can say vendors. When I am saying vendors I mean there is no way somebody can just carry seed in a vehicle and start selling like bread. You can buy seed from authorised dealers because if you just buy seed from elsewhere you will regret after a year it is not seed. Mphaka	It might have expired? Chipungu	Expired. Mphaka	Or they might have picked it from a rubbish bin somewhere? Chipungu	Yes that is what people are doing. So that is my advice.
