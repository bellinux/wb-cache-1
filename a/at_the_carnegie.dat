5|$|In 1963, Rubin began {{a year-long}} {{collaboration}} with Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge, during {{which made her}} first observations of the rotation of galaxies at the McDonald Observatory's 82 inch telescope. During her work <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Carnegie</b> Institute, Rubin applied to observe at the Palomar Observatory in 1965, {{despite the fact that}} the building did not have facilities for women. She created her own women's restroom, sidestepping the lack of facilities available for her and becoming the first female astronomer to observe there.|$|E

Knight sent the painting to an international exhibition held <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Carnegie</b> Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast painting Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, painting in a wood in the Lamorna Valley but then kept the painting unfinished in her studio until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{with the}} fission of uranium were already {{proceeding}} at universities and research institutes in the United States. Alfred Lee Loomis was supporting Ernest Lawrence at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Vannevar Bush was also doing similar research <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Carnegie</b> Institution. At Columbia, while Fermi and Szilard investigated {{the possibility of}} creating a nuclear chain reaction, Dunning considered the possibility, advanced by Niels Bohr and John A. Wheeler but discounted by Fermi, {{that it was the}} rare uranium-235 isotope of uranium that was primarily responsible for fission. He had Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota prepare samples of uranium enriched in uranium-234, uranium-235 and uranium-238 using a mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Carnegie</b> Institution, Rubin {{began work}} {{related to her}} {{controversial}} thesis regarding galaxy clusters with Ford, making hundreds of observations using Ford's image-tube spectrograph. This instrument allowed Rubin to amplify starlight seen through the telescope so they could view astronomical objects that were previously too dim to see. The Rubin–Ford effect, an apparent anisotropy in {{the expansion of the}} Universe on the scale of 100 million light years, was discovered through studies of spiral galaxies, particularly the Andromeda Galaxy, chosen for its brightness and proximity to Earth. First appearing in journals in 1976, the idea of peculiar motion on this scale in the universe was a highly controversial proposition, dismissed by leading astronomers but ultimately shown to be valid. The effect is now known as large scale streaming. The pair also briefly studied quasars, which had been discovered in 1963 and were a popular topic of research.|$|E

5|$|Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Chairman Gordon Dean {{appointed}} Libby to its influential General Advisory Committee (GAC) in 1950. In 1954, he {{was appointed}} an AEC commissioner by President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{on the recommendation of}} Dean's successor, Lewis Strauss. Libby and his family moved from Chicago to Washington, D.C. He brought with him a truckload of scientific equipment, which he used to establish a laboratory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Carnegie</b> Institution there to continue his studies of amino acids. Staunchly conservative politically, {{he was one of the}} few scientists who sided with Edward Teller rather than Robert Oppenheimer during the debate on whether it was wise to pursue a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb. As a commissioner, Libby played an important role in promoting Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program, and was part of the United States delegation at the Geneva Conferences on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955 and 1958.|$|E
5|$|Creutz {{became a}} professor, {{the head of}} the Physics Department, and the head of Nuclear Research Center <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Carnegie</b> Institute of Technology in 1948. He was {{also a member of the}} Executive Board at the Argonne National Laboratory from 1946 to 1958, and a {{consultant}} at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory from 1946 to 1958. In addition to his work on nuclear physics, he cultivated flowers and orchids at his home. He published eight papers on floral species, and named three varieties of violets after his children. One 1966 paper, published in the New York Botanical Garden Journal was on Apetahia raiateensis, a rare flower found only on the island of Raiatea in French Polynesia. He travelled to Polynesia many times, and translated Grammar of the Tahitian language from French into English. His family served as hosts for a time to two young people from Tahiti and Samoa.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a team <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Carnegie</b> Institute of Washington {{reported}} the most precise {{measurement of the}} isotopic signatures of lunar rocks. To their surprise, the team found that the rocks from the Apollo program carried an isotopic signature that was identical with rocks from Earth, and were different from almost all other bodies in the Solar System. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from the California Institute of Technology announced that there {{was less than a}} 1% chance that Theia and Earth had identical isotopic signatures. Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth, which conflicts with what is expected if the Moon formed far from Earth's orbit or from Theia. Variations on the giant impact hypothesis may explain this data.|$|E
