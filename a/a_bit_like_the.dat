500|$|Sanz {{was born}} in Madrid, Spain, on December 18, 1968, the {{youngest}} son of María Pizarro and Jesús Sánchez. He {{grew up in the}} neighborhood of Moratalaz in eastern Madrid. Sanz recalled that [...] "Back then, kids grew up on the street...I was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> group troubadour; the one who played the guitar and sang. That kept me out of a lot of trouble." [...] Sanz's father, a door-to-door book salesman, played guitar professionally, which inspired seven-year-old Sanz to learn to play the instrument. He pursued the instrument with an intensity that eventually frustrated his mother, who broke his guitar one morning after his playing kept the family from sleeping.|$|E
500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2it {{said the}} episode was [...] "pretty good" [...] and that Jenna Fischer was [...] "fantastic", {{but he felt}} the episode was less {{outright}} funny than recent episodes. But Porter also said he had mixed feelings about Pam's decision to work for Michael and about the Charles Miner character, who he said might be too humorless and uncomfortable for the show. Travis Fickett of IGN felt it was disappointing and slow-paced compared to last week's episode [...] "New Boss": [...] "Things slow down a bit as we sort of repeat the awkwardness between Michael and new regional manager Charles Miner. It feels <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> episode is marking time – {{which is exactly what}} Michael is doing with his final two weeks on the job." [...] "Two Weeks" [...] was voted the eighteenth highest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the episode was rated 7.74 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Fodor's called The Dime Store [...] "bright and hip", {{offering}} [...] "office {{workers and}} hotel guests a much-appreciated source of seasonally driven, well-prepared comfort fare". Cizmar wrote a positive {{review of the}} restaurant in August 2014, in which he paid tribute to Leo's and described his two $1 extras (an egg on his BLT and maple syrup for his pancakes) as [...] "the best two dollars [...] spent all week". That same month, Thrillist contributor Drew Tyson included the diner in his list of the [...] "11 Best New Restaurants in Portland", writing: Billing itself as a [...] "finer diner", this old-school space feels <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> diner in Twin Peaks. There's a magazine and candy counter in one corner that {{no one seems to}} touch; just quick enough service that once you start questioning whether or not you'll get another cup of coffee, one arrives; plus a menu full of classics. All-in-all it's one of the only places you can go in Downtown and feel like you're transported somewhere else entirely.|$|E
5000|$|Daryl Surrat of Otaku USA {{magazine}} {{refers to}} Part 4 as the [...] "grand unification of Lupin styles" [...] due to combining elements from several different eras of the franchise; [...] "a <b>bit</b> dangerous <b>like</b> <b>the</b> originals, <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> silly <b>like</b> <b>the</b> 1980s 'pink jacket' Lupin, <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bizarre <b>like</b> <b>The</b> Woman Called Fujiko Mine, <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> 'gentleman thief {{with a heart}} of gold' like Hayao Miyazaki's Cagliostro interpretation." ...|$|R

500|$|Growing up, Perry and her {{siblings}} {{were not allowed}} to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the term [...] "luck" [...] reminded their mother of Lucifer, and had to call deviled eggs [...] "angeled eggs". Perry primarily listened to gospel music, as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends. While not strictly identifying as religious, Perry has stated, [...] "I pray all the time– for self-control, for humility." [...] Following her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who suggested she take vocal lessons. She began training at age 9, and was incorporated into her parents' ministry, singing in church from ages 9 to 17. At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday, and publicly performed songs she wrote. She tried to [...] "be <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> typical Californian girl" [...] while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence. She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, Tom Shales for The Washington Post criticized Morrison as Will, writing: [...] "Morrison is {{definitely}} not gleeful and doesn't seem particularly well equipped to be a high-school impresario; as pipers go, he's not even marginally pied." [...] Shales was more positive regarding Lynch's performance, and concluded that: [...] "Dramatic tension isn't exactly plentiful, but pleasingly staged songs and a general aura of retro ingenuousness come through, and seem awfully if fitfully refreshing". Variety Brian Lowry also highlighted acting and characterization issues with the show, writing that: [...] "It's among the adults, alas – who are mostly over-the-top buffoons – where Glee nearly sails off the rails, from Jane Lynch's tyrannical cheer matron to the salivating football coach, <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Rydell High gang in Grease." [...] Lowry felt that: [...] "Modest redemption comes from the stammering Emma (Heroes Jayma Mays), who has a clear crush on Will, even though he's married to his high-school sweetheart. Perhaps to foster a rooting interest (or at least sympathy) for a Will-Emma pairing, said wife (Jessalyn Gilsig) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew." [...] Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times has called Glee: [...] "the first show {{in a long time}} that's just plain full-throttle, no-guilty-pleasure-rationalizations-necessary fun." [...] She praised Lynch as Sue, writing that [...] "Lynch alone makes Glee worth watching", and claimed that overall: [...] "The music, though by no means edgy, is energetic with a wide audience appeal, like the show itself.|$|E
500|$|Referred to as a [...] "genre roulette" [...] by the San Francisco Chronicle, Post {{touches on}} various musical styles, {{including}} industrial music, big-band jazz, trip hop, chillout, and experimental music. Jim Farber, reviewing the album in 1995 for Entertainment Weekly, considered Post to be a [...] "connecting point between industrial-disco, ambient-trance, and catchy synth pop". When asked if this variety of genres was intentional, Björk replied: [...] "Yes, I'm {{very aware of}} that. I've got very many sides to me. To be honest, I think everyone has got a thousand sides to them. It's called being human. Nature gave us that kinda complexity. Most people pretend they're only one thinglike : [...] "cool" [...] or [...] "intelligent" [...] or [...] "stupid" [...] or [...] "caring". But I think everyone are all of these things, including me". She recognises Post as darker and more aggressive than Debut, and has identified independence, strength, and instinct as its lyrical themes. In a 1997 interview, the singer said: [...] "Post... <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Tin Tin books. Sort of Tin Tin goes to Congo. Tin Tin goes to Tibet. So it's all these different flavors, me sort of trying all these different things on". The balance between synthetic and organic elements in the album—generated through the combination of electronic and [...] "real" [...] instruments—is a recurring characteristic of Björk's output. In 1999, Vibe stated: [...] "Fusing techno, industrial, ambient, punk, and the rarefied yet tuneful spheres of art rock, Björk explores a jungle of tones, supported by her eternally buoyant voice from Mars." ...|$|E

2500|$|A chance {{discussion}} with Diane Samuels {{in the back}} of a taxi one night led to collaboration between the two. Oberman had had difficulty deciding where to transpose Chekhov's narrative, with Samuels offering up the idea of Liverpool, her home town, and the two agreeing on the post-war time frame: [...] "Liverpudlians have their own black sense of humour and comic timing, born out of having their city blown to smithereens during the war". This informed the new Jewish sensibility of the play which was anchored to the tone of Chekhov's original, where the melodrama of the Pozorov family masked the pain and social upheaval all about them. Oberman felt this echoed the way the Jewish community in Britain acted in the wake of the Holocaust: [...] "people that close to the Second World War just didn’t talk about it – <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> elephant in the room". The intent of the play was [...] "to take a family who have the Holocaust hanging over them, and still have them laugh and moan and bicker while wondering what's for breakfast".|$|E
2500|$|Hotel Cabana is a pop, R, {{soul and}} hip hop music record, {{containing}} [...] "orchestral flourishes" [...] and [...] "Bollywood inflections". Naughty Boy called Hotel Cabana {{more than an}} album, it was an audio-visual concept. [...] "I {{want it to be}} an album for our time; it has a concept to it, so it's more like a film in some respects." [...] Speaking about putting together the album, he said [...] "I view it like I'm not just a producer – I'm a director too." [...] During an interview with the Watford Observer, Naughty Boy said [...] "It’s a very diverse, musically organic album. There’s a lot of dance-future music that’s going on now." [...] Explaining the [...] "hotel" [...] concept, he said [...] "the album is like a hotel, and just like guests coming to stay, musicians appear on the album. Each song does stand alone, but all together, the album tells a story, it’s one guy’s journey, <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> song [...] "Hotel California", it’s a twisted journey. You can visit, but you can never leave, you can listen to the album, but you won’t be able to stop.|$|E
2500|$|The first heart sound, or S1, {{forms the}} [...] "lub" [...] of [...] "lub-dub" [...] and is {{composed}} of components M1 (mitral valve closure) and T1 (tricuspid valve closure). Normally M1 precedes T1 slightly. It {{is caused by the}} [...] closure of the atrioventricular valves, i.e. tricuspid and mitral (bicuspid), at the beginning of ventricular contraction, or systole. When the ventricles begin to contract, so do the papillary muscles in each ventricle. The papillary muscles are attached to the cusps or leaflets of the tricuspid and mitral valves via chordae tendineae (heart strings). When the papillary muscles contract, the chordae tendineae become tense and thereby prevent the backflow of blood into the lower pressure environment of the atria. The chordae tendineae act <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> strings on a parachute, and allow the leaflets of the valve to balloon up into the atria slightly, but not so much as to evert the cusp edges and allow back flow of blood. It is the pressure created from ventricular contraction that closes the valve, not the papillary muscles themselves. The contraction of the ventricle begins just prior to AV valves closing and prior to the semilunar valves opening. The sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae and the squeezing of the ventricles against closed semilunar valves, sends blood rushing back toward the atria, and the parachute-like valves catch the rush of blood in their leaflets causing the valve to snap shut. The S1 sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal by the valves. The delay of T1 even more than normally causes the split S1 which is heard in a right bundle branch blockage.|$|E
