50|$|The <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1866 by British ornithologist Frederick Godman. It was formerly {{regarded as a}} subspecies of the Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), but was split off in 1993.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch</b> (Pyrrhula murina), {{also known}} as the São Miguel bullfinch, or locally in Portuguese as the Priolo, is an {{endangered}} passerine bird in the true finch family. It is endemic to São Miguel Island, in the Azores archipelago of Macaronesia in the North Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The highest {{elevation}} on São Miguel is the Pico da Vara at 1103 m.

50|$|Pico da Vara is {{the highest}} {{mountain}} {{on the island of}} São Miguel, in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores, and principal special protection of the Nature Reserve of Pico da Vara. The area around the mountain includes the largest remaining stand of the native laurisilva forest on the island, home to the critically endangered endemic <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The genus has a palearctic distribution. All species {{occur in}} Asia with two species {{exclusively}} in the Himalayas and one species, P. pyrrhula, also occurring in Europe. The <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch</b> (P. murina) is a critically endangered species (about 120 pairs remaining), occurring only in {{the east of the}} island of São Miguel in the Azores archipelago.|$|E
50|$|Fauna {{is these}} forests and shrublands include rare {{terrestrial}} birds, {{such as the}} <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch</b> (Pyrrhula murina), endemic to the Azores, whose refuge is confined primarily to the existent Laurissilva forests of Pico da Vara. This rare bird is considered at risk for extinction. In addition to the bullfinch the zone is habitat for Common chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs moreletti), Common buzzard (Buteo buteo rothschild), Azores wood pigeon (Columba palumbuz azorica) and the São Miguel goldcrest (Regulus regulus azoricus), among others.|$|E
50|$|The Azores has two endemic bird species. The <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch,</b> or Priolo, is {{restricted}} to remnant laurisilva forest in the mountains at {{the eastern end of}} São Miguel and is classified by BirdLife International as endangered. Monteiro's storm-petrel, described to science as recently as 2008, is known to breed in just two locations in the islands, but may occur more widely. An extinct species of owl, the São Miguel scops owl, has also recently been described, which probably became extinct after human settlement due to habitat destruction and the introduction of alien species. The Azores also has an endemic bat, the Azores noctule, which is unusual in regularly feeding during the day.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. —Fern feeding {{ecology of}} the <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch</b> Pyrrhula murina: the {{selection}} of fern species {{and the influence of}} nutritional composition in fern choice. Aims: Ferns are an important component of many ecosystems and potentially provide an abundant food resource for consumers, but there are very few studies on the ecology of fern feeding by vertebrates. We describe the selection of sporangia and leaves among fern species by the <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch</b> (Pyrrhula mu-rina), and addressed the importance of nutritional composition in fern choice. Location: Serra da Tronqueira (37 º 47 ’N, 25 º 13 ’W), a mountainous district on the east of São Miguel Island, Azores. Methods: We established transects throughout the range of the <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch</b> to record: i) the abun-dance of sporangia (= number of fertile leaves), and of each leaf phenological stage (crozier, expanding leaves and recently expanded leaves) for each fern species, and ii) fern consumption, as the number of leaves with beak marks (fern stripping) for each fern species. The composition of both mature sporangia and young fern leaves (lipids, proteins, phenolics and caloric content) was compared between consumed and non-consumed fern species. Results: In winter and early spring the <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch</b> foraged on sporangia of Woodwardia radi...|$|E
40|$|The {{invasive}} Clethra arborea has a dual-role in {{the diet}} of the <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch,</b> a critically endangered bird species endemic to the island of São Miguel (Azores, Portugal). This is a crucial winter food resource but it lowers the availability of native laurel forest species that compose most of the bird's diet throughout the year. The removal of this and other invasive alien species is part of current laurel forest habitat restoration programmes, disregarding {{the impact on the}} <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch</b> population. In order to evaluate the first responses of the <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch</b> to habitat restoration, we studied bird diet, foraging behaviour, food availability and habitat occupancy in managed (without C. arborea) and control areas. Significant increases in the availability of native food resources in managed areas were noticeable {{in the diet}}, particularly the intake of Ilex perado ssp. azorica and Prunus lusitanica ssp. azorica flower buds. In most of the studied months birds heavily used and foraged in managed over control areas. The one exception was in December, when a resource-gap occurred in managed areas, which may be overcome in the short-term due to re-establishment of native plants following removal of invasive aliens. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.

Its status was uplisted to Critically Endangered in 2005 on the basis of an extremely small and declining population that was considered to be restricted to a very small mountain range (43 km 2), in a single location, within which the spread of invasive plants constituted a threat to habitat quality. Nevertheless, information was mostly inferred, or the product of, non-systematic studies. In order to carry out a complete assessment of the conservation status we analysed: (i) population trend, calculated from annual monitoring 1991 – 2008, (ii) population size, and (iii) range size, obtaining estimates in a single morning study in 2008 involving the simultaneous participation of 48 observers. Contrary to previous inferences, the population is no longer decreasing, although quality of laurel forest habitat continues to decline due to the persistent threat of invasive species. Population size (mean ± SE) was estimated at 1, 064 ± 304 individuals using distance sampling methods, although the estimate was very sensitive to the survey method used. Range size estimates (extent of occurrence and area of occupancy) were 144 km 2 and 83 km 2 respectively. Given the present information, we propose the downlisting of <b>Azores</b> <b>Bullfinch</b> to Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The annual {{cycle of}} the <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch</b> or PriBlo, Pyrrhula murina, is described. This bird breeds from June to August, when food {{abundance}} is high, and starts moulting in September. Seasonal variations in body weight and fat scores were small. The annual mortality is probably less than 60 %. The median monthly group size was always one or two. Overall, it presents a strong seasonal pattern {{similar to that of}} western European Pyrrhula, but with slight variations.

40|$|International audienceThis paper reports {{analyses}} of a capture–mark–recapture (CMR) dataset of 149 Azores Bullfinches ringed on São Miguel island (Azores) between 2005 and 2007, and recaptured–resighted {{on a monthly}} basis over a 4 -year period (2005 – 2008) throughout their breeding range. We examined the effect of time, age (adults vs. juveniles), gender (adult males and females), and environmental covariates (temperature, rainfall, NAO index) on survival probabilities. The modelling found a high and constant monthly survival probability (mean ± SE) estimated at 0. 96  ±  0. 01, similar between both adults and juveniles and independent of environmental conditions and gender. These findings agree with expectations from island-based life-history theory where relatively mild conditions and lack of predators should favour high survival rates to compensate for the low reproductive output. The annual survival rate was estimated at 0. 62, which was also consistent with this pattern when compared with survival estimates of mainland bullfinch and passerine species on other subtropical islands obtained in similar CMR studies. Based on a canonical estimator, the size of the studied population (mean ± SE) was estimated at 1608  ±  326 individuals. Given that the population size was only around 120 – 400 individuals in the early 1990 s, we suggest that the high survival probabilities currently applying to this critically endangered species may have substantially contributed to the recent recovery of this population. Future research studies on the species' demography should continue to monitor survival in order to measure the effect of management interventions currently taking place within the range of the <b>Azores</b> <b>Bullfinch,</b> including the restoration of the biodiversity rich laurel forest, but also focusing on nest success, which is important for understanding population dynamics...|$|E
40|$|I {{studied the}} {{seasonal}} variation in habitat selection, diet, food supply and food {{selection of the}} Priolo or <b>Azores</b> <b>bullfinch,</b> Pyrrhula murina. This species and its associated habitat, the Azorean native cloud forest, are poorly known and are threatened by afforestation and the invasion of exotic flora. In addition detailed studies of these aspects are lacking for oceanic island birds. Throughout this study a comparison between {{the ecology of the}} Priolo and that of mainland Bullfinches is made. The primary aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the importance of three alternative hypotheses in explaining the present distribution and abundance of this bird: habitat structure and composition, food availability and food preference, and (2) propose management strategies. Point-counts and capture-recapture indicate a population of 60 to 200 pairs. The bird breeds from mid-June to late August. Annual mortality was in the order of 45 - 50 %. Stations were marked every 200 m along tracks covering all vegetation types in the area. These were walked three times a month to record presence or absence of birds per habitat type. The habitat structure and vegetation composition were recorded at these stations and used to explain the number of times a bird was detected at stations using logistic modelling. Diet was assessed from observations of feeding birds and faecal analysis. Food supply was examined from quadrats placed systematically within foraging habitats and from marked plots of winter food stocks. Food preferences were examined by comparing (a) availability and usage of foods in the field, (b) selected and rejected food items and (c) using food choice trials with captive birds. TTie importance of seed phenolics in explaining patterns of preferences for species and individual trees in winter was examined. The distribution of the Priolo was highly associated with native vegetation and its margins all year round. Other habitats were of marginal importance. The precision of habitat selectivity increased in the following direction: summer The diet ranged from invertebrates and herbaceous seeds in summer, to seeds of fleshy fruits in autumn, fern sporangia and tree seeds (of Clethra arborea) in winter and, flower buds, fern fronds and moss tips in spring. Introduced species were very important in the diet but in August/September and in April native species were significantly more important. In April, birds were highly dependent on flower buds of Ilex perado. At this time, the abundance of seeds and sporangia was at its lowest. An experiment with enclosures showed that the Priolo foraging pressure significantly reduced the number of flower buds. Food preferences changed throughout the year and seemed a complex function of availability, size, palatability and accessibility of foods. Seeds of fleshy fruits were preferred to those of C. arborea. Seeds of C. arborea were ignored when flower buds reached a length of 2. 8 - 3. 0 mm. In autumn, C. arborea was preferred to sporangia of large ferns, but in spring the birds showed the opposite behaviour. Priolos also showed preference for larger items of most winter foods. Phenolic compounds did not explain C. arborea tree preference nor why birds switched from seeds to flower buds in spring. Within a small resource spectrum birds should be less discriminating and energy {{may be the most important}} factor in food selection. Overall, the data suggested that a food supply hypothesis was better in explaining patterns of Priolo distribution and abundance than a habitat structure hypothesis but food preference is important for a full understanding of this question. A shortage of preferred foods may occur in late winter. Other available foods may be inadequate. Some implications for the limitation of this population are discussed. The Priolo needs the several mosaics of the native forest to complete its annual cycle. Nowadays, the mature forest mosaic seems to be the least abundant. In terms of conservation it is necessary to control the expansion of exotic plants and, restore and enlarge the area of native forest. It seems especially important to increase the population of flower-bud producing species. </p...|$|E
