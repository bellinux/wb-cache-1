The speech recognition system {{is based on}} Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which involves complex mathematical operations such as probability estimation and Viterbi decoding. This computational nature makes it power hungry and realtime recognition is not achieved by porting software solutions on embedded device. Our system architecture has a low power embedded processor and dedicated <b>ASIC</b> <b>units</b> for complex computations. These units operate at a low frequency of 50 MHz thus consuming low power. The system uses RAM for the intermediate values and flash memory to store acoustic and language models for speech recognition. I...|$|R

This thesis addresses an FPGA platform {{that can be applied}} in the development of next generation target debugger system. This FPGA platform can also be used for prototyping and verification acceleration of Ericsson ASIC IP:s. Micro Ericsson ASIC (μ-EA) system is implemented in Xilinx Virtex- 6 FPGA board with the SERDES port that can be tested at 1. 25 / 2. 5 Gbps. This design costs 62 % of FPGA device resources at a frequency of 2. 5 MHz. The access of Trace Buffer, MEMORY and DSP inside μ-EA proves achievable as well. Moreover, DSP core inside μ-EA is capable of running software and sending out trace messages to debug block, using DebugTool through a Nexus trace probe.

40|$|Multithreaded node {{architectures}} {{have been}} proposed for future multiprocessor systems. However, some open issues remain: can efficient multithreading support be provided in a multiprocessor machine such that {{it is capable of}} tolerating synchronization and communication latencies, with little intrusion on the performance of sequentially-executed code? Also, how much (quantitatively) does such non-intrusive multithreading support contribute to the scalable parallel performance in the presence of increasing interprocessor communication and synchronization demands? In this paper, we describe the design of EARTH (Efficient Architecture for Running THreads), which attempts to address the above issues. Each processor in EARTH has an off-the-shelf RISC processor for executing threads, and an <b>ASIC</b> Synchronization <b>Unit</b> (SU) supporting dataflowlike thread synchronizations, scheduling, and remote memory requests. In preparation for an implementation of the SU, we have emulated a basic EARTH model [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Current {{state-of-the-art}} {{mass market}} receivers {{are based on}} a chipset or single-chip receiver [19]. The chipset or single-chip receiver is usually implemented as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). ASICs have high Nonrecurring Engineering (NRE) costs, but when produced in high volumes they have very low price per <b>unit.</b> <b>ASICs</b> can also be optimized for small size and to have small power consumption. Both of these features are desired in handheld, battery operated devices. On the other hand, ASICs are fixed solutions and impossible to reconfigure. Modifications in design are also very expensive to realize with ASIC technology.|$|R
50|$|Where {{previous}} POWER processors use the GX++ bus {{for external}} communication, POWER8 removes {{this from the}} design and replaces it with the CAPI port (Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface) that is layered on top of PCI Express 3.0. The CAPI port is used to connect auxiliary specialized processors such as GPUs, <b>ASICs</b> and FPGAs. <b>Units</b> attached to the CAPI bus can use the same memory address space as the CPU, thereby reducing the computing path length. At the 2013 ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference, IBM and Nvidia announced an engineering partnership to closely couple POWER8 with Nvidia GPUs in future HPC systems, with the first of them announced as the Power Systems S824L.|$|R
40|$|We {{have built}} a {{compiler}} that generates code for horizontal-instruction-word, application-specific signal processors. The designer of such an applicationspecific processor tunes the architecture using as feedback the compiled signal-processing code. Accordingly, the compiler is user-retargetable and designed for use with a plastic, irregular style of architecture. 1 Introduction Designers now {{have the option of}} implementing digital signal processing, control, and other dedicated systems as application-specific integrated circuits (<b>ASIC's)</b> to reduce <b>unit</b> cost. Moreover, to reduce design cost, ASIC's may incorporate programmable processors if the required sample rate is not too high. The architecture of such an application-specific processor can be tuned for the program that it will run. An application-specific processor should be just fast enough for the application, as small as possible, and tunable.

40|$|The Core <b>Unit</b> <b>ASIC</b> Technology & System on Silicon at Ericsson Micro Wave Systems has {{a project}} on STM- 1 / SDH {{communication}} over a microwave link called Mini Link. They {{want to have}} a power effective Reed-Solomon encoder to correct bit errors. In this master’s thesis three different algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes are implemented in hardware using VHDL and then compared by power consumption. The Reed-Solomon code implemented is an RS (255, 239) that handles errors but not erasures. The different algorithms used are Berlekamp-Massey, Gröbner basis by Fitzpatrick and Welch-Berlekamp. They are implemented in VHDL and first compared by the size after being synthesized, then compared by power dissipation estimated for non, four and eight errors per block with Watt Watcher from Sequence. The Berlekamp-Masey had the lowest power dissipation for all error rates and the smallest size. However, no real winner could be selected among the algorithms since the differences in size and power dissipation where so small. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Standard Cell ASICs {{are well}} known in the IC {{industry}} and have been successfully used over the past decade. During recent years there is a significant reduction of traditional ASIC design according to Gartner/Dataquest. (About 1 / 3 rd the number of ASIC designs today compared to 3 or more years ago – See Figure 1) Trying to obey Moore’s law and the fact that mask costs passing $ 1 M, design cycles expanding past a year and reliability issues arising from VDSM physical effects, it’s now require a massive production run to justify cell based ASIC. Yet, the demand for custom ASIC performance still remains {{for a wide variety of}} applications. In some cases, FPGA’s are successfully replacing ASIC’s despite their high unit costs, limited performance, high power consumption and power dissipation. Systems manufacturers may still achieve cost reduction in case the product is successful but this can be done in a later stage. The high cost of the development, masks, and tools can justify the production of very high-volume cell-based ASICs only. For mid-volume ASIC designs, the costs are simply becoming out of reach. The industry had to come with an effective and affordable solution. A different concept that will provide custom ASIC’s performance yet, with a short design cycle and low cost manufacturing. A new direction was taken, Structured ASICs. Structured ASICs offer a cost-effective solution for the mid-volume ASIC design with 75 % less development costs than cell-based <b>ASICs</b> and <b>unit</b> costs up-to 90 % less than complex FPGAs. (See Figure # 2) In this article I will present a new design paradigm that has come of age, the structured ASIC...|$|R

To achieve high efficiency of data-intensive computing, studies of heterogeneous accelerators which focus on latest applications, have become a hot issue in computer architecture domain. At present, the implementation of heterogeneous accelerators mainly relies on heterogeneous computing units such as Application-specific Integrated Circuit (<b>ASIC),</b> Graphics Processing <b>Unit</b> (GPU), and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Among the typical heterogeneous architectures above, FPGA-based reconfigurable accelerators have two merits as follows: First, FPGA architecture contains {{a large number of}} reconfigurable circuits, which satisfy requirements of high performance and low power consumption when specific applications are running. Second, the reconfigurable architectures of employing FPGA performs prototype systems rapidly and features excellent customizability and reconfigurability.

40|$|Distributed {{processing}} is a {{fast growing}} {{area of interest}} due to the exploding popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technologies. IoT is a distributed processing structure by nature, while UAVs evolve from single-UAV applications towards multiple-UAV (teams). The demand for processing capabilities is expanding as well. The general purpose processors (e. g. CPUs) {{can be used for}} any type of application, however this flexibility is at the cost of operational efficiency. Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are designed for certain types of application and have great operational efficiency, but they rarely can be used for other applications. The reconfigurable chips – Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide high operational efficiency along with the application flexibility – as they can be reprogrammed with the functionality that is required at the given time. All the above listed aspects are combined in the distributed processing system that is expected to consume low amount of electrical energy. This dissertation proposes a comprehensive solution for the problem of distributed processing equipped with reconfigurable units. The complete and detailed architecture is provided for each element. The design includes operational algorithms that together with the architecture constitute a complete solution for the stated problem. The design of the units is flexible and allows any number and combination of CPUs, <b>ASICs</b> or FPGAs. <b>Units</b> in the proposed design are autonomous – the decisions are taken by individual units, instead of the central node, which is marginalized. The decentralized and autonomous approach provides more flexible and reliable design that is especially important for IoT and teamed UAV applications. The efficiency of the proposed solutions is defined as electrical energy consumption and operation timespan, and is measured using dedicated experimentation system through numerous simulations...|$|R
