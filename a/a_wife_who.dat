5|$|Sabrina Bicknell (1757 – 8 September 1843), {{better known}} as Sabrina Sidney, was a British {{foundling}} girl taken in when she was 12 by author Thomas Day, who wanted to mould her into his perfect wife. Day had been struggling to find <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> would share his ideology and had been rejected by several women. Inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's book Emile, or On Education, he decided to educate two girls without any frivolities, using his own concepts.|$|E
25|$|Of his {{personal}} life, little is known. In the Institutio Oratoria, he mentions <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> died young, {{as well as}} two sons who predeceased him.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the myth}} of the goddess Sati is that of <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> dies by her own {{volition}} on a fire, this is not a case of the practice of sati. The goddess was not widowed, and the myth is quite unconnected with the justifications for the practice.|$|E

25|$|It {{appears that}} {{by the summer of}} 1724, the {{marquise}} de Prie, and possibly also Monsieur le Duc, were considering breaking Louis XV's engagement with the infanta, despite the great offence this would cause Spain, and finding him <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> might provide the country with an heir at an earlier date.|$|E
25|$|Appositional {{compounds}} {{are normally}} written in two words, e.g. ’a footballer wife’ (<b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> plays football) is expressed as futballista feleség. However, {{if there is}} a possessive relationship between the words, i.e. if the wife of a footballer is meant, it is considered a (regular) compound, thus it should be written as one word: futballistafeleség. There are several appositional compounds though, which are written as one word, especially where the first element specifies the type of the second (e.g. diáklány ’student girl’).|$|E
25|$|Similarly, The Queen v Epifania Suluape (2002) NZCA 6, {{deals with}} <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> pleaded {{provocation}} after she killed her husband with an axe when {{he proposed to}} leave her for another woman. There was some evidence of neglect, humiliation, and abuse but the court concluded that this was exaggerated. On appeal, the court was very conscious of the Samoan culture in New Zealand in restricting {{the power of the}} wife to act independently of her husband and reduced her sentence for manslaughter to five years.|$|E

25|$|Adultery was punished {{with the}} death of both parties by drowning; but if the husband was willing to pardon his wife, the king might {{intervene}} to pardon the paramour. For incest between mother and son, both were burned to death; with a stepmother, the man was disinherited; with a daughter, the man was exiled; with a daughter-in-law, he was drowned; with a son's fiancée, he was fined. <b>A</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> for her lover's sake procured her husband's death was gibbeted. A betrothed girl seduced by her prospective father-in-law took her dowry and returned to her family and was free to marry as she chose.|$|E
25|$|Cosimo {{was searching}} for <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> could help {{strengthen}} his political position and had initially asked to marry Margaret of Austria, the widow of Duke Alessandro de’ Medici, who displayed enormous reluctance at the idea (thus serving her father’s own interest and plans for her). The Emperor, not wanting to antagonize Cosimo, offered {{him one of the}} daughters of the rich viceroy of Naples. The viceroy agreed, provided Cosimo settled a large amount of money on her as dowry. This marriage was politically beneficial as the Medici were new to their ducal status. Additionally, Eleanor's royal Castilian ancestors and relations with the Habsburgs provided the Medici with the blue blood they had hitherto lacked and began the process of placing them on a footing with other European sovereigns. Through her father, Eleanor also provided the Medici with a powerful link to Spain, at that time ultimately in control of Florence, so that the marriage offered Cosimo I the opportunity to show sufficient loyalty to and trust in Spain that Spanish troops could be withdrawn from the province.|$|E
25|$|Su Wu (140 - 60 BC) {{was held}} captive for 19 years, {{returning}} to China in 81 BC: 4 poems {{collected in the}} Wen Xuan are only questionably attributed to him. However, at the time, it was not uncustomary to confuse the persona of a poem with {{the person of the}} author. There is a story about Su Wu which became a common allusion in Chinese poetry. According to this story, during the beginning of his captivity in the Xiongnu empire Su Wu was treated harshly, to the point it is said of having to eat the lining of his coat for food and to drink snow which he melted for water. Later Su was elevated in status, even it is said given <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> bore him children. Upon the Han emperor sending an ambassadorial mission toward the territory in which he was being held, the Xiongnu ruler (the chanyu) wished to conceal the presence of Su Wu, presumably in order avoid diplomatic complications; but, Su Wu hearing of this tricked the chanyu by claiming that he had sent a message to the emperor by tying it to the leg of a goose, and accordingly, that since his presence was already known to the Chinese delegation that any attempts at concealing his presence would be viewed as unseemly. This is {{at least part of the}} origin of the use of the image of a flying goose as a messenger, carrying tied to its foot (perhaps symbolically) a letter between two people separated so far seasonally north and south that a migrating goose could be conceived as a possible mode of communication.|$|E

500|$|Torn {{between the}} choice of <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> would appear {{beautiful}} to him but hideous to all his friends, or hideous to him but beautiful to all his friends, he could not reach a decision but instead said to her [...] "into you owne hands and choyse I give the full power and soveraignty to make election of which you best please."

500|$|Day {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that he would not be able to find <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> would meet his high standards and largely blamed women's education for this. Inspired by the character of Sophie in Rousseau's Emile, he resolved to [...] "create" [...] his ideal wife by raising her from adolescence, using the techniques laid out in the book. Day was approaching financial independence, when he would have full access to the money left to him, and conspired with his barrister friend, John Bicknell, to find two girls who could be taken into his care to be groomed as a perfect wife.|$|E

500|$|Many {{critics of}} the time and since have {{declared}} it Cagney's best film, drawing parallels between Cohan and Cagney; they both began their careers in vaudeville, struggled for years before reaching the peak of their profession, were surrounded with family and married early, and both had <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> was happy to sit back while he went on to stardom. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that in this business, you're {{only as good as the}} other fellow thinks you are. It's nice to know that you people thought I did a good job. And don't forget that it was a good part, too." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{his presidential}} term ended on December 9, 1844, Houston turned his {{attention}} to the Raven Hill plantation he had acquired that year northwest of Grand Cane and east of Huntsville. Margaret's slave Joshua was put in charge of the carpentry to build her a new house. [...] Nancy, Margaret and sister Antoinette devoted their time to activities in Grand Cane's Concord Baptist Church, of which they were founding members. She continued to be <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> was happiest when she and her husband stayed close to home. Although she accompanied him to President Andrew Jackson's Tennessee funeral in the summer of 1845, she did not attend fetes held in her husband's honor by his old friends and supporters. During the latter part of the year, Antoinette's husband William died, followed a few months later by the death of Vernal's wife Mary. Prior to her death, she had elicited a promise from Margaret to assume the trusteeship of Virginia Thorne.|$|E
500|$|Taum {{indicates}} that Belenggu presents modernity and traditionalism as a binary system, contrasting the new with the old. For example, Sukartono, a doctor (a position considered {{a symbol of}} modernity), is obsessed with the past, including his schoolmate Rohayah, and prefers traditional kroncong music over modern genres. Through the contrast of Sukartono and his ultra-modern, emancipatory wife Sumartini, Pane emphasises that modernity does not necessarily bring happiness. Aveling agrees, writing that the conflict arises over Tini's refusal to [...] "mother" [...] her husband as expected from a traditional wife. According to Taum, Tono wishes for Tini to perform traditional duties, such as removing his shoes. However, Tini, refuses {{to do so and}} instead keeps herself busy with social activities. This need for <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> behaves as he wishes ultimately becomes a factor in his falling for Yah, who does everything expected from a traditional wife. However, in the end neither modern nor traditional values alone are enough to guarantee happiness.|$|E

500|$|Returning to cinema as a {{freelance}} actress, Lansbury found herself typecast as women older (sometimes far older) than herself in many films in which she appeared during this period. As she later stated, [...] "Hollywood made me old before my time", noting that in her twenties she was receiving fan mail from people who believed her {{to be in her}} forties. She obtained minor roles in such films as A Life at Stake (1954), A Lawless Street (1955) and The Purple Mask (1955), later describing the last as [...] "the worst movie I ever made." [...] She played Princess Gwendolyn in the comedy film The Court Jester (1956), before taking on the role of <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> kills her husband in Please Murder Me (1956). From there she appeared as Minnie Littlejohn in The Long Hot Summer (1958), and as Mabel Claremont in The Reluctant Debutante (1958), which she filmed in Paris. Biographer Martin Gottfried claimed that it was these latter two cinematic appearances which restored Lansbury's status as an [...] "A-picture actress." [...] Throughout this period, she continued making appearances on television, starring in episodes of Revlon Mirror Theatre, Ford Theatre and The George Gobel Show, and became a regular on game show Pantomime Quiz.|$|E
500|$|By {{choosing}} a market as the {{location for the}} sale, the couple ensured a large audience, which made their separation a widely witnessed fact. The use of the halter was symbolic; after the sale, it was handed to the purchaser as a signal that the transaction was concluded, and in some instances, those involved would often attempt further to legitimate the sale by forcing the winning bidder to sign a contract, recognising that the seller had no further liability for his wife. In 1735, a successful wife sale in St Clements was announced by the common cryer, who wandered the streets ensuring that local traders {{were aware of the}} former husband's intention not to honour [...] "any debts she should contract". The same point was made in an advertisement placed in the Ipswich Journal in 1789: [...] "no person or persons to intrust her with my name... for she is no longer my right". Those involved in such sales sometimes attempted to legalise the transaction, as demonstrated by a bill of sale for a wife, preserved in the British Museum. The bill is contained in a petition presented to a Somerset Justice of the Peace in 1758, by <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> about 18months earlier had been sold by her husband for £6 6s [...] "for the support of his extravagancy". The petition does not object to the sale, but complains that the husband returned three months later to demand more money from his wife and her new [...] "husband".|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the musical}} sequence, Mulan {{is taken to}} various shops and stores in the village, in which several women take turns {{painstakingly}} bathing, dressing and applying makeup to the character, one of whom compares her to a [...] "sow's ear". Mulan tries her best to remain calm and demure throughout the entire process while learning about the requirements for being a girl who honors her family, as her mother and grandmother give her a make over. The women advise Mulan that she will successfully find a husband by focusing on her physical appearance and striving to be an obedient housewife, instructing her that primping is a key ingredient in their [...] "recipe for instant bride" [...] and teaching her that marrying well {{is the only way}} for a girl to honor her family. The song also reinforces the idea that the best way for Mulan to impress her future in-laws is by serving them tea and eventually giving birth to a son, teaching Mulan that men want <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>who</b> is calm while boasting an attractive hairstyle and waistline. At times Mulan does resist her transformation, appearing to look uncomfortable in her own body. Salons Jenn Shreve described Mulan as [...] "clumsy in her woman's body, caught in that awkward limbo where the body belongs to an adult but the child inside hasn't quite caught up." [...] In an effort to make her granddaughter even more appealing, Grandmother Fa bestows traditional Chinese gifts upon her. The sequence also features a prayer from Mulan to her ancestors, during which she asks that they help her not disappoint them or herself.|$|E
