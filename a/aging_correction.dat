40|$|Defoliation {{is a key}} {{parameter}} {{of forest}} health and is associated with reduced productivity and tree mortality. Assessing the health of forests requires regular observations over large areas. Satellite remote sensing provides a cost-effective alternative to traditional ground-based assessment of forest health, but assessing defoliation can be difficult due to mixed pixels where vegetation cover is low or fragmented. In this study we apply a novel spectral unmixing technique, referred to as weighted Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (wMESMA), to Landsat 5 -TM and EO- 1 Hyperion data acquired over a Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.) plantation in southern Australia. This technique combines an iterative mixture analysis cycle allowing endmembers to vary on a per pixel basis (MESMA) and a weighting algorithm that prioritizes wavebands based on their robustness against endmember variability. Spectral mixture analysis provides {{an estimate of the}} physically interpretable canopy cover, which is not necessarily correlated with defoliation in mixed-aged plantations due to natural variation in canopy cover as stands age. There is considerable variability in the degree of defoliation as well as in stand age among sites and in this study we found that results were significantly improved by the inclusion of an <b>age</b> <b>correction</b> algorithm for both the multi-spectral (R 2 no <b>age</b> <b>correction</b> = 0. 55 vs R 2 <b>age</b> <b>correction</b> = 0. 73 for Landsat) and hyperspectral (R 2 no <b>age</b> <b>correction</b> = 0. 12 vs R 2 <b>age</b> <b>correction</b> = 0. 50 for Hyperion) image data.

40|$|In recent research, many {{univariate}} {{and multivariate}} approaches {{have been proposed}} to improve automatic classification of various dementia syndromes using imaging data. Some of these methods do not provide the possibility to integrate possible confounding variables like age into the statistical evaluation.

Here, we propose a simple method to control for possible effects of confounding variables such as age prior to statistical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data using support vector machine classification (SVM) or voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We compare SVM results for the classification of 80 AD patients and 79 healthy control subjects based on MRI data with and without prior <b>age</b> <b>correction.</b> Additionally, we compare VBM results for the comparison of three different groups of AD patients differing in age with the same group of control subjects obtained without including age as covariate, with age as covariate or with prior <b>age</b> <b>correction</b> using the proposed method.

Further, applying the proposed <b>age</b> <b>correction</b> substantially improved univariate detection of disease-related grey matter atrophy using VBM in AD patients differing in age from control subjects.

In this regard three cohorts were used to create two different datasets; a small dataset including 63 subjects based on the Alzheimer’s Research Trust (ART) cohort and a large dataset including 1074 subjects combining the AddNeuroMed (ANM) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. In the ART dataset, 34 regional cortical thickness measures and 21 volumetric measures from MRI in addition to 3 metabolite ratios from MRS, altogether 58 variables obtained for 28 AD and 35 CTL subjects. Three different K-OPLS models were created based on MRI and MRS measures and their combination. Combining the MRI and the MRS measures significantly improved the discriminant power resulting in a sensitivity of 96. 4 % and a specificity of 97. 1 %. In the combined dataset (ADNI and AddNeuroMed), the Freesurfer pipeline was utilized to extract 34 regional cortical thickness measures and 23 volumetric measures from MRI scans of 295 AD, 335 CTL and 444 MCI subjects. The classification of AD and CTL subjects using the K-OPLS model resulted in a high sensitivity of 85. 8 % and a specificity of 91. 3 %. Subsequently, the K-OPLS model was used to prospectively predict conversion from MCI to AD, according to the one year follow up diagnosis. As a result, 78. 3 % of the MCI converters were classified as AD-like and 57. 5 % of the MCI non-converters were classified as control-like. Furthermore, an <b>age</b> <b>correction</b> method was proposed to remove the effect of age as a confounding factor. The <b>age</b> <b>correction</b> method successfully removed the age-related changes of the data. Also, the <b>age</b> <b>correction</b> method slightly improved the performance regarding to classification and prediction. This resulted in that 82. 1 % of the MCI converters were correctly classified. All analyses were performed using 7 -fold cross validation.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Bone {{samples from}} the Greenland Viking colony {{provide us with a}} unique {{opportunity}} to test and use 14 C dat-ing of remains of humans who depended upon food of mixed marine and terrestrial origin. We investigated the skeletons of 27 Greenland Norse people excavated from churchyard burials from the late 10 th to the middle 15 th century. The stable car-bon isotopic composition (δ 13 C) of the bone collagen reveals that the diet of the Greenland Norse changed dramatically from predominantly terrestrial food at the time of Eric the Red around AD 1000 to predominantly marine food {{toward the end of the}} settlement period around AD 1450. We find that it is possible to 14 C-date these bones of mixed marine and terrestrial origin precisely when proper correction for the marine reservoir effect (the 14 C age difference between terrestrial and marine organ-isms) is taken into account. From the dietary information obtained via the δ 13 C values of the bones we have calculated indi-vidual reservoir <b>age</b> <b>corrections</b> for the measured 14 C ages of each skeleton. The reservoir <b>age</b> <b>corrections</b> were calibrated by comparing the 14 C dates of 3 highly marine skeletons with the 14 C dates of their terrestrial grave clothes. The calibrated ages of all 27 skeletons from different parts of the Norse settlement obtained by this method are found to be consistent with avail-able historical and archaeological chronology. The evidence for a change in subsistence from terrestrial to marine food is an important clue to the old puzzle of the disappearance of the Greenland Norse, obtained here for the first time by measurements on the remains of the people themselves instead of by more indirect methods like kitchen-midden analysis...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: With MEG and EEG {{the effect}} of {{perinatal}} dioxin load of 38 healthy 7 - to 12 -year-old children was studied to assess possible disturbances of visual development. METHODS: Latencies and amplitudes of the motion (N 2 with subcomponents) and oddball responses (N 200 and P 3 b) were analysed after <b>age</b> <b>correction.</b> RESULTS: With increasing load, latencies increased and the amplitudes of the oddball components tended to be reduced. The latency increase between the high- and low-loaded children was about 13 ms (P < 0. 004) and the oddball response showed an amplitude decrease of 12 % (P= 0. 009). CONCLUSIONS: It may be concluded that, during the end- 80 s/early- 90 s, exposure to background levels in industrialized regions seems to have resulted in small underdevelopment or damage to visual motion processing and visual cognition. SIGNIFICANCE: Since dioxin pollution by incinerators still exists in many regions in developi?g countries and also still, although at a smaller scale, in the industrialized world, perinatal loads of similar magnitude and possibly more as measured in this study may occur {{and as a consequence}} might affect the developing brai...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAccurate {{measurements}} of Solar Spectral Irradiance (SSI) are of primary importance {{for a better}} understanding of solar physics and of the impact of solar variability on climate (via Earth's atmospheric photochemistry). The acquisition of a top of atmosphere reference solar spectrum and of its temporal and spectral variability during the unusual solar cycle 24 is of prime interest for these studies. These measurements are performed since April 2008 with the SOLSPEC spectro-radiometer from the far ultraviolet to the infrared (166 nm to 3088 nm). This instrument, developed under a fruitful LATMOS/BIRA-IASB collaboration, is part of the Solar Monitoring Observatory (SOLAR) payload, externally mounted on the Columbus module of the International Space Station (ISS). The SOLAR mission, with its actual 8 years duration, will cover almost the entire solar cycle 24. We present here the in-flight operations and performances of the SOLSPEC instrument, including the engineering corrections, calibrations and improved know-how procedure for <b>aging</b> <b>corrections.</b> Accordingly, a SSI reference spectrum from the UV to the NIR will be presented, together with its UV variability, as measured by SOLAR/SOLSPEC. Uncertainties on these measurements and comparisons with other instruments will be briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Total of 3780 {{lactation}} {{records of}} Holstein Friesian cattle kept at a commercial farm (Dena Farm) in Egypt, {{during the period}} from 1988 to 1996 were used. Fixed effects of month and year of calving and age at calving as a regression and random effects of sire and cow within sire on 305 day milk yield were used. Least squares analysis of variance showed significant effects of month and year of calving, age at calving, sire and cow within sires. Including age at calving as a polynomial regression of the second degree in the model yielded significant regression coefficients. The partial linear and quadratic regression coefficients of age at calving on 305 day milk yield were 8. 49 ± 1. 76 kg/mo and - 0. 51 ± 0. 05 kg/mo 2, respectively. A set of multiplicative age factors was derived for 305 day milk yield for each season of calving and for all data by fitting a second degree polynomial for production on age. It is suggested {{that there should be a}} separate set of <b>age</b> <b>correction</b> factors for each season of calving and for each region...|$|R
40|$|We study {{integrated}} {{characteristics of}} ~ 14000 low-redshift (0 <z< 1) compact star-forming galaxies (SFGs) {{selected from the}} Data Release 12 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. It is found that emission of these galaxies is dominated by strong young bursts of star formation, implying that their luminosities experience rapid variations on a time scale of a few Myr. Reducing integrated characteristics of these galaxies to zero burst age {{would result in a}} considerably tighter and almost linear relation between stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). The same correction implies that the specific star formation rate (the ratio of SFR and stellar mass) is not dependent on the galaxy stellar mass. We conclude that the correction for rapid luminosity evolution {{must be taken into account}} in a similar way when comparing different samples of low- and high-redshift SFGs. If the bursting nature of star formation and young burst ages are characteristics of the galaxies selected at high redshifts, the <b>age</b> <b>correction</b> of observed SFRs derived from the Hbeta emission line or UV continua would modify the derived SFR densities in the early universe.

40|$|Determinants of {{exercise}} tolerance in adults with {{congenital heart disease}} Purpose: Grown Up patients with Congenital Heart disease (GUCH) have a lower exercise tolerance compared to normal controls, but data concerning the predictive factors {{of exercise}} tolerance are scarce. Therefore this study focuses on the determinants of peak oxygen uptake (peak VO 2) in adults with tetralogy of Fallot (TF), transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and {{coarctation of the aorta}} (COA). Methods: 205 GUCH (98 COA, 57 TF, 50 TGA) who underwent echocardiography at rest followed by an exercise test until exhaustion, and who filled in questionnaires about physical activity and quality of life, were included in the study. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to assess the determinants of peak VO 2. Following variables were included in the analysis: demographic data, pathology, <b>age</b> at <b>correction,</b> resting blood pressure, sports participation, SF- 36 data and smoking. In subanalysis per patient group, echocardiographic-Doppler data and surgical correction data were also included. Results: Peak VO 2 averaged 79. 8 ± 14. 8 % of predicted normal values in COA, 72. 4 ± 15. 1 % in TF, and 64. 4 ± 13. 8 % in TGA. Gender, age, BMI, pathology and MET-hours of sports per week could explain 61, 5 % of the variance in peak VO 2 in all patients. In TF, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), <b>age</b> at <b>correction</b> and perceived physical health were also related to peak VO 2. The variance of peak VO 2 in TGA was furthermore partly explained by perceived physical health, as well as the degree of right ventricular dilatation. Conclusions: In GUCH, exercise tolerance is affected by the underlying heart defect, decreases with age, is positively related to BMI and physical activity, and male patients have a higher exercise tolerance. A higher LVMI and younger <b>age</b> at <b>correction</b> positively influence peak VO 2 in TF. A decrease in right ventricular contractility in TGA negatively affects the exercise tolerance. status: publishe...|$|R
