By May, Folkestone Town Council had decided not to purchase Lympne and Silver City Airways again expressed an interest in purchasing the airport at <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price.</b> In November, it was announced that Air Kruise had been given permission to operate a scheduled service from Lympne and/or Ramsgate to Birmingham. The service was to be seasonal between April and September, with permission to run the service lasting until 1960. Air Kruise moved its operations to Ramsgate Airport in 1953.|$|E

25|$|It {{was from}} around 1770 that Arnold {{developed}} the portable precision timekeeper, {{almost from the}} point where John Harrison ended his work in this field. But, compared to Harrison's complicated and expensive watch, Arnold's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable. Importantly, the relatively simple and conventional design of his movement facilitated its production in quantity at <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price</b> whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment.|$|E

25|$|The Macintosh {{initially}} sold well, but follow-up {{sales were}} not strong {{due to its}} high price and limited range of software titles. The machine's fortunes changed {{with the introduction of}} the LaserWriter, the first PostScript laser printer to be sold at <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price,</b> and PageMaker, an early desktop publishing package. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market. The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} envisaged acquiring BAC's {{capital and}} merging it with Hawker Siddeley. The ownership of BAC would thus give the government a minority {{stake in the}} new company. Although BAC's parent companies were prepared to sell their shares for <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price,</b> the government proposal, in their view, undervalued the group. By August 1967, {{the success of the}} BAC 1–11 and defence sales to Saudi Arabia made the prospect of the parent companies selling their shares less likely. In December 1967, Anthony Wedgwood Benn, the Minister of Technology, while reiterating his desire to see a merged BAC and HSA, admitted it would not be possible.|$|E
25|$|These first {{loudspeakers}} used electromagnets, because large, powerful {{permanent magnets}} were generally not available at <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price.</b> The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by current through a second pair of {{connections to the}} driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a choke coil, filtering the power supply of the amplifier that the loudspeaker was connected to. AC ripple in the current was attenuated {{by the action of}} passing through the choke coil. However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum. In 1930 Jensen introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight Alnico magnets after World War II.|$|E

25|$|The first {{production}} Short 360 had its {{maiden flight}} on 19 August 1982 and entered service with Suburban Airlines (later merged with Allegheny Airlines/US Airways) in November 1982. Building on {{the strengths and}} reputation of its 330 antecedent, the 360s found a niche in regional airline use worldwide, being able to operate comfortably from 4,500ft (1,400 m) runways – opening up hundreds of airfields {{that would otherwise be}} inaccessible to airliners. With a cruise speed about 215mph (370km/h), at an altitude of 10,000ft (3,048 m), the unpressurized 360 was not the fastest turboprop in its market but it offered acceptable performance at <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price</b> combined with ease of service and maintainability. The PT6A turboprops are fully ICAO Stage 3 noise-compliant, making the 360 one of the quietest turboprop aircraft operating today. Production of the 360 ceased in 1991 after 165 deliveries. In 1998, approximately 110 360s were in service. In 2009 a retired Emerald Airlines 360 was bought by Kingsland Primary School in Stoke-on-Trent, for use as a mobile classroom.|$|E
25|$|A start {{was made}} in April on {{building}} the new depot at Carter Gate (Parliament Street), with accommodation for buses, trams and trolleybuses. Trams were given eight roads, all with pits, the capacity being 80 cars. A most complicated layout of track leading to the depot was put in at same time, the intention being to build a single line for one-way traffic inward to the Market Place along Lower Parliament Street and Hockley, via Victoria Street and South Parade, the outward route, also single line and one-way traffic via Long Row and Pelham Street to Hockley. Hockley was a narrow thoroughfare that had been widened towards its junction with Lower Parliament Street, but, owing to the Corporation being unable to obtain a property higher up the street at <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price,</b> the whole scheme was later abandoned, although not before much track and pointwork had been laid. The double turnout {{at the bottom of}} Hockley had been in position for approximately six months when it was removed together with the short length of track leading to it, no car ever having run over it. Lines built in connection with the depot were along Southwell Road, with a three-way junction at Manvers Street, another three-way junction at Lower Parliament Street, and then along Lower Parliament Street to within 30 yards of Pennyfoot Street. There were trailing points from both lines into Stanhope Street, where the depot entrances were. A single line ran along Stanhope Street, with trailing junctions both ways into Manvers Street.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to agriculture and land tenancy, Beverley received additional revenue from land sales in western Virginia. The easing of restrictive land laws by the Virginia colonial government {{allowed him to}} establish his own terms with settlers on his lands, and he initially sold parcels in the Shenandoah Valley.

On September 16 the Randolphs and Robinson transferred sole ownership of the tract to Beverley, who planned to survey and sell it; the tract, which became known as Beverley Manor, encouraged further settlement west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. He commissioned James Patton, a ship captain from Ulster, to recruit Irish and Scotch-Irish immigrants to purchase and settle his Augusta County land. On August 8, 1737, Beverley wrote to Patton, [...] "I should be very glad if you could import families enough to take the whole off from our hands at <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>price</b> and tho' the order mentions families from Pensilvania , yet families from Ireland will do as well".
