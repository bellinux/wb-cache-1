The design of Sil was also linked to a chupacabra sighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the Schwalbe class were {{designed}} for use in Germany's recently acquired overseas colonies. These newly conquered territories required warships to police them, and at the time, the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) possessed <b>a</b> <b>motley</b> collection of older sailing ships that were suitable only for training purposes.

The Schwalbe class was the first unprotected cruiser design built in Germany, and along with several other small warships, they permitted Caprivi to retire five old sailing frigates and modernized the German cruiser force.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch land {{forces were}} less {{amenable}} to the Prince's powers of persuasion, and neither was {{the civilian population}} in North Holland. If anything, {{the effect of the}} invasion was to unify the divided Republic against the invader. The Prince's arrogant proclamation, peremptorily ordering the Dutch people to rally to Orange, was also not calculated to convince the Dutch of the wisdom of a restoration of the Stadholderate. It was therefore not surprising that the call for an uprising by the old Stadtholder himself from Lingen met with indifference by the people. <b>A</b> <b>motley</b> band of Orangist émigrés at the Westervoortsche Bridge near Arnhem, was easily put to flight on September 4 by a small detachment of the Batavian National Guard, proving that the invaders had to do the work themselves. Other Orangist incursions in the eastern Netherlands and Friesland met with even less success. Nevertheless, the Uitvoerend Bewind of the Batavian Republic declared martial law and under these emergency measures an aristocratic partisan of the stadtholder, the freule (baroness) Judith Van Dorth tot Holthuizen was convicted of sedition and executed.|$|E
