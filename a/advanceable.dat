40|$|Primary visual coding can be {{characterized}} by the receptive field (RF) properties of single neurons. Subject {{of this paper is}} our search for a global,second coding step beyond the RF-concept that links related features in a visual scene. In recent models of visual coding, oscillatory activities have been proposed to constitute such linking signals. We tested the neurophysiological relevance of this hypothesis for the visual system. Single and multiple spikes as well as local field potentials were recorded simultaneously from several locations in the primary visual cortex (A 17 and A 18) using 7 or 19 individually <b>advanceable</b> fibermicroelectrodes (250 or 330 mgrm apart). Stimulusevoked (SE) -resonances of 35 â€“ 85 Hz were found in these three types of signals throughout the visual cortex when the primary coding channels were activated by their specific stimuli. Stimulus position, orientation, movement direction and velocity, ocularity and stationary flicker caused specific SE-resonances. Coherent SE-resonances were found at distant cortical positions when {{at least one of the}} primary coding properties was similar. Coherence was found 1) within a vertical cortex column, 2) between neighbouring hypercolumns, and 3) between two different cortical areas. We assume that the coherence of SE-resonances is mediated by recurrent excitatory intra- and inter-areal connections via phase locking between assemblies that represent the linking features of the actual visual scene. Visually related activities are, thus, transiently labelled by a temporal code that signalizes their momentary association...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{investigate}} the spatial and behavioral correlates of striatal neurons during displacement movements, the rostromedial dorsal striata (AP 1. 0 - 2. 2, ML 1. 5 - 2. 0) of five rats were surgically implanted with <b>advanceable</b> bundles of fine wire electrodes. After recovery, the rats were deprived {{of water and}} trained in a square-walled open field in a dark room. The behavioral task required alternating visits to water reservoirs {{in the center and}} in the four corners. A certain corner contained the first reward for each trial; after this reward, a cue card appeared in this corner {{for the rest of the}} trial. The firing rates of striatal units were compared as the rat moved between the center and the four corners of the arena. Analyses were made of 30 units. Eight of these had firing rates that significantly increased or decreased by 62 - 480 % while the rat was in one or more quadrants of the arena. Six of these manifested such firing rate changes only as the rat performed certain behavioral sequences in the quadrant. Three other units fired as the rat's head was in a certain orientation relative to the arena walls, in all parts of the arena. To determine the principal controlling cues and hence the frame of reference of spatial selectivity of these units, the arena, while the rat was still inside, was rotated in total darkness. The first water reward was then presented at the same position relative to the outside room as before the rotation. The cue card was then illuminated in this corner as a visual cue for the extra-arena reference frame. All 11 neurons demonstrated spatial selectivity that rotated with the arena; thus, this activity was in the frame of reference of the arena and was not controlled by the visual cue. Six other units fired at rates up to six times their resting discharge or stopped firing completely in synchrony with initiation or execution of displacement movements, and two of these were also location selective. Four other units were silent as the rat performed the task, but fired tonically following arena rotations or other interruptions of the session, independent of the rat's location or movements. Nine analyzed units had very low firing rates (< 1 impulse/sec) and showed no discernible changes in activity as the rat performed the task. These patterns of unit activity indicate that fundamental informational components required for navigation are coded in the striatum. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Four {{groups of}} federal {{programs}} target unemployed workers: income support, health care assistance, job search assistance, and training. Unemployed {{workers and their}} families may experience substantial income loss and, as a result, may qualify {{for a number of}} other federal programs that determine eligibility based on income (e. g., the Earned Income Tax Credit, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or Medicaid). This report presents information on federal programs targeted to unemployed workers specifically, but does not attempt to discuss means-tested programs. A variety of benefits may be available to unemployed workers to provide them with income support during a period of unemployment. When eligible workers lose their jobs, the Unemployment Compensation (UC) program may provide income support through the payment of UC benefits (often referred to as Unemployment Insurance, or UI, benefits). Certain groups of workers who lose their jobs on account of international competition may qualify for additional or supplemental income support through Trade Adjustment Act (TAA) programs. If an unemployed worker is not eligible to receive UC benefits and the workerâ€™s unemployment may be directly attributed to a declared major disaster, a worker may be eligible to receive Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) benefits. Two federal laws may aid unemployed workers in the purchase of health insurance. The first, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), allows unemployed workers in certain circumstances to purchase continued health insurance coverage. The second, the Health Care Tax Credit (HCTC), allows certain TAA and Alternative TAA (for older workers) participants to receive an <b>advanceable</b> and refundable tax credit for purchasing health insurance. Federal support for Americans seeking assistance to obtain, retain, or change employment is undertaken by a national system of local One-Stop Career Centers (One-Stops) that were established by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA, P. L. 105 - 220). A variety of services and partner programs â€” notably including UC and TAA â€” are located within or linked to One-Stops, which primarily provide job search assistance, career counseling, labor market information, and other employment services. Core labor exchange services (matching job seekers and employers) are provided by the U. S. Employment Service, which was first established by the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933 and most recently amended under Title III of WIA. In addition to ES, Title I of WIA authorizes resources for similar core and intensive employment services for youth, adults, dislocated workers, and targeted populations. WIA Title I is also the nationâ€™s central job training legislation, providing funds for traditional, on-the-job, customized, and other forms of training to individuals unable to obtain or retain employment through other services. This report will be updated as new legislation warrants...|$|E
