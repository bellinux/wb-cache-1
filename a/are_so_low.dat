The Katana makes use of individual stick-type flight control, as opposed to yokes, along with key engine controls on a centrally-positioned pedestal.

[...] The United States Housing Authority (USHA) was soon established to facilitate the implementation of the Housing Act of 1937. The USHA was charged with the responsibility for the development and administration of all federal public housing programs. One of the Authority's first efforts was the implementation of a public relations campaign to establish popular support for the housing program that would help blunt attacks from the construction industry and others enemies. Public Housing was a highly polished monthly publication distributed as part of this public relations campaign. [...] This publication not only discussed the benefits and justifications of public housing programs, but charted progress on a national scale.
