A random approach is adopted to simulate the convergence speed and steady-state properties based on four fuzzy logical functions. The simulation results show that MV logical function causes the system {{to be on the}} edge of chaos when the number of nodes increases. Thus this logical function is more useful to infer real complex networks, such as gene regulatory networks. Then, a novel gene regulatory network inference algorithm based on the FLN theory is proposed and tested.

Objectives: To determine if exercise patterns are associated with scapular fracture in Thoroughbred (TB) and Quarter Horse (QH) racehorses. Methods: High-speed exercise histories for 65 TB and 26 QH racehorses that had a complete scapular fracture (cases) and 2 matched control racehorses were retrospectively studied. Exercise variables were created from lifetime race and official timed workout reports. Associations between exercise variables and scapular fracture were investigated using conditional logistic regression. Results: Thoroughbreds with a scapular fracture had a greater number of workouts, events (combined works and races), and mean event distances than QHs with a scapular fracture. Quarter Horses worked less frequently and <b>accumulated</b> <b>distance</b> at a lower rate than TBs. Breed differences were not found for career race number or length, time between races or lay-up variables for horses with ≥ 1 lay-up. For both breeds, cases had fewer events, lower recent <b>accumulated</b> <b>distance</b> and fewer active days in training than controls; however, a subset of TB cases with > 10 events since lay-up had a longer active career than controls. For QHs that had a lay-up, total and mean lay-up times were greater for cases than controls. Multivariable models revealed that odds ratios (OR) of scapular fracture were greater for TBs that had not yet raced (OR= 23. 19; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 03 - 177. 38) and lower for QHs with more events (OR= 0. 71; 95 % CI 0. 54 - 0. 94). Conclusions and clinical relevance: Racehorses that are in early high-speed training but behind that of their training cohort should be examined for signs of scapular stress remodelling. Quarter Horses that had a prolonged lay-up and TBs that have endured high-speed training for a longer duration than that of their training cohort also were at greater risk...|$|R

Unfortunately, these techniques are not applicable to warped sequences because the mapping between the test sequences and the training sequences is not known. To solve this problem, we propose a constrained LDA framework that produces direction vectors that repeat unit vectors that have dimensions equal to the dimensions of a single sequence sample.

Experimental results and comparative studies justify the effectiveness of the proposed method for moving object segmentation.

We have analyzed RPC expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and evaluated whether exposure to epidermal growth factor (EGF) can coordinate motogenic activity in vitro. Using Boyden chamber analysis as an initial high-throughput screen, we determined that RPC motility was optimally stimulated by EGF concentrations in the range of 20 - 400 ng/ml, with decreased stimulation at higher concentrations, suggesting concentration-dependence of EGF-induced motility. Using bioinformatics analysis of the EGF ligand in a retina-specific gene network pathway, we predicted a chemotactic function for EGF involving the MAPK and JAK-STAT intracellular signaling pathways.

The <b>accumulated</b> <b>distance</b> and number of GV movements are the two main indicators of this study. The core method is to simulate the long-term GV opening of Francis turbines with MATLAB/Simulink, based on a sequence of one-month measurements of the Nordic grid frequency.

Firstly, a model of a turbine governor is discussed and verified, based on on-site measurements of a Swedish hydropower plant. Then, the influence of governor parameters is discussed. Effects of different settings of controller filters (e. g. dead zone, floating dead zone and linear filter) are also examined. Moreover, a change in GV movement might affect the quality of the frequency control. This is also monitored via frequency deviation characteristics, determined by elementary simulations of the Nordic power system. The results show how the regulation settings affect the GV movements and frequency quality, supplying suggestions for optimizing the hydropower turbine operation for decreasing the wear and tear...|$|R
