5|$|The western {{terminus}} of {{the early}} medieval linear earthwork Nico Ditch is in Hough Moss, just {{to the east of}} Stretford; it was probably used as an <b>administrative</b> <b>boundary</b> and dates from the 8th or 9th century.|$|E
5|$|Nico Ditch was {{constructed}} some {{time between the}} end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman conquest in 1066. Its original purpose is unclear, but it may have been used as a defensive fortification or as an <b>administrative</b> <b>boundary.</b> It possibly marked a 7th-century boundary for the expansionist Anglo-Saxons, or {{it may have been a}} late 8th or early 9th century boundary marker between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. In the early medieval period, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex struggled for control over North West England, along with the Britons and the Danes. Whatever its earlier use, the ditch has been used as a boundary since at least the Middle Ages.|$|E

Following <b>administrative</b> <b>boundary</b> changes in 1974, and again in 2013, small areas in the west of the historic county now form part of North West England. It should be noted that during these processes the geographical boundaries, otherwise known as 'historical', remained unchanged.|$|E
500|$|The eastern {{terminus}} of {{the early}} medieval linear earthwork Nico Ditch is in Ashton Moss (...) it was probably used as an <b>administrative</b> <b>boundary</b> and dates from the 8th or 9thcentury. Legend claims {{it was built in}} a single night in 869 or 870 as a defence against Viking invaders. Further evidence of Dark Age activity in the area comes from the town's name. The [...] "Ashton" [...] part probably derives from the Anglo-Saxon meaning [...] "settlement by ash trees", the origin of the [...] "under-Lyne" [...] element is less clear: it could derive from the British lemo meaning elm, or may refer to Ashton being [...] "under the line" [...] of the Pennines. This means that Ashton probably became a settlement some time after the Romans left Britain in the 5thcentury. An early form of the town's name, which included a burh element, indicates that in the 11thcentury Ashton and Bury were two of the most important towns in Lancashire. The [...] "under Lyne" [...] suffix was not widely used until the mid-19th century when it became useful for distinguishing the town from other places called Ashton.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the Greenwich Judgement, {{catchment}} areas can be wholly contained within <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries,</b> and even coincide with <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries,</b> provided {{the area is}} clearly defined {{and there is some}} additional justification for the choice of area that is considered reasonable, such as distance from the school or ease of access. [...] It is common for catchment area boundaries to be aligned with well defined geographical features such as postcode areas and roads, and these sometimes coincide with <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Some faith schools have {{catchment areas}} that are aligned with diocesan boundaries or deaneries which follow the Local Authority's boundaries, and these have been deemed not in breach of the Greenwich Judgement provided that faith criteria are also applied. Some Grammar schools also align their catchments with <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Catchment area boundaries, in common with other over-subscription criteria used in admissions policies, must not unfairly disadvantage children from particular social or racial groups.|$|R

500|$|At {{the time}} of the Kent Hundred Rolls in 1275, Wormshill was in the Hundred of Eyhorne, a {{regional}} sub-division used in the Middle Ages by feudal and crown officials to administer communities. Although the Hundred of Eyhorne (including Wormshill) still exists, it is a mediaeval anachronism and no longer has any practical or administrative significance. In the 19th century, the village was within the lathe of Aylesford, the Bearsted petty sessional division and the Hollingbourne Rural District. The village was also incorporated into the Hollingbourne Poor Law Union (a means of funding and administering the operation of the Poor Laws in the area). The parish of Wormshill in part sits astride the West Kent and East Kent divide, a demarcation which until 1814 applied to an <b>administrative</b> <b>boundary</b> {{for the purposes of the}} law courts' Quarter Sessions. According to Edward Hasted (writing in 1798): [...] "northward of the church, including the borough of Bedmanton, is in the division of East Kent, but the rest of it, including the church and village, is in that of West Kent". This differs from the traditional distinction between Men of Kent and Kentish Men, which are separated by the River Medway, accordingly persons born in Wormshill would be Men of Kent.|$|E

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2003 Dr. Serryn EaglesonThe fragmentation of <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries</b> {{is a serious problem}} in the analysis of social, environmental and economic data. This research focuses on the development of a coordinated approach to the design of <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries</b> that endeavours to support accurate decision making. Around the world, <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries</b> have been structured in an uncoordinated manner, limiting data exchange and integration between organisations. The solution proposed in this research adopts the hierarchical reorganisation of <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries</b> to enhance data integration and data exchange within the spatial data infrastructure (SDI) framework. The SDI is an initiative intended to facilitate access to complete and consistent data sets. One of the most fundamental problems restricting the objectives of the SDI is the fragmentation of data between non-coterminous boundary systems. The majority of <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries</b> have been constructed by individual agencies to meet individual needs. Examples of the proliferation of different boundary systems include postcodes, census-collector districts, health districts and police districts. Due to the lack of coordination between boundary systems, current technologies for analysing spatial data, such as geographic information systems (GIS), are not reaching their full potential. A review of the current literature reveals that, until now, little has been done to solve this problem. The prototype developed within this research provides a new mechanism for the design of <b>administrative</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The prototype incorporates two algorithms. These are based on HSR theory and administrative-agency constraints and are implemented within the GIS environment. Such an approach {{is an example of the}} potential that is available when we link spatial information theory with the SDI framework and disciplinary knowledge. Open Acces...|$|R
