6000|$|A {{considerable}} {{collection of}} canvass, saturated with oil, was now put beneath the pile, {{in the midst}} of splinters of pine, and one of the lamps was forced into the centre of the combustibles. This expedient succeeded; the frosts were slowly chased out of the kindling materials; a sickly but gradually increasing flame strove through the kindling stuff and soon began to play among the billets of the oak, the only fuel that could be relied on for <b>available</b> <b>heat.</b> Still there was great danger that the lighter wood would all be consumed ere this main dependence could be aroused from its dull inactivity. Frost appeared to be in possession of the whole pile; and it was expelled so slowly, clung to its dominion with so much power, as really to render the result doubtful, for a moment or two. Fortunately, there was found a pair of bellows; and by means of a judicious use of this very useful implement, the oak wood was got into a bright blaze, and warmth began to be given out from the fire. Then came the shiverings and chills, with which intense cold consents even to abandon the human frame; and, by their number and force, Roswell was made to understand how near he and his companions had been to death. As the young man saw the fire slowly kindle to a cheerful blaze, a glow of gratitude flowed towards his heart, and mentally he returned thanks to God. The cabin was so small, had been made so tight by artificial means, and the camboose was so large, that a sensible influence was produced on the temperature, as soon as the wood began to burn a little freely. As none of the heat was lost, the effect was not only apparent, but most grateful, Roswell had looked into the vessels of the camboose while the fire was gathering head. One, the largest, was filled, or nearly so, with coffee frozen to a solid mass! In the other, beef and pork had been set over to boil, and there the pieces now were, embedded in ice, and frozen to blocks. It was when these two distinct masses of ice began to melt, that it was known the fire was beginning to prevail, and hope revived in the bosoms of the Oyster Ponders. On taking another look at the thermometer, {{it was found that the}} mercury had so far expanded as to be leaving the ball. It soon after ascended so high as to denote only forty degrees below zero! ...|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} other prison-made {{alcoholic}} potables are known to exist. These include crude wines, famously fermented in toilet tanks. Sugary beverages like orange drink may also be fermented and distilled using a radiator or other <b>available</b> <b>heat</b> source.

50|$|Referring to Figure 3, the {{circulating}} {{working fluid}} (usually an organic compound such as R-134a) is pumped {{to a high}} pressure and then vaporized in the evaporator by heat exchange with the <b>available</b> <b>heat</b> source. The resulting high-pressure vapor flows to the turboexpander where it undergoes an isentropic expansion and exits as a vapor-liquid mixture which is then condensed into a liquid by heat exchange with the available cooling medium. The condensed liquid is pumped back to the evaporator to complete the cycle.|$|E
30|$|To {{replicate}} the heating caused by earthquake slip, we heated the CM retrieved from the host rocks in a thermogravimetric apparatus (Netzsch STA 449 C Jupiter balance) to temperatures from 100 to 1300  °C, at increments of 100  °C, in an Ar gas atmosphere. Although {{the rate of}} temperature increase on the fault plane during an earthquake is several tens to several hundreds of degrees per second (e.g., Lachenbruch 1986), we heated our samples at 50  °C min− 1 because of the limited <b>available</b> <b>heating</b> rates of the apparatus.|$|R
30|$|It is {{demonstrated}} {{now that the}} commercially <b>available</b> <b>heating</b> microscope can be a better and easy tool for studying the sintering characteristics of ashes in the temperature range of 700 °C to 1, 000 °C for CFBC applications. If the sample specimen has cylindrical geometry, both axial and radial or area shrinkage can be recorded simultaneously against recording of shrinkage in one dimension only in dilatometer. Another advantage of heating microscope is the specimen not in contact with an external load like push rod in dilatometer at any time.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there is}} some {{overlapping}} in price and performance, the lighter SLS AMG is considered more of a sporty track-oriented car, compared to the Mercedes-Benz SL which is a more autobahn-focused grand tourer especially with its optional V12 engine. Compared to the SLS AMG Roadster, the SL is a hardtop convertible with technological and comfort amenities, and it also has <b>available</b> <b>heated</b> and cooled seats with a massage function. The SLS AMG has also been said {{to be one of}} the cheapest cars on the market with an unusual door design.|$|R
50|$|Thermal storage {{solutions}} incorporating resistance heating {{can be used}} {{in conjunction}} with ASHPs. Storage may be more cost-effective if time of use electricity rates are <b>available.</b> <b>Heat</b> is stored in high density ceramic bricks contained within a thermally-insulated enclosure. ASHPs may also be paired with passive solar heating. Thermal mass (such as concrete or rocks) heated by passive solar heat can help stabilize indoor temperatures, absorbing heat during the day and releasing heat at night, when outdoor temperatures are colder and heat pump efficiency is lower.|$|E
50|$|A partial {{storage system}} {{minimizes}} capital investment by running the chillers nearly 24 hours a day. At night, they produce ice for storage {{and during the}} day they chill water. Water circulating through the melting ice augments the production of chilled water. Such a system makes ice for 16 to 18 {{hours a day and}} melts ice for six hours a day. Capital expenditures are reduced because the chillers can be just 40 - 50% of the size needed for a conventional, no-storage design. Storage sufficient to store half a day's <b>available</b> <b>heat</b> is usually adequate.|$|E
50|$|At full power, sodium at a {{temperature}} of approximately 500 F passed through a plenum chamber beneath the reactor core through the heat channels absorbing heat released from the fuel elements, and discharged into the upper pool (about 6 ft deep) above the core at an average temperature of 950 °F (510 °C). This space was filled with helium gas, maintained at a pressure of approximately three pounds per square inch. Piping circulated 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg) of heated liquid sodium from the reactor vessel {{to one of two}} <b>available</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers. One heat exchanger transferred heat from the primary sodium loop, which in turn dissipated the heat in a steam generator which boiled water to make steam for use in a turbine generating electricity.|$|E

50|$|The vinegar or ammonia soak is then often {{followed}} by the application of shaving cream to the wound for 30 seconds, {{followed by}} shaving the area with a razor and rinsing the razor thoroughly between each stroke. This removes any remaining unfired nematocysts. Once shaved, the wound is then resoaked in either vinegar or ammonia. If <b>available,</b> <b>heat</b> {{in the form of}} hot salt water (not fresh) or hot packs is then applied at temperatures as hot as the victim can tolerate: heat speeds the breakdown of the toxins already in the skin. After a few hours, a thin layer of hydrocortisone cream at 1% concentration is applied. The victim must then be monitored over the next several days to see if the wound becomes infected: symptoms of infection such as fresh reddening of the wound's edges, the production of pus, the development of a fever, the swelling or hardening of the lymph nodes nearest the wound, etc., indicate that the hydrocortisone is to be discontinued and professional medical treatment may then be necessary.|$|E

The forced labour working hours for both parents often meant that a child or infant was left without care and incidents and infant deaths soared. The supply of dairy and fat products for Polish children were just one-fifth of that for German children.Likewise, the winter brought many deaths, as Germans limited the <b>available</b> <b>heating</b> supplies to 1/4 of that available to Germans.
