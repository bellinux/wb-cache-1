40|$|Pavement albedo is an {{important}} factor when evaluating thermal performance of pavement. Many pavement thermal models have used a constant albedo value in their simulations of pavement temperature profile, but in the real world the albedo value keeps changing diurnally. Information regarding albedo value for different materials is currently limited. Pavement tining is a common practice used in interstate highways in order to control the noise and pavement expansion. There has been, however, no report studying the influence of pavement tining on pavement albedo. This study investigates three topic: diurnal variation of albedo value, influence of <b>albedometer</b> height and its measuring range, and influence of pavement tining on pavement albedo. All albedo measurements used <b>albedometer</b> test method. Diurnal variations of albedo value were examined for both concrete and asphalt pavement. An analysis of energy collection based on both dynamic and constant albedo values was performed. The influence <b>albedometer</b> height on measuring range was examined for 2 different <b>albedometer</b> heights. The influence of pavement tining on pavement albedo was examined for two experimental parking lot sections...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of a cavity-enhanced aerosol single-scattering <b>albedometer</b> based on incoherent broadband cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (IBBCEAS) combined with an integrating sphere (IS) for simultaneous in situ measurements of aerosol scattering and extinction coefficients in an exact same sample volume. The cavity-enhanced <b>albedometer</b> employed a blue light-emitting-diode (LED) -based IBBCEAS approach for the measurement of wavelength-resolved aerosol optical extinction over the spectral range of 445 – 480 nm and an integrating sphere nephelometer coupled to the IBBCEAS setup for the measurement of aerosol scattering. The scattering signal was measured with a single-channel photomultiplier tube (PMT), providing an averaged value over a narrow bandwidth (full-width at half-maximum, FWHM, ~ 9 nm) in the spectral region of 465 – 474 nm. A scattering coefficient at a wavelength of 470 nm was deduced as an averaged scattering value over the spectral region of 465 – 474 nm and used for data analysis and instrumental performance comparison. Performance evaluation of the <b>albedometer</b> was carried out using laboratory-generated particles and ambient aerosol. The scattering and extinction measurements of monodisperse polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres generated in the laboratory proved excellent correlation between two channels of the <b>albedometer.</b> The retrieved refractive index (RI) of the PSL particles from the measured scattering and extinction efficiencies agreed well with the values reported in previously published papers. Aerosol light scattering and extinction coefficients, single-scattering albedo (SSA) and NO 2 concentrations in an ambient sample were directly and simultaneously measured using the <b>albedometer</b> developed. The instrument developed was validated via an intercomparison of the measured aerosol scattering coefficients and NO 2 trace gas concentrations to a TSI 3563 integrating nephelometer and a chemiluminescence detector, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Land surface shortwave {{broadband}} albedo {{is a key}} parameter {{in general}} circulation models and surface energy budget models. Multispectral satellite data are typically used to generate broadband albedo products in a three-step process: atmospheric correction, for converting the top-of-atmosphere observations to surface directional reflectance; angular modeling, for converting the surface directional reflectance to spectral albedo of each individual band; and finally, narrowband-to-broadband conversion, for transforming the spectral albedos to broadband albedos. Spectroradiometers {{can be used for}} validating surface directional reflectance products and pyranometers or broadband albedometers, for validating broadband albedo products, but spectral albedo products are rarely validated using ground measurements. In this study, we designed a new type of <b>albedometer</b> that can measure spectral albedos. It consists of multiple interference filters and a silicon detector, for measuring irradiance from 400 – 1100 nm. The linearity of the sensors is 99 %, and the designed <b>albedometer</b> exhibits consistency up to 0. 993, with a widely-used commercial instrument. A field experiment for measuring spectral albedo of grassland using this new <b>albedometer</b> was conducted in Yudaokou, China and the measurements are used for validating the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) spectral albedos. The results show that the biases of the MODIS spectral albedos of the first four bands are − 0. 0094, 0. 0065, 0. 0159, and − 0. 0001, respectively. This new instrument provides an effective technique for validating spectral albedos of any satellite sensor in this spectral range, which is critical for improving satellite broadband albedo products...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} and spatial variations in the surface albedo of the Vatnajökull ice cap, Iceland, are investigated. A time series of the surface albedo is composed for the summer of 1996 using satellite radiance measurements from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). This time series is compared with ground measurements carried out during a glacio-meteorological experiment during the same summer on the ice cap. The AVHRR is able to reproduce the development in time of the surface albedo fairly well. The large systematic differences found {{for some of the}} stations on the ice are attributed to sub-pixel-scale variations in the albedo. An attempt is made to confirm this hypothesis using satellite radiance measurements carried out by the Thematic Mapper (TM) and measurements made with a portable <b>albedometer.</b> The TM has a pixel size of 30 X 30 m whereas the pixel size of the AVHRR is 1 X 1 km. Although the TM measurements show greater variability in the albedo than do the AVHRR measurements, the large systematic difference remains. Measurements with the portable <b>albedometer</b> show a large spread in the albedo at sites with large systematic differences. This implies that the scale of the albedo variations is smaller than the scale of the AVHRR and TM pixels...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose {{correlations}} between Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers for the case of inclined and closed air-filled hemispherical cavities. The disk of such cavities is subjected to a constant heat flux. The study covers a wide range of Rayleigh numbers from 5 × 107 to 2. 55 × 1012. – Correlations are obtained from numerical approach validated by experimental measurements on some configurations, valid for several angles of inclination of the cavity between 0 ° (horizontal disk) and 90 ° (vertical disk) in steps of 15 °. – The statistical analysis of a large number of calculations leads to reliable results covering laminar, transitional and turbulent natural convection heat transfer zones. – The proposed correlations provide solutions for applications in several fields of engineering such as solar energy, aerospace, building, safety and security. – The new relations proposed are the first published for high Rayleigh numbers for this type of geometry. They supplement the knowledge of natural convection in hemispherical inclined cavities and constitute a useful tool for application in various engineering areas as solar energy (thermal collector, still, pyranometer, <b>albedometer,</b> pyrgeometer), aerospace (embarked electronics), building, safety and security (controlling and recording sensors) ...|$|E
40|$|Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 109 (D 08203), 4633 The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] 10. 1029 / 2003 JD 004392. Airborne {{measurements of the}} ratio of spectral upward and downward irradiances (so-called spectral albedo) are used to derive the areal spectral surface albedo in the wavelength range from 330 to 1670 nm. The data were collected over different sea and land surfaces in cloudless atmospheric conditions during three field campaigns. Measurements from the <b>Albedometer</b> (developed at IfT) and the NASA Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) are employed. Spectral radiative transfer calculations show that atmospheric scattering and absorption within the layer beneath the flight level considerably contribute to the airborne albedo measurements reported here, even for low flight altitudes (0. 2 – 0. 5 km). To remove this atmospheric masking, a nonlinear extrapolation of the airborne albedo measurements to the ground is performed. The nonlinearity {{is due to the}} vertically inhomogeneous distribution of the particle microphysical properties. This fact underlines the importance of aerosol profile measurements for the proper correction of atmospheric masking. Examples of the extrapolated areal spectral surface albedos are discussed in terms of their solar zenith angle dependence, their small-scale, and general variability. Finally, typical areal spectral surface albedos for different sea and land surfaces, as derived from the three measurement campaigns, are supplied in parameterized form for use in radiative transfer applications...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, multi-temporal {{topographic}} measurements from airborne {{laser scanning}} (ALS) have been increasingly {{used as a}} source of spatially explicit and accurate information to calculate geodetic glacier mass balances. Simultaneous to collecting topographic data, most ALS instruments record the backscattered intensity for each laser emission and therefore provide additional information on the reflectance characteristics of the surveyed surface. Along with air temperature, the surface albedo of snow and ice was identified as a major driving factor of glacier melt. Consequently, better knowledge on the spatial distribution of the glacier albedo could substantially improve energy balance based glacier melt modeling. In this study, we collected on-glacier spectro-radiometric and <b>albedometer</b> measurements to serve as a ground reference to radiometrically calibrate high resolution ALS intensity data into a distributed albedo proxy map. This method resulted in an albedo proxy with values between 0. 6 on the glacier tongue and 0. 9 on fresh snow in high altitudes. 99. 6 % of all values fell within the albedo boundary conditions, i. e. values between 0 and 1. Corrected near-infrared ALS intensity data provided a distributed product that allows simulating albedo in glacier energy and mass balance models more realistically. Remaining challenges are (i) a different surface albedo response in the visual part of the electromagnetic spectrum, (ii) the low radiometric resolution of the ALS system for higher intensity values, and (iii) an insufficient correction of the snow bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the price per {{watt-peak}} for photovoltaic modules are decreasing rapidly, there is a large population of people which have still not implemented photovoltaic technology in their everyday lives. An important reason why PV is still not the main source of electrical energy for these people is the uncertainty that comes with installing a PV system on the roof of a house. Consumers are afraid that an investment in a PV system will cost them too much money, while it {{will take a long time}} before their investment is paid back for. Therefore, it is important to accurately estimate the energy yield of PV systems before installation. By doing so, consumers will be more likely to see the benefits of a PV system, thus implementing the technology on their houses. This thesis aims to improve the accuracy of the annual energy yield estimation using LiDAR data and a new model for the albedo component of irradiance. LiDAR has been used to determine the irradiance on a surface previously, however, this thesis uses LiDAR data in the Unity 3 D game engine, which enables the user to apply changes and build on the environment rapidly. This eliminates the disadvan- tage of LiDAR data, which is often outdated, thus missing crucial objects surrounding the location of the potential PV system. Ray-casting is used extensively to determine the sky view factor, view factor, shading factor and to determine the surfaces visible to the PV module. Being able to determine the sky view factor without doing any field work greatly reduces the time required to design a PV system. The albedo component is often neglected entirely when estimating the irradiation on a surface, while it may significantly contribute to the energy yield, reaching up to 10 % of the total. The albedo com- ponent is mainly important for highly tilted PV modules or BIPV. The albedo component is also crucial for bifacial PV modules. Measurements have shown that the albedo of a material is not determined easily using a sample of the material along with two inversely installed pyranometers making up an <b>albedometer.</b> It has been found that the <b>albedometer</b> is only able to determine the specific albedo of a location for the weather condition and the time in which the measurement has been done. Extensive research has been done in order to determine the factors which have an influence on the albedo of a location. The spectral reflectivity of materials is expected to play an important role in finding a final model which describes the albedo factor accurately. In order to estimate the irradiance due to reflectance, first the irradiance on the surfaces that are visible to the PV module are estimated one by one along with the view factor of each of the visible surfaces to the PV module in question. Finally using the reflectivity of the material of each surface, the contribution of each surface to the irradiance on the PV module as a result of reflectance is summed up resulting in the albedo component of the irradiance. The same method is used for the back side of the PV module to determine the irradiance on the back side of a bifacial PV module. This research aims to play an important part in the automation of PV system design, striving to com- pletely eliminate necessary field work, while improving the accuracy of the predicted annual energy yield.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} {{the details of}} the new multi-technology ground-mounted photovoltaic (PV) field installed at the Airport of Bolzano Dolomiti (ABD) in the Italian Alps. The plant, owned by ABD and developed with a co-financing of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), is divided into two main parts: a 662 kW commercial installation, mounting 8538 CdTe modules First Solar 277, and a 62 kW experimental installation, mounting 24 different types of modules, divided into 39 groups ranging between 1 and 2 kW each. In this experimental installation the modules are mounted on fixed racks, as well as on mono-axial and bi-axial active trackers. EURAC Research is the scientific responsible of this test facility and follows the monitoring and test activities to evaluate the performance and the lifetime degradation of the modules. The aim of the monitoring activity is to allow a better understanding of module loss mechanisms for each technology and evaluating the performance in the alpine climatic conditions. The PV modules are evaluated in relationship to meteo data from an on-site station, counting a sensor for ambient temperature, an anemometer, a pyrheliometer, three pyranometers, an <b>albedometer</b> and also a sun photometer which allows evaluating the influence given by aerosols, ozone and vapors in the atmosphere to the irradiance. PV reference cells are also used, mounted horizontally, on the module plane, and on the two trackers. The PV plant has been connected to the MV network on August 10, 2010, and it is presently in course of approval by GSE (Gestore Servizi Energetici) for the incentive scheme in force. Monitoring results can be presently shown only {{for a couple of days}} for a limited number of groups...|$|E
