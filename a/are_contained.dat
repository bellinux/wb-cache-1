5|$|A {{maximum of}} 15 Desk Accessories may be {{installed}} at one time, including the Chooser, Scrapbook, and Control Panel. System 6 uses the Control Panel desk accessory to access all the installed control panels, which imposes severe user interface limitations. Desk Accessories cannot be installed or removed within the Finder; this requires the Font/DA Mover utility. System 7 also fixed this. Control panels, however, <b>are</b> <b>contained</b> in separate files.|$|E
5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems <b>are</b> <b>contained</b> on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E

5|$|During phylogenesis, {{cerebrospinal}} fluid is present within the neuraxis before it circulates. The CSF of Teleostei fish <b>are</b> <b>contained</b> within the ventricles of the brains, {{but not in}} a nonexistent subarachnoid space. In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, the CSF is present in it. Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.|$|E
5|$|In the {{eukaryotic}} cell, the cytosol {{is within}} the cell membrane and {{is part of the}} cytoplasm, which also comprises the mitochondria, plastids, and other organelles (but not their internal fluids and structures); the cell nucleus is separate. The cytosol is thus a liquid matrix around the organelles. In prokaryotes, most of the chemical reactions of metabolism take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the periplasmic space. In eukaryotes, while many metabolic pathways still occur in the cytosol, others <b>are</b> <b>contained</b> within organelles.|$|E
5|$|Integer {{powers of}} 2 are {{important}} in computer science. The positive integer powers 2n give the number of possible values for an n-bit integer binary number, e.g. 28 = 256 different values for 1byte. For a given number the binary number system denotes {{on one side of}} the binary point all the positive integer powers of 2, that <b>are</b> <b>contained</b> in the integer part of this number, and the negative powers to the other side of the binary point represent the fractional part. This system is consistently used to represent numbers in computers for hardware reasons.|$|E

5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, <b>are</b> <b>contained</b> {{in one or more}} rooms called organ chambers. Because sound does not project from a chamber into the room as clearly as from a freestanding organ case, enchambered organs may sound muffled and distant. For this reason, some modern builders, {{particularly those}} building instruments specializing in polyphony rather than Romantic compositions, avoid this unless the architecture of the room makes it necessary.|$|E

Two provisions in Section 11 address voter fraud: Section 11(c) prohibits people from knowingly submitting a false voter registration application to vote in a federal election, and Section 11(e) prohibits voting twice in a federal election.|$|E

It contains views on dharma (moral conduct), jnana (understanding {{of the nature of}} the self), vairagya (detachment from material pleasure), and bhakti (pure, selfless devotion to God), the four essentials Hindu scriptures describe as necessary for a jiva (soul) to attain moksha (salvation).|$|E
