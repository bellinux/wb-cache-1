5|$|Starburst {{galaxies are}} {{characterized}} by dusty concentrations of gas {{and the appearance of}} newly formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions. These massive stars produce supernova explosions, resulting in expanding remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. Only when the <b>available</b> <b>gas</b> is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst activity end.|$|E

50|$|In manual {{closed circuit}} rebreathers the diver can control the gas mix and volume in the loop {{manually}} by injecting each of the different <b>available</b> <b>gases</b> to the loop and by venting the loop.

25|$|A {{submersible}} {{pressure gauge}} {{is used to}} indicate the remaining gas pressure in a diving cylinder. The amount of <b>available</b> <b>gas</b> remaining can be calculated from the pressure and the cylinder internal volume, and {{the time that he}} diver can dive on the <b>available</b> <b>gas</b> depends on the depth and work load, and the fitness of the diver. Breathing rates can vary considerably, and estimates are largely derived from experience. Conservative estimates are generally used for planning purposes.|$|E
25|$|Nitrous oxide, also {{sometimes}} known as laughing gas, is a legally <b>available</b> <b>gas</b> used for purposes that include anesthesia during certain dental and surgical procedures, {{as well as}} food preparation and the fueling of rocket and racing engines. Substance abusers {{also sometimes}} use the gas as an inhalant. Like all other inhalants, it's popular because it provides consciousness-altering effects while allowing users to avoid some of the legal issues surrounding illicit or illegal drugs of abuse. Abuse of nitrous oxide can produce significant short-term and long-term damage to human health, including a form of oxygen starvation called hypoxia, brain damage, and a serious vitamin B12 deficiency {{that can lead to}} nerve damage.|$|E
25|$|Partial {{pressure}} blending using {{ideal gas}} calculations is fairly straightforward. The required mixture is chosen, {{either as a}} best mix which optimises the decompression advantages for acceptable oxygen exposure based on the planned dive profile, or selected {{from a range of}} standardised mixes suitable for a range of depths and times, or optimised to suit <b>available</b> <b>gas</b> stocks or other constraints. The mixture is specified in terms of gas fractions of the component gases, and the convention is to specify the type, (nitrox, trimix or heliox) and composition as percentage by volume of oxygen, helium if present, and nitrogen. The remainder of nitrogen is not always specifically stated, and is assumed to be the balance.|$|E

2500|$|From 1938 to 1954, the FPC did not {{regulate}} wellhead prices. [...] However, {{these prices}} were very low because {{the amount of}} <b>available</b> <b>gas</b> supply exceeded the pipeline capacity to move it to national markets. However, after World War II, wellhead gas prices rose {{even to the point}} that producers started to drill new gas-only wells in areas that contained little oil. [...] The State of Wisconsin claimed that the absence of federal wellhead price regulation caused the delivered price of gas in Wisconsin to reach unreasonable levels. Wisconsin wanted the FPC to regulate wellhead gas sales.|$|E
2500|$|XVIII Corps issued Instruction No. 1 on 30 June, {{describing}} {{the intention to}} conduct a rolling offensive, where each corps would have four divisions, two for the attack and two in reserve, ready {{to move through the}} attacking divisions for the next attack. Separate units were detailed for patrolling, once the green line was reached and some cavalry were attached. Divisions were to build strongpoints and organise liaison with neighbouring divisions, with these groups given special training over model trenches. Ten days before zero, divisions were to send liaison officers to Corps Headquarters. Machine-gun units were to be under corps control, until the black line was reached then devolve to divisions, ready to sweep the Steenbeek valley and cover the advance to the green line by the 51st and 39th divisions. Tanks were attached to the divisions, under arrangements decided by the divisions and some wireless tanks were made <b>available.</b> <b>Gas</b> units remained under corps control, a model of the ground was built for all ranks to inspect and it was arranged that two maps per platoon would be issued. Plans for air-ground communication went into considerable detail. Aircraft recognition markings were given and the flares to be lit by the infantry when called for by contact aeroplanes was laid down, as were recognition marks for battalion and brigade headquarters; dropping stations were created to receive information from aircraft. Ground communication arrangements were made according to the manual [...] Appendices covered Engineer work on roads, rail, tramways and water supply; intelligence arrangements covered the use balloons, contact aeroplanes, Forward Observation Officers, prisoners, returning wounded, neighbouring formations and wireless eavesdropping. Corps Observers were attached to brigades, to patrol forward once the black line was reached, to observe the area up to the green line, judge the morale of the Germans opposite and see if they were preparing to counter-attack or retire, passing the information to a divisional Advanced Report Centre.|$|E
