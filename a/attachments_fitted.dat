5000|$|In the United States, M203 grenade {{launcher}} <b>attachments</b> <b>fitted</b> {{with the standard}} rifled 40mm barrel are classified as [...] "Destructive Devices" [...] under the National Firearms Act part 26 U.S.C. 5845, 27 CFR 479.11, because they are a [...] "non-sporting" [...] firearm with a bore greater than one-half inch in diameter. M203s are on the civilian NFA market but are limited as most manufacturers have quit selling to the civilian markets. New M203 launchers sell for approximately $2,000 plus a $200 transfer tax, and new manufacture 40mm training ammunition is available for $5 to $10 per cartridge, as of March 2011. High explosive 40mm grenades are available for $400 to $500 per cartridge; however, they are exceedingly rare on the civilian market, as each grenade constitutes a Destructive Device on its own, and must be registered with the Federal government, requiring payment of a $200 tax and compliance with storage regulations for high explosives. There are also sub-caliber adapters available for the 40mm M203 (and M79) {{grenade launcher}}s, which will allow the use of standard 12 gauge shotgun shells and [...]22 rimfire ammo.|$|E

This research investigates one solution that creates a direct read force transducer to monitor the forces and moments experienced by the spacecraft, rather than inferring forces from accelerometer readings as is the current practice. In order to minimize costs, the transducer was designed using the existing structure that connects the spacecraft to the second stage, known as the Payload <b>Attachment</b> <b>Fitting.</b> Adapting an existing, irregular geometry to serve as a six degree of freedom force transducer required the development of a specialized design and optimization process.

Ngan et al. report that on surveying pain levels 4 h, 24 h, and 7 days after the insertion of arch wires and separators, pain was greatest when using both devices after 24 h [5]. Harazaki and Isshiki implemented a questionnaire survey regarding the time during which pain was felt by patients having the initial wire inserted to an <b>attachment</b> device <b>fitted</b> to all their teeth and reported that pain occurred after between 3.4 and 3.5 h, peaked at around 24 h, and disappeared a week later [16]. In each of these cases, the pain threshold was at its lowest around 24 h after the application of orthodontic force, after which gradual recovery was noted. In this study, the pain disappeared 5 days after in EIG and IG but not until 6 days after in EG. All VAS scores decreased while the stage progressed.|$|R
40|$|Although trust {{has been}} {{identified}} as a critical factor in alliance management, rigorous conceptual and empirical developments of alliance trust have remained elusive. Our objective in this paper is to develop a conceptual understanding of joint venture (JV) trust. First, we define JV trust as reliance on another JV party (i. e., person, group, or firm) under a condition of risk. Reliance is volitional action by one party that allows that party's fate to be determined by the other party. Risk means that a party would experience potentially negative outcomes from the untrustworthiness of the other party. Thus, under a condition of risk, a JV partner's trust is signified by action that puts its fate in the hand of the other partner. Second, we review previous literature on trust and JVs and show that trust has been viewed from three different perspectives: structural, social, and psychological. Third, we develop a framework of the antecedents and consequences of JV trust. The factors considered as antecedents are: prior cooperative relationships, habitualization, individual <b>attachment,</b> organizational <b>fit,</b> and assessment of partner competence. Proposed consequences or outcomes of JV trust include forbearance, governance structures, relationship investments, increases in JV scope, and JV performance. From this framework, we identify various theoretical and methodological implications, and propose a research agenda. Trust joint ventures alliances...|$|R
5000|$|In {{industrial}} design, future-proofing designs seek {{to prevent}} obsolescence {{by analyzing the}} decrease in desirability of products. Desirability is measured in categories such as function, appearance, and emotional value. The products with more functional design, better appearance, and which accumulate emotional value faster tend to be retained longer and are considered future-proof. Industrial design ultimately strives {{to encourage people to}} buy less by creating objects with higher levels of desirability. Some of the characteristics of future-proof products that come out of this study include a timeless nature, high durability, aesthetic appearances that capture and hold the interest of buyers. Ideally, as an object ages, its desirability is maintained or increases with increased emotional <b>attachment.</b> Products that <b>fit</b> into society’s current paradigm of progress, while simultaneously making progress, also tend to have increased desirability.

60|$|Which {{reminds me}} that the other day I saw the Lady herself {{in the shape of}} a tall woman of twenty-five or six, waiting for her tram on a street corner. She wore her almost flaxen-gold hair waved, and parted low on the forehead, beneath a black astrachan toque, with a red enamel maple-leaf hatpin in one side of it. This was the one touch of colour except the flicker of a buckle on the shoe. The dark, {{tailor-made}} dress had no trinkets or <b>attachments,</b> but <b>fitted</b> perfectly. She stood for perhaps a minute without any movement, both hands--right bare, left gloved--hanging naturally at her sides, the very fingers still, the weight of the superb body carried evenly on both feet, and the profile, which was that of Gudrun or Aslauga, thrown out against a dark stone column. What struck me most, next to the grave, tranquil eyes, was her slow, unhurried breathing in the hurry about her. She was evidently a regular fare, for when her tram stopped she smiled at the lucky conductor; and the last I saw of her was a flash of the sun on the red maple-leaf, the full face still lighted by that smile, and her hair very pale gold against the dead black fur. But the power of the mouth, the wisdom of the brow, the human comprehension of the eyes, and the outstriking vitality of the creature remained. That is how I would have my country drawn, were I a Canadian--and hung in Ottawa Parliament House, for the discouragement of prevaricators.|$|R
40|$|Rigor insect {{flight muscle}} (IFM) can be relaxed without ATP by {{increasing}} ethylene glycol {{concentration in the}} presence of adenosine 5 ′-[β′γ- imido]triphosphate (AMPPNP). Fibers poised at a critical glycol concentration retain rigor stiffness but support no sustained tension (“glycol-stiff state”). This suggests that many crossbridges are weakly attached to actin, possibly {{at the beginning of the}} power stroke. Unaveraged three-dimensional tomograms of “glycol-stiff” sarcomeres show crossbridges large enough to contain only a single myosin head, originating from dense collars every 14. 5 nm. Crossbridges with an average 90 ° axial angle contact actin midway between troponin subunits, which identifies the actin azimuth in each 38. 7 -nm period, in the same region as the actin target zone of the 45 ° angled rigor lead bridges. These 90 ° “target zone” bridges originate from the thick filament and approach actin at azimuthal angles similar to rigor lead bridges. Another class of glycol-PNP crossbridge binds outside the rigor actin target zone. These “nontarget zone” bridges display irregular forms and vary widely in axial and azimuthal <b>attachment</b> angles. <b>Fitting</b> the acto-myosin subfragment 1 atomic structure into the tomogram reveals that 90 ° target zone bridges share with rigor a similar contact interface with actin, while nontarget crossbridges have variable contact interfaces. This suggests that target zone bridges interact specifically with actin, while nontarget zone bridges may not. Target zone bridges constitute only ∼ 25 % of the myosin heads, implying that both specific and nonspecific attachments contribute to the high stiffness. The 90 ° target zone bridges may represent a preforce attachment that produces force by rotation of the motor domain over actin, possibly independent of the regulatory domain movements...|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that both early experience and genetic variation {{play a role in}} influencing sensitivity to social rejection. In this study, we aimed at ascertaining if the A 118 G polymorphism of the μ-opioid receptor gene (OPRM 1) moderates the impact of early maternal care on fearful attachment, a personality trait strongly related to rejection sensitivity. In 112 psychiatric patients, early maternal care and fearful attachment were measured using the Parental Bonding Inventory and the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ), respectively. The pattern emerging from the RQ data was a crossover interaction between genotype and maternal caregiving. Participants expressing the minor 118 [*]G allele had similar and relatively high scores on fearful attachment regardless of the quality of maternal care. By contrast, early experience made a major difference for participants carrying the A/A genotype. Those who recalled higher levels of maternal care reported the lowest levels of fearful attachment whereas those who recalled lower levels of maternal care scored highest on fearful <b>attachment.</b> Our data <b>fit</b> well with the differential susceptibility model which stipulates that plasticity genes would make some individuals more responsive than others to the negative consequences of adversity and to the benefits of environmental support and enrichment...|$|R

A small screw cap <b>attachment</b> is <b>fitted</b> or drilled preferably {{in the middle of the}} housing. A piece of latex or silicone rubber (usually rough inside, but some cases smooth) then is put through the hose and pulled up at both ends. Another latex or silicone cone shaped attachment is placed on one end of the AV an held by a rubber band. on thee end of the cone a glass or plastic centrifudge tube is attached usually 15ml size). Through the cap attachment water usually around 54°C is filled until the AV is 1/2 full (temperature may vary from bull to bull). This water is between the inside rubber and the inside hose wall of the AV. A small amount of K-Y jelly or Vaseline is placed just inside on the unconed end and then it is smeared with a pipette or greasing stick. Finally in most cases and AV jacket is tied or attached onto the cone end to cover the cone and tube. This will help prevent cold shock to the semen by keeping the cone and tube warm. The collector then goes cautiously to the side of the bull when he is in mount, directs the bull's penis inside the AV by grabbing the sheath directly behind the extended penis (never touching the penis itself). The bull then ejaculates after his penis slides through the AV. The bull should be ejaculating through the AV into the cone of the AV so there is very little chance of temperature shock to the semen. after the bull has dismounted the AV should be held in the upright position so the semen runs into the tube onto the end of the cone. Then the tube is detached and placed upright in a water bath of about 29-32°C.|$|R

40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} (WWT) {{is generally}} efficient in removing nanoparticles (NPs) from sewage effluent, but the variety in removal rates {{has not yet}} been explained. WWT parameters such as the activated sludge (AS) concentration, shear rate and ionic strength were varied in kinetic batch attachment and sedimentation studies using silver NPs having nominal 20 or 80 nm sizes and citrate or PEG coatings. The <b>fitted</b> <b>attachment</b> and detachment rate constants and the resulting distribution ratios at steady state varied with WWT process parameters, but most notably with the NP size, which was also found to influence the settling rates most. The NP coating molecules had a limited or no effect. A meta-analysis of literature distribution ratios (attached/detached concentration) of NPs composed of Ag and other materials showed the NP (aggregate) size as the only significant parameter. However, while the distribution ratio of silver NPs to AS increased linearly with AS concentration, the final effect of NP effluent concentrations is partly offset by decreased sedimentation rates. The results thus confirm that a WWT process is efficient in removing NPs from wastewater, but relatively small (< 20 nm) non-aggregated NPs are somewhat more likely to exit a WWT process via the effluent into aquatic compartments compared to relatively larger NPs, which nearly entirely leave the WWT plants with the AS towards soils, incineration plants or landfills...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} {{diagnostic test}} instrument and its development program are described. The instrument automates the {{fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test}} for syphilis {{to the extent}} that only 4 hr of technician time is required to conduct approximately 200 tests daily. Evaluation to date suggests its efficacy. In addition, preliminary studies indicate the feasibility of detecting antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium malariae, and nucleoprotein (antinuclear factor). The instrument would seem to have broad application for routine and research immunofluorescence testing. Two elements comprise the instrument: a slide processor and a microscope attachment. The slide processor is an electro-pneumatically actuated device which automatically feeds special laboratory slides, on which antigen or other reagents are prefixed, through a series of operations which provide reagent application, incubation, washing, drying, and stacking of the finished slides for readout. The instrument provides flexibility in that incubation time and temperature as well as point, sequence, and duration of reagent application can be varied to accommodate a variety of immunofluorescence techniques. The microscope <b>attachment</b> can be <b>fitted</b> to all conventional dark-field fluorescence microscopes and makes possible the reading of three to six slides per minute. The reacted slides from the processor are injected sequentially onto the stage of the microscope by movement of a lever. As injected, slides are automatically in visual focus; fine focus is occasionally required. Scanning of the reacted field is accomplished by means of the normal microscope controls. A buffered glycerol coupling is maintained between the darkfield condenser substage lens and the slide cover glass by means of a pushbutton-actuated feed system...|$|R

Husqvarna now {{has an interest in}} investigating the possibiltiy to expand their production of chains and guide bars to include cutting equipment for timber-harvesters. This project is a technical study which aims to answer questions about cutting equipment for timber-harvesters that have been decided in cooperation with Husqvarna. The questions have mainly been focused on forces, cutting speeds, service and maintenance -as well as general questions regarding the size of the Swedish market. Two methods have been applied to answer the questions. Interviews with retailers of harvesters, producers of harvester heads and harvester drivers. The main findings in this project show that there is a relatively small selection of harvester chains on the Swedish market. In contrast to the selection of harvester chains the selection of guide bars is quite large. Ranging from solid bars to bars with a replaceable sprocket nose with a special alloy to bars with special easy to <b>fit</b> <b>attachments.</b> In total: timber-harvesters on the Swedish market demand for a number of harvester chains that is between 600 000 – 1 000 000 and between 85 700 – 167 700 for guide bars.

40|$|When we send {{humans to}} search for life on other planets, we'll {{need to know what}} we brought with us versus what may already be there. To ensure our crewed systems meet {{planetary}} protection requirements-and to protect our science from human contamination-we'll need to assess whether microorganisms may be leaking or venting from our spacecraft. Microbial sample collection outside of a pressurized spacecraft is complicated by temperature extremes, low pressures that preclude the use of laboratory standard (wetted) swabs, and operation either in bulky spacesuits or with robotic assistance. Engineers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently developed a swab kit for use in collecting microbial samples from the external surfaces of crewed spacecraft, including spacesuits. The Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Swab Kit consists of a single swab tool handle and an eight-canister sample caddy. The design team minimized development cost by re-purposing a heritage Space Shuttle tile repair handle that was designed to quickly snap into different tool attachments by engaging a mating device in each attachment. This allowed the tool handle to snap onto a fresh swab attachment much like popular shaving razor handles can snap onto a disposable blade cartridge. To disengage the handle from a swab, the user performs two independent functions, which can be done with a single hand. This dual operation mitigates the risk that a swab will be inadvertently released and lost in microgravity. Each swab <b>attachment</b> is <b>fitted</b> with commercially available foam swab tips, vendor-certified to be sterile for Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). A microbial filter installed in the bottom of each sample container allows the container to outgas and repressurize without introducing microbial contaminants to internal void spaces. Extensive ground testing, post-test handling, and sample analysis confirmed the design is able to maintain sterile conditions as the canister moves between various pressure environments. To further minimize cost, the design team acquired extensive ground test experience in a relevant flight environment by piggy-backing onto suited crew training runs. These training runs allowed the project to validate tool interfaces with pressurized EVA gloves and collect user feedback on the tool design and function, as well as characterize baseline microbial data for different types of spacesuits. In general, test subjects found the EVA Swab Kit relatively straightforward to operate, but identified a number of design improvements that will be incorporated into the final design. Although originally intended to help characterize human forward contaminants, this tool has other potential applications, such as for collecting and preserving space-exposed materials to support astrobiology experiments...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the mediating role of emotion regulation and coping {{in the relationship between}} attachment insecurity and binge drinking and binge eating, using structural equation modeling. To rule out alternative explanations of the results, Big Five personality was investigated in the supplementary analysis. College students (N = 381) completed the web-survey that included questionnaires: (a) Experiences in Close Relationship-Short Form (Wei, Russell, Mallinckrodt, 2 ̆ 6 Vogel, 2007), partner, mother, and father versions; (b) Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (Gratz 2 ̆ 6 Roemer, 2004); (c) Brief COPE (Carver, 1997); (d) Drinking Style Questionnaire (Smith, McCarthy, 2 ̆ 6 Goldman, 1995); (e) Binge Eating Scale (Gormally, Black, Daston, 2 ̆ 6 Rardin, 1982); (f) Big Five Inventory (John 2 ̆ 6 Srivastava, 1999), and (g) a demographic form. Higher attachment insecurity was associated with binge eating, which was fully mediated by higher emotion regulation difficulties. Coping did not mediate the link between attachment and binge eating. Attachment, emotion regulation, and coping were not associated with binge drinking. In general, partner attachment predicted binge eating better than parental attachment. However, insecure attachment with mother appeared to predict binge eating for men. Results indicated that individuals with insecure attachment have difficulty regulating emotions, and therefore are more likely to binge eat. Models with Big Five personality in place of insecure <b>attachment</b> did not <b>fit</b> the data adequately. Implications for this study include being able to provide a conceptual framework of integrating the two targets (i. e., interpersonal and emotion regulation problems) of intervention for binge eating by applying attachment theory.

40|$|The Composite <b>Fitting</b> <b>Attachment</b> (COFA) {{system was}} {{developed}} by Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures (CRC-ACS) to join thermoplastic (TP) brackets to carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) using ultrasonic welding. This complex process means experimental characterisation of the joint is crucial. Three aspects of the joint formation were investigated: weld development over time, temperature in the weld and surrounding laminate, and failure loads of the joint. Weld development over time was investigated using cross sectional micrographs, differential scanning calorimetry and hot stage. This indicated under a given set of weld parameters, the energy director of the COFA joint started to collapse after 0. 025 secs of ultrasonic vibration and collapse distance is directly proportional to the input actuator energy. Various spherulite sizes were observed at the joint interface divided by striations suggesting varying cooling rates in the TP during resolidification. Minimal percentage crystallinity changes using various cooling rates were measured. Interface and through thickness laminate temperatures were measured using thermocouples. Measured interface temperatures were in excess of 500 °C and 300 °C for joints welded at 20 kHz and 40 kHz, respectively. Maximum times for which any portion of the laminates measured above 200 °C were under 1 second and just over 1 second for joints welded at 20 kHz and 40 kHz, respectively. These short times {{are expected to be}} insufficient to allow thermal degradation of the laminates during welding. Failure test of COFA joint were performed under axial, transverse and shear loads. The shear load test case was newly developed to fully characterise the load-bearing capabilities of the joint. All tests passed the 200 N requirement. Transverse loading applied at 90 ° to the CFRP's first ply is the critical load case. Three different failure mechanisms were observed including CFRP laminate damage through first ply fibre pull out.
