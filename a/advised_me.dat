5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors <b>advised</b> <b>me</b> that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E
25|$|The Director General has <b>advised</b> <b>me</b> that he {{has found}} no {{evidence}} of any truth in the allegations. He has given me his personal assurance that the stories are false. In particular, he has <b>advised</b> <b>me</b> that all the Security Service officers who have been interviewed have categorically denied that they were involved in, or were aware of, any activities or plans to undermine or discredit Lord Wilson and his Government when he was Prime Minister. The then Director General has categorically denied the allegation that he confirmed the existence within the Security Service of a disaffected faction with extreme right wing views. He has further stated that he had {{no reason to believe that}} any such faction existed. No evidence or indication has been found of any plot or conspiracy against Lord Wilson by or within the Security Service.|$|E

She caught an injury to her right hand during the {{marathon}} third set in the fourth round of the Wimbledon Championships against Cibulkova. “Unfortunately the right hand injury I suffered at Wimbledon is not 100 percent (fine) and my medical team has <b>advised</b> <b>me</b> to rest,” said Radwańska. She, however, was able to get back in shape before Rogers Cup in Montreal. At Rogers Cup, she defeated Monica Niculescu in straight sets before losing to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the third round.|$|E

25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that <b>advised</b> <b>me</b> to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and {{he trained}} me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} me to move on.|$|E
500|$|Thrale {{explains}} that her {{book is not}} for [...] "diary-keeping in the strict sense" [...] when she writes: [...] "It is many Years since Doctor Samuel Johnson <b>advised</b> <b>me</b> {{to get a little}} Book, and write in it all the little Anecdotes which might come to my Knowledge, all the Observations I might make or hear; all the Verses never likely to be published, and in fine ev'ry thing which struck me at the Time. Mr Thrale has now treated me with a Repository, - and provided it with the pompous Title of Thraliana; I must endeavour to fill it with Nonsense new and old." [...] These encouraging remarks from Johnson set the theme of the work as it became a new [...] "Johnsoniana" [...] collection. In particular, she transferred her previous notes and documentations about Johnson's life into the collection.|$|E
500|$|On September 9, McCotter {{made his}} last {{campaign}} trip to New Hampshire, attending events for two days. He {{was supposed to}} appear in Iowa again five days later, but had to cancel due to a vote in Congress. While in Washington, he introduced a Grover Norquist-backed Social Security reform plan, which would have created private accounts for those under [...] of age with limited guaranteed government benefits. He called on the other GOP presidential candidates to release their plans on Social Security. Shortly thereafter, McCotter participated in the California Republican Convention. In a speech there, he criticized President Obama, arguing, [...] "No {{matter how many times}} his campaign clown car crisscrosses America, we know that the most prosperous and equitable economy in human history was created by you, the American people, not by bureaucrats in Washington." [...] At the event's straw poll, he received {{less than one percent of}} the vote. McCotter tried to gain entry into the September 22 Fox News debate, but reported via Twitter, [...] has kindly <b>advised</b> <b>me</b> I will be excluded from the Orlando GOP POTUS debate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Liu Shan's {{imperial}} edict for awarding Zhao Yun his posthumous title read: [...] "Zhao Yun {{followed the}} Late Emperor {{and he made}} outstanding contributions. I was young then and experienced many difficulties, but I relied on his loyalty and faithfulness {{to get out of}} danger. I bestow this posthumous name on him to recognise him for his meritorious service and also because there were others who <b>advised</b> <b>me</b> to do so." [...] The name of Zhao Yun's posthumous title was suggested by Jiang Wei and others – shun ( [...] ; literally [...] "obey / follow") because he was virtuous and kind, ping ( [...] ; literally [...] "peace / pacify") because he performed his duties up to standard and overcame chaos, so shun and ping became [...] "Shunping".|$|E

2500|$|It {{was first}} {{brought to light}} by Clement Usill Kingston in 1847. Kingston was a {{schoolmaster}} and amateur painter living {{in the town of}} Ashbourne, Derbyshire, after which the portrait came to be named. He wrote to Abraham Wivell, an authority on Shakespeare portraits, explaining the circumstances in which he claimed to have found it. According to Kingston, [...] "a friend in London sent me word that he had seen a portrait of Shakespeare, that he was positive it was a genuine picture, and that the owner only valued it as being a very fine painting. Being too poor to purchase it himself, he <b>advised</b> <b>me</b> by all means to have it." [...] He immediately purchased it. Kingston told Wivell that the design on the book held in the subject's hand was a combination of [...] "the crest of the Shakespeare family and the tragic mask". After examining the work, Wivell enthusiastically endorsed it.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sîrbu, {{the scandal}} {{was also used}} by the Metropolitan's {{numerous}} adversaries, including Catholic missionaries, but also Orthodox priests investigated for corruption. The issue did grab attention in the Catholic world: according to columnist Jean-Marie of Échos d'Orient, the scandal broke Romanian Orthodoxy into two churches—a truly Orthodox one headed by Safirin; and a [...] "presbyterian" [...] one, under Atanasie. Although his own correspondence with Atanasie was a central piece of the trial, in 1937 Theodorian-Carada admitted that he supported Safirin, and that he and Chiricescu fought their battle with Haret [...] "through the Bishop of Roman". However, he denies that the local Roman Catholic Church had any involvement in the affair: [...] "More than once, Archbishop Netzhammer <b>advised</b> <b>me</b> {{to give up on}} my fight. Same for Vladimir Ghica." [...] As he notes, Haret took pains not {{to have to deal with}} the scandal himself, and was relieved when the Carp cabinet took over in December 1910. As the new Education Minister, Constantin C. Arion demanded a swift resolution.|$|E
