25|$|By 1680 Stradivari {{moved to}} No. 1 Piazza Roma (formerly No. 2 Piazza San Domenico).

25|$|Charles Vine, who {{had been}} beguiled with Kate Claxton's nerve, was far <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> stairs. Claxton's assurances had induced him to wait in his seat for a few minutes, but the crowd growing on the stairs made him uneasy. The sight of men {{trampling}} women appalled him; the din was maddening. He thought everyone was going crazy. Above all, dense smoke was beginning to fill the gallery, reducing visibility and making breathing difficult.|$|E

25|$|Stradivari {{purchased}} a house {{now known as}} No. 1 Piazza Roma (formerly No. 2 Piazza San Domenico) around 1680 for the sum of 7000 lire, 2000 of which he paid {{at the time of}} the purchase. The totality of the house was paid for by 1684. The residence was just doors <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> of several other violin making families of Cremona, including the Amatis and Guarneris. Stradivari probably worked in the loft and attic, and he stayed in this house for the rest of his life.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his presidency, Allende {{remained}} {{at odds with}} the Chilean Congress, which was dominated by the Christian Democratic Party. The Christian Democrats (who had campaigned on a socialist platform in the 1970 elections, but drifted <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> positions during Allende's presidency, eventually forming a coalition with the National Party) , continued to accuse Allende of leading Chile toward a Cuban-style dictatorship, and sought to overturn many of his more radical policies. Allende and his opponents in Congress repeatedly accused each other of undermining the Chilean Constitution and acting undemocratically.|$|E
25|$|When {{the station}} was built, much of Battersea {{was the site of}} heavy {{industry}} while Clapham, a mile south-east of this point, was fashionable. The railway companies, to attract a middle- and upper-class clientele, seized the unindustrial parish calculating that being upon the slopes of Clapham's plateau would only re-inforce this distinction, leading to a long-lasting misunderstanding that the station is in Clapham. The railway companies were not alone in eschewing the name of Battersea; from the 1880s until the 1950s the imposing private houses forming the streets of the district were commonly recorded by property-owning residents as 'Clapham Common N. Side, London' and 'Clapham Common W. Side, London' despite being well <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> park-side streets.|$|E

25|$|Aiken {{was born}} into a Baptist family. As a toddler, in 1980, he {{attended}} Leesville Baptist Church every week. According to his book, , he was involved in Bible school, choir, and the youth group. The book made The New York Times Best Seller List in 2004, debuting at number two. It was written with Allison Glock and published by Random House. Barely mentioning American Idol, Aiken instead turned his focus to the people who had the most influence in his life – his mother, grandparents, siblings, teachers, and friends – and to the importance of religion in his life. He describes himself as a proud Southern Baptist who journeyed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> roots in his late teens in search of a religion with more liberal social policies. He then returned to that church because of family and social ties although he remains at odds with the church on some issues.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{distinction}} between number and magnitude, geometry became the only method that could take into account incommensurable ratios. Because previous numerical foundations were still incompatible with the concept of incommensurability, Greek focus shifted <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> numerical conceptions such as algebra and focused almost exclusively on geometry. In fact, in many cases algebraic conceptions were reformulated into geometrical terms. This may account for why we still conceive of x2 or x3 as x squared and x cubed instead of x second power and x third power. Also crucial to Zeno’s work with incommensurable magnitudes was the fundamental focus on deductive reasoning that resulted from the foundational shattering of earlier Greek mathematics. The realization that some basic conception within the existing theory was at odds with reality necessitated a complete and thorough investigation of the axioms and assumptions that underlie that theory. Out of this necessity, Eudoxus developed his method of exhaustion, a kind of reductio ad absurdum that “…established the deductive organization on the basis of explicit axioms…” as well as “…reinforced the earlier decision to rely on deductive reasoning for proof.” This method of exhaustion {{is the first step in}} the creation of calculus.|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

60|$|There {{was a great}} shout that rang {{through the}} roar of the rapid and far across the {{climbing}} pines.

500|$|Gervais first {{worried that}} he was too {{unfamiliar}} with office protocol in the United States, noting that he [...] "knew everything about this place (in England), the pitfalls, the dos and don'ts. Whereas in America, I don't know if I'm getting it right or not." [...] Despite this, his script writing went [...] "remarkably fast. I suppose that's because we'd been <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> characters for two or three years. It's one of our favorite shows, the American Office."

500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] {{is based}} on Peter Buck's mandolin-playing. Buck said, [...] "The verses {{are the kinds of}} things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't really say {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We are trying to get <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> kind of songs, but like I said before, those are some good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Chad Hillard of Hillydilly wrote that [...] "the host of visuals—while definitely intriguing—prove {{to be quite}} ironic considering her claim that she's <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> drug things". Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern described the clip as [...] "a strangely trippy, kaleidoscopic affair with lots of weird camera tricks" [...] and {{said that it was}} a [...] "simple, yet effective treatment". However, Mark Savage of Discopop gave the video a negative review, writing, [...] " [...] It's a crying shame that the video for [...] Not on Drugs, is so undercooked. The weird editing, the weirder haircuts, the cheap effects and cheaper locations are a woeful disservice to the song's gutsy declaration of love". He also called it a [...] "disappointment" [...] and stated that [...] "maybe just close your eyes and enjoy the song". As of July 2017, it has received over 35 million views on YouTube.|$|E

500|$|The story {{idea came}} from writer Howard Brenton, {{who wanted to}} delve {{into the world of}} suicide bombings, a {{significant}} issue in national security. It became the first episode in Spooks that explicitly portrays Islamic extremism, which Oyelowo described as a [...] "" [...] because of this sensitive issue. The actor was also worried that the plot may [...] "put ideas into people's heads" [...] after the audience would watch the episode. Brenton heavily researched the episode to provide a balanced view. He included characters, such as innocent Muslims who opposed the Islamic extremists, as well as a [...] "Muslim hero" [...] who would thwart the terrorists. The writer still wrote [...] "Nest of Angels" [...] as a classic spy story, where an operative goes undercover to subvert a villainous operation. Director Bharat Nalluri felt that making the hero a Muslim exemplified the balanced view. Series creator David Wolstencroft meanwhile, emphasised that the episode not only showed Islamic extremism, but a more peaceful side of the religion as well, and that the producers should not shy <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> issues.|$|E
500|$|Paine's Age of Reason sparked enough {{anger in}} Britain to {{initiate}} {{not only a}} series of government prosecutions but also a pamphlet war. Around 50 unfavorable replies appeared between 1795 and 1799 alone and refutations were still being published in 1812. Many of these responded specifically to Paine's attack on the Bible in Part II (when Thomas Williams was prosecuted for printing Part II, it became clear its circulation had far exceeded that of Part I). Although critics responded to Paine's analysis of the Bible, they did not usually address his specific arguments. Instead, they advocated a literal reading of the Bible, citing the Bible's long history as evidence of its authority. They also issued ad hominem attacks against Paine, describing him [...] "as an enemy of proper thought and of the morality of decent, enlightened people". Dissenters such as Joseph Priestley who had endorsed the arguments of the Rights of Man turned <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> presented in The Age of Reason. Even the liberal Analytical Review was skeptical of Paine's claims and distanced itself from the book. Paine's deism was simply too radical for these more moderate reformers and they feared being tarred with the brush of extremism.|$|E
500|$|The song, {{which was}} the last one written for the album, was placed {{at the end of the}} album because it [...] "marks a new beginning" [...] for the band, {{which was the}} theme on the album and a theme in Lee's life. In the booklet of The Open Door, she stated that her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler, was the main {{inspiration}} for the song. In the booklet she wrote, [...] "Josh, you are my muse. Nothing inspires me the way you do. Thank you for all my missing pieces. Thank you for your strength and love. Thank you for letting me see myself through your eyes, because only then could I know that I am good enough for you." [...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> bad situations. That's really hard. You have to be really brave and strong about it. After doing that, I felt so amazing. For the first time I felt like I could write a song based on how good I felt.

500|$|When the {{character}} was announced, he {{was described as}} a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self. Norwood expanded on this, saying [...] "when he was in school and the register was being read out and it got to his name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create something even more ridiculous to take away from that. He [...] out of himself and took the power <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason most kids put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something that would get away from that and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff is not something that is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world." [...] Before adopting the [...] "Fatboy" [...] persona, he would adopt personas of men he saw on television, and Norwood said Fatboy was [...] "an awkward kind of child". Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom he has a good relationship, but hustles to hide the fact. He often wears clothing brand Ed Hardy, and his speech has, according to Norwood, a [...] "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.|$|E
