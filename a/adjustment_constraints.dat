Special attention is devoted to dynamic inefficiencies, i. e. underutilizations of the capital stock and labour hoarding. Market disequilibrium is introduced by allowing for a sluggish adjustment of wages and prices. The model of the firm is complemented by explicit aggregation, and the aggregate model is estimated for the FRG for the period 1960 to 1989.

To estimate the models we use data for 1964 - 2005 and for 2005 - 2008 for forecasting. Various models are estimated, wherein loads are segrated into their various classes, with and without restrictions implied by the theory, such as symmetry on asset characteristics and the equivalent of Engel conditions. The best specification {{of the system of}} asset demand equations is a dynamic version which allows for adjustment costs or <b>adjustment</b> <b>constraints</b> in the alignment of the portfolio. It is also demonstrated that a model that diaggregates the various types of bank loans dominates one wherein they are treated as perfect substitutes.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for 3 -D gravity {{inversion}} designed to obtain density contrast models described by subhorizontal layers limited by irregular discontinuity interfaces and models constituted by shallow basins with light infill. It {{is based on a}} previously published inversion method that provides, in a nearly automatic approach, the 3 -D geometry of isolated anomalous bodies. The basic <b>adjustment</b> <b>constraints</b> are model fitness (fitting the anomaly data) and model smoothness (minimizing the total anomalous mass). For models corresponding to subhorizontal layers, we consider an additional minimization condition: the proximity to prescribed horizontal interfaces. This condition is arranged by including an additional weighting (inverse proportional to the distance to the interface) in the covariance matrix for model parameters. The approach works, according a growth process that increases, step by step, the volume of the adjusted anomalous bodies. Some advantages of the method are simultaneous adjustment of a (linear) regional gravity trend, possibility of including simultaneously positive and negative anomalous structures in the model, and unified inversion approach for isolated bodies, basins, and subhorizontal interface structures. We include several simulation examples and an application case (layered model for the volcanic island of Tenerife). Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{experiences}} of the spouses of South African diplomats on a posting in a foreign country. The study focused on the factors that enabled or hindered effective adjustment during posting. Research conducted showed that one of the greatest challenges facing international assignments is that organisations do not only deal with an employee but the whole family, their needs and expectations in the relocation process. The <b>adjustment</b> <b>constraints</b> in this study referred to pre-departure preparation, support provided by the Department, religion and cultural differences or similarities, foreign language, environmental factors and personal health. A qualitative research approach was applied. Data was collected through a semi-structured interview schedule. The study was conducted among nine (9) spouses who returned from posting between 2009 and 2011. Some of the spouses completed the posting whilst others returned prematurely due to adjustment problems. The findings indicated inconsistencies on how the Department prepares and supports spouses before and during posting; and that cultural and religious differences, foreign language competence and environmental factors have a considerable impact on the adjustment of spouses in a foreign country. Social support network, particularly the Embassy staff and diplomatic spouses’ associations play a crucial role in helping spouses to adjust. The study also found that spouses’ inability to adjust can result in early termination of posting. The recommendations are that the Department should review the training curriculum and provide support to spouses during the posting. The study will benefit the department, the diplomats and spouses in future postings. Dissertation (MSW) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2015 Social Work and CriminologyMSWUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|In {{the light}} of new {{political}} initiatives in Latin America, discussions of expanding the monetary cooperation {{in the region have}} intensified and the idea of monetary union is gaining popularity. Since literature on the subject widely dismisses the feasibility of Latin America adopting a single currency in the short- to medium-term, several authors have proposed to follow the European example by establishing a regional exchange rate system, similar to the European Monetary System (EMS), as an intermediate step. While these proposals usually describe the general benefits of an EMS-type system for Latin America, they rarely discuss how such a regional arrangement can institutionally be designed or what the main lessons are, that can be derived from the EMS experience, in order for a Latin American exchange rate system to be successful. Thus, it is the central aim of this paper to address these specific issues by providing a detailed look at the design and functioning of regional fixed rate systems as an intermediate step towards monetary union. For this purpose, first, an overview of the current Latin American initiatives in the field of monetary integration is given, followed by a general analysis of fixed rate systems from an institutional perspective. This analysis presents the basic design choices available to policymakers when creating such a system and describes how the decided upon rules (i. e. the institutional framework) determine the overall monetary <b>adjustment</b> <b>constraints</b> for the participating countries. Further, the paper examines the historic, political and economic rationale as well as the overall institutional design and functioning of a specific fixed rate system, namely the EMS. It is shown that the EMS did not only constitute an efficient monetary arrangement by effectively reducing both nominal and real exchange rate variability in the region, but can also be considered a successful intermediate step towards monetary union in Europe. The paper ends with a discussion of the main lessons drawn from the EMS analysis and their implications for the Latin American prospects of possibly establishing a similar regional exchange rate mechanism.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{critical}} role of labour market imperfections in climate stabilisation costs formation. To do so, we use a dynamic recursive energy-economy model that represents a second best world with market imperfections and short-run <b>adjustments</b> <b>constraints</b> along a long-term growth path. We show {{that the degree of}} rigidity of the labour markets is a central parameter and we conduct a systematic sensitivity analysis of the model results to this parameter. When labour markets are represented as highly flexible, the model results are in the usual range of existing literature, i. e. less than 2 % GDP losses in 2030 for a stabilisation target at 550 ppm CO 2 equivalent. But when labour markets rigidities are accounted for, mitigation costs increase dramatically. In a second time, the article identifies accompanying measures, namely labour subsidies, which guarantees against the risk of large stabilisation costs in the case of high rigidities of the labour markets. That vision complements the usual view that mitigation is a long-term matter that depends on technology, innovation, investment and behavioural change. Here we add the warning that mitigation is also a shorter-term issue and a matter of transition on the labour market...|$|R

40|$|New {{and rich}} panel data {{for a large}} and {{representative}} sample of firms are used to estimate the sensitivity of access to capital to differing ownership structures. The investment behaviour of firms is examined in a dynamic setting {{in the presence of}} <b>adjustment</b> costs, liquidity <b>constraints</b> and imperfect competition. The empirical work is based on the derivation of Euler equations in the presence of symmetric and quadratic adjustment costs and both debt and equity constraints. Whereas the norm is to use ad hoc approaches to model these constraints, our alternative and more consistent leads to the inclusion of financial variables in investment equation in first differences rather than in levels. Our GMM estimates confirm the importance of financial factors in determining investment rates and suggest that firms owned by insiders, especially non-managerial employees, are more prone to be liquidity constrained than are others. Among the other groups, somewhat surprisingly, only domestic outsider owned firms display sensitivity to both measures of the availability of finance, with manager owned firms being sensitive to the availability of external finance, while state owned firms being sensitive to the availability of internal finance.
