25|$|San Antonio International Airport uses {{a system}} for its evening arrival {{aircraft}} using the terminals. Once all flights that are classified as passenger departures have departed, The airport would usually get very crowded in the terminal area, thus having no room for other aircraft. The San Antonio Airport Authority figured that a plan was needed to be placed into action. The plan was to have an <b>arriving</b> <b>passenger</b> aircraft park at a gate that is operated by their airline. Once all the passengers and crew are deplaned, and all servicing is completed on that aircraft, The plane will then be towed by a tug to the West Cargo area to sit parked overnight and give room for other aircraft.|$|E

The overall layout {{is similar to}} that of {{airports}} in Europe and North America, with multiple levels and considerable distances to walk after disembarking from the aircraft. The walk is assisted by escalators and moving walkways. The upper level departures hall, with an area of over , is equipped with 110 check-in counters and as well as flight information display systems. A small shopping mall, known as Buy & Bye, is open to both travellers and the general public. The mall, which includes shops, restaurants and a post office, was planned to be a draw for non-flyers too. On the same level as the mall, passengers enter passport control and the security check. Planes taking off and landing can be viewed from a distinctive tilted glass wall. The arrivals hall is located on the ground floor where there are also 20 additional check-in counters (serving Star Alliance airlines).

50|$|Looe {{passenger}} station {{was built in}} the area known as Shutta, some distance above Looe Bridge. It consisted originally of a single platform 75 feet (23 m) long, with basic facilities.

5000|$|YVR's {{interior}} has {{a uniquely}} British Columbian theme, featuring {{one of the}} most extensive collections of Pacific Northwest Coast Native art in the world, and blues and greens to reflect the colours of the land, sea and sky. This theme was put in place by Vancouver-based Architectura (now Stantec Architecture Ltd). The airport uses a great deal of carpet and vast expanses of glass to let in large amounts of natural light. One of the most noticeable places for an <b>arriving</b> <b>passenger</b> is the International arrivals hall, a large area where customs and immigration procedures are completed. Arriving passengers come down escalators leading to a platform across a large waterfall. The YVR aboriginal art collection includes wooden sculptures and totem poles. Bill Reid's sculpture in bronze, [...] "The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, The Jade Canoe", is displayed in the international departures area. This is the second of two castings of this sculpture; the first casting, [...] "The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, The Black Canoe", is now displayed outside the Canadian Embassy in Washington D.C.

50|$|Construction {{started in}} 1965 {{on a new}} airport to handle travel to nearby naval bases.

A new idea at JIA was separating departing and <b>arriving</b> <b>passengers</b> on different sides of the terminal (as {{can be seen in}} the photo on this page). This is no longer the case, and the airport (which has greatly expanded since the picture was taken) now uses the more typical layout with departing passengers on an upper level with an elevated roadway, and <b>arriving</b> <b>passengers</b> on the lower level.|$|R
5000|$|It is the {{interpretation}} of the rules that make immigration law so controversial. The practicalities of assessing large numbers of people arriving at ports mean that a great deal of discretion is given to the immigration officer, (although less now than was once the case). While the officer must obtain the approval of a Chief Immigration Officer or Inspector to refuse someone entry the way in which interviews are conducted and recorded are based on a lower level of proof than those in other areas of law enforcement. The immigration rules for visitors say that the immigration officer must be [...] "satisfied" [...] that the person is a genuine visitor not intending to stay longer than the rules allow and is not intending to seek employment. The idea that a relatively low ranking officer merely has to satisfy himself or herself as to the person intentions rather than prove an offence, {{as is the case in}} criminal matters, is a long-standing cause of legal and legislative tension. The level of proof is effectively a balance of probabilities rather than that of an overwhelming case being proven against the <b>arriving</b> <b>passenger.</b> In practice the immigration officer is required to conduct an in-depth interview, seek corroborative evidence from other sources and present a compelling case to a Chief Immigration Officer before refusing the person. The work of a port based immigration officer is to sift arriving passengers to detect those whose accounts of their intentions give some cause for concern. The officer will briefly interview all arriving people who are not British Citizens or EU nationals, check their document for alterations or forgery, verify any entry clearances held, assess their travel history against the stamps in their passport, check them against warnings lists and do all of this, usually, in less than two minutes. If the officer is satisfied they will stamp the passport with one of a variety of wordings, (conditions), depending on the reason for the persons stay and apply a time limit according to pre-set criteria. The pressure on port immigration officers is to do this quickly so as to satisfy various targets concerning waiting times. There has never been a quota or target for detecting and refusing inadmissible passengers - the performance standards for immigration officers at ports have always revolved around the quality of interviewing, decision making and their investigative qualities.|$|E
40|$|The CleanEra {{project is}} {{initiated}} by the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology. Significant reduction of noise impact on perimeters of airports via arrival trajectory optimization is considered {{as one of the}} major targets of the project. In this paper, an aircraft model and its acoustic performance are introduced to assist the development of the optimization tool since the CleaenEra project is still ongoing. Interval analysis is explained in details because interval algebra is employed to deal with real intervals rather than real numbers in the so-called interval-related optimization algorithms. The largest advantage of such algorithms is that they are capable of finding the global optimum out of the multiple local minima to a given optimization problem. Two numerical examples are presented to show the usefulness of such algorithms while solving both static and dynamic optimization problems. In the end, a third example is given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed optimization tool to trajectory optimization for <b>arriving</b> <b>passenger</b> aircraft.

40|$|Abstractâ€”In the taxicab industry, {{a long-standing}} {{challenge}} {{is how to}} reduce taxicabs â€™ miles spent without fares, i. e., cruising miles. The current solutions for this challenge usually depend on passengers to actively provide their locations in advance for pickups. To address this challenge without the burden on passengers, in this paper, we propose a cruising system, pCruise, for taxicab drivers to find efficient routes to pick up passengers to reduce cruising miles. According to the real-time pick-up events from nearby taxicabs, pCruise characterizes a cruising process with a cruising graph, and assigns weights on edges of the cruising graph to indicate the utility of cruising corresponding road segments. Our weighting process considers the number of nearby passengers and taxicabs together in real-time, aiming at two scenarios where taxicabs are explicitly or implicitly coordinated with each other. Based on a weighted cruising graph, when a taxicab becomes vacant, pCruise provides a distributed online scheduling strategy to obtain and update an efficient cruising route with the minimum length {{and at least one}} <b>arriving</b> <b>passenger.</b> We evaluate pCruise based on a real-world GPS dataset from a Chinese city Shenzhen with 14; 000 taxicabs. The evaluation results show that pCruise assists taxicab drivers to reduce cruising miles by 42 percent on average. Index Termsâ€”Taxicab network, dispatching, cruising mile reduction Ã‡...|$|E
