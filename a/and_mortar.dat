5|$|After {{the capture}} of Bréville, the Germans never seriously {{attempted}} {{to break through the}} airborne division's lines again. The British division only being subjected to sporadic artillery <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> fire. This lasted until 17August, when the Germans started to withdraw and the 6th Airborne Division advanced to the River Seine.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} the infantry battalions of the 6th Division adopted the Australian battalion structure of two rifle companies, a support company, a {{light machine gun}} platoon and an administrative headquarters, they soon switched to the British structure with four rifle companies– each consisting of three platoons with three sections– and a headquarters company consisting of signals, carrier, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administrative <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> platoons.|$|E
5|$|At 13:30 Gay {{ordered the}} 8th Cavalry Regiment to {{withdraw}} its men off Ka-san. Gay {{believed he had}} insufficient forces to secure and hold it and that the North Koreans had insufficient ammunition to exploit its possession as an observation point for directing artillery <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> fire. However, Holley could not reach anyone in D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion.|$|E
50|$|The {{exercise}} {{involved the}} 270th Rifle Division, 320 planes, 600 tanks and self-propelled guns, 600 armoured personnel carriers, 500 artillery pieces <b>and</b> <b>mortars</b> <b>and</b> 6,000 automobiles.|$|R

5|$|Crossing {{points in}} the defence network– bridges, tunnels and other weak spots– were called nodes or points of resistance. These were {{fortified}} with removable road blocks, barbed wire entanglements, and land mines. These passive defences were overlooked by trench works, gun <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> emplacements, and pillboxes. In places entire villages were fortified using barriers of scaffolding, sandbagged positions and loopholes in existing buildings.|$|E
5|$|During the launch, Launch Pad 39A {{sustained}} substantial damage, {{more than}} had been seen on any previous launch. Following liftoff, inspectors discovered that bricks <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> from the launch pad's base had been thrown {{as far as the}} perimeter fence, a distance of 1,500 feet (457m).|$|E
5|$|The Grand Palace has twelve gates (ประตู, Pratu, {{literally}} a door), three along {{each of the}} four walls.

5|$|The link up {{occurred}} on 3 December {{and the following}} day a composite force from the 2/32nd and 2/43rd Infantry Battalions took over the advance to the Christmas Hills, which were secured on 7 December after the Japanese abandoned the position {{in the wake of}} a series of flanking moves by the Australians, an intense artillery <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> bombardment and a frontal assault.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the 3rd Battalion, 27th Infantry, to hold the high knob on Battle Mountain after its attacks on September 8 and 9, the 24th Infantry stopped trying to retake Battle Mountain. K Company, 24th Infantry, and C Company, 65th Engineer Combat Battalion, dug in on the hill east of and beneath Battle Mountain, {{fortified}} their position with barbed wire and mine fields, and placed registered artillery <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> fires on all approaches to the position. The regimental commander planned to contain the North Koreans on Battle Mountain by artillery <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> fire. The North Koreans on Battle Mountain attacked the lower American defensive position many times on subsequent nights, but all their attacks were driven off. After a month of almost constant battle the North Koreans gained and held possession of the crest of Battle Mountain. The defensive fires of the 24th Regiment and attached artillery, however, contained them there and they were unable to exploit the possession on the peak or attack further.|$|E
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} patrol from the 13th Parachute Battalion reported a large gathering of Germans in Bréville and suspected an attack was imminent. At 08:00 a massive artillery <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> bombardment fell along the 1st Special Service Brigade lines, while the 857th Grenadier Regiment, which had {{gathered in the}} village, attacked No. 6 Commando. By 10:30, the attack on No. 6 Commando had been driven back, but to their left at Hauger No.4 Commandos had to win a hand-to-hand fight before the Germans withdrew. Twice more during the day the commandos were attacked unsuccessfully, from Sallenelles {{in the north and}} again from Bréville.|$|E

5|$|Amidst growing {{concerns}} amongst Australian {{military commanders}} about Japanese intentions, the scheduled {{replacement of the}} 22nd Brigade was cancelled, and the 2/18th remained in Seremban until they were transported east to Jemaluang in August. The following month they were sent north to Mersing, which, situated {{on the east coast}} of the Malay Peninsula, was considered a likely place for a Japanese landing as it offered a short route of advance towards Singapore. At Mersing, the battalion was set to work digging defensive positions and constructing wire obstacles, punctuated by familiarisation patrols and anti-aircraft, anti-gas <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> training.|$|E
5|$|Around 10:00 Kemal and the 1st Battalion, 57th Infantry {{were the}} first to arrive in the area between Scrubby Knoll and Chunuk Bair. From the knoll Kemal was able to observe the landings. He ordered the {{artillery}} battery to set up on the knoll, and the 1st Battalion to attack Baby 700 <b>and</b> <b>Mortar</b> Ridge from the North-East, while the 2nd Battalion would simultaneously circle around and attack Baby 700 from the West. The 3rd Battalion would for the moment be held in reserve. At 10:30 Kemal informed II Corps he was attacking.|$|E
5|$|Around midday the Germans {{opened up}} an {{artillery}} <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> barrage that caused casualties among the ridge's defenders and lasted {{for the entire}} afternoon. At about the same time, Kampfgruppe Weidinger seized an important road junction northeast of Coudehard. Several units of the 10th SS, 12th SS, and 116th Panzer Divisions managed to clear a corridor past Point 262N, and by mid afternoon about 10,000 German troops had passed out of the pocket.|$|E

5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> fire. Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them. It {{was less than a}} foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00 {{the first}} shells of what {{proved to be}} a two-hour North Korean {{artillery}} <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon. As the barrage rolled on, North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire. At 23:00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon, forcing it from the hill after a short fight. Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line.|$|E
5|$|At around 10:00am, the Israelis renewed the attack, {{moving toward}} Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. The paratroopers at Jebel Mariam became engaged in intense {{fighting}} but, with their advantageous position, {{were able to}} repel the attack by late afternoon. Meanwhile, the Israelis concentrated artillery <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> fire against the Sa'iqa positions at Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. At noon, advance Israeli elements engaged with a Sa'iqa reconnaissance unit, and the Israelis lost two tanks and a half-track. At 1:00pm, an Israeli paratrooper company attacked Abu 'Atwa without first scouting ahead, and was ambushed and annihilated. The attack ended after paratroopers suffered over fifty casualties and lost four tanks.|$|E
50|$|In 1807, Copenhagen was burnt by a British {{attack with}} more than 14,000 various {{missiles}} {{in the form of}} metal balls, explosive and incendiary bombs from cannons <b>and</b> <b>mortars,</b> <b>and</b> about 300 Congreve rockets.|$|R

5|$|At {{positions}} west of Hill 881 South {{and north}} of Co Roc Ridge, {{across the border in}} Laos, the North Vietnamese established artillery, rocket, <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> positions from which to launch attacks by fire on the base and to support its ground operations. The NVA 130mm and 152mm artillery pieces, and 122mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105mm and 155mm howitzers. This range overmatch was used by the North Vietnamese to avoid counter-battery fire. They were assisted in their emplacement efforts by the continuing bad weather of the winter monsoon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 October the allied {{artillery}} <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> bombardment began, targeting Chinese positions on the Hinge. Hassett moved the 3 RAR tactical headquarters on to Hill 317 just before the assaulting troops stepped off the line of departure, allowing him to direct the battle from a forward position and to co-ordinate fire support. Waiting for the fog to lift so that the artillery could fire until the last safe moment, the attack finally began at 08:00. B Company moved off down the ridgeline, with two-up and one-in-depth, using the trees and long grass for concealment. Initially it seemed that the Chinese had withdrawn during the night, when suddenly the lead Australian platoons were engulfed by small arms fire from their rear. A series of intense fire-fights ensued as the Australians fought back and by 09:20 the Hinge finally fell, with the Australians losing two killed and 20 wounded. Chinese casualties included more than 20 killed. As a result of the fighting Captain Henry Nicholls and Lieutenant Jim Hughes were awarded the Military Cross, while Corporal J. Park and Corporal E.F. Bosworth were awarded the Military Medal. Yet even as the surviving Chinese withdrew, artillery <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> fire began to fall on the Hinge. B Company moved quickly to consolidate the position, but were hampered by the shelling, while they now faced a pressing shortage of ammunition and difficulties evacuating their casualties.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{division}} did not fare well, though it improved quickly. Its anti-aircraft and armor assets {{were used as}} mobile artillery, which continuously pounded Chinese positions. The 45th, in turn, was under constant artillery <b>and</b> <b>mortar</b> attack. It also conducted constant small-unit patrols along the border seeking to engage Chinese outposts or patrols. These small-unit actions made {{up the majority of}} {{the division}}'s combat in Korea. Chinese troops were well dug-in and better trained than the troops of the inexperienced 45th, and it suffered casualties and frequently had to disengage when it was attacked.|$|E
