40|$|AbstractThe ovine {{adenovirus}} isolate OAV 287 {{represents a}} new group of adenoviruses that are distinct from the Mast- and <b>Aviadenoviruses</b> by several criteria, including genome arrangement. The OAV major late promoter and some late transcripts were previously mapped. To better define the probable coding sequences and to identify the approximate location of early promoters a partial transcription map of the genome was elucidated using a PCR-based approach. This was possible because the complete nucleotide sequence of the genome was known. The strategy permitted the identification of transcription start sites and RNA splice junctions and allowed the approximate location of promoters in the lefthand end, IVa 2, E 2, P 32 K, and E 4 regions to be deduced. The data showed that lefthand end and E 4 regions are controlled by three and two temporally distinct promoters, respectively. The E 2 region is controlled by a single promoter, in contrast to Mastadenoviruses, where E 2 expression is controlled by the E 2 A and E 2 B promoters. The p 32 kDa structural protein at the lefthand end and the IVa 2 protein are also expressed from their own promoters.

40|$|AbstractAn ovine adenovirus, {{which is}} phylogenetically {{distinct}} from the Mastadeno- and <b>Aviadenoviruses,</b> was used to construct recombinants in which reporter genes were expressed from the OAV major late, or human cytomegalovirus promoters. It was demonstrated by transgene expression that OAV could infect bovine nasal turbinate and rabbit kidney cells {{as well as a}} range of human cell types, including lung and foreskin fibroblasts as well as liver, prostate, breast, colon, and retinal lines. Some human lines, e. g., 293 and LNCaP were not detectably infected. Infection occurred even though OAV has a fiber protein with a unique cell binding domain and a penton protein that lacks the integrin-binding Arg–Gly–Asp motif which facilitates entry by human adenoviruses. Most cell lines showed little or no ill effect for several days after infection but a prominent cytopathic effect appeared in fibroblasts after 3 – 4 days. However, no viral DNA synthesis was detected and replication was abortive. Viral promoter activity during infection of nonpermissive cell types was assayed by RT-PCR. Early promoter activity was detectable in some, but not all cell types. In a liver and a colon carcinoma cell line, none of the promoters examined was significantly active, even when a higher multiplicity of infection was used. Major late promoter activity was not detectable in any cell type. The lack of DNA replication and MLP function suggests that a critical transition from early to late gene expression does not occur during abortive infection by OAV...|$|E
40|$|AbstractActivation of the {{adenoviral}} E 2 promoter is {{an early}} step in adenovirus gene expression. For members of the mast- and <b>aviadenoviruses,</b> this requires induction of the cellular transcription factor E 2 F by virally encoded gene products such as E 1 A, E 4 orf 6 / 7 and orf 22 /GAM- 1. The newly recognized genus atadenovirus, of which the ovine isolate OAdV is the prototype, lacks any sequence homology to those genes. To find a possible link between E 2 promoter activation and OAdV gene expression, we utilized a screening method to search for genes within the OAdV genome that were capable of stimulating the viral E 2 promoter. One such gene, E 43, was identified within the proposed E 4 region toward the right-hand end of the OAdV genome. The E 43 gene product was also found {{to be capable of}} stimulating E 2 F- 1 -dependent gene expression. A closer inspection of the E 2 promoter revealed the presence of a non-palindromic E 2 F binding site within the OAdV E 2 promoter. Mutation of this site markedly reduced both E 2 F- 1 - and E 43 -dependent promoter activation. Moreover, a direct protein–protein interaction of the E 43 gene product with E 2 F, but not with the retinoblastoma protein pRb, suggested a possible cooperation between these two proteins in activating the E 2 promoter. The importance of the E 43 gene product for virus replication is also underlined by the finding that an OAdV recombinant with a functionally inactivated E 43 gene showed severely inhibited virus growth...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAdenoviruses of the Mastadenovirus and Aviadenovirus genera {{are able}} to {{transform}} certain cell types and induce tumor formation in susceptible animals. For the mastadenoviruses the E 1 A/B sequences are largely responsible for these properties but E 4 sequences may also be involved. The transforming sequences of the <b>aviadenoviruses,</b> which lack E 1 A/B and E 4 homologues, {{have not yet been}} fully identified. The recent proposal for a third genus of adenoviruses, which apparently lack an E 1 A homologue and have weak E 1 B homology, prompted an examination of the transforming properties of ovine adenovirus OAV 287 (OAV), the prototype member of the new group. When OAV and human adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5) were used to infect primary rat embryo cells, transformed foci developed in Ad 5 - but not in OAV-infected cultures. Similarly, after plasmid transfection, baby rat kidney cells were transformed by Ad 5 E 1 A/B but not by OAV sequences. When CSL 503 cells, an ovine cell line that is permissive for OAV, were transfected with Ad 5 E 1 A/B sequences, transformed foci again appeared. However, plasmids or fragments containing complete or partial OAV genome sequences did not detectably transform CSL 503 cells under the same conditions. When Ad 5 E 1 A/B sequences were incorporated into the complete OAV genome and transfected, transformed clones were again obtained, showing that the gene dosage and transfection conditions were not limiting for transformation. The provision of Ad 5 E 1 A and OAV sequences in combination marginally increased the number of morphologically altered foci in baby rat kidney cells but failed to induce multilayered focus formation. The data suggest that OAV lacks transforming functions in the cell types examined. Additional information suggesting that OAV may have a fundamentally distinct strategy for replication compared with other Ads is discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>Aviadenovirus</b> (FAdV) {{was investigated in}} chickens from the poultry industry of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The investigation was conducted due to the scarcity of recent data {{in the country and}} its description in neighboring countries. For this purpose, livers were collected from layer chicks (n= 25), older layers (n= 25), broilers (n= 300), and livers (n= 25) and stool (n= 25) samples from broiler breeders, representing the major poultry regions of the state. FAdV DNA was demonstrated using a previously described PCR protocol for amplifying part of the hexon gene encoding sequence. FAdV was found in layer chicks (36 %), widespread (100 %) in older layers, and with regional differences in broilers (24 - 86 %). Although all broiler breeder stools were negative, FAdV DNA was detected in livers (16 %, 4 / 25) of stool-negative birds. In order to obtain additional information on the circulation of the infection, livers of subsistence chickens collected from one poultry intensive region, were evaluated (n = 12), with FAdV being detected in all samples. FAdV was found in young and old layers, broilers, broiler breeders and free-range chickens, and results suggest the circulation of FAdV among different types of chickens. The detection in older layer chickens may indicate an extended risk of horizontal transmission in regions of Minas Gerais with mixed activity of egg and meat type chickens and poor biosecurity strategies. The infection in breeders may indicate vertical transmission and the continuous production of infected progenies.

Sixty-two Northern aplomado and six peregrine falcons died. Epidemiologic analyses indicated a point source epizootic, horizontal transmission, and increased relative risk associated with cross-species brooding of eggs.

They can infect all 5 major vertebrate classes but only <b>Aviadenovirus</b> infecting birds and Mastadenovirus infecting mammals have been well studied. CELO (chicken embryo lethal orphan) adenovirus is responsible for mild respiratory pathologies in birds. Most studies on CELO virus have focussed on its genome sequence and organisation whereas the structural work on CELO proteins has only recently started. Contrary to most adenoviruses, the vertices of CELO virus reveal pentons with two fibres of different lengths. The distal parts (or head) of those fibres are involved in cellular receptor binding. Here we have determined the atomic structure of the short-fibre head of CELO (amino acids 201 – 410) at 2. 0  Å resolution. Despite low sequence identity, this structure is conserved {{compared to the other}} adenovirus fibre heads. We have used the existing CELO long-fibre head structure and the one we show here for a structure-based alignment of 11 known adenovirus fibre heads which was subsequently used for the construction of an evolutionary tree.

A substantial variation {{in the degree of}} susceptibility was observed with mortalities of 100 and 96 % in the FAdV-E and D infected SPF broiler groups, respectively, whereas in the groups of infected SPF layers mortalities of only 20 and 8 % were noticed. Significant changes in clinical chemistry analytes of all infected birds together with histopathological lesions indicated impairment of liver and pancreas integrity and functions. Furthermore, significantly lower blood glucose concentrations were recorded at peak of infection in both inoculated SPF broiler groups, in comparison to the control group, corresponding to a hypoglycaemic status. High viral loads were determined in liver and pancreas of SPF broilers already at 4  days post-infection (dpi), in comparison to SPF layers, indicating a somewhat faster viral replication in the target organs. Overall, highest values were noticed in the pancreas of SPF broilers independent of the virus used for infection.

In vivo targeting of a therapeutic gene to specific cells has then become {{a major issue in}} gene therapy. The Ad fiber protein largely determines viral tropism through interaction with specific receptors. Hereto, we constructed a set of HAdV 5 vectors carrying chimeric fibers with knob domains from nonhuman AdV, namely from the FAdV- 1 (<b>Aviadenovirus),</b> DAdV- 1, and BAdV- 4 (Atadenovirus). Correspondents viruses were produced using an established new HEK 293 cell line, which express the HAdV 2 fiber. Recombinant HAdV harboring chimeric fibers constituted of the N-terminal domain of HAdV 2, and knob domain of bovine adenovirus type 4 (BAdV- 4) demonstrated the greatest reduction in fiber-mediated gene transfer into human cells expressing the hCAR. Moreover, this vector infects with a better efficiency than vector with wild-type fiber, the Chinese Hamster Ovarian (CHO) and SKOV 3 cell lines, both from ovarian origin, hamster and human, respectively. These studies support the concept that changing the fiber knob domain to ablate hCAR interaction should result in a de- or retargeted adenoviral vector. The adenoviral vector with the chimeric HAdV 2 /BAdV- 4 fiber lacking hCAR interaction and with an ovarian cell tropism could be a nice candidate to elaborate vectors for ovarian tumor therapy...|$|R

Paramyxoviruses belong to the Paramyxoviridae family and Avulovirus genus that includes nine serotypes (APMV 1 to 9). Avian adenoviruses belong to the Adenoviridae family and <b>Aviadenovirus</b> genus. In pigeons, cause classical adenovirosis and necrotizing hepatitis. The respiratory and enteric tracts are common targets of coronavirus. They belong to the Coronaviridae family and to 3 a and 3 c groups.

Molecular characterization has identified the falcon virus as a new member of the <b>aviadenovirus</b> group (M. Schrenzel, J. L. Oaks, D. Rotstein, G. Maalouf, E. Snook, C. Sandfort, and B. Rideout, J. Clin. Microbiol. 43 : 3402 - 3413, 2005). In this study, the virus was successfully isolated and propagated in peregrine falcon embryo fibroblasts, in which it caused visible and reproducible cytopathology. Testing for serum neutralizing antibodies found that infection with this virus was limited almost exclusively to falcons. Serology also found that wild and captive peregrine falcons had high seropositivity rates of 80 % and 100 %, respectively, although clinical disease was rarely reported in this species. These data implicate peregrine falcons as the natural host and primary reservoir for the virus. Other species of North American falcons, including aplomado falcons, had lower seropositivity rates of 43 to 57 %. Falcon species of tropical and/or island origin were uniformly seronegative, although deaths among adults of these species have been described, suggesting they are highly susceptible. Chickens and quail were uniformly seronegative and not susceptible to infection, indicating that fowl were not the source of infection.

A total of 218 000 chickens, 2 – 29 days of age, were affected over a 1 -year period, all testing positive by microscopy, virus isolation and confirmation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Affected birds were depressed, lost body weight, were weak and had watery droppings. Pathological changes observed during necropsy indicated consistent changes in the liver, characterised by hepatomegaly, cholestasis and hepatitis. Lesions were also discernible in the spleen, kidney and gizzard wall and were characterised by splenomegaly, pinpoint haemorrhages, nephritis with haemorrhage, visceral gout and serosal ecchymosis of the gizzard wall.

40|$|Fowl {{adenovirus}} (FAdV) is {{a member}} of the genus <b>Aviadenovirus</b> and causes a number of economically important poultry diseases. One of these diseases, inclusion body hepatitis (IBH), has a worldwide distribution and is characterised by acute mortality (5 % – 20 %) in production chickens. The disease was first described in the United States of America in 1963 and has also been reported in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Ireland, but until now, not in South Africa. Adenoviruses isolated from the first outbreak of IBH in South Africa were able to reproduce the disease in chicken embryo livers. The aim of the present study was to characterise the viruses and determine the pathogenicity of the FAdV strains responsible for the first reported case of IBH in South Africa. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the L 1 loop region of the fowl adenovirus hexon gene using degenerate primer pair hexon A/B was used to identify the viruses that were isolated. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the amplification products was used for the differentiation of 14 isolates of fowl adenovirus. Sequencing of the PCR products followed by amino acid comparison and phylogenetic analysis using the L 1 loop region of the hexon protein was done to determine the identity of the isolates. Amino acid sequences of the hexon genes of all the South African isolates were compared with those of reference strains representing FAdV species. Amino acid comparison of 12 South Africa field isolates to FAdV reference strains revealed a high sequence identity (> 93. 33 %) with reference strains T 8 -A and 764. Two of the isolates had high sequence identity (93. 40 %) with reference strains P 7 -A, C 2 B and SR 48. Phylogenetic analysis of the L 1 loop region of the hexon protein of all 14 South African isolates was consistent with their RFLP clusters.

This virus belongs to family Adenoviridae and genus <b>Aviadenovirus.</b> In recent years, Hydropericardium syndrome (HPS) has {{emerged as one of the}} important diseases occurring in Pakistan and has caused heavy economic loss. Efforts have been made to develop conventional vaccines against this disease. These vaccines were formulated from infected liver homogenate. Unfortunately, formalin-inactivated liver organ vaccines failed to protect the poultry industry in the country. Hence, there is a need to develop a suitable vaccine to combat this disease. Currently, recombinant vaccine candidates are being developed for the prevention and control of some infectious diseases in several laboratories elsewhere. The present work is an effort to develop a recombinant protein, using molecular biology, biotechnological and immunological approaches for effective control and diagnosis of HPS. In the present study, the viral particle was isolated from natural outbreak of Hydropericardium syndrome in broilers, Punjab province of Pakistan using conventional methods. The existence of the virus was initially observed by Scanning Electron Microscopic examination. Icosahedral shaped viral particles of 70 â€“ 80 nm in diameter were observed. Further, the presence of FAdV was confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) by amplification of 730 bp variable region (L 1 and part of P 1 loop) of hexon gene. DNA sequence analysis and Phylogenetic analysis of the PCR product revealed that isolate is closely related with Indian fowl adenovirus â€“ 4 isolate. To investigate which gene product encoded by fowl adenovirus plays vital role in immune response against the disease, two genes representing structural proteins of the virus (Penton base & short fiber) and one gene representing non structural protein (100 K) were selected to develop recombinant constructs. To achieve this, the Penton base (1587 bp), Short fiber (1437 bp) and 100 K (2397 bp) genes were amplified by PCR and cloned in an expression vector (pET 28 a). The histidine residues along with thrombin protease site were engineered upstream to inserts (viral genes). The presence of recombinant DNA fragments were confirmed by double digestion method, PCR amplification of insert using gene specific primers and DNA sequencing of the inserts. Nucleotide sequences of inserts revealed that two genes (Penton base and Short fiber) of local isolate have > 98 % homology with the Indian FAdV- 4 isolates, while one gene (100 K) has 96 % homology with the Russian FAdV- 10 isolate. The recombinant constructs were expressed in E. coli. The expression of recombinant proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of histidine tagged recombinant proteins i. e. short fiber (60 Kda), penton base (65 Kda) and 100 K (95 Kda) using anti His tag antibody. The three recombinant proteins were purified by Nickle affinity chromatography. The biological and immunological activity of recombinant proteins were assessed for potential use as antigen in vaccine and diagnostic (ELISA). The purified recombinant proteins were adjuvanted separately with Freundâ€™s complete adjuvant and broilers were immunized. ELISA test was performed and antibody titers were determined against the respective recombinant proteins. The results indicated that protein constructs pSMJ- 2 (penton base) and pSMJ- 3 (short fiber) are more immunogenic antigens as compared to protein construct pSMJ- 1 (100 K) and commercial vaccine. Challenge protection test also proved that penton base (pSMJ- 2) and short fiber (pSMJ- 3) protein constructs conferred 90 % and 80 % protection respectively against pathogenic virus challenge. Whereas 100 K (pSMJ- 1) protein construct and commercial inactivated vaccine provided 50 % and 70 % protection respectively. The results obtained by ELISA and challenge test in this study indicated that the constructed recombinant proteins are suitable candidates to develop subunit vacci...|$|R
