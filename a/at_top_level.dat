5|$|In 2007 {{the station}} {{underwent}} a major modernisation, removing the murals {{installed on the}} Central and Bakerloo line platforms in the 1980s and replacing them with plain white tiles, in a style {{similar to those used}} when the station opened in 1900. One 1980s mural remains on one of the platforms. The Central line platform works were substantially complete and a new Station Operations Room <b>at</b> <b>top</b> <b>level</b> opened. This enabled the entire CCTV system to be switched over to new recordable digital technology. The original motifs designed by Hans Unger on the Victoria line platforms were restored.|$|E

He travelled to Europe and competed <b>at</b> <b>top</b> <b>level</b> meets, including Athletissima, before going on to finish as runner-up at the 2004 Ibero-American Championships in Athletics behind Spain's Joan Lino Martínez. He made his first appearance at the Olympics at the 2004 Athens Games, where he finished eighth in his qualifier with a jump of 7.98m but {{did not make the}} final. He represented the NAU Lumberjacks in the 2005 indoor season and broke two national indoor records, running 6.76seconds for the 60 metres and clearing 8.00m for the long jump.|$|E

500|$|Chew Valley Lake {{is in the}} Chew Valley at the {{northern}} edge of the Mendip Hills, surrounded by meadows and woods and close to the villages of Chew Stoke, Chew Magna and Bishop Sutton. When it was built in the 1950s, its 1,200acres (4.9km²) were flooded with 4,500millionimperial gallons (20,000,000m³) of water from the Mendip hills, with a catchment area of 14,000acres (57km²). It is shallow, with an average depth of 14ft (4m) <b>at</b> <b>top</b> <b>level</b> and a maximum depth of just 37ft (11m). It is fed by small rivers, and it flows into the River Chew for 17miles (27km) before it joins the Avon to head out to sea. The deepest part is near the dam and the outlet tower, where the steeply sloping shores of Walley Bank and the north shore result in depths of up to 20ft (6m). [...] "Denny Island", above the surface throughout the year, is wooded and provides a habitat for wildlife.|$|E
500|$|Lindwall {{returned}} to England in 1953, {{the site of}} his triumph five years earlier. Lindwall was to exhibit performances that were rated higher than during the Invincibles tour. Roland Perry wrote that Lindwall [...] "reached his zenith, producing a sustained, sensational season of brilliant, powerful and intelligent fast bowling". In the tour matches {{leading up to the}} Test, Lindwall set about gaining a psychological advantage over England's leading batsmen. In doing so, he could leave them in a poor state leading up to the Test, potentially curtailing their ability to win matches. In a match against Yorkshire, Lindwall bowled Hutton with an inswinger yorker, something he had developed the previous year. During a match against the country champions Surrey at The Oval, Lindwall came across Peter May, who was regarded as the best young English batsman to emerge from the post-war era. Lindwall's first over to May consisted of three inswingers and three outswingers, leaving him perplexed and uncertain about his position <b>at</b> <b>top</b> <b>level</b> cricket. Although Lindwall did not dismiss May, he regarded it as his best over at any level of cricket. The unsettled May was bowled in the following over by Ron Archer. Lindwall's performances saw him regarded as the finest fast bowler of his time.|$|E
2500|$|Morris {{returned}} {{at home to}} Grimsby Town, a 3–0 win {{in which}} Wheldon scored in his fifth consecutive Alliance match. He scored his tenth goal in six Alliance matches the next week, away to Walsall Town Swifts, a match in which Walsall had the better {{of the first half}} but were outplayed in the second as Heath won 4–3. The result left the club still able to secure second place. A large holiday crowd at Plumstead saw Royal Arsenal have the better of a Good Friday friendly but lose to a second-half goal scored by Billy Walton. On Saturday, Heath played Nottingham Forest in an eventful game. Sloppy defending by Bayley and Hollis allowed Forest's Oscroft to open the scoring, but after half an hour he was [...] "badly hurt" [...] when charged by Jenkyns [...] "in an unnecessarily severe manner". Their second goal was allowed despite apparently passing over rather than under the crossbar, clearly illustrating the value of goal nets, which were not yet required even <b>at</b> <b>top</b> <b>level.</b> Thereafter Forest defended their lead, which would confirm them as Alliance champions, and {{towards the end of the}} game, the [...] "marked preference shown by several of the players for their opponents instead of the ball caus the play to degenerate from the high standard which marked the early stages". A 2–0 win at Crewe Alexandra gave Small Heath a third-place finish and took Wheldon's total for the season to 21 goals in 22 Alliance matches.|$|E
