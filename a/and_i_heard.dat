Petty said, [...] "Pearson could beat you on a short track, he could beat you on a superspeedway, he could beat you on a road course, he could beat you on a dirt track. It didn't hurt as bad to lose to Pearson as it did {{to some of the}} others, because I knew how good he was."

He told Al Arabiya that [...] "I returned from Davos to Egypt because of the current situation in Egypt. The new Prime Minister had contacted me for the same position in the new cabinet, I refused because I want fresh blood." [...] Regarding the travel ban, he commented, [...] "I had no idea about the accusations, I served for six and half years and I am completely ready to face any accusation. No one had informed me of this decision <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> it from the news." [...] He was considered a possible candidate for Prime Minister before the protests.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the loss}} limited Monk as a performer, he {{recorded}} several albums of original music and received much {{attention from the}} press, which led Colomby to argue to the SLA that he was [...] "a drug-free, law-abiding citizen, whose productivity and growing popularity as a recording artist demonstrates his standing as a responsible working musician". In May 1957, the SLA said Monk needed to get a club owner to hire him first, so Colomby considered the Five Spot Café: [...] "I {{wanted to find a}} place that was small. I once drove past this place in the Village and there was a bar <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> music ... A place where poets hung out." [...] Joe Termini, who co-owned the venue with his brother Iggy, testified at Monk's police hearing, which resulted in his card being reinstated.|$|E

500|$|On March 28, 2012, Jessica Sanchez, a {{contestant}} of {{the eleventh}} season of American Idol, covered [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] performing a slow-tempo ballad {{version of the}} song accompanied at the beginning by harps. Her performance received favorable comments and a standing ovation from the judges of the show. Jennifer Lopez commented, [...] "You did a beautiful job on it...If I was Beyoncé and I was home <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that, I'd be like 'I got {{to do that in}} my next concert, slow that one down.'" [...] Steven Tyler described Sanchez's performance as [...] "great" [...] while Randy Jackson noted that it was [...] "unbelievable, sensational". James Montgomery of MTV News graded her performance with a B, and called the cover [...] "a bit of an odd choice, and yet also a supremely confident one". He added, [...] "For once, she pulled things back, and maybe suffered a bit for doing so, but there were still plenty of subtly great moments, particularly in the verses. Might not have been her best—it definitely lacked in vocal fireworks...And really, it was good enough".|$|E
500|$|Lody's {{information}} was entirely inaccurate {{and had been}} gleaned, as he was to admit at his trial, purely from rumours: [...] "I heard it in the boarding-house <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> it in the barber's shop." [...] His second letter, in German, was addressed to [...] "Herr Stammer" [...] at German naval intelligence in Courbierestrasse, Berlin, and contained details of British naval losses and vessels stationed at Leith and Grangemouth. He had obtained details of the naval vessels simply by climbing Calton Hill in Edinburgh and observing the panorama from the summit, and by taking a promenade along the seafront at Grangemouth, used by thousands of citizens as a popular excursion. He {{was worried about the}} risks that he was taking and stated in his letter that he would not go near any place where he could be challenged, or where barricades and restrictions prevented access. His lack of training or preparation meant that these letters, like all of his communications, were written with no attempt at concealment whatsoever– no code or invisible ink– and were composed entirely en clair in ordinary written English or German.|$|E
500|$|In mid-November, they {{performed}} at the Bag O'Nails nightclub in London, with Clapton, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Jeff Beck, Pete Townshend, Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, and Kevin Ayers in attendance. Ayers described the crowd's reaction as stunned disbelief: [...] "All the stars were there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> serious comments, you know 'shit', 'Jesus', 'damn' and other words worse than that." [...] The successful performance earned Hendrix his first interview, published in Record Mirror with the headline: [...] "Mr. Phenomenon". [...] "Now hear this... we predict that [...] is going to whirl around the business like a tornado", wrote Bill Harry, who asked the rhetorical question: [...] "Is that full, big, swinging sound really being created by only three people?" [...] Hendrix commented: [...] "We don't want to be classed in any category... If it must have a tag, I'd {{like it to be}} called, 'Free Feeling'. It's a mixture of rock, freak-out, rave and blues". After appearances on the UK television shows Ready Steady Go! and the Top of the Pops, [...] "Hey Joe" [...] entered the UK charts on December 29, 1966, peaking at number six. Further success came in March 1967 with the UK number three hit [...] "Purple Haze", and in May with [...] "The Wind Cries Mary", which remained on the UK charts for eleven weeks, peaking at number six.|$|E

2500|$|A true {{indication}} of how successful the Beatles became thanks to [...] "From Me to You" [...] (though it would soon be overshadowed by [...] "She Loves You" [...] and [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand") was expressed by McCartney: [...] "The first time I thought we'd really made it, was when I was lying in bed one morning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> a milkman whistling 'From Me to You'.

2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who {{was playing with}} Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it was like, when I {{walked in the door}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> them playing, it was like a revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E
2500|$|Coen {{stated that}} this is the brothers' [...] "first adaptation". He further {{explained}} why they chose the novel: [...] "Why not start with Cormac? Why not start with the best?" [...] He further described this McCarthy book in particular as [...] "unlike his other novels... it is much pulpier." [...] Coen stated that they have not changed much in the adaptation. [...] "It really is just compression," [...] he said. [...] "We didn't create new situations." [...] He further assured that he and his brother Ethan had never met McCarthy when they were writing the script, but first met him during the shooting of the film. He believed that the author liked the film, while his brother Ethan said, [...] "he didn't yell at us. We were actually sitting in a movie theater/screening room with him when he saw it... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him chuckle a couple of times, so I took that as a seal of approval, I don't know, maybe presumptuously." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Third Test at Melbourne Bill Edrich {{was given}} out lbw to Ray Lindwall by Umpire Scott after {{he hit the}} ball onto his pads with his bat. The bowler wrote [...] "Bill {{genuinely}} thought he hit the ball onto his pad...I saw no deviation of the ball after it pitched <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> no click". A few minutes later he gave Denis Compton out lbw to Ernie Toshack when padding up of a ball that landed outside the stumps, causing the Middlesex player to stare at him in disbelief before his walked off. Lindwall wrote that Compton [...] "made no stroke at a ball he thought had pitched outside his leg-stump, but which umpire and bowler declared pitched on {{the line of the}} leg stump", which would make Compton out. Wally Hammond came on and, annoyed at the two dismissals, gave a simple caught-and-bowled to Bruce Dooland. Cyril Washbrook was out soon after and England collapsed from 155/1 to 179/5. Scott was angry with the English pressmen who accused him of making the wrong decisions, saying Edrich had not hit the ball with his bat and Washbrook had thought Compton was out (though Washbrook was several yards {{to the right of the}} umpire and so unable to judge the line of the ball).|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} {{chiropractic}} began in 1895 when Daniel David Palmer of Iowa performed the first chiropractic adjustment on a partially deaf janitor, Harvey Lillard. While Lillard was working without his shirt on in Palmers office, Lillard {{bent over to}} empty the trash can. Palmer noticed that Lillard had a vertebra out of position. He asked Lillard what happened, and Lillard replied, [...] "I moved the wrong way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> a 'pop' in my back, and that's when I lost my hearing." [...] Palmer, who was also involved in many other natural healing philosophies, had Lillard lie {{face down on the}} floor and proceeded with the adjustment. The next day, Lillard told Palmer, [...] "I can hear that rackets on the streets." [...] This experience led Palmer to open a school of chiropractic two years later. Rev. Samel Weed coined the word [...] "chiropractic" [...] from Greek roots. Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in vitalism, naturalism, magnetism, spiritualism and other constructs that are not amenable to the scientific method, although Palmer tried to merge science and metaphysics. In 1896, Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic echoed Andrew Still's principles of osteopathy established a decade earlier. Both described the body as a [...] "machine" [...] whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction/subluxation to improve health. Palmer distinguished his work by noting that he was the first to use short-lever HVLA manipulative techniques using the spinous process and transverse processes as mechanical levers. He described the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation as being mediated primarily by the nervous system.|$|E
2500|$|So I grew up (in Ottawa), in this capital city. My parents used to {{work for}} the government, and I went to {{elementary}} school, high school, and the university in the city. And there was a place on Sussex Drive (Sussex Drive is where the Prime Minister's house is, right below Parliament Hill), and there was a little club there called Le Hibou, which in French means 'the owl.' And it was run by a gentleman named Harvey Glatt, and he brought every, and I mean every blues star that you or I would ever have wanted to have seen through Ottawa in the late 50s, well I guess more late 60s sort of, in around the Newport jazz rediscovery. I was going to Le Hibou and hearing James Cotton, Otis Spann, Pinetop Perkins, and Muddy Waters. I actually jammed behind Muddy Waters. S. P. Leary left the drum kit one night, and Muddy said 'anybody out there play drums? I don't have a drummer.' And I walked on stage and we started, I don't know, Little Red Rooster, something. He said 'keep that beat going, you make Muddy feel good.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> Howlin' Wolf (Chester Burnett). Many, many times I saw Howlin' Wolf. And of course Buddy Guy, Buddy Guy and Junior Wells, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. So I was exposed to all of these players, playing there as part of this scene to service the academic community in Ottawa, a very well-educated community. Had I lived in a different town I don't think that this would have happened, because it was just the confluence of educated government workers, and then also all the colleges in the area, Ottawa University, Carleton, and all the schools—these people were interested in blues culture.|$|E
