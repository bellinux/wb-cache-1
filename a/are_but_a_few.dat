25|$|Both drift {{gillnets}} and setnets {{have long been}} used by cultures around the world. There is evidence of fisheries exploitation, including gillnetting, going far back in Japanese history, with many specific details available from the Edo period (1603–1868). Fisheries in the Shetland Islands, which were settled by Norsemen during the Viking age, share cultural and technological similarities with Norwegian fisheries, including gillnet fisheries for herring. Many of the Norwegian immigrant fishermen who came to fish in the great Columbia River salmon fishery {{during the second half}} of the 19th century did so because they had experience in the gillnet fishery for cod in the waters surrounding the Lofoten Islands of northern Norway. Gillnets were used as part of the seasonal round by Swedish fishermen as well. Welsh and English fishermen gillnetted for Atlantic salmon in the rivers of Wales and England in coracles, using hand-made nets, for at least several centuries. These <b>are</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of the examples of historic gillnet fisheries around the world.|$|E

2500|$|The only {{descendants}} of the Israelites who have preserved Hebrew texts are the Jews and the Samaritans, the latter of whom there <b>are</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred left. Both the Samaritan religion and the indigenous Samaritan language, which today is used only liturgically, differ somewhat from their Jewish counterparts, though {{the difference between the}} language varieties is only dialectal. The canon of the Samaritans consists solely of a version of the Pentateuch. It is slightly different from the Jewish Masoretic version. Most are minor variations in the spelling of words or grammatical constructions, but others involve significant semantic changes, such as the uniquely Samaritan commandment to construct an altar on Mount Gerizim. Remarkably, it is to this day written in a script which developed from the paleo-Hebrew script (namely the Samaritan script), whereas the common [...] "Hebrew script" [...] is in fact a stylized version of the Aramaic script, not of the paleo-Hebrew script.|$|E
2500|$|The Jenkins Orphanage was {{established}} in 1891 by the Rev. Daniel J. Jenkins in Charleston. The orphanage accepted donations of musical instruments and Rev. Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and Avery Institute Graduates to tutor the boys in music. As a result, Charleston musicians became proficient {{on a variety of}} instruments and were able to read music expertly. These traits set Jenkins musicians apart and helped land some of them positions in big bands with Duke Ellington and Count Basie. William [...] "Cat" [...] Anderson, Jabbo Smith, and Freddie Green <b>are</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of the alumni from the Jenkins Orphanage band who became professional musicians in some of the best bands of the day.

2500|$|The unfortunate {{results of}} the prejudices and {{mistakes}} of the planners of 1811 are well known today. [...] The lack of suitable sites for public buildings, the traffic congestion at the frequent intersections, the lack of enough north-south arteries, the overbuilding on narrow lots that inevitably resulted from the shallow blocks [...] these <b>are</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of the shortcomings. But even {{by the standards of}} the early nineteenth century the plan was inadequate. In an effort to escape criticism on the grounds of economy and practicality, the commissioners ignored well-known principles of civic design that would have brought variety in street vistas and resulted in focal points for sites for important buildings and use. True enough, no one would have foreseen the rapid growth of the city and the changes in transportation and population that lessened the importance of the river-to-river cross streets while placing an intolerable load on the less numerous north-south avenues. [...] But one cannot avoid the conclusion that the commissioners, in fixing upon their plan, were motivated mainly by narrow consideration of economic gain. [...] Their surveyor, Randel, was later to defend the plan by steadfastly maintaining its utility for the [...] "buying, selling and improving of real estate." [...] As an aid to speculation the commissioners' plan was perhaps unequalled, but only on this ground can it justifiably be called a great achievement.|$|E
2500|$|Wishing {{for a quiet}} holiday {{free from}} crime, Poirot goes to Rhodes during the low season in October where there <b>are</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> guests. Aside from the young Pamela Lyall and Sarah Blake there is Valentine Chantry, a {{consciously}} beautiful woman who seems to swoon under the attentions of Douglas Gold. This is done {{at the expense of}} his own wife, Marjorie, a mildly attractive woman, and Valentine's husband Tony Chantry. This is the [...] "triangle" [...] that everyone observes, and it gets rather absurd with the two men vying for Valentine's favour. She seems to delight in the attention. Marjorie Gold soon wins the sympathy of many of the guests of the hotel as her husband is frequently in the company of Valentine, she confesses her own doubts about Valentine to Poirot. Poirot, however, warns her to flee the island if she values her life. The event comes to a head one evening, beginning when Gold and Chantry have a loud argument. Valentine and Marjorie return from a drive, and the former is poisoned by the cocktail her husband gives her. Gold is immediately suspected, as the strophanthin that kills Valentine is found in the pocket of his dinner jacket. Poirot notices otherwise, seeing that Chantry puts it in Gold's pocket just as everyone's attention is on his dying wife. Poirot gives this information to the police, and points out to Pamela Lyall that she was focusing on the wrong triangle. The real triangle was between Douglas, Marjorie and Chantry. Chantry and Marjorie were in love, but they could not get married as Douglas, a Catholic, would not consent to divorce. For this reason, Chantry and Marjorie decided to kill Valentine and ensure that Douglas was blamed for the murder. Also, Poirot's warning to Marjorie Gold was not because he feared she was a victim at risk of being murdered, but the opposite. He was warning her she would be caught, tried, and convicted as one of the culprits, and be hanged for murder.|$|E
