30|$|The {{proposal}} in [21] suggests an optimized slotted 1 -persistence scheme for multi-hop communications. As well, the protocol proposes {{the formation of}} vehicle clusters that includes vehicles within the transmission range of each other. Using the elected cluster front and tail vehicles, the protocol proposes a store-carry forward mechanism in sparse networks to reduce the network overhead. Synchronized transmissions and additional overhead required for cluster formation and maintenance are the drawbacks of this scheme. To consider both channel quality and transmission distance in selecting the next relay node, Slavik and Maghoub [22] assign a shorter waiting time to vehicles belonging to a connected dominating set (CDS) and employs acknowledgements for every multi-hop message. The main disadvantage of the scheme is the piggy-backed acknowledgement that is sent {{as part of the}} periodic safety message, increasing its transmission overhead. The work of [14] develops an opportunistic broadcast scheme, in which the relay nodes use a long-range ACK packet to lower the redundant multi-hop transmissions. Moreover, the dissemination of multi-hop messages takes place in two phases: first one for quick propagation of message and second one for increasing the reception reliability. However, interference from the periodic safety messages could result in loss of long-range <b>ACK</b> packets <b>resulting</b> in greater number of retransmissions.|$|R

We focus on multicast in single channel multi-access wireless networks and consider Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) based error control algorithms. We propose a simple NACK based method, called overlapped NACKs, that exploits the physical nature of the transmitted NACK signals in order to achieve a high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) even in the presence of NACK collisions. As an example, we apply the proposed method to Bluetooth, quantify its reliability and compare the achievable throughput with respect to the multi-unicast case and to an <b>ACK</b> based protocol. <b>Results</b> show that the overlapped NACK method has the potential to substantially increase the throughput over the ACK based protocol and provides good reliability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStudies of mice {{containing}} {{mutations in}} the genes for a receptor tyrosine kinase, c-kit, or its cognate ligand, Steel factor (SLF), establish that this signaling pathway {{is required for the}} development of melanocytes from their precursors in the embryonic neural crest (NC). In order to define the mechanism of this requirement, we have labeled cells expressing c-kit with an anti-c-kit antibody (ACK 2) and studied the action of SLF on these cells in cultures of murine trunk NC. c-kit positive (c-kit+) cells first appeared after 2 days in culture and were morphologically indistinguishable from other NC cells. These cells subsequently expressed tyrosinase-related protein, an early marker for the melanocyte lineage, and became pigmented {{in the presence of a}} phorbol ester. Further, elimination of the c-kit+ population, by incubating the cultures in <b>ACK</b> 2, <b>resulted</b> in the ablation of the melanocyte population, but had no effect on the generation of other neural crest derivatives. These data indicate that c-kit+ cells arising from the neural crest are melanocyte progenitors. The addition of SLF to these cultures stimulated an increase in the number of c-kit+ cells, and further studies indicated that SLF acts as both a survival and a proliferative factor for c-kit+ cells. These findings provide a mechanism of regulation of melanocyte development, whereby c-kit is exclusively expressed by melanocyte progenitors within the neural crest precursor population, and subsequent survival and proliferation of these progenitors is regulated by SLF...|$|R

In this paper, we focus on very dynamic high-speed networks where the available best-effort bandwidth for regulated traffics can vary over time.

The ACK supports rigid body simulations and simple elastic body simulations. The ACK is compared with commercial FEM software to investigate its usability and reliability. Required time was compared in modelling of a machine tool. The ACK needed 30 % of the total required time for the FEM because of its modularity in machine modelling.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} TCP simultaneous-send problem which arises in {{infrastructure}} mode 802. 11 wireless local area networks. In particular {{it has been}} observed that for file transfer traffic, 802. 11 wireless nodes have a sustained supply of packets to send and hence experience a relatively high rate of MAC contention. For TCP, this results in competition among data and ACK packets for channel access which causes the simultaneous-send problem that deteriorates flow throughput. This simultaneous-send problem can be alleviated by skipping TCP <b>ACKs.</b> Detailed simulation <b>results</b> are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of ACK skipping in various network scenarios such as with MAC retries and multiple TCP flows. The largest improvement is seen for the case of a single TCP flow, and moderate gains are also achieved in cases with multiple streams. For the single TCP stream case with 1 ACK skip and no MAC retries, TCP throughput improves 30 % for short-lived and 98 % for long-lived TCP transmissions. The paper concludes with potential cross-layer solutions that potentially provide further improvements, including the use of the point coordination function (PCF) to reduce contention between multiple TCP streams and returning ACK packets...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative {{communication}} {{techniques have}} been proposed {{in order to improve}} the quality of the received signals at the receivers by using the diversity added by duplication of signals sent by relay terminals situated between each transmission pair. Researches related to cooperative communication can be categorized into two fields; Cooperative transmissions and Cooperative setup. The first research field concerns with cooperative transmission techniques in the physical layer while the second research field concerns with issues on inter-layer interaction between cooperative transmissions in the physical layer to protocols in the upper layers (especially the MAC layer and the network layer). These research topics have been separately concerned but, for implementations, they have to work together. Since there is not any existing common frame work to describe entire functions in cooperative communication, we proposed an original framework of cooperative network at the system level called “Cooperative Network Model”. The model does not reflect the protocol layering; thus, we can generalize the cooperation process and obtain an analysis that is available for many solutions. For validity, the proposed model can clearly illustrate and systematically describe existing cooperative setup protocols. In addition, the proposed cooperative network model facilitates us to find and to solve problems in cooperative designs; especially in cooperative setup, which is in charge on the initiation of the terminal’s role (i. e., a source, a relay, and a destination terminal). Thus, we believe that this model can facilitate the design and updating of existing and future propositions in this domain. The cooperative network protocol is used to design an adaptive cooperative transmission called Proxy Cooperative Transmission. In contrast to other adaptive cooperative transmission techniques, our proposition is compatible to both of the basic access mode and the optional access mode of IEEE 802. 11 Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol. The transmission mode for each data frame is adaptively switched between a proxy cooperative mode and a non-cooperative mode based on the absence of acknowledge (<b>ACK)</b> frame. Simulation <b>results</b> show that transmission performance is improved by decreasing the number of re-transmissions due to frame errors; thus, chances of multi-hop mode transitions that are costly in time and bandwidth are alleviated. Then, in order to fulfill ProxyCoop communications in part of cooperative setup, we propose a cooperative setup method called “Proxy Cooperative Setup”. The proposition is based on a routing standard protocol for ad hoc networks, AODV, so that it could be easily deployed. The impacts of ProxyCoopSetup when it works with ProxyCoop transmissions have been studied. From simulation results, it shows that ProxyCoop transmissions with ProxyCoopSetup has similar performance to the ProxyCoop transmissions without ProxyCoopSetup. Finally, when the implementation of the proxy cooperative communication and how it can be integrated on existing networks have been considered, it is shown that the design of proxy cooperative communication is also valuable for the 802. 11 s WLAN Mesh Network environments...|$|R
