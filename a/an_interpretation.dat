5|$|Although the {{mortuary}} inscription of Pacificus, archdeacon of Verona, {{records that}} he constructed a night clock (horologium nocturnum) {{as early as}} 850, his clock {{has been identified as}} being an observation tube used to locate stars with an accompanying book of astronomical observations, rather than a mechanical or water clock, <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> supported by illustrations from medieval manuscripts.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I argue for <b>a</b> non-referential <b>interpretation</b> of some uses of indexicals {{embedded}} under epistemic modals. The so-called descriptive uses of indexicals come in several types {{and it is}} argued that those embedded within the scope of modal operators do not require non-referential interpretation, provided the modality is interpreted as epistemic. I endeavor to show that even if we allow <b>an</b> epistemic <b>interpretation</b> of modalities, the resulting interpretation will still be inadequate as long as we retain <b>a</b> referential <b>interpretation</b> of indexicals. I then propose an analysis of descriptive indexicals that combines <b>an</b> epistemic <b>interpretation</b> of modality with <b>a</b> non-referential <b>interpretation</b> of indexicals...|$|R

25|$|That project aims at {{registering}} {{a complete}} {{range of values}} with which people identify, {{to which they are}} attracted or which they reject as abhorrent. The notion of wisdom is explored as a way, an art, of dealing with value dilemmas. For instance, Complexity: understanding value systems is a text that looks at values through <b>a</b> positive <b>interpretation,</b> <b>a</b> negative <b>interpretation,</b> <b>a</b> paradoxical negative <b>interpretation</b> of the positive, and <b>a</b> paradoxical positive <b>interpretation</b> of the negative. Another text, Insights: wisdom and requisite variety, gives a list of several sources of wisdom which, in interrelation, may be required in a value system to ensure the long-term viability of a complex society.|$|R

5|$|Alboin came to {{the throne}} {{after the death of}} his father, {{sometime}} between 560 and 565. As was customary among the Lombards, Alboin took the crown after an election by the tribe's freemen, who traditionally selected the king from the dead sovereign's clan. Shortly afterwards, in 565, a new war erupted with the Gepids, now led by Cunimund, Thurisind's son. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, as the sources are divided; the Lombard Paul the Deacon accuses the Gepids, while the Byzantine historian Menander Protector places the blame on Alboin, <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> favoured by historian Walter Pohl.|$|E
5|$|Many popular modern {{accounts}} of the war claim {{that there was a}} factional split in the escaped slaves between those under Spartacus, who wished to escape over the Alps to freedom, and those under Crixus, who wished to stay in southern Italy to continue raiding and plundering. This appears to be <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> of events based on the following: the regions that Florus lists as being raided by the slaves include Thurii and Metapontum, which are geographically distant from Nola and Nuceria.|$|E
5|$|Peada's {{conversion}} {{and the introduction}} of priests into Middle Anglia could be seen as evidence of Penda's tolerance of Christianity, given the absence of evidence that he sought to interfere. On the other hand, <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> is also possible whereby the marriage and conversion could be seen as corresponding to a successful attempt on Oswiu's part to expand Bernician influence at Penda's expense; Higham saw Peada's conversion more in terms of political manoeuvring on both sides than religious zeal.|$|E

The game's joke ending came out of a suggestion box created to find alternative reasons for the occurrences in Silent Hill.|$|E
5|$|The prince {{began to}} be {{perceived}} as a unifier towards the middle of the 19th century. Such <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> is completely lacking in the historiography of the 17th-century chroniclers, and even in that of the Transylvanian School around 1800. What they emphasized, apart from the exceptional personality of Michael himself, were the idea of Christendom and his close relations with Emperor Rudolf. The conqueror's ambition is likewise frequently cited as a motivation for his action, occupying in the interpretative schema the place that was later to be occupied by the Romanian idea.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, its {{original}} provenance remains unknown.

5|$|After {{discussing}} Supreme Court precedent, Heins {{recounts the}} jury verdict which decided against her client by ruling that Richardson's firing was not illegal. Heins describes the trial chronologically, including the evidentiary process and testimony by witnesses. The jury's decision is examined; {{it found that}} Richardson sincerely believed that her school's administration practiced employment discrimination, and her criticism was made in good faith. However, the jury also determined that the administration did not fire Richardson because of this criticism. Heins critiques the compromise decision, contending that it reflects the bias of individual jurors rather than <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the law as applied to Richardson's firing by the school's administration. In post-trial interviews, the jurors explained they {{felt that it was}} the duty of employees (such as Richardson) respect their superiors and Nesmith was one such superior in his capacity as {{dean of the school of}} theology.|$|E
5|$|Another {{performance}} issue {{pertains to}} the choice of tempi, which is of special relevance in Schubert's major instrumental works, particularly in the opening movements. Schubert often notated his opening movements with moderate tempo indications, the extreme case being the Molto moderato of the B-flat piano sonata. The latter movement in particular, has been interpreted in vastly different speeds. Ever since the famous performances by Sviatoslav Richter, taking the opening movement at an extremely slow pace, similar tempo interpretations for this movement have been frequent. However, the majority of Schubert scholars tend to dismiss such <b>an</b> <b>interpretation,</b> arguing instead for a more flowing pace, a measured allegro.|$|E
5|$|Bohr's {{evidence}} {{came from}} <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> {{of a letter}} he received from a Soviet friend and scientist in Russia, which he showed to the British security services. He reasoned that the longer the United States and Britain hid their nuclear advancements, Russia would feel increasingly threatened and more inclined to speed up their effort to produce an atomic bomb of their own. With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, Bohr met with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons on 26 August 1944; but Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work. At the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944, Roosevelt sided with Churchill, deciding {{that it would be}} upon the nation's best interest to keep the atomic bomb project a secret. Moreover, they decided Bohr was potentially dangerous and specific security measures must be made in order to prevent him from leaking information {{to the rest of the}} world, Russia in particular.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{develops}} <b>a</b> <b>interpretation</b> of Leibniz’ {{theory of}} motion that strives to integrate his metaphysics of force with his {{doctrine of the}} equivalence of hypotheses, but which also supports a realist, as opposed to <b>a</b> fully idealist, <b>interpretation</b> of his natural philosophy. Overall, the modern approaches to Leibniz’ physics that rely on a fixed spacetime backdrop, classical mechanical constructions, or absolute speed, will be revealed as deficient, whereas <b>a</b> more adequate <b>interpretation</b> will be advanced that draws inspiration from an invariantist conception of reality and recent non-classical theories of physics...|$|R

40|$|Shafer's belief {{functions}} {{were introduced}} in the seventies of the previous century as a mathematical tool in order to model epistemic probability. One {{of the reasons that}} they were not picked up by mainstream probability was the lack of <b>a</b> behavioral <b>interpretation.</b> In this paper we provide such <b>a</b> behavioral <b>interpretation,</b> and re-derive Shafer's belief functions via <b>a</b> betting <b>interpretation</b> reminiscent of the classical Dutch Book Theorem for probability distributions. We relate our betting interpretation of belief functions to the existing literature...|$|R
5|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the {{negotiations}} leading to {{the transfer of the}} codex to the Tsar's possession are open to <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> that reflects adversely on Tischendorf's candour and good faith with the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery. For a recent account intended to exculpate him of blame, see Erhard Lauch's article 'Nichts gegen Tischendorf' in Bekenntnis zur Kirche: Festgabe für Ernst Sommerlath zum 70. Geburtstag (Berlin, c. 1961); for an account that includes a hitherto unknown receipt given by Tischendorf to the authorities at the monastery promising to return the manuscript from Saint Petersburg 'to the Holy Confraternity of Sinai at its earliest request'.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to the {{platforms}} {{is controlled}} by automatic ticket gates on Platform 3, which is used by many northbound CrossCountry trains and local services to Bristol Parkway and Gloucester.

This is most frequently used by Severn Beach Line trains but is long enough to handle any four-car Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU). Behind Platform 1 is a brick wall that forms part of the signal box and on this are some metal artworks created by artists with learning difficulties to celebrate Brunel's 200th anniversary in 2006; <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> panel is nearby.

5|$|The Senate {{as a body}} {{remained}} {{devoid of}} any significant power; nevertheless, the senators, who had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats. Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule; however, such <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> remains conjectural, {{given the fact that}} we do not have the precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.|$|E
