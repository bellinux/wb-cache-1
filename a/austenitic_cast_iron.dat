A series of investigations concerning the influence of microsegregation on mechanical properties of :pearlitic, ferritic and <b>austenitic</b> nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> have then been reported. The influence of section size on the tensile and impact properties of cornmercial purity and refined ferritic nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> has been studied. It has been shown. that an increase in section caused a decrease in impact transition temperature of the commercial purity material without greatly affecting the impact transition temperature of the purer material. This effect has been related to increased amounts of segregation effects such as cell boundary carbides in heavier sections of the commercial purity material. Microsegregation studies on the materials used in this thesis have been carried out using an electron probe microanalyser. This technique has shown that concentrations of chromium and manganese and depletions of nickel and silicon occurred at eutectic cell boundaries in nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and were often associated with brittle carbides in these areas. These effects {{have been shown to be}} more prevalent in heavier sections. The nature of segregation during the solidification of nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> has been studied by quenching samples of nodular iron during the solidification process. Micro-analysis of such samples has shown that segregation of manganese and chromium occurs by a gradual build-up of these elements at the solid/liquid interface. The microstructures of the quenched specimens revealed carbide filaments connecting graphite nodules and areas of quenched liquid. These filaments have been used as evidence for a revised hypothesis for the solidification of nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> by a liquid diffusion mechanism. A similar series of experiments has been carried out on two high nickel austenitic irons containing 0. 5 per cent manganese and 4 per cent manganese respectively. In both these materials a decrease in elongation was experienced with increasing section. This effect was more drastic in the 4 per cent manganese material which also contained much greater amounts of cell boundary carbide in heavy sections. Micro-analysis of samples of the 4 per cent manganese material quenched during solidification revealed that manganese concentrated in the liquid and that nickel concentrated in the solid during solidification. No segregation of silicon occurred in this material. Carbide filaments appeared in the microstructures of these specimens.

40|$|During {{solidification}} microsegregations {{build up}} in solid phases due to solid concentration variations with temperature. Diffusion, which is a kinetic process, usually reduces microsegregations. The present work aims at modeling such kinetic effects on solidification of <b>austenitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> applying a holistic approach. To this end, a microsegregation model was developed and validated. Moreover, this model was coupled directly to a commercial process simulation tool and thermodynamic software. A series of GJSA-XNiCr 20 - 2 clamp-rings was cast varying inoculation state and number of feeders. The composition of this cast alloy was analyzed and the microstructure characterized to provide input data for the microsegregation model. To validate the software, cooling curves were recorded, and differential thermal analysis, electron dispersive x-ray analysis, and electron probe micro analysis were carried out. Furthermore, porosity within the casting was analyzed by x-ray. Since significant discrepancies between the transformation temperatures measured and the values predicted by thermodynamic calculations became apparent, a numerical concentration variation analysis was performed. Moreover, two commercial and one open thermodynamic database, as well as three different chemical analyses of the cast alloy were compared. In this way, {{it was possible to}} determine the most appropriate combination of database and chemical analysis in relation to the predicted metal carbides, transformation temperatures, and solidification kinetics. Notwithstanding this effort, large temperature differences remain. The most probable reason for these discrepancies is nucleation and inaccuracy of the thermodynamic databases applied for this kind of alloy. Various submodels for chemical diffusion, cross-diffusion, as well as cross-diffusion in combination with dendrite arm coarsening were compared as to identify their particular impact. This analysis shows that the chemical diffusion model does not reflect the solidification kinetics determined by experiments and is therefore not applicable to this type of alloy. In the present work, cross-diffusion was identified as the chief reason for the graphite promoting effect of nickel. Dendrite arm coarsening induces the sensitivity of the model to cooling characteristics, {{while at the same time}} reducing slightly the sensitivity to variations in heat extraction rate. Validation of the model was attempted by comparing results to a solution from a commercial software product taking account of cross-diffusion. The results match when the diffusive fluxes are modified. Since in this case, the phase fractions correlate very well, the solution of the solidification problem is considered to be correct. To further validate the diffusion solver, it was compared to an analytical solution and could be verified by this test. It could be shown through performing coupled simulations, that due to dendrite arm coarsening the different cooling characteristics within the casting lead to distinct differences in phase fractions and solidification temperatures. This transition of cooling characteristics is accompanied by a transition from a globular-eutectic to a chunky-dendritic microstructure in experiments. The hot spot effect below the feeders is aided by a shift towards lower solidification temperatures over solidification time. This shift is a result of local cooling characteristics which can only be predicted, if process simulation is directly coupled with material simulation. The porosity predictions and analyses show good agreement. A comparison between experimental and virtual cooling curves leads to the conclusion that the innovative coupling concept and its implementation are valid. To achieve an effective coupling procedure between process and material simulation, a complex and unique microsegregation software has been generated. This model is notable for its time-efficient predictions and general applicability thanks to a multicomponent concept, thermodynamic coupling, cross-diffusion model, and multicomponent dendrite arm coarsening model. Furthermore, the characteristics of the present model were compared to decoupled and coupled state-of-the-art microsegregation models and four unique features were identified: (1) the innovative coupling concept to porosity prediction and (2) process simulation, (3) the multiphase concept, and (4) the concept for reproducing mixed geometries...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to coming}} {{emission}} legislations, {{the temperature is}} expected to increase in heavy-duty diesel engines, specifically in the hot-end of the exhaust system affecting components, such as exhaust- and turbo manifolds. Since the current material in the turbo manifold, a ductile <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> named SiMo 51, is operating close to its limits {{there is a need for}} material development in order to maintain a high durability of these components. When designing for increased life, many material properties need to be considered, for example, creep-, corrosion- and fatigue resistance. Among these, the present work focuses on the latter two up to 800 °C improving the current material by additions of Cr, for corrosion resistance, and Ni, for mechanical properties. The results show improved high-temperature corrosion resistance in air from 0. 5 and 1 wt% Cr additions resulting in improved barrier layer at the oxide/metal interface. However, during oxidation in exhaust-gases, which is a much more demanding environment compared to air, such improvement could not be observed. Addition of 1 wt% Ni was found to increase the fatigue life up to 250 °C, resulting from solution strengthening of the ferritic matrix. However, Ni was also found to increase the oxidation rates, as no continuous SiO 2 -barrier layers were formed in the presence of Ni. Since none of the tested alloys showed improved material properties in exhaust gases at high temperature, it is suggested that the way of improving performance of exhaust manifolds is to move towards <b>austenitic</b> ductile <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> or <b>cast</b> stainless steels. One alloy showing good high-temperature oxidation properties in exhaust atmospheres is an <b>austenitic</b> <b>cast</b> stainless steel named HK 30. This alloy formed adherent oxide scales during oxidation at 900 °C in gas mixtures of 5 %O 2 - 10 %H 2 O- 85 %N 2 and 5 %CO 2 - 10 %H 2 O- 85 %N 2 and in air. In the two latter atmospheres, compact scales of (Cr, Mn) -spinel and Cr 2 O 3 were formed whereas in the atmosphere containing 5 %O 2 and 10 %H 2 O, the scales were more porous due to increased Fe-oxide formation. Despite the formation of a protective, i. e. compact and adherent, oxide scale on HK 30, exposure to exhaust-gas condensate showed a detrimental effect in form of oxide spallation and metal release. Thus, proving the importance of taking exhaust-gas condensation, which may occur during cold-start or upon cooling of the engine, into account when selecting a new material for exhaust manifolds.   QC 20130508 </p...|$|R
40|$|Emission {{regulations}} for heavy-duty diesel engines {{are becoming increasingly}} restrictive to limit {{the environmental impacts of}} exhaust gases and particles. Increasing the specific power output of diesel engines would improve fuel efficiency and greatly reduce emissions, but these changes could lead to increased exhaust gas temperature, increasing demands on the exhaust manifold material. This is currently the ferritic ductile <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> alloy SiMo 51, containing about 4 wt% Si and ~ 1 wt% Mo, which operates close to its fatigue and oxidation resistance limits at peak temperature (750 C). To ensure high durability at higher temperatures, three different approaches to improving the life of exhaust manifolds were developed in this thesis. The first approach was to modify SiMo 51 by adding different combinations of Cr and Ni to improve its high-temperature strength and oxidation resistance, or by applying a thermal barrier coating (TBC) to reduce the material temperature and thereby improve fatigue life. In the second approach, new materials for engine components, e. g. <b>austenitic</b> ductile <b>iron</b> and <b>cast</b> stainless steel, were investigated for their high-temperature fatigue and oxidation properties. In order to identify the most suitable alloys for this application, in the third the environmental effects of the corrosive diesel exhaust gas on the fatigue life of SiMo 51 were investigated. The high-temperature oxidation resistance of SiMo 51 at 700 and 800 C in air was found to be improved by adding Cr, whereas Ni showed adverse effects. The effects of solid-solution hardening from Ni and precipitation hardening from Cr were low at 700 C, with improvements only at lower temperatures. Applying a TBC system, providing thermal protection from a ceramic topcoat and oxidation protection from a metallic bond coat, resulted in only small reductions in material temperature, but according to finite element calculations still effectively improved the fatigue life of a turbo manifold. Possible alternative materials to SiMo 51 identified were <b>austenitic</b> <b>cast</b> ductile <b>iron</b> Ni-resistant D 5 S and <b>austenitic</b> <b>cast</b> stainless steel HK 30, which provided high durability of exhaust manifolds up to 800 and 900 C, respectively. Corrosion fatigue testing of SiMo 51 at 700 C in diesel exhaust gas demonstrated that the corrosive gas reduced fatigue life by 30 - 50 % compared with air and by 60 - 75 % compared with an inert environment. The reduced fatigue life was associated with a mechanism whereby the crack tip oxidized, followed by crack growth. Thus another potential benefit of TBC systems is that the bond coat may reduce oxidation interactions and further improve fatigue life. These results can be used for selecting materials for exhaust applications. They also reveal many new research questions for future studies. Combining the different approaches of alloy modification, new material testing and improving the performance using coatings widened the scope of how component life in exhaust manifolds can be improved. Moreover, the findings on environmental interactions on SiMo 51 fatigue provide a completely new understanding of these processes in ductile irons, important knowledge when designing components exposed to corrosive environments. The novel facility developed for high-temperature corrosion fatigue testing can be useful to other researchers working in this field.   QC 20150507 </p...|$|R
