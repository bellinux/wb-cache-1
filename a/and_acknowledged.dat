5|$|Angola {{agreed to}} trade oil to Slovakia {{in return for}} arms, buying six Sukhoi Su-17 attack {{aircraft}} on 3 April 2000. The Spanish government in the Canary Islands prevented a Ukrainian freighter from delivering 636tons of military equipment to Angola on 24 February 2001. The captain of the ship had inaccurately reported his cargo, falsely claiming the ship carried automobile parts. The Angolan government admitted Simportex had purchased arms from Rosvooruzhenie, the Russian state-owned arms company, <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> the captain might have violated Spanish law by misreporting his cargo, a common practice in arms smuggling to Angola.|$|E

Eminem has claimed on multiple occasions that he dated Carey, but Carey has always firmly denied that she knew him on a romantic level. In 2001, Carey contacted Eminem to discuss the possibility of writing a song together for inclusion on Carey's ninth studio album Charmbracelet (2002), and they reportedly started dating soon after.|$|E
5|$|Géza died in 1077, and his {{supporters}} made Ladislaus king. Solomon resisted Ladislaus {{with the assistance of}} King Henry IV of Germany. Ladislaus supported Henry IV's opponents during the Investiture Controversy. In 1081, Solomon abdicated <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> Ladislaus's reign, but he conspired to regain the royal crown and Ladislaus imprisoned him. Ladislaus canonized the first Hungarian saints (including his distant relatives, King Stephen I and Duke Emeric) in 1085. He set Solomon free during the canonization ceremony.|$|E

5|$|Isabella and Martinuzzi left Buda on 5 September 1541, taking John Sigismund and the Holy Crown with them. She {{and her son}} {{settled in}} Lippa, which {{was the center of}} an old domain of the Zápolya family. The delegates of the {{counties}} of John Sigismund's realm met in Debrecen on 18October. They swore fealty to him <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> the sultan's suzerainty. Martinuzzi signed a treaty with FerdinandI's representative, Caspar Serédy, in Gyalu (now Gilău in Romania) on 29December. According to the Treaty of Gyalu, Hungary was to be reunited under the rule of Ferdinand, but John Sigismund's right to the Zápolyas' domains in Upper Hungary was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|King Andrew {{transferred}} Béla from Slavonia to Transylvania in 1226. In Slavonia, he was {{succeeded by}} his brother, Coloman. As Duke of Transylvania, Béla adopted an expansionist policy {{aimed at the}} territories over the Carpathian Mountains. He supported the Dominicans' proselytizing activities among the Cumans, who dominated these lands. In 1227 he crossed the mountains and met Boricius, a Cuman chieftain, who had decided to convert to Christianity. At their meeting, Boricius and his subjects were baptized <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> Béla's suzerainty. Within a year, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania was established in their lands.|$|E
5|$|Leo had {{meanwhile}} united the Armenian Church in Cilicia with Rome <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry VI. The emperor's envoy, Conrad of Wittelsbach, Archbishop of Mainz, {{was present}} when Leo was crowned the first king of Armenian Cilicia on 6January 1198. Before long, Conrad went to Antioch and persuaded Bohemond and his barons to swear {{an oath to}} accept Raymund-Roupen's right to inherit Antioch.|$|E

5|$|The allies invaded Paraguay in April 1866, {{but after}} initial success, their advance {{was blocked by}} fortifications at Humaitá and along the Paraguay River. Porto Alegre had {{remained}} behind, leading the 2nd Corps and guarding Rio Grande do Sul. Mitre, no longer on Brazilian territory <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> as the allied commander-in-chief, planned to use Porto Alegre's army to march through Paraguayan territory from the rear to surround Humaitá. As {{a result of a}} suggestion by Tamandaré—though Mitre had not issued orders for the move—Porto Alegre boarded his army onto Brazilian ships and instead brought them up to the positions occupied by the other allied troops.|$|E
5|$|Citing his {{disappointment}} at failing to gain promotion, Stimson resigned {{from his post}} at Grays on 16 May 2006. He stated {{that at the time}} he had received no firm job offers from other clubs, <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> that he was taking a gamble with his career, but said that if he was unable to find a new job as a manager he would move into youth coaching or open his own football school. He was linked with the managerial vacancy at League Two Peterborough United, but eventually took over as manager of Stevenage Borough on 28 May, and led the club to an eighth-place finish in the Conference National in his first season in charge. Stevenage also defeated Stimson's former club Grays to reach the FA Trophy final, and beat Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 at the new Wembley Stadium in the final, giving Stimson a third consecutive Trophy win as a manager.|$|E
5|$|Coloman sent envoys to the Council of Guastalla, {{which had}} been convoked by Pope Paschal II. In October 1106 the envoys solemnly {{informed}} the pope of their king's renunciation of his royal prerogative to appoint the prelates of his realms. According to historians Ferenc Makk and Márta Font, without this declaration the Holy See would not have acknowledged Coloman's conquest of Dalmatia. During the civil war between BoleslawIII and his brother Zbigniew, Coloman intervened on the former's behalf and helped him overcome the latter's army in Mazovia in 1107. Coloman also sent Hungarian reinforcements to the Byzantine Emperor AlexiosI Komnenos against Bohemond I of Antioch, who had invaded Byzantine territories in October 1107. After suffering a sound defeat, Bohemond withdrew his troops <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> the emperor's suzerainty over the Principality of Antioch in the Treaty of Devol in 1108.|$|E

5|$|In 1842, Conroy {{settled at}} his {{family home in}} Arborfield Hall near Reading, Berkshire and became a gentleman farmer, winning prizes for his pig breeding. He founded the Montgomery Regiment of Militia in 1849. Despite his {{pensions}} and ownership of properties and lead mines in Wales, Conroy was in substantial debt when he died on 2 March 1854 at Arborfield. His eldest son Edward succeeded him to the baronetcy. After his death, the Duchess of Kent finally agreed to open her financial accounts <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> that significant funds were missing. She was moved to admit that Conroy had swindled her {{while at the same}} time hurting her relationship with Victoria for his own benefit. A rapprochement followed between mother and daughter.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party {{reported}} on the discovery of copernicium <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> {{the discovery of the}} isotope 283Cn. This implied the de facto discovery of the livermorium-291 isotope, from the acknowledgment of the data relating to its granddaughter 283Cn, although the livermorium data was not absolutely critical for the demonstration of copernicium's discovery. Also in 2009, confirmation from Berkeley and the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany came for the flerovium isotopes 286 to 289, immediate daughters of the four known livermorium isotopes. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 2000–2006. Whereas they found the earliest data (not involving 291Lv and 283Cn) inconclusive, the results of 2004–2006 were accepted as identification of livermorium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|The Venetians {{were taken}} by {{surprise}} when the city fell, as the fleet under Morosini was still sailing off the western coast of Greece. Following their customary strategy, they reacted by sending their fleet to blockade Gallipoli and cut off passage of the Dardanelles. However, the Venetians were by now ready to disengage themselves from this profitless venture, and soon instructed Morosini to seek peace. In July, Hamza Bey signed a peace treaty with the Venetians (ratified on 4 September) whereby the Republic recognised its loss of Thessalonica, restored passage of the Dardanelles, <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged,</b> in exchange of an annual tribute of 236 ducats, Ottoman overlordship over Patras in the Morea. In exchange, the Venetians secured the Sultan's recognition of their possessions in Albania: Durazzo, Scutari, and Antivari.|$|E

5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} {{of the different}} groups of bats {{have been the subject}} of much debate. The traditional subdivision between Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera reflected the view that these groups of bats had evolved independently of each other for a long time, from a common ancestor already capable of flight. This hypothesis recognized differences between microbats and megabats <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> that flight has only evolved once in mammals. Most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a single or monophyletic group. In the 1980s, a hypothesis based on morphological evidence was offered that stated the Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the Microchiroptera. The so-called flying primate hypothesis proposed that, when adaptations to flight are removed, the Megachiroptera are allied to primates by anatomical features not shared with Microchiroptera. For example, the brains of megabats have advanced characteristics that link them to primates. Although recent genetic studies strongly support the monophyly of bats, debate continues as to the meaning of available genetic and morphological evidence.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in circuses {{has also been}} controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied {{that any of these}} practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions. Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, {{the ranking}} Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, {{sent a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations <b>and</b> <b>acknowledged</b> White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E
