5|$|Indigenous {{people of}} the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes have {{inhabited}} the area for hundreds of years. In pre-contact times, these people lived a nomadic lifestyle. They did not build permanent structures in which to live, as they moved from region to region to find food and resources. Animals such as caribou, martin, moose and caribou were hunted and trapped by the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes. In summer, these people gathered roots, plants and a volcanic glass called obsidian. Anahim obsidian was traded widely throughout the Interior <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the Coast from the community of Bella Coola. Arrowheads and knives were made from obsidian because when it breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, it creates very sharp edges. A modified form of this lifestyle is practiced by some indigenous people to this day.|$|E

On the reverse, it had a battery level {{indicator}} light (activated by a button) and a three-position switch to turn the unit off or set it to play music in order or shuffled. It plugged directly into a computer's USB port (either 1.1 or 2.0), through which it also recharged its battery, which has an expected life of around 12 hours. The USB plug is hidden beneath a cap. The unit also comes with a lanyard that attaches to the iPod Shuffle via an attached cap and this allows the user to wear the iPod Shuffle around his or her neck.|$|E

500|$|Construction on the Phalanstery was {{progressing}} {{well until}} {{the evening of}} March 3, 1846, when {{it was discovered that}} the Phalanstery had caught fire. Within two hours, the structure had completely burned down; firefighters from Boston arrived too late. The fire was likely caused by a defective chimney. One participant noted, [...] "Ere long the flames were chasing one another in a mad riot over the structure; running across long corridors <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the supporting columns of wood, until the huge edifice was a mass of firework".

500|$|Lindsay Planer of AllMusic {{writes that}} Harrison carried out [...] "significant lyrical embellishments" [...] after debuting {{the song in}} 1968. On the {{released}} recording, he concludes with a statement on how to break the circle of repetition: [...] "When loss and gain <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> / Become the same, then we stop going in circles." [...] Allison interprets this conclusion, and Harrison's worldview generally, as espousing the need to recognise the illusory nature of the material world, saying: [...] "All the multiplicity and diversity are in truth manifestations of the one hidden and divine reality … opposites are not opposites. To understand that up is down and that gain is loss is to be … on one's way to escaping from the material world." ...|$|E

500|$|Dylan biographer Howard Sounes {{described}} [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] as a [...] "grim masterpiece." [...] The only accompaniment is Dylan's guitar, playing folk-blues riffs <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> chord progressions. Author Sean Wilentz {{has noted}} that the song's chord structure {{is similar to that}} used by the Everly Brothers' in their hit recording of [...] "Wake Up Little Susie". The lyrics of [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] express Dylan's anger at what he sees as the hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, and war mentality inherent in contemporary American culture, but unlike those in his earlier protest songs, do not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions. In his book Bob Dylan, Performing Artist, author Paul Williams has suggested that the song addresses [...] "the possibility that the most important (and least articulated) political issue of our times is that we are all being fed a false picture of reality, and it's coming at us from every direction." [...] Williams {{goes on to say that}} the song successfully paints a portrait of an [...] "alienated individual identifying the characteristics of the world around him and thus declaring his freedom from its 'rules'." [...] As such, a major target in the song is the old, established concepts which give a false picture of reality and hinder new worldviews from being accepted.|$|E
500|$|The {{goldcrest}} is {{the smallest}} European bird, [...] in length, with a [...] wingspan and a weight of [...] It is similar in appearance to a warbler, with olive-green upper-parts, buff-white underparts, two white wing bars, and a plain face with conspicuous black irises. The crown of the head has black sides and a narrow black front, and a bright crest, yellow with an orange centre in the male, and entirely yellow in the female; the crest is erected in display, making the distinctive orange stripe of the male much more conspicuous. The small, thin bill is black, and the legs are dark flesh-brown. Apart from the crest colour, the sexes are alike, although in fresh plumage, the female may have very slightly paler upper-parts and greyer underparts than the adult male. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} adult, but has duller upper-parts and lacks the coloured crown. Although the tail and flight feathers may be retained into the first winter, by then the young birds are almost indistinguishable from adults in the field. The flight is distinctive; it consists of whirring wing-beats with occasional sudden changes of direction. Shorter flights while feeding are a mix of dashing and fluttering with frequent hovering. It moves restlessly among foliage, regularly creeping on branches <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> trunks.|$|E

Upon his entry to the Naval Academy, on August 10, 1847, Franklin was promoted to [...] "passed midshipman". Instruction lasted nine months, and Franklin passed. He was assigned to the Coast Survey, which he joined in mid-July 1848. The survey team spent the autumn months surveying the coast beginning at Cape Henlopen, Delaware; moving south to the tip of the Delmarva Peninsula; <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the east and west coasts of Chesapeake Bay.

The short clip provided by BioWare revealed that space combat {{would be a}} [...] "tunnel shooter."

Game play includes moving right and left on the X axis <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> on the Y axis; however, players do not have control {{of the speed of}} their space craft. Jake Neri, LucasArts Producer, told PC Gamer in their October 2010 issue that their goal was to [...] "capture the most cinematic moments that we can create. We want players to get in and feel like they're in the movies. It's about highly cinematic, controlled combat moments ... very heroic, action-packed, exciting, visceral and dangerous encounters that'll make you pee your pants." [...] With the December 2013 release of the free expansion, Galactic Starfighter (GSF), players now have a free flight PVP space combat experience, with multiple ships and roles independent of other aspects of the game.|$|E
