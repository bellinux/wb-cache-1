5|$|Among the {{prominent}} wildflowers are Hooker's fairy bells, vanilla leaf, evergreen violet, and trillium. Invasive species include English ivy, European holly, clematis, morning glory, and Himalayan blackberry.

5|$|The site's value today {{includes}} its {{ecological and}} environmental significance, and its shoreline, {{which is in}} a semi-natural state, {{is part of the}} habitat for the rare map turtle. It is situated between the Lake of Two Mountains and the Senneville Forest ecoterritory, as described in Montreal's Natural Spaces Policy. Therefore, it could be considered part of the wildlife corridor (lien faunique) between the lake <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fiji's native birdlife {{has been}} badly {{affected}} by agriculture, deforestation and introduced pests like rats and mongooses. Although Important Bird Areas {{have been established}} on Taveuni <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> east of Vanua Levu, conservation problems persist. The Fiji parrotfinch has adapted well to man-made landscapes; it is neither a ground nor hole nester, so it avoids predation from the mongoose and competition for nest sites with introduced common and jungle mynas. Introduced rodents are able to access the nests and may affect breeding productivity. The potential introduction of other species, such as snakes, or diseases like avian malaria could lead to major losses among bird species.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum-140 has a short {{half-life}} of some 41 hours, {{and is not}} {{a threat}} after a fairly short time. Other radioisotopes, present as impurities, have a long enough half-life to present a potential problem even decades after the tests; in 2002 the Los Alamos National Laboratory issued a warning to the Los Alamos county <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> Service performing thinning of trees in the area to not remove the trees cut {{in various parts of the}} Bayo Canyon due to possible content of residual radioactive materials. The worst affected zones are fenced off; detectable levels of radioisotopes are present in the soil, insects and trees in the surrounding areas. The neighbouring population was not informed about the tests until the mid-1990s, and Los Alamos refused to declassify the documentation.|$|E
5|$|Suomen Gummitehdas Oy {{was founded}} in 1898 and began {{manufacturing}} car tyres in 1932. The Hakkapeliitta tyre name was introduced in 1936, and some tyres sold under the Nokian tyre name still use the Hakkapeliitta brand name. Hakkapeliitta is a (Finnish) historical term used for a Finnish light cavalryman {{in the service of}} King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48). In 1967, Suomen Kumitehdas Oy (originally called Suomen Gummitehdas Oy) merged with Suomen Kaapelitehdas (Finnish Cable Works) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and power industry company Nokia Aktiebolag to create Nokia Corporation.|$|E
50|$|Hillerød is {{surrounded}} {{by some of the}} most extensive woodlands in Denmark, with Store Dyrehave to <b>the</b> south <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> of Gribskov to the north. Gribskov is the fourth largest connected woodland in <b>the</b> country <b>and</b> both of <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> are rich with wild game, primarily deer.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>forest</b> {{is rich in}} resources, but {{the local}} people are more {{protected}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> are preserved.There is {{a long period of}} time in which minerals such as lead may be stored underground.|$|R
50|$|In 1162, Amadeus {{permitted}} {{the use of}} the land of Vaud, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> that belonged to him, by the Abbot of Haut-Crêt.|$|R
5|$|The Act left range {{management}} policy unresolved in many respects, {{although it did}} specify that BLM <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> Service consult with state wildlife agencies. In practice, BLM struggled to accommodate the needs of feral horses among its other priorities (which included livestock grazing, prevention of soil erosion, and accommodating big game hunting). In November 1971, the BLM announced a major effort to save the Pryor Mountain herd from starvation after a poor summer growing season left vegetation on the range stunted. By 1974, the herd on the Pryor Mountain range {{was said to have}} increased by 17 percent over the 1968 level, but there was strong disagreement over whether the population had actually increased.|$|E
5|$|The Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of Charters) {{was issued}} in Norman French by Edward I in 1297. Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, {{and they had}} armed {{themselves}} against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> Charter to avoid civil war. The nobles had sought to add another document, the De Tallagio, to Magna Carta. Edward I's government {{was not prepared to}} concede this, they agreed to the issuing of the Confirmatio, confirming the previous charters and confirming the principle that taxation should be by consent, although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{minister}} for forests from 1998 to 2001, Wilson Tuckey, {{was a strong}} advocate of Plantations 2020. He also held the federal seat of O'Connor in Western Australia, which included much of the Great Southern region and significant areas of plantation forests. Tuckey <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> industry had a close relationship, {{to the extent that}} the industry paid for newspaper advertisements that reproduced a letter from Tuckey, following critical coverage of forestry MIS schemes in the media. Great Southern also reproduced Tuckey's letter in their 2000 Annual Report.|$|E

5|$|When the Shawnee Purchase Units {{were first}} established, {{temporary}} headquarters {{were set up}} in Room 303, First Trust and Savings Bank Building, Harrisburg, Illinois. This was the only modern office building {{in the town of}} Harrisburg suitable for headquarters, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> has continued to occupy this building as Supervisor's offices. Expansion of the offices has continued since 1933, until today (June 1938), ten rooms on the third floor, and four rooms on the fourth floor, are leased by the Forest Service. Employees who were here during {{the early days of the}} forest tell of the chaos and confusion caused by the small space under lease, the incoming shipments of equipment and supplies, and the constant inflow of new personnel.|$|E
5|$|With the Restoration of Charles II to {{the throne}} in 1660 the castle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> were taken back to the {{ownership}} of the Duchy. Sir John Granville was made the Rider and Master Forester of Dartmoor and the Lydford Castle courts continued to be held to regulate the Forest. Repairs to the dilapidated building {{do not appear to}} have been carried out, however, and in 1704 a report was drawn up for the government, noting that the Stannary laws could not be enforced without a working prison.|$|E
5|$|With the reconfirmation of the Charters in 1300, an {{additional}} document was granted, the Articuli super Cartas (The Articles upon the Charters). It {{was composed of}} 17 articles and sought in part {{to deal with the}} problem of enforcing the Charters. Magna Carta <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> Charter were to be issued to the sheriff of each county, and should be read four times a year at the meetings of the county courts. Each county should have a committee of three men who could hear complaints about violations of the Charters.|$|E

5|$|Forests {{were special}} areas {{of land in}} medieval England, owned by the Crown and subject to forest law. They were often {{selected}} because of their natural resources, and were expected to provide the Crown with a flow of money or raw materials. In 1195, the Forest of Dartmoor extended across all of Devon, but in 1204 John curtailed {{the extent of the}} royal forest, removing much of Devon from Forest Law and leaving the area known in the modern period as Dartmoor. This reduced forest was still subject to the Forest Laws, involving a specialised group of legal officials who met at Lydford Castle to impose fines and other punishments. Probably both Lydford Castle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> was given to the Sheriff of Devon, William Brewer, in 1216. The arrangement changed under Henry III, when the estates were given to Richard, the Earl of Cornwall in 1239. Legally, this meant that the Forest of Dartmoor was converted to a chase, although the Earls of Cornwall continued to hold law courts at Lydford Castle, enforcing chase laws that closely resembled the former Forest Laws.|$|E
5|$|Gathering, {{hunting and}} fishing were still {{essential}} as sources of food and materials such as hide or fur. The forest was also exploited {{as a source of}} building materials such as wood. In addition, wild forest bees were kept there, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> {{could be used as a}} place of refuge. Until the 9th century, the population was separated from the main centers of civilization and self-sufficient with primitive, local community and household-based manufacturing. Specialized craftsmen existed only in the fields of iron extraction from ore and processing, and pottery; the few luxury items used were imports. From the 7th century on, modestly decorated ceramics were made with the potter's wheel. 7th– to 9th-century collections of objects have been found in Bonikowo and Bruszczewo, Kościan County (iron spurs, knives, clay containers with some ornamentation) and in the Kraków-Nowa Huta region (weapons and utensils in Pleszów and Mogiła), among other places. Slavic warriors were traditionally armed with spears, bows and wooden shields. Axes were used later, and still swords of the types popular throughout 7th– to 9th-century Europe were also used. Independent of distant powers, the Slavic tribes in Poland lived a relatively undisturbed life, but at the cost of some backwardness in civilization.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the forest was visited by {{mountain}} men and explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger. Colter {{is the first}} white man known to have visited both the Yellowstone region <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> which he did between 1807 and 1808. Having been an original member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Colter requested permission from Meriwether Lewis to leave the expedition after it had finished crossing the Rocky Mountains during their return journey from the Pacific Ocean. Colter teamed up with two unaffiliated explorers the expedition had encountered, but soon thereafter decided to explore regions south of where his new partners wished to venture. Traveling first into the northeastern region of what is today Yellowstone National Park, Colter then explored the Absaroka Mountains, crossing over Togwotee Pass and entering the valley known today as Jackson Hole. Colter survived a grizzly bear attack and a pursuit by a band of Blackfeet Indians who had taken his horse. The explorer later provided William Clark, who had been his commander on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with previously unknown information on the regions he had explored, which Clark published in 1814.|$|E

5|$|Miles {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} Empress Matilda, on {{her return to}} England in 1139. According to Professor Edmund King, Miles' decision to support Matilda was guided by expediancy rather than principle, {{and the necessity of}} joining forces with Matilda's illegitimate half-brother, the powerful Robert, Earl of Gloucester, who was the overlord of some of Miles' fiefs. Stephen stripped Miles of the title 'Constable of England' in punishment for having deserted him. On 25 July 1141, in gratitude for his support and military assistance and, according to historian R.H.C. Davis, possibly to compensate Miles for having appeared to have lost the constableship, Matilda invested him as 1st Earl of Hereford. He also received St. Briavels Castle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> of Dean. At the time Matilda was the de facto ruler of England, Stephen having been imprisoned at Bristol following his capture the previous February after the Battle of Lincoln. Sibyl was styled Countess of Hereford, until Miles' unexpected death over two years later. In 1141, Miles received the honour of Abergavenny from Brien FitzCount, the (likely illegitimate) son of Duke Alan IV of Brittany. This was in appreciation of the skilled military tactics Miles had deployed which had spared Brien's castle of Wallingford during King Stephen's besiegement in 1139/1140. Matilda gave her permission for the transfer.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 2005, {{the crew}} began {{shooting}} at Dominica, a location Verbinski had selected {{as he felt}} it fitted the sense of remoteness he was looking for. However, this was also a problem; the Dominican government were completely unprepared for the scale of a Hollywood production, as while the 500-strong crew occupying around 90% of the roads on the island they had trouble moving around on the underdeveloped surfaces. The weather also alternated between torrential rainstorms and hot temperatures, the latter of which was made worse for the cast who had to wear period clothing. At Dominica, the sequences involving the Pelegosto <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> segment of the battle on Isla Cruces were shot. Verbinski preferred to use practical props for the giant wheel and bone cage sequences, feeling long close-up shots would help further suspend the audience's disbelief. Dominica was also used for Tia Dalma's shack. Filming on the island concluded on May 26, 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Ostsack (east sack) of the Krivasoo bridgehead, {{defended by}} the Soviet 6th and the 117th Rifle Corps, were {{confused}} by the Strachwitz Battle Group's diversionary attack on 6 April. The attack deceived the Soviet forces into thinking that the German attack intended to cut them out from the west flank. The actual assault came directly at the 59th Army and started with a heavy bombardment. The positions of the 59th Army were attacked by dive bombers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> there was set afire. At the same time, the 61st Infantry Division and the Strachwitz tank squadron pierced deep into the 59th Army's defences, splitting the two rifle corps apart and forcing them to retreat to their fortifications. Marshal of the Soviet Union Leonid Govorov was outraged by the news, sending in the freshly re-deployed 8th Army. Their attempt {{to cut off the}} Tiger I tanks was repelled by Lieutenant Günther Famula, who received a posthumous Knight's Cross for these actions, keeping their supply lines open. On 7 April, Govorov ordered his troops to switch on to the defensive. The 59th Army, having lost another 5,700 troops from all causes, was withdrawn from the bridgehead. For these successes Strachwitz received the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds on 15 April 1944. News of the award had reached his headquarters on the early morning of 15 April via teleprinter message. The official presentation was made a few weeks later by Hitler.|$|E
