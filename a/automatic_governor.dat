50|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>governor</b> {{connected}} to the throttle valve, a small hand-lever above {{the steering wheel and}} the accelerator pedal allows the maintenance of any desired speed.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, the {{conventional}} power plant was dismantled in stages {{to allow for}} rehabilitation project, which was fully completed in 2009. Tuanku Jaafar Power Station has now become the power plant of choice (top in the merit order) with high efficiency, full automation (<b>Automatic</b> <b>Governor</b> Control-AGC), in compliance to the international standards and environment.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the power}} {{generated}} by the Mechanicville plant {{was sent to the}} General Electric plant in Schenectady. Some 40 Hz power was used locally for lighting and motors until 1949. In 1899, the Hudson River Power Company took over control of the plant from the original developers, and began operating the plant in parallel with a new larger plant called Spier Falls; regulation of the Mechnicville units speed was done manually until <b>automatic</b> <b>governors</b> were installed in 1902. From 1935 through to the end of WWII, the HVDC Mechanicville-Schenectady DC transmission system sent power to the GE plant and also served to convert from 40 Hz to 60 Hz.|$|R
50|$|Watt {{never ceased}} {{improving}} his designs. This further improved the operating cycle speed, introduced <b>governors,</b> <b>automatic</b> valves, double-acting pistons, {{a variety of}} rotary power takeoffs and many other improvements. Watt's technology enabled the widespread commercial use of stationary steam engines.|$|R
50|$|Fitchburg were notable in also {{supplying}} an <b>automatic</b> <b>governor</b> (illus., left-hand flywheel) {{that controlled}} the valve's cut-off according to load. Such governors would become significant around 1900 {{with the development}} of the high-speed engine, where they were used to control speed precisely. In these earlier medium-speed engines, the function of these governors was not just to control the engine's speed, but also to improve efficiency. The Fitchburg piston valves could be operated with a cut-off from zero to two-thirds of the stroke. A larger cut-off improves efficiency when operating under light loads. Earlier engines had used devices such as expansion valves to achieve this, but they also required the continued attention of a skilled driver, who could 'drive' the engine by varying the cut-off as load changed. The earlier Watt governors only controlled a throttle valve, so although they controlled an engine's speed, they did not encourage efficiency. An engine operating with no cut-off but a throttled steam supply will be operating inefficiently, owing to reduced expansive working and the risk of wire-drawing. The first 'automatic' governors were termed that because they not only controlled the speed, but could also take over the role of the driver and could vary cut-off too.|$|E
30|$|Primary {{frequency}} control is an <b>automatic</b> <b>governor</b> response {{in proportion to}} the frequency deviation from the scheduled value. This response, also called frequency responsive reserve, is typically provided by a conventional generator with governor droop control to regulate its power output as a function of frequency deviation and droop setting [50, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68]. A WTG’s primary frequency regulation resembles that of a conventional generator, which is usually activated within a few tens of seconds and sustained for up to 15 min once the grid frequency deviation exceeds the allowable threshold [67]. It {{plays an important role in}} mitigating the steady-state frequency deviation after inertial response until the secondary {{frequency control}} (automatic generation control, AGC) takes over to achieve zero frequency error in the steady-state condition.|$|E
40|$|The {{opportunity}} to maintain continuity of supply using dispersed generation when the network becomes disjointed and the grid connection is lost, is becoming realisable given the increasing penetration of these units in distribution networks. A rule-based system is presented which provides the necessary switching between the control strategies required for operation {{in parallel with}} the grid and when islanded. It consists of an expert system technique for selecting {{the control of the}} generator's excitation system and the <b>automatic</b> <b>governor</b> control system. The control strategy is such that when operating in parallel with the grid, the excitation and governor systems are operated to control the power factor and to regulate active power generation. In islanded operation these systems are operated to regulate the voltage and frequency of the islanded network. An advantage of this system {{is that it does not}} use communications to determine which control strategy is appropriate and instead relies on local measurements. Simulation studies are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive control system under a variety of operating condition...|$|E
50|$|Fuel {{injection}} is indirect via a prechamber arrangement. The OM-601's {{injection pump}} is a mechanical fuel injection unit with a 5,150 RPM (+ or - 50 RPM) mechanical <b>governor,</b> <b>automatic</b> altitude compensation, and a 'load sensing' automatic idle speed control. The pump is lubricated by {{a connection to}} the engine oil circulation.|$|R
50|$|The {{widely used}} {{reciprocating}} engine typically {{consisted of a}} cast iron cylinder, piston, connecting rod and beam or a crank and flywheel, and miscellaneous linkages. Steam was alternately supplied and exhausted {{by one or more}} valves. Speed control was either <b>automatic,</b> using a <b>governor,</b> or by a manual valve. The cylinder casting contained steam supply and exhaust ports.|$|R
50|$|About 7.6 metres {{south of}} the boiler is the Marshall steam engine. There is no manufacturer's name on the engine, but it has the {{characteristics}} of a Marshall, Sons & Co. (Gainsborough, England) engine, specifically their class C model, which was fitted with a Hartnell's Patent <b>automatic</b> expansion gear <b>governor.</b> An example of the latter is still present on top of the engine next to the flywheel.|$|R
40|$|Fluctuating {{wind power}} {{is due to}} wind {{turbulence}} and is the part which should be filtered out leaving behind the more predictable mean wind power which can be traded in the hourly energy market. The power fluctuations cause the frequency of electric utility to deviate from the 60 Hz standard. This thesis is concerned with estimating the maximum fluctuating wind power before the 1 % deviation from the 60 Hz standard (required by some utilities) is exceeded. To keep the thesis manageable, the scope is narrowed to thermal power plants with governor speed control but no <b>Automatic</b> <b>Governor</b> Control (AGC). This thesis shows that each governor speed control system provides energy storage buffer to attenuate the wind power fluctuations and arrives at the estimate that the fluctuating wind power penetration is conservatively around 5 % of the generation capacity of the utility grid. The methodologies used to reach this estimate are: (i) Transfer Function analysis of power plants; (ii) digital simulations using HYPERSIM. Through the research, an innovative method of predicting the frequency deviation in an electric grid with multiple power plants has been developed and validated by simulation. The thesis also shows that fluctuating wind power penetration can be higher when there are filtering also in the wind farms. Wind turbines, with small inertias, driving constant speed squirrel cage induction generators are found to provide poor filtering. On the other hand, the fluctuating wind power penetration limit is increased to 18 % {{in the case of}} wind turbines, with large inertias, driving variable-speed doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) with decoupled P-Q control to implement optimal wind power acquisition...|$|E
5000|$|In 1944, Earl Kemp Long, who {{had been}} {{governor}} from 1939 to 1940, ran for lieutenant governor but faced a Democratic runoff against J. Emile Verret, a school board member from Iberia Parish. Long lost the runoff to Verret, {{but he had been}} the high votegetter in the first primary. If there had been no gubernatorial runoff that year, Long would have been the <b>automatic</b> lieutenant <b>governor</b> nominee. Louisiana law at the time provided {{that there would be no}} second primaries for other constitutional offices unless there was also a gubernatorial contest. Long hence could have won if the [...] "Long" [...] candidate for governor, Lewis L. Morgan of Covington, the seat of St. Tammany Parish, had withdrawn from the runoff with James Houston [...] "Jimmie" [...] Davis.|$|R
50|$|As {{technology}} advanced, so did {{the electronics}} that go into cars. The electronic control unit in a modern automobile, together with advanced engine technology, {{makes it possible to}} control many aspects of the engine's operation, such as spark timing and fuel injection. The electronic control unit may also control electronic throttle control (drive-by-wire), poppet valve timing, boost control (in turbocharged engines), Anti-lock braking system, the <b>automatic</b> transmission, speed <b>governor</b> (if equipped), and the Electronic Stability Control system.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{there has been a}} {{continuous}} growth of wind power generation. This trend, especially in Greek islands, where wind potential is high, raises the issue of acceptable penetration levels of wind generation especially in autonomous systems. This work is part of a research program between PPC S. A. -of Greece and NTUA. The method is applied to two islands, Crete and Rhodes, where wind power penetration is expected to be increased within the next years. The power grid of each island is modeled and speed <b>governors,</b> <b>automatic</b> voltage regulators of conventional plants, as well as wind turbines are modeled in detail. Case studies are formed and simulation results are produced, discussed and eventually the penetration levels are determined, together with proposed measures to increase them. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a detailed modelling approach {{to study the}} impact of wind power fluctuations on the frequency control in a non-interconnected system with large-scale wind power. The approach includes models for wind speed fluctuations, wind farm technologies, conventional generation technologies, power system protection and load. Analytical models for wind farms with three different wind turbine technologies, namely Doubly Fed Induction Generator, Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator and Active Stall Induction Generator-based wind turbines, are included. Likewise, analytical models for diesel and steam generation plants are applied. The power grid, including speed <b>governors,</b> <b>automatic</b> voltage regulators, protection system and loads is modelled in the same platform. Results for different load and wind profile cases are being presented for the case study of the island Rhodes, in Greece. The scenarios studied correspond to reference year of study 2012. The effect of wind fluctuations in the system frequency is studied for the different load cases, and comments on the penetration limits are being made based on the results.

40|$|EXPLANATION OF TEST REPORT GENERAL CONDITIONS East tractor is a {{production}} model equipped for common usage. Power consuming accessories can be disconnected {{only when it}} is convenient for the operator {{to do so in}} practice. Additional weight can be added as ballast if the manufacturer regularly supplies it for sale. The static tire loads and the inflation pressures muse conform to recommendations in the Tire Standards published by the Society of Automotive Engineers. PREPARATION FOR PERFORMANCE RUNS The engine crank case is drained and refilled with a measured amount of new oil conforming to specifications in the operator’s manual. The fuel used and the maintenance operations must also conform to the published information delivered with the tractor. The tractor is then limbered-up for 1 hour on drawbar work in accordance with the manufacturers published recommendations. The manufacturer’s representative is present to make appropriate decisions regarding mechanical adjustments. The tractor is equipped with approximately the amount of added ballast that is used during maximum drawbar tests. The tire tread-bar height must be at least 65 % of new tread height prior to the maximum power run. BELT OR POWER TAKE-OFF PERFORMANCE Maximum Power and Fuel Consumption. The manufacturer’s representative makes carburetor, fuel pump, ignition and governor control settings which remain unchanged throughout tall subsequent runs. The governor and the manually operated governor control lever is set to provide the high-idle speed specified by the manufacturer for maximum power. Maximum power is measured by connecting the belt pulley or the power take-off to a dynamometer. The dynamometer load is then gradually increased until the engine is operating at the rated speed specified by the manufacturer for maximum power. The corresponding fuel consumption is measured. Varying Power and Fuel Consumption. Six different horsepower levels are used to show corresponding fuel consumption rates and how the governor causes the engine to react to the following changes in dynamometer load: 85 % of the dynamometer torque at maximum power; minimum dynamometer torque, ½ the 85 % torque; maximum power; ¼ and ¾ of the 85 % torque. Since at tractor is generally subjected to varying loads the average of the results in this test serve well for predicting the fuel consumption of a tractor in general usage. DRAWBAR PERFORMANCE All engine adjustments are the same as those used in the belt or power take-off tests. If the manufacturer specifies a different rated crankshaft speed for drawbar operations, then the position of the manually operated governor control is changed to provide the high-idle speed specified by the manufacturer in the operating instructions. Varying Power and Fuel Consumption With Ballast. The varying power runs are made to show the effect of speed-control devices (engine <b>governor,</b> <b>automatic</b> transmissions, etc.) on horsepower, speed and fuel consumption. These runs are made around the entire test course with has two 180 degree turns with a minimum radius of 50 feet. The drawbar pull is set at 3 different levels as follows: (1) as near to the pull a maximum power as possible and still have the tractor maintain the travel speed at maximum horsepower on the straight sections of the test course; (2) 75 % of the pull at maximum power; and (3) 50 % of the pull at maximum power. Prior to 1958, fuel consumption data (10 hour test) were shown only for the pull obtained at maximum power for tractors having torque converters and at 75 % of the pull obtained at maximum power for gear-type tractors. Maximum Power With Ballast. Maximum power is measured on straight level sections of the test course. Data are shown for not more that 12 different gears or travel speeds. Some gears or travel speeds may be omitted because of high slippage of the traction members or because the travel speed may exceed the safe-limit for the test course. The maximum safe speed for the Nebraska Test course has been set at 15 miles per hour. The slippage limits have been set at 15 % and 7 % for pneumatic tires and steel tracks or lugs, respectively. Higher slippage gives widely varying results. Maximum Power Without Ballast. All added ballast is removed from the tractor. The maximum drawbar power of the tractor is determined by the same procedure used for getting maximum power with ballast. The gear (or travel speed) is the same as that used in the 10 -hours test. Varying Power and Travel Speed With Ballast. Travel speeds corresponding to drawbar pulls beyond the maximum power range are obtained to show the “lugging ability” of the tractor. The run starts with the pull at maximum power; then additional drawbar pull is applied to cause decreasing speeds. The run is ended by one of three conditions; (1) maximum pull is obtained, (2) the maximum slippage limit is reached, or (3) some other operating limit is reached...|$|R
