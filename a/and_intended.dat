5|$|A {{total of}} sixty-nine poems, sixty short stories, and three serials were {{published}} in Asia Raya, a newspaper in the Dutch East Indies and early Indonesia. First published on 29 April 1942, months after the Empire of Japan invaded the Indies, Asia Raya was established under the occupation government <b>and</b> <b>intended</b> {{as a vehicle for}} pro-Japanese propaganda– including literature. Run by both Japanese and native staff, the newspaper remained in publication until 7September 1945, closing {{less than a month after}} Indonesia proclaimed its independence.|$|E

So, for example, the 2009 report was published in October 2009 <b>and</b> <b>intends</b> to reflect events between 1 September 2008 and 31 August 2009. No report was released in 2011. The 2011-2012 report, labelled 2012 in the table below, was published on 20 January 2012 <b>and</b> <b>intends</b> to reflect events between 1 December 2010 and 30 November 2011.

5|$|After {{taking a}} two-month break {{following}} the band's Black Clouds and Underdogs tour in promotion of their 2005 album From Under the Cork Tree, Fall Out Boy {{returned to the}} studio to begin work on their follow-up effort. The band began writing songs for the new album while touring, <b>and</b> <b>intended</b> to quickly make a new album {{in order to keep}} momentum in the wake of their breakthrough success. Vocalist Patrick Stump stated that he wished to begin working on the record earlier, but the group's management urged the members to take time off to recuperate from their constant touring schedule.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} during his campaigns in Thessaly, Philip {{captured}} the strategic port of Pagasae, which was in effect the port of Pherae. It is unclear whether this was during {{the first or second}} campaign; both Buckler and Cawkwell suggest that it took place in the second campaign, before the Battle of Crocus Field. By taking Pagasae, it is possible that Philip prevented Pherae from being reinforced by sea during his second campaign. Buckler suggests that Philip had learnt his lesson from the previous campaign, <b>and</b> <b>intended</b> to cut Pherae off from outside help before attacking it.|$|E
5|$|Based on Japanese mythology, Orochimaru {{was created}} {{as one of}} the series' main antagonists, <b>and</b> <b>intended</b> to {{represent}} the opposite of the protagonists' morals and values.

In Japanese, Orochimaru has been voiced by Kujira whereas in the English dub he is voiced by Steve Blum.|$|E

5|$|By early 1944, Allied {{submarines}} were sinking {{large numbers}} of Japanese ships. Their activities were frequently guided by 'Ultra' intelligence relating to ship movements which was collected by intercepting and decrypting encoded radio transmissions. The IJN routinely broadcast the location <b>and</b> <b>intended</b> route of convoys under its protection, and decrypting these messages allowed Allied naval commanders to alert submarines {{in the vicinity of}} convoys. The submarine commanders were free to plan their interception and attack where conditions were most favorable.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{asserted}} that the king of Scotland owed him feudal allegiance, <b>and</b> <b>intended</b> to unite the two nations by marrying his son Edward to Margaret, the sole heir of King Alexander III. When Margaret died in 1290, competition for the Scottish crown ensued. By invitation of Scottish magnates, Edward I resolved the dispute, ruling in favour of John Balliol, who duly swore loyalty to him and became king. Edward insisted that he was Scotland's sovereign and possessed the right to hear appeals against Balliol's judgements, undermining Balliol's authority. Balliol allied with France in 1295; Edward invaded Scotland the following year, deposing and exiling Balliol.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{when he was}} {{not working}} at American Greetings, Crumb drew many Fritz the Cat strips for his own amusement. Some of these strips would later be {{published}} in Help! and Cavalier magazines and in the underground comix. Fritz also appears briefly in Crumb's graphic novel Big Yum Yum Book: The Story of Oggie and the Beanstalk, drawn in 1964, but not published until 1975. Several characters from the anthropomorphic universe of Fritz the Cat appeared in another Crumb comic strip, The Silly Pigeons, drawn in 1965 <b>and</b> <b>intended</b> for Help! In 1970, Crumb redrew an early Fuzzy the Bunny story written by Charles Crumb in 1952; it was published in Zap Comix #5.|$|E

A former employee of Wurpel had been storing the tapes <b>and</b> <b>intended</b> to dispose of them unless the city was interested. The city had paid her $3,000 for the storage costs and took possession of the tapes. Legal proceedings subsequently ensued to return the tapes to Wurpel and U2.|$|E

5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, <b>and</b> <b>intended</b> to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society {{was formed}} with the {{intention}} of fulfilling a number of goals. It hoped to educate women on why they {{should have the right to}} vote and convince men of the same. It had links with Liberal MPs <b>and</b> <b>intended</b> to use these to pressure the government to allow women's suffrage. In addition, the society tried to drum up support for their cause by holding small scale events, often with speakers at the Yamen Cafe in Liverpool's Bond Street. The events would also include poetry, singing or performances of acting or ballet by the Blue Bird Theatre Company.|$|E

He spent the last months of 1797 recuperating in London, during which he was awarded the Freedom of the City of London and a pension of £1,000 a year. He used the money to buy Round Wood Farm near Ipswich, <b>and</b> <b>intended</b> to retire there with Fanny. Despite his plans, Nelson was never to live there.|$|E
