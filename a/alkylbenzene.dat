25|$|Benzene is used {{mainly as}} an {{intermediate}} to make other chemicals, above all ethylbenzene, cumene, cyclohexane, nitrobenzene, and <b>alkylbenzene.</b> More {{than half of the}} entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene, a precursor to styrene, which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene and EPS. Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene, which is needed to produce phenol and acetone for resins and adhesives. Cyclohexane consumes ca. 10% of the world's benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, explosives, and pesticides. In 2013, the biggest consumer country of benzene was China, followed by the USA. Benzene production is currently expanding in the Middle East and in Africa, whereas production capacities in Western Europe and North America are stagnating.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the first development of detailed kinetic {{models for the}} <b>alkylbenzenes</b> actually present in diesel fuels. Thanks to {{a new version of}} the software EXGAS dedicated to <b>alkylbenzenes,</b> the first detailed models for the oxidation of <b>alkylbenzenes</b> with an alkyl chain containing more than 2 atoms of carbon have been automatically generated. These models are based on an aromatic reaction base consisting of a recent ethylbenzene detailed kinetic model. They involve a new type of generic primary reaction for EXGAS mechanisms, ipso-addition, and new generic rules for the estimation of kinetic parameters involved in primary and secondary mechanisms. The existing experimental data on the oxidation of n-propylbenzene and n-butylbenzene, as well as new results on the oxidation of n-hexylbenzene obtained in a jet-stirred reactor from 500 to 1100 K under 1 atm, have been successfully modeled. Simulations well reproduce the more important low-temperature reactivity which is observed for n-hexylbenzene compared to n-butylbenzene. This new tool has also been used to numerically investigate the behavior of <b>alkylbenzenes</b> from n-propylbenzene up to n-decylbenzene. Simulations using this model show an important enhancement of low-temperature reactivity when the alkyl chain in the compounds increases. Flow rate analyses show that this significant increase is due to a decreasing influence of resonance stabilized benzylic radicals obtained from the reactant by H-abstractions on the carbon atom neighboring the ring...|$|R

40|$|Póster presentado en la SSS 6. 2 /BG 9. 11 : Soil {{organic matter}} turnover: from {{molecules}} to ecosystems {{and back again}} (co-organized) del Congreso European Geosciences Union General Assembly 2017 Vienna | Austria | 23 – 28 April 2017 The environmental factors involved in soil organic carbon sequestration remain unclear. The functional relationships between the macromolecular structure of the soil organic matter (SOM) and its resilience {{has been a constant}} in classical biogeochemical models. Other more recent hypotheses have postulated that preservation by soil minerals may play a chief role in the accumulation of stable SOM forms. However, additional experimental data are required to demonstrate a cause-to-effect relationship between preservation and stabilization. Some authors might consider that models neglecting the role of macromolecular structure are swapping cause and effect i. e. that SOM structurally flexible, weakly condensed and having ‘open’ structures is the one with high potential to interact with the soil mineral matrix, leading to stable microaggregates. In this study up to 35 topsoil samples (0 – 5 cm) were collected from different Spanish soils with contrasted values of organic C (the dependent variable), geological substrate and vegetation type. A wide array of uni- and multivariate chemometric models were applied to independent variables consisting of total abundances of the major aromatic compounds, i. e. <b>alkylbenzenes</b> and methoxyphenols released from whole soil samples using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). These two families of compounds were selected since they are classically considered to inform on the degree of microbial reworking of lignins, which is an important precursor of the aromatic moiety of the SOM. A series of pyrolytic surrogate indices (aiming to express SOM diagenetic transformation in relation to the original biogenic molecular composition) were especially successful in forecasting SOC, viz: a) ratio between <b>alkylbenzenes</b> and methoxyphenols, b) ratio between short-chain (C 0 –C 4) and long-chain (>C 4) <b>alkylbenzenes,</b> c) ratio between methoxyphenols and short-chain <b>alkylbenzenes,</b> and d) ratios between methoxyphenols with different side-chain length, i. e. methyl-, ethyl-, vinyl-, propenyl- and aceto- derivatives of guaiacyl and syringyl rings. In particular partial least squares regression (PLS) models led to very significant prediction of SOC based exclusively on the major aromatic pyrolytic compounds as predictors, i. e, methoxyphenols and <b>alkylbenzenes.</b> The PLS coefficients showed high positive loadings for methoxyphenols (i. e. these compounds were diagnostic for soils with high C-storage potential), and negative for <b>alkylbenzenes</b> (which were characteristic for C-depleted soils). This may be explained as if selective preservation of lignin were the most efficient process in soils behaving as active C sinks. Conversely, the progressive smoothing in the lignin signature and the accumulation of methoxyl-lacking aromatics (i. e. short-chain <b>alkylbenzenes)</b> was typical in the soils with low SOC content but high levels of diagenetic alteration of lignin. The progressive alteration of C 6 –C 3 phenylpropanoid lignin units also corresponded to the fact that heavily altered lignin, presumptively accumulated in SOM depleted soils, tended to release typical pyrolytic markers consisting of C 0 –C 1 methoxyphenols instead of its vinyl and propenyl counterparts, in addition to major proportions of short-chain (<C 4) <b>alkylbenzenes.</b> The SOM forecasting model suggested that the SOM storage potential in continental Mediterranean soils does not parallel SOM quality, at least when the latter is defined as {{the extent to which the}} structural components of biomacromolecules are transformed into H- or alkyl-substituted condensed structures (i. e. in the case of lignin: demethoxylation, dealkylation, phenylpropanoid side-chain breakdown...) which characterizes the matured, structurally complex SOM forms. This finding could challenge the current policies incentivizing SOM sequestration regardless the qualitative descriptors of its maturity, or the analysis of local mechanisms responsible for the temporary retention of the SOM under different bioclimatic scenarios.
