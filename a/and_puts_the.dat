Kate struggles to put on her oxygen mask due to the handcuffs, so she uncuffs herself using the marshal's keys <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> marshal's oxygen mask on him before attaching her own, {{at which point the}} tail end of the plane suddenly breaks off and flies away.|$|E
5|$|Veerangan {{now finds}} himself saddled {{with the role}} of king for more days than he had {{initially}} bargained for because of Marthandan's sudden disappearance. He does not let this setback deter him <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to good use by beginning many reforms, and enacting several measures to uplift the poor. These steps are supported by the people while causing a political upheaval among the elite. However, he is troubled {{by the fact that he}} is deceiving Manohari who believes him to be Marthandan. Unable to keep it a secret from her, he tells her the truth. Perceiving his noble character, Manohari accepts him as her brother.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} two {{unemployed}} parents obtaining employment {{in an upcoming}} theater production. Shortly after returning home, the landlady shows up and demands the rent, but can not collect. She gives them one week, but the theater production does not manifest and the parents again search for work. While they are out, the landlady finds a tenant <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> children out on the street. They end up dancing for an organ grinder and are saved by a theater manager who puts them on his vaudeville bill. The parents come into a fortune and are reunited by their children at the theater. The film was met with positive reviews and some criticism for its acting and scenario, but the industry had reasons to encourage the success of Edwin Thanhouser's company. A print of the film exists, {{but it was the}} subject of nitrate deterioration.|$|E

On the sorcerer's orders, the duo fight Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, and Sonya Blade and come close to defeating them until Raiden intervenes <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> fight to a halt. The backstory relationship of Scorpion and Sub-Zero is explored {{during the course of}} the film in a computer-animated fight sequence. He was the only character in the film who had no dialogue.|$|E

By the time the platform has completed almost a full rotation, another milker or a machine removes the cups and the cow steps backwards off the platform and then walks to its feed. Rotary cowsheds, as they are called in New Zealand, started in the 1980s but are expensive compared to Herringbone cowshed - the older New Zealand norm.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a broad}} {{disagreement}} over chronology between Matthew, Mark and Luke {{on one hand and}} John on the other: all four agree that Jesus' public ministry began with an encounter with John the Baptist, but Matthew, Mark and Luke follow this with an account of teaching and healing in Galilee, then a trip to Jerusalem where there is an incident in the Temple, climaxing with the crucifixion {{on the day of the}} Passover holiday. John, by contrast, puts the Temple incident very early in Jesus' ministry, has several trips to Jerusalem, <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> crucifixion immediately before the Passover holiday, on the day when the lambs for the Passover meal were being sacrificed in Temple.|$|E
25|$|Tetsuo disappears in the {{subsequent}} explosion, and Kaneda and Kei come across Akira outside of the base. Vaguely aware of who he is, they take him back into Neo-Tokyo. Both the Colonel's soldiers and the followers of an Esper named Lady Miyako begin scouring Neo-Tokyo in search for him. Kaneda, Kei, and a third terrorist, Chiyoko, attempt to find refuge with Akira on Nezu's yacht. However, Nezu betrays them and kidnaps Akira for his own use, attempting to have them killed. They survive the attempt, and manage to snatch Akira from Nezu's mansion. The Colonel, desperate to find Akira and {{fed up with the}} government's tepid response to the crisis, mounts a coup d'état <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> city under martial law. The Colonel's men join Lady Miyako's acolytes and Nezu's private army in chasing Kaneda, Kei, Chiyoko, and Akira through the city.|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} Pink World's main character, Artemus, shown in his bedroom, {{looking out the}} window at a {{helicopter}} that follows him throughout {{the first half of the}} video. He is then shown holding a small globe that is glowing red. His mother enters <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> globe under his bed and tucks him in. With the helicopter following him, the scene changes to a large institutional setting filled with empty beds. He appears sad and confused as his mother washes him. He sees a vision of crowds of people in the Barrier (foreshadowing the scene in the second part of the video). The first part of the video ends as we see Artemus again looking out of his bedroom window, the institution and the crowds in the Barrier apparently a vision. He climbs back into bed. The plot in the first part of the video is not linear. Scenes are interspersed with flashbacks and future visions.|$|E

25|$|But then {{a mysterious}} {{person in a}} Krabby Patty-costume defeats {{all four of the}} {{restaurant}} managers, saves SpongeBob and takes him back to the Krusty Krab. It turns out that the Krusty Krab has gone downhill ever since Mr. Krabs fired SpongeBob and took over as the fry cook. Squidward reveals himself as the person in the costume, and explains that as much as he hates SpongeBob (which SpongeBob himself acknowledges), he hates the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more, and both he and Mr. Krabs ask SpongeBob to be the fry cook again, with Mr. Krabs admitting that he made a huge mistake in firing SpongeBob in the first place. SpongeBob gladly accepts his old job as the fry cook, <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> restaurant back on track, which brings back all the customers, even the four restaurant managers who fought over SpongeBob. At the end of the episode, Mr. Krabs reveals that he has installed a pay toilet that costs a nickel to use, thus making up the nickel that he previously lost by hiring SpongeBob.|$|E
25|$|Depth {{of field}} {{increases}} with f-number, {{as illustrated in}} the image here. This means that photographs taken with a low f-number (large aperture) will tend to have subjects at one distance in focus, {{with the rest of}} the image (nearer and farther elements) out of focus. This is frequently used for nature photography and portraiture because background blur (the aesthetic quality of which is known as 'bokeh') can be aesthetically pleasing <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> viewer's focus on the main subject in the foreground. The depth of field of an image produced at a given f-number is dependent on other parameters as well, including the focal length, the subject distance, and the format of the film or sensor used to capture the image. Depth of field can be described as depending on just angle of view, subject distance, and entrance pupil diameter (as in von Rohr's method). As a result, smaller formats will have a deeper field than larger formats at the same f-number for the same distance of focus and same angle of view since a smaller format requires a shorter focal length (wider angle lens) to produce the same angle of view, and depth of field increases with shorter focal lengths. Therefore, reduced–depth-of-field effects will require smaller f-numbers when using small-format cameras than when using larger-format cameras.|$|E
500|$|With Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death, Jack {{retrieves}} {{the last}} remaining drops {{of water from the}} destroyed fountain <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> tear in one of them. Knowing that one of them must be sacrificed, he wants Angelica to drink from the chalice containing the tear. Instead, Blackbeard drinks it, asking his daughter to save him. Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice. Jack is upset to lose Angelica, but reveals that he made a mistake about which chalice contained the tear. Neither of the two are happy, and they both believe Jack deliberately tricked them. Angelica's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard's body.|$|E

When the video fades, she reveals {{that she had}} known that the planetarium would never have more customers during the 30 years she was alone, despite her apparent infinite optimism up to this point. In her final moment as she [...] "dies" [...] in front of him, Yumemi ejects the memory card from her artificial brain for his safekeeping. Touched and completely shaken {{by the loss of}} the beautiful world she left in his mind, he throws away his gun <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> memory card in his coat, before wandering off with a broken leg as the fallen war machine's automated backup units are closing in on the scene.|$|E
500|$|Back home, {{having given}} up on his dream, SpongeBob dries himself out when he {{receives}} an insulting phone call <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> hair dryer in his pants. While he talks, the dryer inflates his pants, giving him the ability to fly. He goes around helping people, earning their admiration and becoming a superhero of sorts. However, the other characters continue to ask increasingly unnecessary favors of him, leaving him no time to fly with the jellyfish. When he tries to escape to the Jellyfish Fields, a mob forms and chases him, but is unable to catch him. Cannonball Jenkins, formerly a farmer and later on, a sailor, launches himself at SpongeBob, popping the pants and sending him plummeting to the ground. Everyone then hold a funeral for his now-deflated pants. Upset, SpongeBob decides to go home, but the jellyfish help him fly and take him back there. Patrick arrives and asks if they could [...] "fly over" [...] to the pizzeria, but SpongeBob decides to leave the flying to the jellyfish, only for Patrick to literally fly off himself.|$|E
500|$|Nikephoros Komnenos {{continued}} {{to serve as}} strategos of Vaspurakan under Basil II's brother and successor, Constantine VIII, but in 1026 he was dismissed on suspicion of disloyalty and recalled to Constantinople, where he was blinded. Two different versions are provided by the historical record on the background to his recall: the Byzantine chronicler John Skylitzes reports that he insisted on a written pledge of support from his troops, intended to be used against the neighbouring Turkish rulers, but which was interpreted by Constantine {{as an attempt to}} create a force personally loyal to him. While Skylitzes declares the accusation baseless <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> blame on the over-suspicious Constantine, Aristakes claims that Nikephoros was indeed engaged in treasonous talks with King George I of Georgia (...) , aiming to either declare himself emperor, or make Vaspurakan an independent kingdom. When the troops of Cappadocia found out about it, however, they captured Nikephoros and sent him as a prisoner to Constantinople, where Constantine VIII, after carefully examining the affair and convincing himself of Nikephoros' guilt, had him and eight of his companions blinded in the next year.|$|E

500|$|The primary {{characters}} in The Other Hand are Little Bee, a Nigerian refugee, and Sarah, a middle-class Englishwoman. Critics {{have focused on}} the contrast between the two, with Caroline Elkins of The New York Times commenting that Sarah might initially appear [...] "insipid" [...] to readers, and that when juxtaposed with Little Bee, she seems [...] "unsympathetic, even tiresome". Tim Teeman of The Times deemed Sarah [...] "batty, bizarre and inconsistent, and despite the tragedy she has suffered, unsympathetic", while writing that in contrast: [...] "Goodness peppers every atom of [...] being." [...] Other reviewers took an opposite stance. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle found Little Bee's characterisation problematic, writing: [...] "Sometimes she's not convincing, and sometimes she tries too hard to convince. It's too often apparent that Little Bee is not real. This doesn't do justice to her story, <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> burden back on the author to show that he's representing her, rather than exploiting her." [...] Ed Lake of The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Bee's arch reasonableness and implausibly picturesque speech mean she often comes off as a too-cute cipher", and ultimately found Sarah the more convincing character.|$|E
500|$|The {{recovery}} of higher-resolution ice cores spanning {{more of the}} past 1,000,000 years by the ongoing EPICA project may help shed more light on the matter. A new, high-precision dating method developed by the team allows better correlation of the various factors involved <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> ice core chronologies on a stronger temporal footing, endorsing the traditional Milankovitch hypothesis, that climate variations are controlled by insolation in the northern hemisphere. The new chronology is inconsistent with the [...] "inclination" [...] theory of the 100,000-year cycle. The establishment of leads and lags against different orbital forcing components with this method—which uses the direct insolation control over nitrogen-oxygen ratios in ice core bubbles—is in principle a great improvement in the temporal resolution of these records and another significant validation of the Milankovitch hypothesis. An international climate modelling exercise (Abe-ouchi et al., Nature, 2013) demonstrated that climate models can replicate the 100,000-year cyclicity given the orbital forcing and carbon dioxide levels of the late Pleistocene. The isostatic history of ice sheets was implicated in mediating the 100,000-year response to the orbital forcing. Larger ice sheets are lower in elevation because they depress the continental crust upon which they sit, {{and are therefore more}} vulnerable to melting.|$|E
500|$|Doomfist is {{the first}} villain {{introduced}} to the Overwatch fictional universe. In the backstory of the third Doomfist, Akande Ogundimu is presented as the villainous heir to a prosthetics company in Nigeria who splits his time between expanding the company and martial arts training. During the game's [...] "Omnic War" [...] between humans and rogue Omnic robots, Ogundimu lost his right arm. His prosthetic replacement impressed the second Doomfist (Akinjide Adeyemi), who then trained Ogundimu as his successor, but the student later killed his teacher to claim the gauntlet for himself. Ogundimu became {{a leader of the}} Talon group, the nemesis organization to Overwatch, and advocates for his belief that forces of conflict will strengthen humanity. At some point prior to the game's present, Overwatch's Winston, a playable character from the game, defeats Doomfist <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> titular gauntlet behind glass in the Overwatch museum, as referenced in the original Overwatch announcement video. Blizzard's first teaser for Doomfist's release shows a fictional news report about Talon freeing Doomfist from prison to steal the gauntlet. Blizzard had modified the Numbani level during its release of Orisa, the previous playable character released for the game, to imply that Doomfist had attacked the city and stolen the gauntlet; notably, the payload casing had been broken open and the gauntlet missing.|$|E
