25|$|As well {{as being}} an {{everyday}} beverage, Turkish coffee is {{also a part of}} the traditional Turkish wedding custom. As a prologue to marriage, the bridegroom's parents (in the lack of his father, his mother and an elderly member of his family) must visit the young girl's family to ask the hand of the bride-to-be and the blessings of her parents upon the upcoming marriage. During this meeting, the bride-to-be must prepare and serve Turkish coffee to the guests. For the groom's coffee, the bride-to-be sometimes uses salt instead of sugar to gauge his character. If the bridegroom drinks his coffee without any sign of displeasure, the bride-to-be assumes that the groom is good-tempered and patient. As the groom already comes as the demanding party to the girl's house, in fact it is the boy who is passing an exam and etiquette requires him to receive with <b>all</b> <b>smiles</b> this particular present from the girl, although {{in some parts of the}} country this may be considered as a lack of desire on the part of the girl for marriage with that candidate.|$|E

25|$|One {{day during}} our lunch {{hour in the}} last week of filming, the craft service man handed out slices of {{watermelon}} to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, <b>all</b> <b>smiles.</b> I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during Stir Crazy.|$|E
500|$|Strindberg was {{susceptible}} to strong, independent career women, {{as well as}} to dainty, delicate-looking young girls; like his first and second wives—Siri von Essen and Frida Uhl—Bosse combined these qualities. He was entranced when he saw the dark, exotic-looking, petite twenty-two-year-old Bosse (who was often cast in sprite roles or what were conceptualized as [...] "Oriental" [...] roles) play her first major part, an impish Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream. He immediately picked her out as a suitable actress for the part of The Lady in his coming play To Damascus, and invited [...] her to his bachelor establishment to discuss the role. At this famous first meeting, Strindberg, according to Bosse's narrative of the event, met her at the door <b>all</b> <b>smiles</b> and charm. Offering her wine, flowers, and beautifully arranged fruit, he shared with her his fascination with alchemy, showing her a golden brown mixture he told her was gold he had made. When she got up to leave, Bosse claims Strindberg asked for the feather in her hat to use for writing his plays. [...] Bosse gave it to him, and he used this feather, with a steel nib insert, to write all his dramas during their marriage. [...] It is now in the Strindberg Museum in Stockholm.|$|E

2500|$|Buffalo Bill and his Wild West {{was back}} in Du Bois in September 1901. At this time McCreight lived in his townhouse, and had not yet moved to The Wigwam. [...] “At {{the opening of the}} 20th Century a crowd of twelve Oglala Lakota came to spend the evening with the writer. [...] Besides Chief Lone Bear, Chief Flying Hawk was in the party. [...] The yard outside was covered with neighbors, big and little, who had seen them come, arrayed in their war bonnets, beaded regalia and gay plumes of eagle quills, as they climbed to and spread over the wide veranda and swung open their richly covered blankets. [...] It was a {{surprise}} visit from old-time western friends. [...] Don [...] was quickly dispatched for cigars, fruit and candy, with a large market basket and instructions to deliver same to the back door,to apportion the supplies, and pass them around when the Indians got seated inside. [...] Don was thirteen, and full of business. [...] At the proper time, he appeared from the kitchen with both arms full, a cigar for each man on the platter, and another with candy, bananas, oranges and grapes. [...] Don set the fruit basket on a table in the outer room, and proceeded to pass the cigars, beginning with the big chief. [...] As he modestly handed the platter to the chief to take one cigar, the whole dozen or more were scooped from the plate and quickly stored within his blanket. [...] The boy was “game,” and went back his kitchen stores and brought another supply, and went on passing them to the others-one at a time.” “Chief Lone Bear noticed a pair of boxing gloves on the floor and signed to the writer to explain. They belonged to the [...] twins, aged five. More signals indicated he wanted to see them box. The two boys stood with open eyes gazing at the strange people, and it took a little coaxing to get the boys to put on the gloves. [...] But they, too, were game, and came to dad to have them tied on. <b>All</b> <b>smiles,</b> the visitors spread their chairs, through the arch into the big parlor, so as to form a large area, for the bout. [...] Dad called “time” and the boys went to it rough and tumble. They immediately forgot their modesty and the audience. [...] No fight in the prize rings of New York or Boston ever witnessed better sparring. It was a battle to the finish; bloody noses and howls of laughter from the Indians all the while it lasted. [...] When they were exhausted and their dad stopped the fight, the old chief ordered that they both be adopted into the tribe as worthy of membership in [...] "The Nation of the Fighting Sioux." ...|$|E
