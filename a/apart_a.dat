5|$|At the Horn Island {{lighthouse}}, {{the lighthouse}} keeper was killed {{along with his}} wife and daughter due to the hurricane. In addition to the death of the three at the lighthouse, it was noted that the schooner Daisy had been dismantled there, with one person killed. A person who was climbing a small tree was thrown away by the wind and drowned. Several people were trapped in their homes after a creek topped its banks. A warehouse and four other buildings were destroyed, while a bank's roof was blown off. A train near Brookhaven was washed away along the tracks of the Mississippi Central Railroad, resulting in the injury of five people. 25 schooners along the Mississippi coastline were completely destroyed. Two barks, the Nurnberg and Hercules were destroyed during the hurricane. Mandeline, owned by Norway, was filled with water, while Sigrav suffered severe damage, completely torn <b>apart.</b> <b>A</b> boat known as the Florine was washed ashore. A total of 78fatalities occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} some comets may be fragile, a {{conclusion}} {{supported by the}} observation of comets splitting <b>apart.</b> <b>A</b> significant cometary disruption was that of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9, which was discovered in 1993. A close encounter in July 1992 had broken it into pieces, and {{over a period of}} six days in July 1994, these pieces fell into Jupiter's atmosphere—the first time astronomers had observed a collision between two objects in the Solar System. Other splitting comets include 3D/Biela in 1846 and 73P/Schwassmann–Wachmann from 1995 to 2006. Greek historian Ephorus reported that a comet split apart {{as far back as the}} winter of 372–373 BC. Comets are suspected of splitting due to thermal stress, internal gas pressure, or impact.|$|E

At its conclusion, the Maritime delegations expressed a willingness to join a confederation if the details could be worked out.|$|E

5|$|The Greenbackers {{nominated}} Weaver {{for president}} in 1880, but he received only 3.3 {{percent of the popular}} vote. After several more attempts at elected office, he was again elected to the House in 1884 and 1886. In Congress, he worked for expansion of the money supply and for the opening of Indian Territory to white settlement. As the Greenback Party fell <b>apart,</b> <b>a</b> new anti-big business third party, the People's Party ("Populists"), arose. Weaver helped to organize the party and was their nominee {{for president in}} 1892. This time he was more successful and gained 8.5 {{percent of the popular vote}} and won five states, but still fell far short of victory. The Populists merged with the Democrats by the end of the 19th century, and Weaver went with them, promoting the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896, 1900, and 1908. After serving as mayor of his home town, Colfax, Iowa, Weaver retired from his pursuit of elective office. He died in Iowa in 1912. Most of Weaver's political goals remained unfulfilled at his death, but many came to pass in the following decades.|$|E

25|$|When {{two or more}} {{antennae}} {{are placed}} close together, differences in position of the antennae cause the received radio signal {{to be seen as}} differences in phase. For instance, if the two antennae are positioned ½ a wavelength <b>apart,</b> <b>a</b> signal approaching along the line between them will have the opposite phase in the two antennae, causing opposite voltages to be induced. If the signal approaches perpendicular to the line, the phase is the same and the voltages will be equal.|$|E
25|$|However, β-strands {{are rarely}} {{perfectly}} extended; rather, they exhibit a twist {{due to the}} chirality of their component amino acids. The energetically preferred dihedral angles near (φ,ψ) = (–135°,135°) (broadly, the upper left region of the Ramachandran plot) diverge significantly from the fully extended conformation (φ,ψ) = (–180°,180°). The twist {{is often associated with}} alternating fluctuations in the dihedral angles to prevent the individual β-strands in a larger sheet from splaying <b>apart.</b> <b>A</b> good example of a strongly twisted β-hairpin {{can be seen in the}} protein BPTI.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{impaired}} balance, patients {{suffering from}} ataxic cerebral palsy often walk {{with their feet}} unusually far <b>apart</b> (<b>a</b> wide gait). In addition, the low muscle tone caused by ataxic cerebral palsy causes people suffering from the disease to appear very unsteady, as their body is constantly trying to counterbalance itself. Infants with the disease often take a significantly longer {{amount of time to}} be able to walk without support, and over 50% of all children with ataxic cerebral palsy experience some form of a learning disability or speech impediment.|$|E
50|$|Large haplotypes can {{be thought}} of as steps between {{adjacent}} loci. For example, A1-Cw*0701, Cw*0701-B8, B8 to DR3, and DR3-DQ2 are each steps. Each step is a haplotype in its own right, however, the closer two loci are together, the longer it takes recombination to alter the step. Both Cw-B and DR-DQ are close together, A-Cw and B-DR are far <b>apart.</b> <b>As</b> a result, components of a haplotype evolve at different paces.|$|R

25|$|The tench (Tinca tinca), a {{significant}} food species farmed in western Eurasia in large numbers, is unusual. It {{is most often}} grouped with the Leuciscinae, but even when these were rather loosely circumscribed, it always stood <b>apart.</b> <b>A</b> cladistic analysis of DNA sequence data of the S7 ribosomal protein intron1 supports the view that it is distinct enough to constitute a monotypic subfamily. It also suggests it may {{be closer to the}} small East Asian Aphyocypris, Hemigrammocypris, and Yaoshanicus. They would have diverged roughly at the same time from cyprinids of east-central Asia, perhaps {{as a result of the}} Alpide orogeny that vastly changed the topography of that region in the late Paleogene, when their divergence presumably occurred.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} ways of fabricating a QPC. It can be realized in a break-junction by pulling <b>apart</b> <b>a</b> piece of conductor until it breaks. The breaking point forms the point contact. In a more controlled way, quantum point contacts are formed in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), e.g. in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. By applying a voltage to suitably shaped gate electrodes, the electron gas can be locally depleted and {{many different types of}} conducting regions can be created in the plane of the 2DEG, among them quantum dots and quantum point contacts. Another means of creating a QPC is by positioning the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope close to the surface of a conductor.|$|E
25|$|As the Western Roman Empire {{was falling}} <b>apart,</b> <b>a</b> Germanic tribe {{known as the}} Vandals briefly took Sicily in AD 467-8 {{under the rule of}} their king Geiseric but in 476 the island was {{returned}} to Odoacer, who was ruling Italy, 476-93, {{in the name of the}} Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor. The Vandals had already invaded parts of Roman France, Spain, and Portugal, asserting themselves as an important power in Western Europe. However, they soon lost these newly acquired possessions to another East Germanic tribe in the form of the Goths. The Ostrogothic conquest of Sicily (and Italy as a whole) under Theodoric the Great began in 488. The Goths were Germanic, but Theodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and allowed freedom of religion.|$|E
