A first system receives parameters for flight plan configurations (e. g., initial fuel carried, flight route, flight route segments followed, flight altitude for a given flight route segment, aircraft velocity for each flight route segment, flight route ascent rate, flight route descent route, flight departure site, flight departure time, flight arrival time, flight destination site and/or alternate flight destination site), flight plan schedule, expected weather along each flight route segment, aircraft specifics, airspace (altitude) bounds for each flight route segment, navigational aids available.

The invention provides for aircraft dynamics effects, such as wind effects at each altitude, altitude changes, airspeed changes and aircraft turns to provide predictions of aircraft trajectory (and, optionally, aircraft fuel use).

40|$|The {{effects of}} blowing dust on {{transport}} operations are often mentioned {{as one of}} the significant impacts of aeolian processes on human welfare. However, few studies have been presented to demonstrate this impact. This research examined official <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>incident</b> reports in Australia for inclusively 1969 - 2010 to characterise the hazard of blowing dust to aviation in the country, the first such study of its kind. For the 42 year record, 61 incidents were identified (mean 1. 4 per annum), with the large majority occurring {{in the first half of}} the 1970 s. Only 20 % of incidents occurred from 1984 onwards. Australian dust activity has not decreased over time, and the reduction in incidents is partly explained by improvements in aviation technology. The centralisation of Air Traffic Control operations to major coastal cities may however have reduced pilot reporting of dust-induced aviation incidents. By type of dust activity, dust storms were associated with nearly half of the reported incidents and dust hazes produced around a quarter. Only 5 % of incidents resulted in any physical damage to aircraft and only one case involving personal injury was reported. The majority of the adverse effects on aviation due to dust (nearly 60 % of reported incidents) were related to difficulties for navigation and completion of scheduled journey. Since aircraft damage and bodily harm were rare, the impact of dust in Australia is mostly that of inconvenience and associated raised economic costs. From 1990, the temporal pattern of incidents does not show any significant increase despite several intensely dusty years associated with recent droughts. This suggests that Australian aviation safety may be relatively resistant to the adverse effects of atmospheric dust as a hazard. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|E

25|$|Between 1970 and December 2016 {{there have}} been 110 serious {{incidents}} involving the Tu-154, and 69 hull losses, 30 of which did not involve fatalities. Of the fatal incidents, five resulted from terrorist or military terrorist action (two other wartime losses were non fatal), several from poor runway conditions in winter (including {{one in which the}} airplane struck snow plows on the runway), cargo overloading in the lapse of post-Soviet federal safety standards, and mid-air collisions due to faulty <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control. Other <b>incidents</b> resulted from mechanical problems (two cases prior to 2001), running out of fuel on unscheduled routes, pilot errors (including inadequate flight training for new crews), and cargo fires; several accidents remain unexplained.|$|R
40|$|In a {{world where}} {{airlines}} routinely operate over two million flights per month, {{the role of the}} <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controller (ATC) is continually increasing in importance. The principal responsibility of ATCs is to 'prevent a collision between aircraft operating in the system and to organise and expedite the flow of traffic'. In addition to providing vectoring and separation services for aircraft whilst en route, ATCs are also responsible for providing authorisation for take-off and landing operations and for acting as the primary source of information for pilots throughout the entire flight process. These individuals work in a busy and challenging environment where they are required to make precise and rapid decisions, respond effectively to changing circumstances, and, perform all tasks without error. As such, an <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controller's job is one that requires 'absolute precision and constant vigilance'. The task of selecting ATCs of 'the right stuff' is therefore crucial. The high cost associated with training ATCs makes trainee attrition a very expensive problem. A significant concern facing the entire aviation industry at present is the danger of worldwide ATC staffing shortages within the next two decades. These problems have significant implications for public safety, given that such shortages may result in additional demands being placed on existing controllers. Indeed, a number of recent <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control <b>incidents</b> have been blamed on staff shortages and highlight the importance of having a responsive selection system and the need for <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control providers to continually refine and improve their human resource selection systems. The current project will determine whether (a) ATC job competencies, need to be amended and/or new job competencies added; (b) the selection tools used to select ATC trainees align with such competencies.

30|$|One of the {{two main}} types of traffic {{congestion}} is non-recurrent congestion, which is mainly due to different events, such as <b>traffic</b> <b>incidents</b> and large-scale sports events. Although non-recurrent congestion is difficult to predict because of its stochastic nature, addressing it in a timely and effective manner is important to reduce its influence on <b>traffic</b> conditions. <b>Incidents</b> normally consist of two intervals: the primary is {{from the time of}} occurrence to the time when the incident is cleared, whereas the secondary is {{from the end of the}} primary interval to the time when the facility has resumed normal operations. Adler et al. [1] demonstrated that a one-minute duration reduction generates a € 57 gain per incident and even considerably higher gains at locations with high levels of recurrent congestion (i.e., approximately € 1200 per incident per minute at highly congested locations).
