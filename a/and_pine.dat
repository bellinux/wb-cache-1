5|$|Because Ireland became {{isolated}} from mainland Europe by rising sea levels {{before the last}} ice age had completely finished, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain, which separated later, or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland. Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer <b>and</b> <b>pine</b> marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the last}} glacial period, Indiana's {{topography}} was dominated by spruce <b>and</b> <b>pine</b> forests and was home to mastodon, caribou, and saber-toothed cats. While Northern Indiana had been covered by glaciers, Southern Indiana remained unaltered by the ice's advance, leaving plants and animals that could sustain human communities. Indiana's earliest known inhabitants were Paleo-Indians. Evidence exists that humans were in Indiana as early as the Archaic stage (8000–6000 BC). Hunting camps of the nomadic Clovis culture have been found in Indiana. Carbon dating of artifacts found in the Wyandotte Caves of Southern Indiana shows humans mined flint there as early 2000 BC. These nomads ate quantities of freshwater mussels from local streams, as shown by their shell mounds found throughout southern Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Harrya chromapes is an ectomycorrhizal species, and its fruit bodies grow singly to {{scattered}} on soil. They are usually found in forests containing conifers, Betulaceae and oak in North America. The North American distribution includes eastern Canada south to Georgia and Alabama, including Mexico. It extends west to Michigan and Mississippi. The fruit season extends from late spring to late summer. In Costa Rica, where the species associates with oak, {{it has been}} recorded from the Cordillera Talamanca, the Poás and Irazu Volcano. It is also in Guatemala. In Asia, it is known from India (West Bengal), Taiwan, Japan, and in China, where it associates with trees from the beech <b>and</b> <b>pine</b> families.|$|E

In support of our first two hypotheses, we found (H 1) that fire severity was negatively related to post-fire stem density and basal area, and (H 2) that fire severity was positively related to {{the recruitment of}} tree species dependent on high-light environments (oaks <b>and</b> <b>pines).</b>|$|R

The two routes then overlapped along Pulteney Street to Centerway, where they crossed the Chemung River via Centerway <b>and</b> <b>Pine</b> Street. At Market Street, NY17 and NY44 turned east and remained concurrent to Conhocton Street, where NY44 headed south to Caton while NY17 continued east on Market to the hamlet of Gibson.

5|$|Metro Transit began {{planning}} a bus tunnel through downtown Seattle in the 1970s, to be eventually converted to use by light rail trains.

The tunnel would be completed by 1989 and feature public art and stations designed to match the identities of the surrounding area; the tunnel station at Union Station would be designed around an Asian motif reflecting the International District.|$|E
