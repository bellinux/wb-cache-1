25|$|The {{greatest}} disadvantage is {{the difficulty}} in machining such <b>a</b> <b>thread.</b> The single-point <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> or taps and dies used to cut the thread cannot have efficient rake and relief angles (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult. Square threads also cannot carry as much load as <b>a</b> trapezoidal <b>thread,</b> because {{the root of the}} square thread is smaller. Also, {{there is no way to}} compensate for wear on the nut, so it must be replaced when worn out.|$|R

For {{internal}} threads, solid cutters are generally limited to holes larger than , and indexable internal <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> {{are limited to}} holes larger than [...] The advantage {{is that when the}} insert wears out it is easily and more cost effectively replaced. The disadvantage is the cycle time is generally longer than solid tools. Note that solid multiple-form <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> look similar to taps, but they differ in that the <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> does not have a backtaper and there is not a lead-in chamfer. This lack of a lead-in chamfer allows the threads to be formed within one pitch length of the bottom of a blind hole.|$|R

2500|$|Single-point threading, also colloquially called single-pointing (or just <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> {{when the}} context is implicit), is an {{operation}} that uses a single-point tool to produce <b>a</b> <b>thread</b> form on <b>a</b> cylinder or cone. The tool moves [...] while the precise rotation of the workpiece determines {{the lead of the}} thread. The process can be done to create external or internal threads (male or female). In external <b>thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> the piece can either be held in a chuck or mounted between two centers. With internal <b>thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> the piece is held in a chuck. The tool moves across the piece linearly, taking chips off the workpiece with each pass. Usually 5 to 7 light cuts create the correct depth of the thread.|$|R
25|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> as {{compared}} to thread forming and rolling, is used when full thread depth is required, when the quantity is small, when the blank is not very accurate, when <b>threading</b> up to <b>a</b> shoulder is required, when <b>threading</b> <b>a</b> tapered <b>thread,</b> or when the material is brittle.|$|R
50|$|On {{a manual}} milling machine, the {{micrometer}} adjustment nut limits the depth {{to which the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> may plunge into the workpiece. It is located on <b>a</b> <b>threaded</b> rod on the mill head. The machine operator moves it up or down by rotating it clockwise (to move it down) or counter-clockwise (to move it up). Moving the nut down increases the depth to which the <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> may plunge into the workpiece. Moving the nut up reduces the depth to which the <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> may plunge into the workpiece.|$|R

30|$|For many {{researchers}} in wood and forest sciences, increment borer is a preferred way of sampling {{because it can}} take wood core samples without killing the living tree.

They are {{the most commonly used}} tool to obtain core samples, typically from 4.35 to 12  mm in diameter [1]. The bit for sampling 12  mm cores has the outer diameter of 19  mm. Owing to high contact surface area and large friction forces with the wood, the increment borer needs a high torque to penetrate the wood, especially when sampling 12  mm cores.|$|R
