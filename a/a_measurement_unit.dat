In mathematics, ground breaking theories on Algebra, Arithmetic and Geometry were postulated by Mahaviracharya, a native of Gulbarga who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition. He was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I. His greatest contribution was Ganitasarasangraha, a writing in 9 chapters that defined important axioms. These axioms state that a proper fraction is a sum of improper fractions, a negative number is not a square number and hence {{does not have a}} square root. He also defined formulae to calculate the sum of complex progressions and <b>a</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> for the size of an atom. His other works are Chattisa Ganitha, a volumnous work that contains 9,000 Granthas (manuscripts) pertaining to mathematical collection.

5000|$|The global hectare (gha) is <b>a</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> for {{quantifying}} {{both the}} ecological footprint of people or activities {{as well as}} the biocapacity of the earth or its regions. One global hectare represents the average productivity of all biologically productive areas (measured in hectares) on earth in a given year. Examples of biologically productive areas include cropland, forests, and fishing grounds; they do not include deserts, glaciers, and the open ocean. [...] "Global hectare per person" [...] refers to the amount of biologically productive land and water available per person on the planet. The total number of global hectares is approximately 11.3 billion, averaging about 1.8 global hectares per person (2004). A total of 13.4 billion hectares were used, or 2.2 global hectares per person, meaning about 20% more was consumed than produced. This is possible because there are natural reserves all around the globe that function as backup food, material and energy supplies, although only for {{a relatively short period of}} time. Due to rapid population growth, these reserves are being depleted at an ever increasing tempo. See Earth Overshoot Day.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ruler of}} Qi {{was not a}} good speaker and could not speak clearly, and so he did not like to meet with {{governmental}} officials. He spoke nothing to anyone except his jesters and servants. He was weak in his personality and was fearful of people staring at him. Even the most honored officials or the head of the government were not allowed to look at him, and therefore the officials could only make summary reports and then withdraw in panic. He inherited the luxurious and wasteful living habits of Emperor Wucheng and thought that this was proper. All of the women and eunuchs of the palace dressed in the best silk and ate delicacies. It sometimes took 10,000 pi <b>a</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> for textile to make one skirt for them. Each of them competed with each other for the newest and most wonderful things, and clothes made in the morning may be considered old and out of style that same evening. He spent much effort on building palaces and gardens of the greatest splendor, but his affections for them could not last, so all buildings were torn down and rebuilt and torn down again. These construction activities went around the clock without ceasing, with great torches used for illumination at night, and water boiled to mix with the dirt in the winter. In order to carve Buddha images in the western hills of Jinyang, over 10,000 torches were used for one night, bright enough to shine on the Jinyang Palace like it was the day. Whenever there were natural disastrous, ill omens, or agrarian rebellions, he never blamed himself, but would only hold great vegetarian feasts to treat the Buddhist and Taoist monks, believing that this would bring divine blessings so that difficulties would pass. He liked to play the pipa and sing, and he wrote a song entitled, Song of No Worries (無愁曲), with several hundred servants singing with him, leading to the people referring to him as [...] "the Son of Heaven with no worries." [...] He established [...] "the Pauper Boy's Village" [...] within the Hualin Garden (華林園), where he would put on pauper clothes and beg in the village, believing that this was great joy. He also built models of the important border cities and had soldiers act like Northern Zhou soldiers to attack them, and with him resisting the attacks with the eunuchs.|$|E
