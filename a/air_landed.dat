5|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{many of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Red Dog Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, then 24, {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon. Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached. The truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either {{the back of the truck}} or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle. The motorcycle bounced into the <b>air,</b> <b>landed</b> on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing his internal organs. Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.|$|E

Widely blamed for the accident, Elisian was suspended by USAC (reinstated a few days later), and was shunned by the racing community.

5000|$|Geologic studies {{indicate}} that the earliest rocks {{in this part of}} the High Cascades began forming when a chain of volcanoes erupted between five and three million years ago. During the last glacial period, the composite volcanoes of Mount Mazama and Mount McLoughlin began their initial build-up. On their north and east slopes, Mount McLoughlin and other peaks bear scars caused by glaciers. Like most other major drainages within the Sky Lakes Wilderness, Seven Lakes Basin and the deep canyon of the Middle Fork of the Rogue River were carved by the massive ice fields that covered the highest elevations of the Cascades. [...] Approximately 6,700 years ago, when Mount Mazama exploded, collapsed, and formed the caldera of Crater Lake, some of the vast amount of rock and ash thrown into the <b>air</b> <b>landed</b> in the northern portion of the Sky Lakes Wilderness, creating the pumice-covered Oregon Desert.|$|E
