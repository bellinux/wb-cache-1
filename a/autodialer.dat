50|$|A Smart <b>Autodialer</b> is an <b>autodialer</b> {{capable of}} {{personalizing}} messages and collecting touch tone or speech feedbacks. A speech engine is usually included for converting {{text to speech}} and recognizing speech over the phone.|$|E
50|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} power of modern computers, {{especially those with}} multiple cores and multiple processors, <b>autodialers</b> that utilize VOIP can be scaled up well. In today's call centers, <b>autodialers</b> that do not use telephony board can easily make hundreds of simultaneous calls. In addition, call transfer to remote agent is much easier with VOIP technology since no physical telephone wires are needed.|$|R
50|$|There {{also exist}} {{computer-aided}} manipulation {{tools such as}} Mas Hamilton's SoftDrill (no longer in production) and Cygnus. These tools are like <b>autodialers</b> except they listen to the lock and, {{with the aid of}} a computer, make logical decisions like a human manipulator would.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Autodialers</b> may be {{used for}} a number of dishonest purposes, {{including}} telemarketing fraud or even as War dialing. War dialers take their name from a scene in the 1983 movie WarGames in which a 'cracker' programs a home computer to dial every number in an exchange, searching for lines with auto-answer data modems. Sequential dialing is easy to detect, pseudo-random dialing is not.|$|R

50|$|A ghost call {{sometimes}} can be repetitive or completely tie {{up a phone}} line {{making it impossible to}} call 911 in an emergency. You may receive a ghost call sometimes once an hour, once a day or once a week. At a certain level when an <b>Autodialer</b> is completely overlooked and unmanaged or in extremely rare cases where a company goes under and an <b>autodialer</b> gets left running for years before it's discovered, this can be especially annoying as there is no one to complain to.|$|E
5000|$|An {{enterprise}} grade dialer {{must provide}} two key features. First, {{it must be}} capable of making large number of simultaneous phone calls; and second, it must provide an application programming interface (API) for system integration. Almost all enterprise grade <b>autodialers</b> employ computer networking technology, since voice boards have fixed number of ports and cannot be scaled up. In order to make 2000 simultaneous phone calls, for example, a group of computers have to be linked together to provide the support for that many phone lines.|$|R
5000|$|A recent {{trend in}} {{telemarketing}} {{is to use}} robocalls: automated telephone calls that use both computerized <b>autodialers</b> and computer-delivered pre-recorded messages in a sales pitch. Some can simulate a personalized phone call through personalized pre-recorded messages. These calls often include intentionally deceptive tactics, with computer recorded messages saying things like [...] "Don't panic but this is your final notice" [...] or [...] "We have already attempted to contact you through the mail." [...] The messages are often outright lies, intended to incite concern or fear in the potential customer.|$|R
50|$|The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) {{was passed}} by the United States Congress in 1991 and signed into law by President George H. W. Bush as Public Law 102-243. It amended the Communications Act of 1934. The TCPA is codified as 47 U.S.C. 227. The TCPA restricts {{telephone}} solicitations (i.e., telemarketing) and the use of automated telephone equipment. The TCPA limits the use of automatic dialing systems, artificial or prerecorded voice messages, SMS text messages, and fax machines. It also specifies several technical requirements for fax machines, <b>autodialers,</b> and voice messaging systemsâ€”principally with provisions requiring identification and contact information of the entity using the device to be contained in the message.|$|R
50|$|Today's <b>autodialer</b> {{supposedly}} runs a smarter {{batch of}} software, claiming {{less than a}} 2% hangup rate. Most telemarketing companies place thousands of calls an hour, bringing that 2% back up to an annoying level however.|$|E
50|$|Inherent in {{the need}} to dial many prospects/users/consumers/clients (or whomever) {{is the need to}} {{maintain}} compliance with the laws for a business or call center or anyone in the US using an <b>autodialer.</b> The ability to maintain records, demonstrate drop call percentages on campaigns and avoid calling numbers listed in any federal, state, or company 'Do Not Call' lists is essential for continued legal use of any <b>autodialer.</b> Certain organizations are exempt from certain compliance laws, but the bulk of autodialers are built for the bulk of users who are required to comply, and in many cases must be able to demonstrate their compliance upon demand of a regulatory entity.|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} dialer (auto dialer, auto-dialer, autodialler) is an electronic device or software that automatically dials telephone numbers. Once the call has been answered, the <b>autodialer</b> either plays a recorded message or connects {{the call to}} a live person.|$|E
5000|$|In a West Virginia {{class action}} suit (Mey v. Herbalife International, Inc., et al.) filed on July 16, 2003, the plaintiffs allege that some {{telemarketing}} practices of certain Herbalife International distributors violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, {{and seeks to}} hold Herbalife International vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors. More specifically, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that several of Herbalife International's distributors used pre-recorded telephone messages and <b>autodialers</b> to contact prospective customers {{in violation of the}} TCPA's prohibition of such practices Herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that, in the West Virginia case, any such distributor actions also went against Herbalife's own policies. Management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes Herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition, particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they [...] "believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes". The case was resolved with Herbalife and its distributors paying $7 million into a fund for class members part of the suit. Herbalife International did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors.|$|R
50|$|To {{customize}} or personalize messages, a smart <b>autodialer</b> {{system uses}} message template, which contains variables {{that can be}} replaced later by actual values. For example, a time variable included in the message template can {{be replaced by the}} actual time when a phone call is made.|$|E
50|$|A robocall is a {{phone call}} that uses a {{computerized}} <b>autodialer</b> to deliver a pre-recorded message, {{as if from a}} robot. Robocalls are often associated with political and telemarketing phone campaigns, but can also be used for public-service or emergency announcements. Some robocalls use personalized audio messages to simulate an actual personal phone call.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{technology for}} autodialers {{is the ability}} to distinguish live human pick-ups from answering machines. Since there is no indication hardware signal when a call is answered by an answering machine or voice-mail system, <b>autodialer</b> systems have to analyze incoming audio for a prediction. Currently, no algorithms exist that can achieve 100% accuracy.|$|E
50|$|This is {{generally}} {{caused by a}} neglected <b>Autodialer</b> or indirectly through consequences of restrictions applied to autodialers used for telemarketing by the FCC that restricts how long they can tie up a phone line without causing inconvenience to the receiver or blocking emergency services. It could also fall under the accidental Pocket dialing category.|$|E
50|$|When an <b>autodialer</b> connects an {{answered}} {{call to a}} live agent, it is often called a predictive dialer or power dialer. A predictive dialer uses realtime analysis to determine the optimal time to dial more numbers, whereas a power dialer simply dials a pre-set number of lines when an agent finishes the previous call.|$|E
50|$|A regular PC, desktop or laptop, can {{be turned}} into an <b>autodialer</b> by using a {{telephony}} board or modem. There are software programs which can set up an autodialer-like function over a physical telephone line using such hardware. It is also possible to run cheap or free autodialers without a modem or telephone line using the Internet and VoIP.|$|E
5000|$|Safety {{confirmation}} {{was invented}} {{and brought to}} market by James Batchelor (May 28, 1977, Yorkshire, England), a British technology entrepreneur and inventor who created it when he spotted the shortcomings of the predominant paradigm of personal safety alarms (also known as: community alarms; pendant alarms; <b>autodialer</b> alarms; medical alerts or personal emergency response systems (PERS)) after his grandmother fell.|$|E
50|$|When an <b>autodialer</b> plays a {{pre-recorded}} message, it {{is often}} called voice broadcasting, or robocalling. Some voice broadcasting messages ask the person who answers to press a button on their phone keypad, such as in opinion polls in which recipients are asked to press one digit if they support one side of an issue, or another digit if they support the other side. This type of call is often called outbound interactive voice response.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{advancement}} of computer software technology {{at the end of}} the 20th century, many hardware-based telephony capabilities for auto dialing can be implemented in software. Voice modems are much less expensive and some computers have them pre-installed already. Touch tones, call transfer, call progress detection, detection of answering machine and voice mail, and other telephony card features, are available in voice modem-based auto dialing systems. For a simple <b>autodialer</b> supporting only a few phone lines per PC, telephony cards offer few advantages over simple voice modems.|$|E
5000|$|Caller name display (CNAM) is {{vulnerable}} to data mining, where a dishonest user obtains a line (fixed or mobile) with caller name display and then calls that number repeatedly from an <b>autodialer</b> which uses caller ID spoofing to send a different presentation number on each call. None of the calls are actually answered, but the telephone company has to look up every number (a CNAM database [...] "dip") to display the corresponding subscriber name from its records. The list of displayed names and numbers (which may be landline or wireless) is then sold to telemarketers.|$|E
50|$|A power dialer {{like the}} Dolphin Power Dialer, is <b>autodialer</b> {{software}} that enables telemarketers, sales teams, and call centers to dial {{a list of}} phone numbers automatically and completely hands-free, thus, saving them valuable time and energy {{that would otherwise be}} wasted dialing by hand. Power dialing is suitable for all campaigns, from customer care follow-up calls to telemarketing. For example, power dialing is useful to call predictive dialing contacts that resulted in nuisance to ensure that an agent is available to talk to the customer. A 2012 research study conducted by The Bridge Group, Inc. discovered that while inside sales jobs and career demand is up 54 percent, most sales leverage comes with power dialer software.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To assess {{cost and}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of immunization reminder/recall {{systems in the}} private sector. Methods. A manual postcard system (mail) was compared with a computer-based telephone system (<b>autodialer)</b> and control. Costs included time costs {{and the cost of}} equipment and supplies. The cost per child and the incremental cost of the intervention relative to control were computed. Cost-effectiveness ratios were computed for return visits and for immunizations delivered. Results. The average cost per child was $ 2. 28 for the mail group and $ 1. 47 for the <b>autodialer</b> group. The incremental visit cost relative to the control was higher for the mail group ($ 9. 52) than for the <b>autodialer</b> group ($ 3. 48). The <b>autodialer</b> was more cost-effective in delivering immunizations: $ 4. 06 per extra immunization (<b>autodialer)</b> versus $ 12. 82 (mail). Conclusions. Excluding start-up costs, the <b>autodialer</b> system was most cost-effective. Including <b>autodialer</b> equipment costs, the <b>autodialer</b> system is more cost-effective only for larger practices...|$|E
40|$|Americans have {{received}} unwanted telemarketing calls for decades. In {{response to a}} rapid increase in pre-recorded calls made using <b>autodialer</b> devices, Congress enacted the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) in 1992. The TCPA imposes restrictions on calls made to consumersâ€™ residences and wireless phones using <b>autodialer</b> devices, {{even if they are}} not telemarketing calls. Congress appointed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prescribe rules and regulations to enforce the TCPA. In 2015, the FCC released an order that defined <b>autodialer</b> more broadly under the statute. Consequently, devices that have the potential to become autodialers in the future, even if they are not presently able to perform <b>autodialer</b> functions, will constitute autodialers for purposes of the TCPA. This new scope of autodialers includes everyday technology, such as smartphones, that consumers and businesses use on a regular basis. As a result, the FCC has unreasonably broadened the scope of the TCPA to limit the use of everyday technology. This note examines the new <b>autodialer</b> definition and argues that it is problematic for several reasons. The new <b>autodialer</b> definition does not comport with a plain reading of the TCPA, Congressional intent, or recent federal case law. Furthermore, this note predicts that the broader <b>autodialer</b> definition will have two detrimental effectsâ€”it will shift TCPA enforcement efforts away from purposeful, predatory TCPA violators and will increase TCPA litigation against companies engaged in legitimate business or between individual consumers. This note also examines recent trends in TCPA class action suits, including financial incentives for plaintiff attorneys to pursue TCPA lawsuits. Ultimately, the FCC should reinterpret the statute so that autodialers only include devices with the present ability to perform <b>autodialer</b> functions and should further require service providers, such as AT 2 Ì† 6 T and Verizon, to offer consumers a more widespread call blocking service to help protect them from predatory robocall...|$|E
40|$|The DO {{cryogenic}} {{system is}} controlled by a TI 565 -PLC based control system. This allows the system to be unmanned when in steady state operation.

40|$|The D 0 Cryo System is {{monitored}} by a computerized {{process control system}} and an ODH safety system. During steady state operations the cryo system will be unmanned and system experts will depend on communication systems for notification of system problems. The FIRUS system meets the minimum communication requirement and is supplemented with an <b>autodialer</b> which attempts to contact cryo operators by pager or phone. The RD/Safety Department requires the ODH monitor system {{to be connected to}} the labwide FIRUS system. which enables the Communications Center to receive alarms and notify the proper experts of the condition. The ODH system will have two alarm points. One for an ODH alarm and one for a system trouble alarm. The <b>autodialer</b> system has replaced a former cryo operations summation alarm point in the FIRUS system. This has freed space on the FIRUS system and has allowed the cryo experts more flexibility in setting up their own communication link.

The views expressed herein are not necessarily those of NASS or USDA. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY During the 2007 Pennsylvania County Estimates Survey, a test of software which dials and delivers automated telephone messages was conducted, comparing it to postcard reminders and a control group with no reminders. The software automatically dialed and delivered a prerecorded message to two random subsamples of operations selected for the survey. Following the first mailing of the questionnaire, one subsample received a generic message which did not identify the speaker. A second subsample received an equivalent message recorded by the Pennsylvania Secretary of Agriculture. An additional third unique subsample received the same message on a traditional postcard reminder delivered via US Postal Service mail. Response rates {{for each of these}} groups were compared to a control group which received no reminder. All three reminder groups had higher response rates than the control group, with the generic <b>autodialer</b> message increasing response the most.

The views expressed herein are not necessarily those of NASS or USDA. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Software which dials and delivers automated telephone messages was tested {{as an alternative to}} postcard reminders during the Pennsylvania County Estimates Survey. The recorded telephone messages were automatically dialed and delivered to two subsamples of telephone numbers of operations selected for the survey that had not already responded. One subsample received the message following the first mailing of the questionnaire. A second subsample received the message immediately preceding the second mailing of the questionnaire. An additional third unique subsample received the same message as a traditional postcard reminder delivered via US Postal Service mail. Response rates for each of these groups were compared to a control group which received no reminder. All three reminder groups had higher response rates than the control group, with the postcard reminder increasing response the most. The use of <b>autodialer</b> software appears to be effective and is relatively inexpensive. While not quite as effective in the present experiment as mailed reminder postcards, <b>autodialer</b> calls can be easily implemented by a field office and messages can be tailored to specific groups. The use of <b>autodialer</b> software appears to be a promising addition to the tools field offices can use to increase response rates in mail surveys. Methods to use this technology should continue to be tested and evaluated. ...|$|E

There we find that, while we must restrict our attention to universes containing at least one observer, the total number of observers predicted in each universe is irrelevant to the confirmation of a theory. The Doomsday Argument (Bostrom 1997, 2002; Leslie 1989, 1996) concludes that the prior probability we assign to the short-term extinction of humanity is greatly magnified by our observation that we exist at the present time in human history. Before we discuss the Doomsday Argument itself, it is instructive to examine one of the thought experiments that is held up as its analogue. The following experiment, Cubicles, is a minor variation of the original Incubator described by Bostrom (2002). Cubicles One hundred cubicles are numbered 1 to 100. A coin is flipped to determine how many people will be placed in the cubicles. If the result is heads, one person is placed in all 100 cubicles. If the result is tails, only the first 10 cubicles are occupied. Each person who enters a cubicle is led in blindfolded so they cannot tell which cubicle they are placed in, nor can they tell how many other people have been placed in cubicles. Initially, you find yourself in a cubicle, but you do not know which one. You are asked to estimate the probability that the coin toss was tails. You have no additional information, so you answer 50 %. Next, you learn that you are in cubicle # 5. What is the posterior probability that the coin flip was tails? The revised probability of the coin flip having been tails can be computed using Bayes ' theorem: p(tails|# 5) = p(# 5 |tails) p(tails) / (p(# 5 |tails) p(tails) + p(# 5 |heads) p(heads)) (1...|$|E
