5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E

Repair work was being done on equipment that regulates the driving pressure for the control blades, and when a valve was opened at 2:23pm a control blade drift <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off.</b> On later inspection, {{it was found that}} several of the rods had been unintentionally inserted.|$|E
25|$|The {{caretaker}} at the Otis home {{heard of}} the Zeehandelaar bomb, and decided to search around the Otis house. He found a leather suitcase behind some bushes under a bay window. Again the police arrived, and carried the suitcase {{away from the house}} and out in the open. But while they were cutting open the suitcase, the clockwork <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> inside the suitcase. The police ran to safety just before the bomb exploded. Investigators speculated that, like the Zeehandelaar bomb, the clock mechanism at the Otis house had been wound too tightly, delaying the explosion.|$|E

25|$|On 30 June 2012 around 6:25 hours local time, an <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> and {{the cooling}} {{system of the}} spent fuel pool halted. At that time, the {{temperature}} was 33.3 degrees Celsius; no leakage of radioactive contaminated water was reported. On 4 June, a similar situation caused the cooling to be halted. On 1 July shortly after 3 p.m. the cooling was resumed, the water temperature of the pool having risen to 42.9°C. TEPCO had feared that the temperature could reach 65°C, the upper limit designated in safety regulations. The cause of the troubles was laid {{in some parts of}} the emergency power system, and these were to be replaced.|$|E
500|$|The {{disasters}} of the New Haven opener concluded during [...] "Come Home", a song {{near the}} end of the play—the quiet urgings of the chorus and Joe's mother to entice him to return to his small town. [...] A false fire <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> and the audience began to push towards the exit. [...] Joshua Logan, who was in attendance, loudly ordered the crowd to sit down, which it did. [...] One of the Boston tryouts that followed New Haven was marked by boisterous behavior by conventioneers, until Hammerstein yelled, [...] "Shut up!" [...] and the audience subsided.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before 08:00 {{local time}} on 7 December 1941, Japanese {{aircraft}} from six aircraft carriers struck the Pacific Fleet as it lay in port at Pearl Harbor, and wrought devastation on the warships and the facilities defending Hawaii. On board Arizona, the ship's air raid <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> at about 07:55, {{and the ship}} went to general quarters soon after. Shortly after 08:00, 10 Nakajima B5N [...] "Kate" [...] torpedo bombers, five each from the carriers [...] and , attacked Arizona. All of the aircraft were carrying [...] armor-piercing shells modified into [...] bombs. Flying at an estimated altitude of , Kagas aircraft bombed Arizona from amidships to stern. Soon after, Hiryus bombers hit the bow area.|$|E

2500|$|On December 7, 1941, Miller, a crewman aboard West Virginia, awoke at 06:00. After serving breakfast mess, he was {{collecting}} laundry when at 07:57 Lieutenant Commander Shigeharu Murata {{from the}} [...] launched {{the first of}} nine torpedoes that would hit West Virginia. When the [...] "Battle Stations" [...] <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> [...] Miller headed for his battle station, an anti-aircraft battery magazine amidship, {{only to discover that}} a torpedo had destroyed it.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{three minutes}} later, however, at 19:07, {{passengers}} reported smelling {{smoke in the}} cabin again. Two minutes after that the [...] "master breaker" [...] <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> in the cockpit, and electrical systems throughout the plane began to fail, including power for the elevator trim system. This made controlling the plane's descent extremely difficult and required great physical exertion from the pilot and first officer. The PA system also failed, leaving the flight attendants unable to communicate efficiently with the passengers; nevertheless, attendants were able to instruct passengers sitting in the exit rows on how to open the doors, a practice that was not standard on commercial airline flights at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Wednesday 19 February 2014 late in {{the evening}} a leakage was found near a storage tank with {{radioactive}} water. The water contained 230.000.000 bq/l. The water did flow over the barrier around the tank, into the grounds around it. TEPCO estimated that some 100 metric tons were lost. [...] After the waterflow into the tank was cut off, the leakage stopped, According to TEPCO nothing was flown into the ocean nearby. Further investigations were done after the cause of the leakage. A valve was opened by error, this caused an inflow of water to the tank. Around 2 p.m. on 19 Feb. an <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> indicating that the tank was dangerously filled. This alarm was ignored, because no radioactive water was transferred to the tank. The tank, however, got overfilled, and the radioactive access water left the tank along the rain-gutter. Because all rainwater is directed outside the barriers around the tanks, the overflowing radioactive water seeped directly into the grounds. According to TEPCO all leakage was due to human error. The patrols were doubled to twice a day, and the number of workers involved was increased 6 times to 60 people. Because the leak was about 700 meters from the coastal line, TEPCO did believe that none of this water had reached the ocean.|$|E

2500|$|Following Alex & Amanda's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Words of Love" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests competed in heats; the men went first, and were {{followed}} by the women. The HouseGuests were asked questions about the various quotes hanging {{on the walls of}} the house. If a HouseGuest answered a question correctly, they would eliminate one HouseGuest from the competition; the man and woman who won each round would then face off in the final round, with the winner earning both them and their partner the title of Head of Household for the week. Joshuah & Sharon were the winners. Shortly following their win, Joshuah and Allison engaged in numerous verbal arguments due to Joshuah being mad at Allison for changing her vote last minute, as well as the lesbian lie she had told earlier in the game. Due to these arguments, Allison debated quitting the game, though was later convinced in the Diary Room to stay; she did, however, have a restraining order placed on Joshuah, and he was forbidden to be within five feet of her. On Day 22, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Big Aspara-Guess!" [...] food competition. For this competition, the men were required to guess the weight of their partners and then gather enough asparagus to weigh the same amount. If they got within ten pounds of their partner's weight, the HouseGuests won the two major food groups that couple represented. Later that day, Joshuah & Sharon chose to nominate Allison & Ryan and Matt & Natalie for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Adam & Sheila were selected to compete; James was selected to host. On Day 23, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Cupid is as Cupid Does" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, the couples were required to solve a puzzle by lifting the women into the air through a harness, while the men ran the puzzle pieces to them. Matt & Natalie were the winners of the Power of Veto. On Day 24, the HouseGuests learned that sometime in the coming weeks an alarm would go off in the house, and this meant that a twist would occur. On Day 25, Matt & Natalie chose to use the Power of Veto to remove themselves from the block, with Adam & Sheila being nominated in their place. On Day 28, Allison and Ryan were announced as the fourth couple to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of two to zero. Before they could exit the house, however, the <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> and the HouseGuests learned that they were officially playing the game as individuals. The HouseGuests then learned that they would be voting to evict either Allison or Ryan from the house, rather than the both of them being evicted. Allison then became the first individual HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of six to zero.|$|E
2500|$|The accuser's 14-year-old brother Star {{testified that}} he'd walked into Jackson's bedroom and seen Jackson masturbating {{himself and the}} {{sleeping}} accuser. He testified that he'd meant {{to go to sleep}} in Jackson's room, had found the door [...] "kind of locked, so [...] pushed it, and it opened," [...] and he walked some ways into the room and stopped when he saw what Gavin and Michael were doing. He testified they were on the bed [...] "outside of the covers," [...] Jackson was on his back with his eyes closed, and Gavin was [...] "curled up" [...] facing away from Jackson and was [...] "kind of snoring." [...] Star couldn't remember what his brother had been wearing but said it might have been [...] "pants or underwears," [...] and that Jackson was wearing [...] "socks, underwears, and an undershirt," [...] but later said Jackson's [...] "hand was in his pants." [...] He variously used the words [...] "pants" [...] and [...] "underwears" [...] for both Gavin and Jackson to describe what they were wearing. One aspect that weakened his testimony was that Star, the only witness to the alleged molestation, claimed he twice walked in on Jackson molesting Gavin and was completely unnoticed, even while tripping the alarm system in the hallway leading to Jackson's bedroom. An alarm or bell would sound whenever anyone approached, and Star claimed that on both occasions the <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> and Jackson didn't hear it. Neither did he hear nor see the boy come and go. Star said he stood watching for about four seconds before he [...] "just went back to the guest units." [...] Star testified that two days later he had an almost identical experience. He allegedly walked into Jackson's bedroom and saw that [...] "the same thing was happening," [...] with Jackson [...] "masturbating, stroking up and down" [...] and his other hand moving around in Star's sleeping [...] "brother's underwears." [...] This time Star only stayed for three seconds before returning to the guest units. Star's account of the sexual act on the second occasion matched neither the description he gave during an interview with psychologist Stanley Katz nor his statement given in police interviews in 2003. Star Arvizo {{said in an interview with}} the psychologist on May 29, 2003, that he witnessed Jackson placing his hand on Gavin's crotch outside his clothes. On July 7, 2003, during his first interview with sheriff's investigators, Star changed his story. He claimed that during the first incident Jackson placed his left hand under the front of his brother's pajama pants. Star Arvizo changed his account still a third time during a police interview on August 13, 2003, when he claimed that Jackson had placed his hand inside the front of his brother's boxer shorts. Dr. Katz' grand jury testimony about what Star had told him included a story about Jackson [...] "rubbing his penis against Gavin's buttocks" [...] and another about smelling marijuana. In court, Star denied that he'd made the allegations and refused Mesereau's offer to [...] "refresh [...] recollection [...] that page of [...] testimony." ...|$|E

Half an hour later, {{just as the}} steward's <b>alarm</b> <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> instantly checked by that light-sleeping Asiatic, the Elsinore began to heel over on my side. I could hear Mr. Pike barking and snarling orders, and at times a trample and shuffle of many feet passed over my head as the weird crew pulled and hauled. The Elsinore continued to heel over until I could see the water against my port, and then she gathered way and dashed ahead at such a rate that I could hear the stinging and singing of the foam through the circle of thick glass beside me.|$|E
