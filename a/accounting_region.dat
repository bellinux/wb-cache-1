They are unique, so secure and reliable to use and doesnt change for one in a lifetime.

In this thesis work, we propose a method for fingerprint matching based on minutiae matching. However, unlike conventional minutiae matching algorithms our algorithm also takes into <b>account</b> <b>region</b> and line structures that exist between minutiae pairs. This allows for more structural information of the fingerprint to be accounted for thus resulting in stronger certainty of matching minutiae.

40|$|A proper {{classification}} is a {{key factor}} for the successful visualization of 3 D medical data. In direct volume rendering applications, the data is classified {{by means of a}} transfer function mapping each voxel characteristics to optical properties such as color and opacity, thus highlighting certain regions over others. In a medical scenario, the structures of interest that must be highlighted may vary strongly depending on the application. Therefore, easy and intuitive user interaction is crucial to achieve a meaningful classification for a given patient’s scan. In this paper, we focus on a novel approach that combines direct visualization and interaction with 3 D data in a medical augmented reality (AR) environment. The proposed method takes into <b>account</b> <b>regions</b> of interest directly defined by the physician in the patient’s anatomy and employs this information to automatically generate an adequate transfer function.

40|$|Fingerprint {{matching}} is {{the process}} used to determine whether two sets of fingerprint ridge detail {{come from the same}} finger. There exist multiple algorithms that do fingerprint matching in many different ways. Some methods involve matching minutiae points between the two images, while others look for similarities in the bigger structure of the fingerprint. A major approach for fingerprint recognition today is to extract minutiae from fingerprint images and to perform fingerprint matching {{based on the number of}} corresponding minutiae pairings. One of the most difficult problems in fingerprint recognition has been that the recognition performance is significantly influenced by fingertip surface condition, which may vary depending on environmental or personal causes. In this paper we propose a method for offline fingerprint matching based on minutiae matching. However, unlike conventional minutiae matching algorithms, our algorithm also takes into <b>account</b> <b>region</b> and line structures that exist between minutiae pairs. This allows filling the small breaks in the curves created because of uneven surface and uneven pressure...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, an {{innovative}} method {{is presented to}} identify models with a modified frequency-domain subspace method. This new approach allows to introduce in the subspace resolution constraints on the identified model poles location. Here, a very general formulation is proposed to take into <b>account</b> <b>regions</b> in continuous/discrete map. This formulation {{is based on an}} LMI (linear matrix inequalities) description where the stability domain represents a particular case. These LMI constraints are combined with the frequency-domain subspace resolution to obtain identified models whose poles are situated in the specified LMI regions. This approach is benchmarked with the Loewner one, which belongs to the class of frequency-domain input–output model identification and approximation methods. Besides the fact that they both belong to the data-driven model approximation class, they result to have slightly different objectives and show complementary performances. This discussion is illustrated in practice with experimentations that have been performed for the identification and control of the gust disturbance over a 2 D wing span, from sub to transonic, in a wind tunnel facility...|$|R

Hyperspectral imagery was obtained with a Real-time Data Acquisition Camera System (RDACS- 3), which had a 2 by 2 -m pixel resolution and 120 spectral bands (471 to 828 nm in 3 -nm increments). For each band, a one-way analysis of variance (did not account for spatial autocorrelation) and two random field analyses (accounted for spatial autocorrelation) were used {{to determine the extent to}} which variability was greater between than within map units (F-ratio).
