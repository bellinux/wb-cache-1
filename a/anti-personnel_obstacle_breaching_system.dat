50|$|The <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>breaching</b> <b>system</b> (APOBS) is an {{explosive}} line charge {{system that allows}} safe breaching through complex antipersonnel obstacles, particularly fields of land mines. The APOBS is a joint DOD program for the U.S. Army and the United States Marine Corps.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>{{breaching}}</b> <b>system</b> (APOBS) and the British RAMBS II {{rifle grenade}} breaching system {{are starting to}} replace the Bangalore for path-clearing due to their ease of use, effectiveness, and flexibility—they can clear a path several times longer than the Bangalore torpedo.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>breaching</b> <b>system</b> {{originated}} as {{an operational}} requirements document {{published by the}} US Army Engineer School, Fort Leonard Wood, MO. The joint requirements document was subsequently signed by the Army and the Marines on 11 April 1994. The system {{was developed by the}} United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command - Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, and produced by Ensign-Bickford Aerospace and Defense. During preliminary test and evaluation, the original explosive grenade attachment scheme proved inadequate, resulting in program delay and the Naval Surface Warfare Center sponsoring a complete line-charge analysis and manufacturing redesign. [...] The subsequently proposed and highly successful woven nylon over-wrap is currently employed on the Mk 7 Mod 1, fielded in 2002, and the Mod 2 fielded in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The Bangalore Torpedo of World War II — the {{predecessor}} to the mine-clearing line charge that clears {{a path through}} a minefield. This can also be done using the Antipersonnel <b>Obstacle</b> <b>Breaching</b> <b>System</b> or Giant Viper, a hose-pipe filled with explosives and carried across a minefield by a rocket.|$|R
50|$|During {{an armed}} {{conflict}} {{there are several}} methods of countering land mines. These include using armoured vehicles to negate the effects of anti-personnel land mines. Land mines can also be cleared either by hand, or by using specialised equipment such as tanks equipped with flails. Explosives {{can also be used}} to clear mine fields, either by artillery bombardment, or with specialised charges such as Bangalore torpedoes, the Antipersonnel <b>Obstacle</b> <b>Breaching</b> <b>System</b> and the Python Minefield <b>Breaching</b> <b>System.</b>|$|R

50|$|Systems {{in current}} use include the British Python, which can clear a 7.3 m wide by 180-200 m long path, and the American M58 Mine Clearing Line Charge, which can clear an 8 m wide by 100 m long path. Both are large, heavy {{systems that are}} {{deployed}} in a vehicle-towed trailer.The US Army also uses the Antipersonnel <b>Obstacle</b> <b>Breaching</b> <b>System,</b> which clears a path 0.6 to 1.0 meters by 45 meters, and is light enough to be carried by two soldiers.|$|R
50|$|On 12 March 2011, the 530th Bloodhounds {{deployed}} to Forward Operating Base Sarkari Karez, Afghanistan in the Helmand province to conduct route clearance. In May 2011, the company {{moved to the}} Kandahar province and split into two elements. First and second platoon conducted clearance operations in and around FOB Walton, while third and fourth platoon moved to FOB Spin Boldak in southern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border. The Bloodhound efforts reduced 147 IEDs in southern Afghanistan; 80,000 kilometers of improved and unimproved roads were cleared. Effectively employed multiple Mine Clearing Linear Charges and eight Antipersonnel <b>Obstacle</b> <b>Breaching</b> <b>Systems</b> during route and area clearance operations; cross-trained maneuver counterparts on both devices. Executed a responsible Relief In Place - Transfer Of Authority with two Mobility Augmentation Companies at two FOBs separated by over 100 km in RC-South.Awarded 19 Purple Hearts and 65 Combat Action Badges during deployment; redeployed every Bloodhound from Afghanistan. The company returned to Fort Stewart on 12 March 2012.|$|R
50|$|However, tanks {{have the}} {{disadvantage}} of having the driver at the front, close to the flail and any explosions, {{and they can not}} go slow enough for effective mine clearance. Also, the weight of tanks makes them difficult to transport (by contrast, the 18-ton Hydrema 910 is light enough to be moved by air in a C-130 Hercules.) The tanks used have generally been obsolete models that have been highly modified - some work under remote control, others have had the driver's station moved to the rear. In modern times, there has been little military interest in an updated equivalent of the Sherman Crab or Matilda Scorpion - a substantially unmodified tank still capable of combat. In battle, the modern preference is to detonate mines with explosive devices (mine-clearing line charges), such as the Antipersonnel <b>Obstacle</b> <b>Breaching</b> <b>System</b> or the Giant Viper. During the Gulf War, the U.S. 2nd Marine Division made an attempt to breach an Iraqi mine field with a mine flail mounted on an armored bulldozer. But the flail was destroyed and the bulldozer crippled by an Iraqi anti-tank mine.|$|R
50|$|In July 2014, the Battalion {{completed}} their largest training exercise in {{years in the}} Mojave Desert. This {{was the first time}} since the battalion’s deployment to Afghanistan in 2009 - 2010 that all the companies, with the exception of Company A, were able to train together. The large training area gave the Marines a chance to use all of the weaponry available on the LAVs and the chance to use the Mine Clearing Lane Charge. Additionally, the Marines had a chance to fire the M242 Bushmaster chain gun, the M240 machine gun and anti-tank guided missiles. Marines also fired a MICLIC, which consists of a rocket tethered to thousands of pounds of C-4 explosives from an LAV. The MICLIC clears out mines and any obstacles, and gives the LAVs a safe and clear path to travel through. The Marines also fired an Anti-Personal <b>Obstacle</b> <b>Breaching</b> <b>System</b> (APOBS) that consists of two backpacks that fire a smaller rocket with tethered grenades that makes a safe path for Marines. In addition to the firepower on the LAVs, the scouts had a chance to engage the enemy in live-fire exercises with the M4 Service Rifle, M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle and M136 AT4 Rocket Launcher.|$|R
50|$|Today ditches are {{obsolescent}} as an <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>obstacle,</b> but {{are still}} often used as anti-vehicle obstacles (see also berm).|$|R
50|$|The {{anti-tank}} obstacle {{system was}} followed by an <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>obstacle</b> system made primarily of dense barbed wire. Anti-tank road barriers also {{made it possible to}} block roads at necessary points of passage through the tank obstacles.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{original}} construction had not anticipated tank attack, no specific measures had {{been incorporated into}} the defence system. To eliminate this drawback, 30 km and 15 km long anti-tank ditches were dug.Also installed were metal hedgehogs and <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>obstacles,</b> among them 16 km of electrified barbed wire {{and a large number}} of minefields.|$|R
5000|$|For <b>obstacle</b> <b>breaching,</b> {{including}} minefields, {{the combat}} engineers {{use a variety}} of vehicles, explosive devices and plastic explosives including: ...|$|R

50|$|The rapid anti-personnel {{minefield}} <b>breaching</b> <b>system</b> or RAMBS II is a British {{rifle grenade}} used to <b>breach</b> <b>obstacles</b> and clear minefields. It {{is designed to}} replace the Bangalore torpedo, offering a more effective and flexible alternative. When deployed, the RAMBS II will clear a path 60 metres long and 0.6 metres wide, compared to the Bangalore's cleared area that is 15 metres long and 1 metre wide.|$|R
5000|$|The main defense line usually lies at hilltop on {{the edge}} of a forest, and divided into circularly {{defensible}} independent sectors (platoon size). A sector includes 3 (or more) trench-rings and 1 or 2 ferro-concrete shelter(s) surrounded by 30 m (or more) wide zone of <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>obstacles</b> (barbed wire, electric fences, wide variety of non-explosive traps) and 2 (or more) [...] "V" [...] or [...] "U" [...] shaped anti-tank trenches or anti-tank walls. Independent sectors were connected by communication trenches into a defensive zone or fortress (Hungarian: völgyzár - literally [...] "valley fort").|$|R
50|$|The Gladiator was {{designed}} {{with the intent}} to be easily transported to different parts of the battlefield. Rated for many types of environments, the Gladiator was to enhance the ability of Marines to accomplish assigned mission tasks. The purpose of the Gladiator was to be teleoperated just forward of the Marine units, performing basic scouting/surveillance, <b>obstacle</b> <b>breaching,</b> and reconnaissance tasks while permitting the operator to remain out of the line of danger.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} {{to have a sense}} of unpredictability so it can be played without confining the player to rules. To achieve this, the company added the <b>breaching</b> <b>system,</b> which adds more varieties of combat and gives players more choices when dealing with the artificial intelligence. The <b>breaching</b> <b>system,</b> which originated as a mini-game, {{was designed to}} be simple so it would not interrupt the flow of gameplay. Instead of being purely a first-person shooter, the game features action-adventure elements that allow players to choose their progression and tasks them with solving environmental puzzles.|$|R
5|$|As {{part of the}} Plan Beersheba reorganisation, the M1A1 Arbrams tanks will {{be split}} across each the three {{armoured}} cavalry regiments assigned to the Army's multirole combat brigades located in Brisbane, Darwin and Townsville. It {{has been reported that}} this plan may require the acquisition of an additional 10–12 M1A1 Abrams and six M88A2 Hercules ARVs in order to allow the formation of three tank squadrons. <b>Obstacle</b> <b>breaching</b> and bridgelaying variants may also be acquired at a later date. One of the 1st Armoured Regiment's squadrons was transferred to the Townsville-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment in late 2015, with 14 of the tanks relocating.|$|R
50|$|The Gladiator Program is a U. S. Marine Corps {{initiative}} {{based on}} the Joint Army-Marine Corps Tactical Unmanned Vehicle (TUV) ORD originated by the Infantry School. MNS INT 12.1.1 dated 4 November 1993 validated {{the need for a}} tactical unmanned ground vehicle system and the Army approved the ORD in August 1995 and by the Marine Corps in May 1996. Existing unmanned vehicles contained several deficiencies which caused both Army and Marine Corps developers to reevaluate design aspects. Developments of the Gladiator allow it to support dismounted infantry and aid in scout/surveillance, direct engagement, and <b>obstacle</b> <b>breaching</b> missions.|$|R

50|$|Because of the its low metal content, the Type 72 {{cannot be}} located using metal {{detectors}} under most field conditions. The Type 72 is resistant to shock and overpressure from explosive <b>breaching</b> <b>systems</b> {{such as the}} Giant Viper and MICLIC.|$|R
50|$|The Python Minefield <b>Breaching</b> <b>System</b> {{is used by}} the British Army {{to clear}} minefields. It replaces the Giant Viper, and has the ability to clear a safe lane in minefields 180-200m long and 7.3 m wide through which {{vehicles}} can pass.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{manner of}} this type of field {{fortification}} was to close potential vehicular transport and attack routes with multiplied anti-tank ditches, hedgehogs, dragon's teeth and mine fields. These obstacle-zone are followed by a quite small but peculiarly complex system of ditches and barbed wire obstacles, which protects the anti-tank barrier against sappers, bridge-layer tanks and engineer teams. The semi-mobile engagement is the main point, soldiers fight in open firing positions, while bunkers served as only shelters during bombardments. Thus it is possible to quickly reallocate between the points of defense (manpower not locked in pillboxes), and counterattacks feasible by defense force. The main defense line usually lies at hilltop {{on the edge of a}} forest, divided into circularly defensible independent subsectors (platoon size) which allow a full 360° arc of fire. A sector includes 3 (or more) trench-rings and no more than a few ferro-concrete shelters surrounded by a wide zone of <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>obstacles</b> and 2 (or more) [...] "V" [...] or [...] "U" [...] shaped anti-tank trenches or dragon's teeth. 3-4 independent sectors connect by communication trenches into a defensive zone or fortress (company or battalion size).|$|R
50|$|Construction {{started in}} June 1939, {{only two months}} before the {{outbreak}} of World War II. The spot was chosen carefully; most of the concrete bunkers were built on hills overlooking a swampy Narew River valley. They could be reached either through direct assault through the swamps or by attack along the causeway leading from the bridge in Wizna. Before September 1, 1939, only 16 bunkers were built out of 60 planned. Six bunkers were made of heavy concrete with reinforced steel cupolas weighing 8 tons each, armed with machine guns and anti-tank artillery. Two were light concrete bunkers, armed with machine guns only. The remaining eight were ad-hoc machine gun pillboxes, protected mostly by sandbags and earthworks. Four additional heavy bunkers were under construction when World War II started. In addition, the area was reinforced with trenches, anti-tank and <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>obstacles,</b> barbed wire lines and land mines. There were also plans to break the dams on the Biebrza and Narew rivers to flood the area, but the summer of 1939 was one of the driest seasons in Polish history and the water level was too low.|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{initiation}} of detonation in fuel-air explosive clouds The invention {{relates to the}} chemical {{initiation of}} detonation of a fuel-in-air (FAE) cloud such as might {{be used in a}} minefield <b>breaching</b> <b>system.</b> A component of the system is adapted to carry fuel to the breaching site and is also adapted to carry a compatible chemical, either gaseous or liquid. Upon detonation of a suitable explosive within the component the fuel is dispersed outwardly to form the cloud and the chemical is jetted outwardly into the cloud in a turbulent manner. A chemical reaction between the chemical initiator and the fuel-air mixture leads almost instantaneously to an explosive shock wave that propagates through the cloud causing detonation thereof. Such detonation neutralizes the minefield along a desired path. With the invention {{it is not necessary to}} utilize secondary charges and hence a more efficient and reliable <b>breaching</b> <b>system</b> is achieved...|$|R

40|$|Breaching in {{masonry wall}} {{as a process}} of quick {{intervention}} of special forces in emergency cases, may require the use of explosive charges. In order to maximize the explosive effects on the wall and to minimize the shock wave and fragments propulsion, such <b>breaching</b> <b>systems</b> usually use a water layer which cover the explosive charge. The thickness of the water layer has a significant influence both on the mitigation of unwanted effects and enhancing the demolition effect, but also increases the mass of the system which can have negative consequences on the maneuverability and rapidity of intervention, respectivly. In this respect, the paper under consideration addresses numerical and experimental research on masonry walls to determine the behavior of mortar and brick under contact detonation and to establish an optimal water layer thickness to balance the <b>breaching</b> <b>system</b> requirement related to the mass {{on the one hand and}} effects and offered protection on the other hand...|$|R
