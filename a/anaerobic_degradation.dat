Prunings of the high tannin, low quality MPT Calliandra houstoniana CIAT 20400 (Calliandra) and the tannin free, high quality MPT Indigofera zollingeriana (Indigofera) were mixed in the proportions 100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, and 0 : 100 (w/w) {{in order to measure}} the aerobic rate and extent of N release in a leaching tube experiment, and the anaerobic extent of N degradation in an in vitro gas production experiment. Parameters measured in Calliandra:Indigofera mixtures were compared to theoretical values derived from single species plant material (i. e. 100 : 0 and 0 : 100). Aerobic N release and apparent <b>anaerobic</b> N <b>degradation</b> increased with increasing proportion of the high quality legume (Indigofera) in the mixture. While N release in the soil was lower than theoretical values in the mixture 50 % Calliandra/ 50 % Indigofera, {{this was not the case}} with apparent <b>anaerobic</b> N <b>degradation</b> with the same mixture. Aerobic N immobilization was more pronounced for the mixture 75 % Calliandra/ 25 % Indigofera than for 100 % Calliandra and negative interaction was observed with apparent <b>anaerobic</b> N <b>degradation</b> in the mixture 75 % Calliandra/ 25 % Indigofera. Plant quality parameters that best correlated with aerobic N release and apparent <b>anaerobic</b> N <b>degradation</b> in the rumen were lignin + bound condensed tannins (r=? 0. 95 and ? 0. 95 respectively, P< 0. 001). In addition, a positive correlation (r= 0. 89, P< 0. 001) was found between aerobic N release in the leaching tube experiment and apparent N degradation in the in vitro anaerobic gas production experiment. Results show that mixing prunings of MPT materials with contrasting quality is an effective way to modify aerobic N release pattern as well as apparent <b>anaerobic</b> N <b>degradation</b> and could possibly be applied to minimize N losses in the rumen and in the soil. In addition, apparent <b>anaerobic</b> N <b>degradation</b> was identified as good predictor of aerobic N release in the soil, which has resource saving implications when screening MTP to be used as green manures.

40|$|Like other {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons, benzene is {{a common}} soil and groundwater contaminant. It is recognized as a human carcinogen. Exposure of benzene can cause serious negative impacts on human health. Benzene is of major concern due to its toxicity and relatively high water solubility. Benzene is easily biodegraded by ubiquitous bacteria {{with the presence of}} free oxygen. However, soil and groundwater contamination with petroleum hydrocarbon often results in the development of anaerobic zones. Bioremediation has been considered as an advantageous alternative in terms of fairly low cost, process flexibility, and on-site utility for the treatment of contaminated soil and groundwater. However, benzene is particularly persistent under anaerobic condition even in the enhanced anaerobic biodegradation process. Although studies have shown that benzene biodegradation could occur under several reducing conditions, the in situ activities of <b>anaerobic</b> benzene <b>degradation</b> are generally low. Bioaugmentation rather than biostimulation may be applicable to accelerate biodegradation process. Successful bioaugmentation requires the inoculation of contaminated soil and groundwater with the strains or consortia of specific degrading capabilities. However, information of dominant species within the microorganisms for <b>anaerobic</b> benzene <b>degradation</b> is still limited. To address this problem, in this study, a benzene-degrading nitrate-reducing culture was established with soil contaminated by gasoline. A nitrate-reducing medium with sulphate, phosphate and other inorganic nutrient was employed to enhance <b>anaerobic</b> benzene <b>degradation.</b> BioSep BioTrap coupled with stable isotope probing and other molecular biological methods were used to identify key anaerobic benzene degraders.

Within a stretch of 31 kb, all genes required for the complete pathway of <b>anaerobic</b> benzoate <b>degradation</b> (catabolic island) were identified, including the four subunits of the key enzyme benzoyl-CoA reductase (bcrCBAD), which catalyzes the ATP-driven 2 -electron reduction of the aromatic ring.

50|$|Because {{methiocarb}} {{is widely}} used as an insecticide on crops, environmental risks were also studied to establish safety risks for human health. The metabolism of methiocarb in plants, soil and water have been proposed from radiolabeled 14Cmethiocarb studies.

40|$|A gene, badH, whose {{predicted}} {{product is}} a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family of enzymes, was recently discovered during studies of <b>anaerobic</b> benzoate <b>degradation</b> by the photoheterotrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Purified histidine-tagged BadH protein catalyzed the oxidation of 2 -hydroxycyclohexanecarboxyl coenzyme A (2 -hydroxychc-CoA) to 2 -ketocyclohexanecarboxyl-CoA. These compounds are proposed intermediates of a series of three reactions that are shared by the pathways of cyclohexanecarboxylate and benzoate degradation used by R. palustris. The 2 -hydroxychc-CoA dehydrogenase activity encoded by badH was dependent on the presence of NAD+; no activity was detected with NADP+ as a cofactor. The dehydrogenase activity was not sensitive to oxygen. The enzyme has apparent Km values of 10 and 200 μM for 2 -hydroxychc-CoA and NAD+, respectively. Western blot analysis with antisera raised against purified His-BadH identified a 27 -kDa protein that was present in benzoate- and cyclohexanecarboxylate-grown but not in succinate-grown R. palustris cell extracts. The active form of the enzyme is a homotetramer. badH was determined to be the first gene in an operon, termed the cyclohexanecarboxylate degradation operon, containing genes required for both benzoate and cyclohexanecarboxylate degradation. A nonpolar R. palustris badH mutant was unable to grow on benzoate or cyclohexanecarboxylate but had wild-type growth rates on succinate. Cells blocked in expression of the entire cyclohexanecarboxylate degradation operon excreted cyclohex- 1 -ene- 1 -carboxylate into the growth medium when given benzoate. This confirms that cyclohex- 1 -ene- 1 -carboxyl-CoA is an intermediate of <b>anaerobic</b> benzoate <b>degradation</b> by R. palustris. This compound had previously been shown not to be formed by Thauera aromatica, a denitrifying bacterium that degrades benzoate by a pathway that is slightly different from the R. palustris pathway. 2 -Hydroxychc-CoA dehydrogenase does not participate in <b>anaerobic</b> benzoate <b>degradation</b> by T. aromatica and thus may serve as a useful indicator of an R. palustris-type benzoate degradation pathway...|$|R

Moreover, these methanogens change the structure of the tailings pond and help the pore water efflux to reuse for processing oil sands. Because the archaea and bacteria metabolize and release bubbles within the tailings, the pore water can go through the soil easily. Since they accelerate the densification of mature fine tailings, the tailings pond are enable to settle the solids more quickly so that the tailings can be reclaimed earlier. Moreover, the water released from the tailings can use it in the procedure of refining oil. Reducing the demand of water can also protect the environment from drought.|$|E

5000|$|Anaerobic {{microbial}} mineralization of recalcitrant {{organic pollutants}} {{is of great}} environmental significance and involves intriguing novel biochemical reactions. In particular, hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds have long been doubted to be degradable {{in the absence of}} oxygen, but the isolation of hitherto unknown anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading and reductively dehalogenating bacteria during the last decades provided ultimate proof for these processes in nature. While such research involved mostly chlorinated compounds initially, recent studies have revealed reductive dehalogenation of bromine and iodine moieties in aromatic pesticides. [...] Other reactions, such as biologically induced abiotic reduction by soil minerals, has been shown to deactivate relatively persistent aniline-based herbicides far more rapidly than observed in aerobic environments. Many novel biochemical reactions were discovered enabling the respective metabolic pathways, but progress in the molecular understanding of these bacteria was rather slow, since genetic systems are not readily applicable for most of them. However, with the increasing application of genomics in the field of environmental microbiology, a new and promising perspective is now at hand to obtain molecular insights into these new metabolic properties. Several complete genome sequences were determined during the last few years from bacteria capable of anaerobic organic pollutant degradation. The ~4.7 Mb genome of the facultative denitrifying Aromatoleum aromaticum strain EbN1 was the first to be determined for an anaerobic hydrocarbon degrader (using toluene or ethylbenzene as substrates). The genome sequence revealed about two dozen gene clusters (including several paralogs) coding for a complex catabolic network for anaerobic and aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds. The genome sequence forms the basis for current detailed studies on regulation of pathways and enzyme structures. Further genomes of anaerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were recently completed for the iron-reducing species Geobacter metallireducens (accession nr. NC_007517) and the perchlorate-reducing Dechloromonas aromatica (accession nr. NC_007298), but these are not yet evaluated in formal publications. Complete genomes were also determined for bacteria capable of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>degradation</b> of halogenated hydrocarbons by halorespiration: the ~1.4 Mb genomes of Dehalococcoides ethenogenes strain 195 and Dehalococcoides sp. strain CBDB1 and the ~5.7 Mb genome of Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain Y51. Characteristic for all these bacteria is the presence of multiple paralogous genes for reductive dehalogenases, implicating a wider dehalogenating spectrum of the organisms than previously known. Moreover, genome sequences provided unprecedented insights into the evolution of reductive dehalogenation and differing strategies for niche adaptation.|$|E
