25|$|Wright {{expressed}} the following sentiments regarding the CLMC death threat {{in an interview}} he conducted with journalist Emer Woodful in late August 1996:My {{heart goes out to}} my family at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this. Well, if you think you're right, then you're right. Although I have done nothing wrong except express an opinion that's the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price. Well, I've been prepared to die for long many a year. I don't wish to die, {{but at the end of}} the day no one will force their opinions down my throat – no one.|$|E
25|$|President Eisenhower did {{not want}} to fly American U-2 pilots over the Soviet Union because he felt that if one of these pilots were to be shot down or {{captured}} that it could be seen as an act of aggression. At <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> the Cold War, any act of aggression could spark open conflict between the two countries. In order to ease the burden of flying Americans into Soviet airspace the idea developed to have British pilots from the Royal Air Force fly these missions in place of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). With the United Kingdom still reeling from the aftermath of the Suez Crisis and in no position to snub American requests, the British government was amenable to the proposal. Using British pilots allowed Eisenhower {{to be able to use}} the U-2 plane to see what the Soviet Union was hiding, while still being able to plausibly deny any affiliation if a mission became compromised.|$|E
500|$|Gessle briefly {{reunited with}} Gyllene Tider in 1996, then Roxette took {{instrumental}} masters {{of many of}} its ballads and recorded translated Spanish lyrics over them. The resulting album, Baladas En Español, sold well in Spanish speaking regions reaching 2×platinum in Spain and platinum in Argentina. The single [...] "Un día sin ti" [...] ("Spending My Time") accompanied by a video directed by Jonas Åkerlund, became their first Latin Pop Airplay chart entry.

2500|$|Gwen Inhat of The AV Club {{gave the}} episode a B+. In her review she stated [...] "Once Upon <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> <b>likes</b> {{to throw out}} a lot of platitudinal {{concepts}} like “trust,” and who can be trusted. It's a veritable trust smorgasbord this episode, as allies form that shouldn't, while villains turn on everyone because if we know anything from these five seasons of OUAT, we know that's what they do." ...|$|R

Her second child Oscar Mikael, was born on 26 November 1996.|$|E
2500|$|News of {{casualties}} {{suffered by the}} British Expeditionary Force in Belgium was already turning the public mood against [...] "business as usual" [...] and on 27 August a letter written by W.G. Grace was published in The Sportsman in which he declared that [...] "I think the time has arrived when the county cricket season should be closed, for it is not fitting at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this that able-bodied men should be playing cricket by day and pleasure-seekers look on. I should like to see all first-class cricketers of suitable age {{set a good example}} and come to the help of their country without delay in its hour of need." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both Harper and Dion {{addressed}} {{the nation on}} December 3, 2008, with televised statements broadcast on Canada's major television networks. Harper's five-minute pre-recorded statement, televised nationally in English and French at 7 pm Eastern Time (ET), outlined the steps the government had taken to address the economic crisis and attacked the Liberals for forming a coalition with the Bloc Québécois. Harper said: [...] "at a time of global economic instability, Canada's government must stand unequivocally for keeping the country together. At <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this, a coalition with the separatists cannot help Canada. And the opposition {{does not have the}} democratic right to impose a coalition with the separatists they promised voters would never happen." [...] The press noted that while he used the word sovereigntist in the French version of his speech, Harper used separatist in English.|$|E
2500|$|Clark, Vines, and Harlan {{whispered the}} {{password}} to viewers {{on the first}} two versions of the show, but the practice was discontinued, beginning with Password All-Stars, when a computer (referred to as [...] "Murphy" [...] on-camera by Allen Ludden) was incorporated; it would display the password, one letter at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> (<b>like</b> a typewriter), followed by the quotation marks. A beeping sound would accompany each letter as it appeared on the screen. A final beep would signal that the password was revealed to the home viewer, and play would start. On Password Plus, a bell would ring when the password was revealed. On Super Password from September 24, 1984 to October 31, 1986, a chirping sound was heard when the password was revealed. However, Gene Wood began whispering the words on Super Password just like in the original, starting on November 3, 1986. The practice was again discontinued on Million Dollar Password.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 May, {{they heard}} that the Belgian army was surrendering. [...] General Réquin spoke to Mrs Spears and {{emphasised}} the serious of the military situation. She received telephone calls from Paris – her husband wanted {{her to come to}} Paris before he flew to London. [...] She resisted – how could she leave her unit at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this? [...] Spears was insistent but she was reluctant, as was Captain Gosset, who feared the road might be cut and that she would be unable to get back. [...] They heard that Dunkirk had been evacuated. [...] Then Spears rang again – this time ordering her to come to Paris. [...] She decided to make a dash to the capital and back. [...] They met at the British embassy. [...] With the French army collapsing on all fronts, Spears was exhausted. 'His eyes were bloodshot. [...] There were lines inches deep in his face. [...] I saw for one second what was going to happen. [...] The war leapt at me out of his eyes. [...] I was terrified.' ...|$|E

40|$|Nucleic acid-based tests (NABTs) were {{developed}} to decrease {{the time required to}} identify microorganism in the pathological specimens. The commercially available NABTs are of two types – one those can be applied to positive cultures grown in blood culture bottles and other those can be applied directly to blood samples. The latter tests are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based assays which can amplify the existing load of microorganism nucleic acids many <b>a</b> <b>times</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> culture in a blood culture bottle. Both tests then identify the pathogenic organisms with the use of specific nucleic acid probes. These tests have proven useful in management of heart transplant sepsis management...|$|R
