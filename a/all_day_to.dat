25|$|Unlike {{other groups}} which formed yeshivas in pre-war Poland, Belz {{maintained}} a unique yoshvim program, developed by Rabbi Yissachar Dov, which produced many outstanding Torah scholars. The yoshvim were married and unmarried men {{who remained in}} the synagogue <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> study the Talmud, pray, and derive inspiration from their Rebbe. They were supported by local businessmen, and their food and other necessities were brought to them so they wouldn't {{have to leave the}} synagogue for even a short time. Some yoshvim even slept in the synagogue on benches. They typically remained in this program until the Rebbe would tell them to return home to their wives and families.|$|E
25|$|Carlingford {{railway station}} is the {{terminus}} of the Carlingford Line on the Sydney Trains network. The Carlingford Line, which opened on 20 April 1896 {{as a private}} railway, then as a public line on 1 August 1901, is a mostly single-track line. There is currently only one service {{in the early morning}} which connects to the city directly, at other times a train-change at Clyde, is necessary to reach other stations, and consequently the service has a low patronage, though it is quite popular during peak hours. As part of the CityRail Clearways Project, a passing loop was promised to the Carlingford Line with two services per hour <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> become effective in 2010. This was however scrapped in the 2008 mini-budget.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{was aware}} of the {{precarious}} situation on the Plank Road, rather than reorganizing his line, Lee chose to allow Hill's men to rest, assuming that Longstreet's Corps, now only 10 miles from the battlefield, would arrive in time to reinforce Hill before dawn. When that occurred, he planned to shift Hill to the left to cover some of the open ground between his divided forces. Longstreet calculated that he had sufficient time to allow his men, tired from marching <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> <b>to</b> rest and the First Corps did not resume marching until after midnight. Moving cross-country in the dark, they made slow progress and lost their way at times, and by sunrise had not reached their designated position.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until the}} late 1990s baboons {{occurred}} on all the mountains of the Peninsula, including the Back Table immediately behind Table Mountain. Since then they have abandoned Table Mountain and the Back Table, and only occur on the Constantiaberg, and {{the mountains to the}} south. They have also abandoned the tops of many of the mountains, in favour of the lower slopes, particularly when these were covered in pine plantations which seemed to provide them with more, or higher quality food than the fynbos on the mountain tops. However these new haunts are also within easy reach of Cape Town's suburbs, which brings them into conflict with humans and dogs, and the risk of traffic accidents. In 2014 there were a dozen troops on the Peninsula, varying in size from 7 to over 100 individuals, scattered on the mountains from the Constantiaberg to Cape Point. The baboon troops are the subject of intense research into their movements (both of individuals and of the troops), their physiology, genetics, social interactions and habits. In addition, their sleeping sites are noted each evening, so that monitors armed with paint ball guns can stay with the troop <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> <b>to</b> ward them off from wandering into the suburbs. From when this initiative was started in 2009 the number of baboons on the Peninsula has increased from 350 to 450, and the number of baboons killed or injured by residents has decreased.|$|E
25|$|Isolated {{from the}} rest of the division, they were {{assisted}} in their defence by the dense woods, which broke up infantry assaults and made armoured vehicle attacks impossible. They did however suffer under artillery bombardments, until their trenches had adequate over-head cover. Adopting a policy of mine laying, setting ambushes, raiding and patrolling, at times the battalion's patrols reached as far as Bures and Troarn. The battalion remained in the woods until 16 June, when the 3rd Parachute Brigade went into reserve. When they returned to the front, they continued patrolling and harassing the Germans for the next six weeks. Until 17 August when the 6th Airborne Division, crossed the River Dives. The 8th Battalion were involved in heavy fighting at Goustranville, which they captured by nightfall. By 21 August the battalion, had reached Annebault. Supported by a left flanking attack by the 9th Parachute Battalion, the 8th put in a frontal assault. The village was well defended and both battalions fought <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> liberate the village. The 8th Battalions next major engagement was on 25 August at Beuzeville, attacked by the 3rd Parachute and the 4th Special Service Brigade. Supported by the Cromwell tanks of the 6th Airborne Division Reconnaissance Regiment the battalion gradually overcome the German strong points and captured the town. After the liberation of Beuzeville the 6th Airborne Division having reached Honfleur on the River Seine was ordered to hold their positions. By September the battalion had been withdrawn to England. At the same time Lieutenant Colonel George Hewitson replaced the incapacitated Lieutenant Colonel Pearson as commanding officer.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Festubert {{began on}} 15 May, and on 25 May the 47th Division {{extended}} the British offensive by launching an attack from Givenchy {{just north of}} the La Bassée Canal. 6th London Brigade (now entitled 142nd (1/6th London) Bde), was chosen to make the attack on a two-battalion front by the 1/23rd and 1/24th Londons, with the 1/21st in support. The brigade was harassed by artillery and machine-gun fire (during the Battle of Aubers) {{in the days before the}} attack, which went in at 18.30 on the 25th, against German trenches known as the 'S' Bend. The leading battalions swept across No-Man's Land with comparatively small losses, but once in the German front-line trench came under fierce enfilading fire from German guns that had pre-registered their own trenches. The lead companies of the First Surreys (B and D), waiting in the British front trenches, were also heavily shelled, and then met with intense small-arms fire when they crossed No-Man's Land to support the attack. They then had to put the captured trenches into a defensible state to ward off counter-attacks, while A and C companies brought up supplies, evacuated wounded, and dug a communication trench from the old front line during the night. Daybreak on 26 May revealed that the left flank of the battalion was 'in the air', with a party of Germans behind it still inflicting casualties. It took <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> fortify this flank and build up parapets that could be handed over to the relieving battalion that night. The First Surreys lost two officers and 32 NCOs and men killed in this action, and three officers and 120 NCOs wounded, and won the battle honour Festubert 1915.|$|E

500|$|The British {{plan for}} Gaza {{required}} the ANZAC Mounted Division to circle around by night and block Turkish reinforcements {{getting to the}} town.

They soon reached their positions with the brigade, between the 2nd Light Horse and 22nd Mounted Brigades, {{and waited for the}} infantry divisions to assault the town. At 14:00, as the infantry were having problems, the brigade were ordered to attack. The regiment galloped towards the town, with the Wellington Mounted Rifles on their right and the Auckland Mounted Rifles in reserve. Once there, the regiment moved south along a ridge and attacked the garrison at Ali Muntar. This hilltop could command the approaches into Gaza. They soon captured the outlying Turkish trenches, forcing the defenders back towards the town. At 18:40 the 10th Squadron reached the hill top {{at the same time as}} the 53rd (Welsh) Division, who had been trying <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> take the position from the other side.

500|$|As the {{infantry}} {{moved to the}} attack contact-patrol aircraft flew low overhead, two being maintained over each corps during the day. The observers were easily able to plot the positions of experienced troops, who lit flares and waved anything to attract attention. Some troops, poorly trained and inexperienced, failed to co-operate, fearing exposure to the Germans so aircraft flew dangerously low to identify them, four being shot down in consequence. Although air observation was not as vital to German operations because of their control of commanding ground, the speed by which reports from air observation could be delivered, made it a most valuable form of liaison between the front line and higher commanders. German infantry proved as reluctant to reveal themselves as the British so German flyers also had to make visual identifications. Reports and maps were dropped at divisional headquarters and corps report centres, allowing the progress of {{the infantry}} to be followed. During the pause on the ridge crest, an observer reported that the Oosttaverne line was barely occupied, at [...] a balloon observer reported a heavy German barrage on the II Anzac Corps front and a counter-attack patrol aircraft reported German infantry advancing either side of Messines.
