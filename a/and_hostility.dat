5|$|Conditions {{improved}} slightly {{after the}} death of Peter II, and Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of physics in 1731. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, who was fed up with the censorship <b>and</b> <b>hostility</b> he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him {{as the head of the}} mathematics department.|$|E
5|$|NOI {{leaders were}} angry that Clarence13X freely taught {{portions}} of their doctrine that they only revealed to committed members; although one of their captains repeatedly asked him to stop, he refused.

5|$|Although {{the team}} name of Eastern Michigan University {{changed from the}} Hurons to the Eagles in 1991, the change {{remained}} controversial as some students and alumni sought to restore it. In 2012, the university president brought back the Hurons logo, which was placed inside flap a of the band uniforms, along with another historic logo, with the stated intent of recognizing the past. However, {{the return of the}} Hurons logo has prompted protests from Native Americans at the university and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes stereotypes <b>and</b> <b>hostility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} he adopted his famous style of dressing, {{consisting}} of a knee-length one-piece Kafni robe and a cloth cap. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was dressed like an athlete and sported 'long hair flowing down {{to the end of}} his spine' when he arrived in Shirdi, and that he never had his head shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the kafni and cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing. This attire contributed to Baba's identification as a Muslim fakir and was a reason for initial indifference <b>and</b> <b>hostility</b> against him in a predominantly Hindu village.|$|E
5|$|Augustus {{bestowed}} only {{properties and}} possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance <b>and</b> <b>hostility</b> among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With {{regards to the}} Principate, {{it was obvious to}} Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.|$|E

5|$|In 1913 a Suffrage Pilgrimage was organised, to {{end with}} a rally in Hyde Park, London on 26 July. It {{was an attempt to}} remind the public of the larger {{constitutional}} and non-militant wing of the movement, and routes were planned from 17 British towns and cities, including Wales. Twenty-eight members from Welsh NUWSS branches left from Bangor on 2 July travelling through Wales where they were met with both support <b>and</b> <b>hostility.</b> A further branch left Cardiff on 7 July.|$|E
5|$|In a {{situation}} analogous {{with that of}} other European countries, the progressive internal decay of the Polish Church created conditions favorable for the dissemination of the Reformation ideas and currents. For example, there was a chasm between the lower clergy and the nobility-based Church hierarchy, which was quite laicized and preoccupied with temporal issues, such as power and wealth, and often corrupt. The middle nobility, which had already {{been exposed to the}} Hussite reformist persuasion, increasingly looked at the Church's many privileges with envy <b>and</b> <b>hostility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scandinavian Scotland {{refers to}} the period from the 8th to the 15th centuries during which Vikings and Norse settlers, mainly Norwegians {{and to a lesser}} extent other Scandinavians, and their descendents colonised parts of what is now the {{periphery}} of modern Scotland. Viking influence in the area commenced in the late 8th century, <b>and</b> <b>hostility</b> between the Scandinavian Earls of Orkney and the emerging thalassocracy of the Kingdom of the Isles, the rulers of Ireland, Dál Riata and Alba, and intervention by the crown of Norway were recurring themes.|$|E

5|$|To {{mark their}} victory, the Allied troops marched in triumph {{through the streets}} of Buenos Aires. The parades {{included}} the Brazilian Army, which insisted that their triumphal procession take place on 20 February, to mark payback for the defeat it had suffered at the Battle of Ituzaingó twenty five years before on that date. The population of Buenos Aires was said to have looked on silently with a combination of shame <b>and</b> <b>hostility</b> as the Brazilians passed.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the terms}} of the new alliance, during the late summer, the Christian fleet {{assembled}} at Messina, under the command of Don John of Austria, who arrived on 23 August. By that time, however, Famagusta had fallen, and any effort to save Cyprus was meaningless. Before setting sail for the east, Don John {{had to deal with the}} mutual distrust <b>and</b> <b>hostility</b> among the various contingents, especially between the Venetians and the Genoese. The Spanish admiral tackled the problem by breaking the various contingents up and mingle ships from various states. Doria assumed command of the right wing, Don Juan kept the centre, the Venetian Agostino Barbarigo received the left, and the Spaniard Alvaro de Bazan the reserve. Unaware of Famagusta's fate, the allied fleet left Messina on 16 September, and ten days later arrived at Corfu, where it learned of the Ottoman victory. The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Müezzinzade Ali Pasha, had anchored at Lepanto (Nafpaktos), near the entrance of the Corinthian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|Born in Bohemia (then part of Austrian Empire) as a German-speaking Jew of humble circumstances, Mahler {{displayed}} {{his musical}} gifts {{at an early}} age. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 {{as director of the}} Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler—who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post—experienced regular opposition <b>and</b> <b>hostility</b> from the anti-Semitic press. Nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky. Late in his life he was briefly director of New York's Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic.|$|E

After roaming around the school shooting innocents, Harris and Klebold commit suicide. A montage of clips showing Harris and Klebold's corpses, students comforting each other, and childhood photos of the gunmen plays.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{initially}} {{signed a}} non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany in August 1939. But after the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Soviet Union and the Allied powers formed {{an alliance of}} convenience. Britain signed a formal alliance and the United States made an informal agreement. In wartime, the United States supplied both Britain and the Soviets through its Lend-Lease Program. However, Stalin remained highly suspicious and {{he believed that the}} British and the Americans had conspired to ensure that the Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting against Nazi Germany. According to this view, the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at the last minute and shape the peace settlement. Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension <b>and</b> <b>hostility</b> between the Allied powers.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the film}} industry, Grant is cited as an anti-star who {{approaches}} his roles like a character actor, {{and attempts to}} make his acting appear spontaneous. Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of irony/sarcasm and studied physical mannerisms, {{as well as his}} precisely-timed dialogue delivery and facial expressions. The entertainment media's coverage of Grant's life off the big screen has often overshadowed his work as an actor. Grant has been outspoken about his antipathy towards the profession of acting, and in his disdain towards the culture of celebrity <b>and</b> <b>hostility</b> towards the media. In a career spanning 30years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting was not his true calling, but rather a career that developed by happenstance.|$|E

5|$|At this point, several {{conflicts}} {{began to}} develop that threatened {{the future of the}} new government at Athens. First, the planned coup at Samos was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats and a group of Athenians who they entrusted with helping them. When the army at Samos heard the news of the coup at Athens, which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government, they declared their loyalty to democracy <b>and</b> <b>hostility</b> to the new government. At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of Scelias {{as the leader of the}} moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by Phrynicus, containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and Antiphon, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were willing to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although willing to seek peace with Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens' power, were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5,000, presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{conflict}} was the ancient distrust, rivalry, <b>and</b> <b>hostility</b> between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the House of Habsburg, which {{had risen to}} the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor since 1438. Since the late 13th century, {{the members of the}} Swiss Confederacy had gradually taken control of territories that once had belonged to the Habsburg realm. The Swiss had attained the status of imperial immediacy, being subject only to the emperor himself, and not to any intermediate Princes or liege lords. This status granted them a far-reaching autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire, even more so as the emperor was a distant overlord. Before 1438, the empire and the emperor had been an antipole to the Habsburg dukes for the Swiss. Previous emperors had repeatedly supported the confederates in their struggles against the Habsburgs, whom they saw as strong rivals. They had confirmed the Imperial immediacy of the Swiss on several occasions; and the Swiss had succeeded in defending their privileged status against Habsburg dukes who had tried to regain their former territories.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will <b>and</b> <b>hostility</b> between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E
