40|$|The Polar Night Jet (PNJ) is {{a strong}} stratospheric {{westerly}} circumpolar wind at around 65 ° N in winter, {{and the strength of}} the climatological PNJ is widely recognized to increase monotonically from October through late December. Remarkably, the climatological PNJ temporarily stops increasing during late November. We examined <b>this</b> <b>short</b> <b>break</b> in terms of the atmospheric dynamical balance and found that it results from an increase in the upward propagation of climatological planetary waves from the troposphere to the stratosphere in late November, which coincides with a maximum of the climatological Eliassen–Palm flux convergence in the lower stratosphere. The upward propagation of planetary waves at 100  hPa, which is strongest over Siberia, is related to the climatological strengthening of the tropospheric trough over Siberia. We suggest that longitudinally asymmetric forcing by land–sea heating contrasts caused by their different heat capacities can account for the strengthening of the trough...|$|R

2500|$|A [...] {{conservative}} {{physical therapy}} program begins with preliminary rest and restriction {{from engaging in}} activities which gave rise to symptoms.
