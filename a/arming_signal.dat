50|$|Electronic arming and fusing, called Electronic Safe Arming and Fire (ESAF), is used. The ESAF system {{enables the}} firing and arming process to proceed, while {{imposing}} {{a series of}} safety checks on the missile. ESAF cues the launch motor after the trigger is pulled. When the missile reaches a key acceleration point (indicating that it has cleared the launch tube), the ESAF initiates a second <b>arming</b> <b>signal</b> to fire the flight motor. After another check on missile conditions (target lock check), ESAF initiates final arming to enable the warheads for detonation upon target impact. When the missile strikes the target, ESAF enables the tandem warhead function (provide appropriate time between the detonation of the precursor charge and the detonation of the main charge).|$|E

40|$|In the {{referenced}} letter, FPL Energy Seabrook submitted license amendment request (LAR) 07 - 01, Setpoint Change for Reactor Trip System Interlock P- 9. The LAR {{proposed a}} {{change to the}} Seabrook Station Technical Specifications (TS) to increase the power level required for a reactor trip following a turbine trip (P- 9 setpoint). The current TS requires a reactor trip when a turbine trip signal occurs and reactor power is greater than 20 percent rated thermal power (RTP); the LAR proposed to change the P- 9 setpoint to 45 percent RTP. The purpose of this letter is to provide additional information regarding the proposed amendment. Following submittal of the LAR, FPL Energy Seabrook recognized that the proposed change impacts the Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) mitigation system (AMS). The AMS is normally enabled to automatically actuate during operation above 20 percent power based on an <b>arming</b> <b>signal</b> from main turbine impulse pressure. With the proposed change to the P- 9 setpoint, however, the turbine could be off-line when power is between 20 percent and 45 percent, and the AMS would not be enabled. The supplemental information provided in the Enclosure to this letter provides {{an evaluation of the}} effect of the P- 9 setpoint change on the functioning of the AMS. an FPL Group companyUnited States Nuclear Regulatory Commission SBK-L- 07181 / Page 2 This additional information regarding LAR 07 - 01 does not alter the conclusion in the referenced submittal that the proposed change does not involve a significant hazard consideration pursuant to 1...|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} used {{a laboratory}} analogue {{to the task}} of driving to took at drivers' responses to encounters with a bicyclist at a T-junction. In particular, a comparison was made between the bicyclist indicating an upcoming turn with an <b>arm</b> <b>signal,</b> an informal signal of intent, or no <b>signal.</b> Overall, <b>arm</b> <b>signals</b> worked relatively well to inform drivers of the bicyclist's intentions and were easier to perceive than informal signals. It was also found that simple failures to react to the bicyclist in time were more common at shorter thinking times whereas incorrect positive responses were unaffected by thinking time. Most interestingly, these experiments showed that <b>arm</b> <b>signals</b> often slowed down the participants' decision-making processes, leading to a lower probability of their stopping in time when the bicyclist was at risk. Moreover, the same was true for informal signals in which there was eye-contact between the bicyclist and the participant. It is suggested that these effects come about because both <b>arm</b> <b>signals</b> and eye-contact are communicative acts and therefore invoke extra stages of involuntary cognitive processing in the drivers, thereby slowing their reactions.

40|$|The frizzled (fz) gene in Drosophila {{controls}} {{two distinct}} signaling pathways: it directs the planar cell polarization (PCP) of epithelia and it regulates cell fate decisions through Armadillo (Arm) by {{acting as a}} receptor for the Wnt protein Wingless (Wg). With the exception of dishevelled (dsh), the genes functioning in these two pathways are distinct. We have taken a genetic approach, based {{on a series of}} new and existing fz alleles, for identifying individual amino acids required for PCP or <b>Arm</b> <b>signaling.</b> For each allele, we have attempted to quantify the strength of signaling by phenotypic measurements. For PCP signaling, the defect was measured by counting the number of cells secreting multiple hairs in the wing. We then examined each allele for its ability to participate in <b>Arm</b> <b>signaling</b> by the rescue of fz mutant embryos with maternally provided fz function. For both PCP and <b>Arm</b> <b>signaling</b> we observed a broad range of phenotypes, but for every allele there is a strong correlation between its phenotypic strength in each pathway. Therefore, even though the PCP and <b>Arm</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways are genetically distinct, the set of signaling-defective fz alleles affected both pathways to a similar extent. This suggests that fz controls these two different signaling activities by a common mechanism. In addition, this screen yielded a set of missense mutations that identify amino acids specifically required for fz signaling function...|$|R

40|$|Fatigue {{damage in}} the {{connections}} of single mast <b>arm</b> <b>signal</b> support structures {{is one of the}} primary safety concerns because collapse could result from fatigue induced cracking. This type of cantilever signal support structures typically has very light damping and excessively large wind-induced vibration have been observed. Major changes related to fatigue design were made in the 2001 AASHTO LRFD Specification for Structural Supports for Highway Signs, Luminaries, and Traffic Signals and supplemental damping devices {{have been shown to be}} promising in reducing the vibration response and thus fatigue load demand on mast <b>arm</b> <b>signal</b> support structures. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and optimal use of one type of damping devices termed tuned mass damper (TMD) in vibration response mitigation. Three prototype single mast <b>arm</b> <b>signal</b> support structures with 50 -ft, 60 -ft, and 70 -ft respectively are selected for this numerical simulation study. In order to validate the finite element models for subsequent simulation study, analytical modeling of static deflection response of mast <b>arm</b> of the <b>signal</b> support structures was performed and found to be close to the numerical simulation results from beam element based finite element model. A 3 -DOF dynamic model was then built using analytically derived stiffness matrix for modal analysis and time history analysis. The free vibration response and forced (harmonic) vibration response of the mast arm structures from the finite element model are observed to be in good agreement with the finite element analysis results. Furthermore, experimental test result from recent free vibration test of a full-scale 50 -ft mast arm specimen in the lab is used to verify the prototype structure’s fundamental frequency and viscous damping ratio. After validating the finite element models, a series of parametric study were conducted to examine the trend and determine optimal use of tuned mass damper on the prototype single mast <b>arm</b> <b>signal</b> support structures by varying the following parameters: mass, frequency, viscous damping ratio, and location of TMD. The numerical simulation study results reveal that two parameters that influence most the vibration mitigation effectiveness of TMD on the single mast <b>arm</b> <b>signal</b> pole structures are the TMD frequency and its viscous damping ratio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Rock {{magnetic}} cyclostratigraphy {{was measured}} in the Barremian–Aptian Cupido (‘Cupidito’) Formation, northeastern Mexico. The goal was to develop an objective evaluation of palaeo-environmental variability recorded in the formation that is independent of facies analysis and interpretation. Anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) was used to estimate magnetic mineral concentration variations for the upper 143 m of the formation, which is characterized by metre-scale carbonate cycles representative of inner- and middle-shelf marine environments. Iso-thermal remanent magnetization acquisition experiments and scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination indicate that micron-sized detrital magnetite from eolian dust carries the <b>ARM</b> <b>signal.</b> At the sampled sections from Garcia and Chico canyons, 25 km apart, ARM records a synchronous 30 – 35 m oscillation with maxima coinciding with fourth-order sequence boundaries, superim-posed with prominent high-frequency variability. Calibrating the 30 – 35 m oscillation to a 405 kyr period (long eccentricity cycle) focuses the high frequencies into short eccentricity, obli-quity and precession index bands; the precession-band signal modulates with an eccentricity sig-nature. The <b>ARM</b> <b>signal</b> is correlated between sections, but decoupled from the interpreted fifth-order depositional cycles. ARM amplitudes diminish up-section with facies suggesting deepenin...|$|R
