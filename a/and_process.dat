40|$|The Paeoniae Radix Alba-Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma herbal pair {{is mainly}} used for {{regulating}} {{the functions of}} liver and spleen, benefiting qi, and nourishing blood. However, the bioactive compounds for the pharmacological activities of the crude <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> Paeoniae Radix Alba-Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma herbal pair extracts are still unclear to date. In the present study, Q Exactive high-performance benchtop quadrupole-Orbitrap LC-MS/MS was applied to identify the complicated components from crude <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> Paeoniae Radix Alba, crude <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, and their crude <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> herbal pair extracts. 123 and 101 compounds were identified in crude <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> Paeoniae Radix Alba samples, respectively.

In the crude <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> Paeoniae Radix Alba-Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma herbal pair extracts, co-decoction could significantly change the chemical composition of Paeoniae Radix Alba and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma in solution. The developed method may provide a scientific foundation for deeply elucidating the processing and compatibility mechanism of Paeoniae Radix Alba and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma...|$|R

5|$|Fish {{brains are}} divided into several regions. At the front are the {{olfactory}} lobes, a pair of structures that receive <b>and</b> <b>process</b> signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves. The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction. Together these structures form the forebrain.|$|E
5|$|In Environmental Ethics <b>and</b> <b>Process</b> Thinking, Palmer {{examines}} whether process philosophy, {{in particular}} the philosophies of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne, can provide an appropriate background for engaging in environmental ethics. Process thought, Clark notes, has frequently appealed more to theologically-inclined environmental ethicists than classical theism; in particular, the views of Hartshorne and Cobb have been influential.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} hailed as an {{important}} addition to the literature in both environmental ethics <b>and</b> <b>process</b> philosophy. Garland offered two challenges to Palmer's claims.

Second, he challenged Palmer's claim that process philosophers will always favour human ends over nonhuman ends. Cobb and Menta, though both welcoming her consideration of process philosophy, challenged Palmer's interpretation of the philosophy of Whitehead and Hartshorne {{on a number of}} points.|$|E

She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E
