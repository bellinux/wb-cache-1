A stone keep and fortification was built within the Roman walls and faced several sieges. Although its garrison was twice starved into surrender, it was never successfully stormed. The castle was occupied more or less continuously until the 16th century, apart from a possible break in the early 13th century when it was slighted. It had been abandoned <b>again</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> late 16th century and remained a crumbling, partly overgrown ruin until it was acquired by the state in 1925.|$|E

5|$|A 1947 fire {{destroyed}} the clubhouse of the Toronto Argonaut Rowing Club and damaged the Grey Cup. Many other trophies and artifacts {{in the clubhouse}} melted or were damaged beyond repair but the Grey Cup survived by catching onto a nail when the shelf upon which it sat collapsed. The trophy has been broken on six other occasions: in 1978, when it was dropped by celebrating Edmonton Eskimos players; in 1987, when an Eskimos' player sat on it; in 1993, when Edmonton's Blake Dermott head-butted it; in 2006, when the trophy broke away from its base as the BC Lions celebrated their victory; in 2012 {{when one of the}} handles broke off as the Toronto Argonauts celebrated; and finally in 2014 when trophy broke from its base <b>again</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Calgary Stampeders after their win.

5|$|After his stint {{with the}} Penguins in 2015, Sprong rejoined the Islanders for the {{remainder}} of the 2015–16 season. He played 33 games for the Islanders and recorded 46 points. The team made the playoffs, where Sprong scored a further 15 points before the team was eliminated in the second round. An injury sustained during practice with the Penguins during the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs kept Sprong out until January, 2017 when he rejoined Charlottetown. He only played 31 games that season, but finished with 59 points, the highest points-per-game average in the entire league. He finished his career with the Islanders with the third goals and second most points in team history, and during the playoffs he tied the record for most career goals and broke the records for most assists and points. Sprong led the Islanders in scoring with 20 points in 12 games as the team lost in the third round of the playoffs, ending his junior career. Following that he was recalled <b>again</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Penguins to train with them during their time in the NHL playoffs.|$|E
