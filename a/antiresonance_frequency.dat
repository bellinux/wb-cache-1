Such behaviour implies a negative DE effect and is opposite to that of bulk Terfenol. In this paper we present measurements of EH and EB (and the magnetomechanical coupling coefficient k) for a range of epoxy bonded composites with different particle sizes and volume fractions. The results indicate that the elastic modulii have a variation with bias field which is complex and dependent on both of these compositional variables. The compression bonded samples were produced using Terfenol powder particles in the size rnages (106 - 150, 150 - 210, 210 - 300, 300 - 500 and 500 - 710 mm) each in three concentrations (of nominal volume fractions 55, 62 and 70 %).

For this purpose; we have proposed the continuous electrodes to divide into two pairs of electrodes. The one pair is used to pick up the electric signal; another one is exploited for electromechanical damping. Two types of electrodes may be used—rectangular or non-rectangular—with a gap between them directed at some angle, usually 45 °. The frequency bandwidth is wider (up to 9 kHz) in the case of non-rectangular electrodes. The strip-like acoustic matching element bonded to the tip of the PMN- 32 %PT crystal may significantly enhance the performance of the ultrasonic receiver. It was proposed to use for this purpose AIREX T 10. 110 rigid polymer foam, the acoustic impedance of which is close to the optimal value necessary for matching with air. It was found that {{in order to get a}} wide bandwidth the length of the matching strip should be selected not a quarter wavelength λ/ 4 at the <b>antiresonance</b> <b>frequency</b> but at lower frequency. It allowed achieving the frequency bandwidth (14 – 18) % with respect to the central frequency at − 3 dB level...|$|E
40|$|QCR {{devices have}} been used as sensors to detect the {{mechanical}} and electrical properties of a loading medium. Recent studies report that the electrical loading sensitivity of the QCR device can be significantly improved by modifying the electrode structure of the QCR in terms of the dimension and geometry. This device is referred to as a modified-electrode QCR. The device produces relatively high strength electric fringing fields {{near the edge of the}} modified-electrode. These electric fringing fields are utilized to enhance the electrical loading sensitivity of the QCR device. Results clearly indicate that the modified-electrode QCR device can be used as an effective detector in monitoring the electrical properties of a medium adjacent to the QCR surface. However, it appears that further characterizations of the modified-electrode QCR devices are necessary to explain the electrical loading mechanism and to improve the performance of the device. Moreover, investigation on the crystal vibration mechanism of the device is also necessary to optimize the design of the modified-electrode QCR device. For example, the modified-electrode QCR does not sustain oscillation as easily as a typical QCR. This is because most of the acoustic energy is trapped under the narrow or modified-electroded region. As a result, the resonance condition of the QCR device becomes easily unstable when any change in the boundary conditions on the narrow or modified-electroded region occurs. This is even more serious when the device is used in liquid environments where damping occurs due to viscous coupling. Although the modified-electrode QCR device shows relatively high sensitivity to electrical loading, the difficulty in maintaining oscillation can cause severe limitations in its applications. Therefore, a complete understanding of the crystal vibration and detection mechanisms of the modified-electrode QCR device is needed for an optimized design. This dissertation formulated a theory representing the crystal vibration amplitude profiles and the differential mass sensitivity profiles of the various modified-electrode QCR devices. To analyze the electrical loading mechanism of the QCR devices, a study of the behavior of the electric fringing field due to the change in the electrical properties of the loading medium was carried out using the Finite Element Analysis Method. Changes in the electrostatic capacitance of the various QCR devices loaded with various conductive dielectric loading media were also calculated. It is shown that the effective surface area of the electrode increases as the conductivity of the loading medium increases which, in turn, results in a change in the electrical load of the QCR. Using the network analysis method, various critical frequencies of the loaded modified-electrode QCR were theoretically and experimentally characterized. It is shown that these critical frequencies respond differently to the changes in the material properties of the loading medium. It has been found that the <b>antiresonance</b> <b>frequency,</b> fa, is the most sensitive frequency to the variations in the electrical properties of the loading medium, and therefore can be utilized in sensor applications. On the other hand, the results also indicate that the series resonance frequency, fs, can be utilized to monitor the mechanical properties of the crystal/liquid interface. Note that the change in the mechanical properties at that interface is directly related to changes in the electrical properties...|$|E
40|$|Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonators (TFBARs) {{had been}} {{developed}} a decade ago and since then were implemented extensively in mobile communications devices. The "heart" of a TFBAR consists of a piezoelectric film that operates as an acousto-electric transducer, stabilizing the transmission at a given predetermined frequency. For reasons such as space economy in hand-held devices, it is of interest to make these TFBARs tunable, so that a single TFBAR is multi-band responsive. This thesis demonstrates {{for the first time}} electrically tunable, single-component TFBARs. A theory describing the tuning behavior of dc bias induced acoustic resonances was developed. Then we made the hypothesis that dc bias induced piezoelectric BaxSr 1 -xTiO 3 (BST) thin films – namely, paraelectric, non-piezoelectric films operating under dc bias – {{can be used to make}} electrically tunable TFBARs and that the devices can be switched on or off depending on the dc bias state. The devices were then fabricated: We integrated BST lms onto silicon substrates, micromachined the substrate to create the TFBARs and a new type of suspended planar capacitor which were then characterized, analyzed, and modeled, demonstrating successfully the new concept: We developed a theory describing the electrical tuning behavior of the dc bias induced acoustic resonances in paraelectric thin lms in terms of material parameters. The field dependent constitutive piezoelectric equations were derived from the Landau free energy P-expansion by taking the linear and nonlinear electrostrictive terms as well as the background permittivity into account. We considered two modes of excitation for the tuning of the acoustic resonances, namely the thickness excitation (TE) mode and the lateral field excitation (LFE) mode. The tuning behavior of the two types of resonators based on BST thin films was modeled and discussed. For the modeling we calculated the relevant tensor components controlling the tuning of the BST resonators from the available literature data. The fabrication of the membrane-type TFBARs was realized by integrating BST thin films onto silicon substrates and using micromaching technologies. We showed that the developed TFBARs can be switched on or off with a dc bias. At a dc electric field of 615 kV/cm we observed a tuning of - 2. 4 % (- 66 MHz) and - 0. 6 % (- 16 MHz) for the resonance and antiresonance frequencies of the device, while the resonance frequency at a dc electric field extrapolated to 0 kV/cm was 2. 85 GHz. The effective electromechanical coupling factor k 2 eff of the device increased up to 4. 4 %. The tuning was non-hysteretic. The Quality-factor (Q-factor) of the device was about 200. The developed micromaching processes for the TFBARs were used to fabricate coplanar BST capacitors on silicon. Micromaching was used to remove the Si substrate under the active area of the device. Comparing this new micromachined coplanar capacitor with conventional non-micromachined capacitors, we demonstrated that the removal of the substrate from the active device area resulted in a reduction of parasitic effects. The micromachined coplanar capacitor showed an increased tunability and a reduced loss tangent in comparison to the non-micromachined capacitor. The micromachined capacitor showed a relative tunability of 37 % at a dc electric field of 1100 kV/cm. The loss tangent was 0. 08 and 0. 06 at zero and maximum dc bias, respectively, at a measurement frequency of 20 GHz. The integration of epitaxial BST thin films on silicon was studied as well because of its potential improvement of the device performance in comparison to devices based on polycrystalline films. Two different electrode/buffer layer systems, YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (YBCO) / CeO 2 / YxZr 1 -xO 2 -x/ 2 (YSZ) and TiN were used for the integration. Epitaxial BST thin films were grown with both structures. For the BST / YBCO / CeO 2 / YSZ / Si structure, the BST unit cell was rotated by 45 ° in the in-plane dimension with respect to the substrate. The BST layer exhibited good structural quality as indicated by a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 0. 5 ° of the rocking curve of the BST(002) diffraction peak. For the BST / TiN / Si structure, the BST layer was grown with a cube-on-cube epitaxial relationship on the silicon substrate, thus demonstrating epitaxially grown BST on silicon using conventional bottom electrode that is easily acceptable by the microelectronic industry. However, in this case, the structural quality of the BST layer was reduced in comparison to the BST / YBCO / CeO 2 / YSZ / Si structure. The FWHM of the rocking curve of the BST(002) diffraction peak was 2. 2 °. We established the temperature (T= 550 to 600 °C) and pressure (p ≈ 10 - 7 to 5 × 10 - 4 Torr) conditions for the growth of epitaxial BST thin films on TiN-buffered Si. At too high temperatures and/or oxygen pressures epitaxial BST thin film growth was impeded due to the oxidation of the TiN layer. By introducing experimental results from the electrical characterization of the micromachined devices with the polycrystalline BST into our developed theory, we could successfully model the tuning behavior of our fabricated TFBARs. The modeling allowed us to de-embed the intrinsic electromechanical properties of a freestanding BST layer. The effect of increasing mechanical load on the tuning performance of the device was modeled and studied experimentally. Under strong mechanical load, the tuning of both resonance and <b>antiresonance</b> <b>frequency</b> was reduced. The effect was attributed to a reduction in the tuning of k 2 eff of the device and of the sound velocity of the BST layer...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{updating}} {{technique that}} includes antiresonances {{in the definition}} of the output residual is considered. Antiresonances are not a global system property, but are typical of each frequency response function (FRF), thus allowing the residual vector to be enlarged with data identified from additional FRFs. However, antiresonance information is not independent of mode shape information; it is rather an alternative, which is preferable for several reasons. Antiresonances can be identified from experimental FRFs with much less error than mode shapes; furthermore, correlation between test and analysis antiresonances is a good index of the correlation between test and analysis FRFs. In the implementation of the technique, matching problems arise whenever antiresonances identified from transfer FRFs are used; unlike the situation for point FRFs, the distribution of antiresonances may be significantly altered by small changes in the structural model. Such problems may be circumvented by restricting the experimental database to point FRFs; in this case, the procedure is quite robust and excellent results are obtained, although it is necessary to plan experimental testing differently from the usual modal testing, with possible impact on related costs. For this reason, a procedure to deal with transfer FRFs by establishing a correlation between test and analysis FRFs at <b>antiresonances</b> using <b>frequency</b> domain assurance criterion (FDAC), is also evaluated. The procedure is not very robust and requires special attention to give acceptable results...|$|R
