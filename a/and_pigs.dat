5|$|In ancient Egypt, cattle {{were the}} most {{important}} livestock, and sheep, goats, <b>and</b> <b>pigs</b> were also kept; poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Honey bees were domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, providing both honey and wax.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} named, the {{proteins}} {{have been found}} to be differentially expressed in other glands that secrete products directly into the external environment. These include lacrimal, parotid, submaxillary, sublingual, preputial and mammary glands. In some species, such as cats <b>and</b> <b>pigs,</b> Mups appear not to be expressed in urine at all and are mainly found in saliva. Sometimes the term urinary Mups (uMups) is used to distinguish those Mups expressed in urine from those in other tissues.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{face the}} same threats as other seabirds; in {{particular}} they are threatened by introduced species.

At a fixed concentration of NPK fertilizer, it was observed that increase in Tween 80 <b>and</b> <b>pig</b> manure concentrations resulted in higher TPH and Cr (VI) reductions. The maximum reductions in TPH (67.32 %) and Cr (VI) (53.21 %) were obtained with 10 mg/l of Tween 80 and 4 g (i.e., 20, 000 mg/kg) of NPK fertilizer.|$|R
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} is {{the type}} genus of the family Hippopotamidae. The pygmy hippopotamus belongs to a different genus in Hippopotamidae, either Choeropsis or Hexaprotodon. Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes, the subfamily Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotamuses and anthracotheres in the superfamily Anthracotheroidea. Hippopotamidae are classified along with other even-toed ungulates in the order Artiodactyla. Other artiodactyls include camels, cattle, deer <b>and</b> <b>pigs,</b> although hippopotamuses are not closely related to these groups.|$|E
5|$|The inaccessibility of many tern colonies {{gave them}} a measure of {{protection}} from mammalian predators, especially on islands, but introduced species brought by humans can seriously affect breeding birds. These can be predators such as foxes, raccoons, cats and rats, or animals that destroy the habitat, including rabbits, goats <b>and</b> <b>pigs.</b> Problems arise not only on formerly mammal-free islands, as in New Zealand, but also where an alien carnivore, such as the American mink in Scotland, presents an unfamiliar threat.|$|E
5|$|About 10% of Lord Howe Island's forests {{have been}} cleared for agriculture, and another 20% has been disturbed, mostly by {{domestic}} cattle and feral sheep, goats <b>and</b> <b>pigs.</b> As a result, 70% {{of the island}} remains relatively untouched {{with a variety of}} plants and animals, many of which are endemic, some of which are rare or threatened. Two species of plants, nine terrestrial birds, one bat and at least four invertebrates have become extinct since 1778. Endemism at the generic level includes the palms Howea, Hedyscepe and Lepidorrhachis, a woody daisy Lordhowea, the tree Negria, the leech Quantenobdella howensis, three annelid worm genera (Paraplutellus, Pericryptodrilus and Eastoniella), an isopod shrimp Stigmops, a hemipteran bug Howeria and a cricket Howeta.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture {{formed the}} bulk of the English economy {{at the time of the}} Norman invasion. Twenty years after the invasion, 35% of England was covered in arable land, 25% was put to pasture, 15% was covered by {{woodlands}} and the remaining 25% was predominantly moorland, fens and heaths. Wheat formed the single most important arable crop, but rye, barley and oats were also cultivated extensively. In the more fertile parts of the country, such as the Thames valley, the Midlands and the east of England, legumes and beans were also cultivated. Sheep, cattle, oxen <b>and</b> <b>pigs</b> were kept on English holdings, although most of these breeds were much smaller than modern equivalents and most would have been slaughtered in winter.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the formal {{administration}} of Toraja villages by the Tana Toraja Regency, each Toraja village was autonomous. In a more complex situation, in which one Toraja family could not handle their problems alone, several villages formed a group; sometimes, villages would unite against other villages. Relationship between families was expressed through blood, marriage, and shared ancestral houses (tongkonan), practically signed by the exchange of water buffalo <b>and</b> <b>pigs</b> on ritual occasions. Such exchanges not only built political and cultural ties between families but defined each person's place in a social hierarchy: who poured palm wine, who wrapped a corpse and prepared offerings, where each person could or could not sit, what dishes should be used or avoided, and even what piece of meat constituted one's share.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle <b>and</b> <b>pigs</b> were associated with more settled communities.|$|E
40|$|Ribs from sheep, goat <b>and</b> <b>pig</b> {{are rarely}} assessed  to species {{due to the}} fact that they are very similar in their {{morphology}} and size. The ribs are instead considered unidentifiable although it is possible to see what kind of bone it is. If these ribs would be identified to species not only would species assessment degree of archaeological source material   increase, the relationship between meat-rich and meat poor regions would change. To find out whether there are morphologically measurable differences between sheep, goat <b>and</b> <b>pig</b> ribs, three measurement points on each rib has been defined and measured. At each measurement point two measurements were measured, one medial-lateral measurement and one cranial-caudal measurement. The ratio between the medial- lateral measurement and the cranial-caudal measurement was calculated for each point. In this way, it is not the size variation between species that are studied, but its morphology. There are statistically differences between the species. Sheep <b>and</b> <b>pig</b>   have significant differences in 11 pairs of ribs. Goat <b>and</b> <b>pig</b> also have significant differences in 11 pairs of ribs. Sheep and goat are significantly different in five pairs of ribs. The results of this study could be used to develop a method for the assessment of sheep, goat <b>and</b> <b>pig</b> based on ribs...|$|R

5|$|The {{island was}} {{subsequently}} visited by many government and whaling ships sailing between New South Wales and Norfolk Island {{and across the}} Pacific, including many from the American whaling fleet, so its reputation as a provisioning port preceded settlement, some ships leaving goats <b>and</b> <b>pigs</b> on the island as food for future visitors. Between July and October 1791 the Third Fleet ships arrived at Sydney and within days the deckwork was being reconstructed for a future in the lucrative whaling industry. Whale oil was to become Australia's most profitable export until the 1830s, {{and it was the}} whaling industry that shaped Lord Howe Island's early history.|$|E
5|$|Although the IUCN {{lists the}} Rodrigues {{solitaire}} as going extinct by 1778, the species probably became extinct some {{time between the}} 1730s and 1760s; the exact date is unknown. Its disappearance coincided with the tortoise trade between 1730 and 1750, when traders burnt off vegetation, hunted solitaires, and released cats <b>and</b> <b>pigs</b> that preyed on eggs and chicks. In 1755, Joseph-François Charpentier de Cossigny attempted to obtain a live specimen, {{as he had been}} assured the Rodrigues solitaire still survived in remote areas of the island. After searching for 18 months and offering large rewards, he could find none. He noted that cats were blamed for decimating the species, but suspected that it was really due to hunting by humans. When he visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, Alexandre Guy Pingré encountered no solitaires, although he had been assured that they survived.|$|E
5|$|Husbandry {{has a long}} history, {{starting}} with the Neolithic revolution when animals were first domesticated, from around 13,000 BC onwards, antedating farming of the first crops. By the time of early civilisations such as ancient Egypt, cattle, sheep, goats <b>and</b> <b>pigs</b> were being raised on farms. Major changes {{took place in the}} Columbian Exchange when Old World livestock were brought to the New World, and then in the British Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century, when livestock breeds like the Dishley Longhorn cattle and Lincoln Longwool sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists such as Robert Bakewell to yield more meat, milk, and wool. A wide range of other species such as horse, water buffalo, llama, rabbit and guinea pig are used as livestock {{in some parts of the}} world. Aquaculture of fish, molluscs, and crustaceans, and the keeping of bees and silkworms is widespread. Insects for human consumption are raised in several countries; for example, the production of crickets is a profitable industry in Thailand.|$|E
