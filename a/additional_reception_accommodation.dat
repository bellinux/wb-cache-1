30|$|Functionally, campization {{results in}} {{blurring}} the differentiation {{of the classic}} functions of European refugee accommodation: <b>Reception,</b> <b>accommodation,</b> and detention. Centre Sandholm and Centre Kongelunden, and some facilities in Berlin and Athens show a concentration of these functions in one place. Thus, an official registration and reception site {{may also be a}} place where long-term accommodation and deportation is conducted. An accommodation center that is set up to house asylum seekers during the application procedure may easily become a place of deportation. The concentration of multiple functions, however, is reflected in the functional segregation of the camps. In Centre Sandholm and Ellinko, for example, there are various sectors and zones that constitute spaces of first <b>reception,</b> long-term <b>accommodation,</b> and deportation within one camp. Furthermore, campizated accommodation tends to consist of its own infrastructures and the facilities for daily needs (such as schools, clinics, playgrounds, canteens, and wash houses). The cases of Berlin’s Motardstraße, Hovestaden’s Sandholm and Kongelunden, as well as the camps in Attica illustrate that different usages of space and daily routines are functionally segregated into various zones.|$|R

After an attempted relocation of asylum procedures in centres on the boundaries of the EU, in 2003 these policies have resulted in a proliferation of exile camps in and around the European Union, a pressure on neighbouring countries to develop systems that consider applications for asylum in their territories, and a radicalisation of antimigratory policies in neighbouring countries and within the border of the European Union.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) {{technique}} {{is well known}} in the field of wireless communications, and has recently been proposed to increase the capacity of in-home Power Line Communication (PLC) networks. MIMO PLC employs the Protective Earth in addition to the classical Line and Neutral wires, to form a multi-sensor transmission channel. By considering the <b>additional</b> <b>reception</b> of Common Mode signals, up to 2 simultaneous transmit ports and 4 receive ports can be considered. In order to develop new signal processing strategies optimally exploiting the MIMO propagation characteristics, and to evaluate their performance, accurate modeling of the transmission channel is necessary. This paper presents a comprehensive statistical model of the in-home MIMO PLC channel based on an extensive measurement data base collected in 6 European countries. The study first analyses the main MIMO PLC channel parameters, including path loss parameters and wideband parameters such as the delay spread, coherence bandwidth and small-scale statistics. A focus is then made on the MIMO correlation matrix, and its modelling using empirical statistical distributions. A fully parameterized channel model is then developed, with a particular emphasis on both the frequency fading structure of the transfer function and the correlation matrix between sub-channels. As a result, the proposed model generates random MIMO PLC channel realizations statistically representative of the experimental observations...|$|R

30|$|In the {{aftermath}} of large refugee arrivals in 2015, EU regulations and national asylum laws were tightened, especially those regarding <b>reception</b> and <b>accommodation.</b> The current contribution introduces the concept of “campization” to explain the impact of law and policy changes on the socio-spatial configuration and functions of refugee accommodation in European capital regions. Based on qualitative research concerning case studies for Athens, Berlin, and Copenhagen, I argue that refugee accommodation has increasingly been transformed into large, camp-like structures with lowered living standards and a closed character. This is shown by the structural, functional, and socio-spatial characteristics of the accommodation in the three case studies, {{as well as the}} political and administrative objectives that determine the campization of accommodation. The contribution lastly highlights changing notions and forms of containment, exclusion, and temporality as part of campization, and links this process to current trends in asylum and urban development.|$|R

40|$|The dual-process {{model of}} {{development}} regulation (Brandtstädter & Rothermund, 2002 a) proposes that accommodation (flexible goal adjustment) contributes to well-being and successful development.

Study 1 (training study; N = 79) investigates whether such a mindset can be induced by attentive-analytical music reception (simultaneously focusing various musical parameters). Two groups of students were trained to listen to music or view art in a complex way. Results showed group differences in the preferences for the stimuli presented. These preferences were correlated with accommodation. The findings from Study 2 (cross-sectional; N = 470) showed a significant relationship between attentive-analytical music <b>reception</b> and <b>accommodation.</b> Furthermore, the interplay between analytical and affective music reception seemed to play an important role in this process.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is study of feasibility of application of instrumental 100 Hz vibration of the thorax for rehabilitation of COPD patients. Materials and methods. This aim is achieved by clinical observation of 43 COPD patients of 1 st and 2 nd severity,  77. 4 % from which were patients with low risk of exacerbations. Research has been carried out during the stable period of disease. The following parameters have been analyzed: dynamics of the clinical state, spirometry data, clinical - biochemical indicators of blood reflecting presence of the inflammatory process activity, a number of indicators of immune system. Two groups of patients, which were equivalent in an initial state on age, disease severity, expressiveness of functional violations, have been isolated.

The 2 nd group contained 23 persons obtained in addition sea-buckthorn paste. Results. It has been revealed that the course of 100 Hz vibration impact on the thorax is accompanied, mainly, with positive subjective dynamics in the form of decrease of frequency and expressiveness of complaints.

30|$|Defining refugee {{accommodation}} is {{a struggle}} of interpretational sovereignty. Witteborn (2011, p. 1149) illustrates that “the practice of naming asylum heterotopias constructed the forced migrant as a discursive location.” Pieper (2008, p. 528) explains that labeling these spaces {{is a result of}} the political will of those who govern them and of their institutional character. Terms such as asylum center would downplay the objectives of these places and their living conditions. Refugee organizations and refugees themselves predominantly apply the term “refugee camp.” This is because, as Migreurop (2005) and the Alliance against Camps (2014) highlight in an interview, this term not only refers to closed centers with walls, barbed wire, and surveillance devices, but generally to premises that exclude refugees. “Open” sites such as accommodation centers may appear to be designed to provide assistance and shelter, but they have been set up to contain refugees without providing an option other than remaining there. I use the official terms such as <b>reception,</b> emergency, <b>accommodation</b> center, etc., when I refer to a specific case. I apply camp or the more broad term accommodation, when I generally refer to these sites to underline their camp-like characteristics.|$|R
