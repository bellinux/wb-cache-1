5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the correlation of tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E

5|$|Although {{multiple}} hypotheses {{exist on}} the origins of the horse in Finland, an indigenous wild horse origin is thought improbable, <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> numbers of domesticated horses were imported from earliest times. The Finnhorse is most likely descended from a northern European domestic horse. One theory suggests that horses arrived from the west, brought to what today is western Finland by the Vikings during the Viking Age, circa 800–1050 CE. These Viking horses would have been of northern European ancestry. The other main theory suggests that non-Viking peoples, who migrated into Finland from the southeast and south, brought with them horses of Mongolian origin that had been further developed in the Urals and Volga River regions. Both theories have merit, as there were two distinct horse types in the eastern and western regions of Finland that remained distinct from one another until at least the middle of the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Although not <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> as {{deforestation}} and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs {{and other}} species that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people.

Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E
5|$|Among the bishops, {{only two}} stood out <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> {{political}} figures, the more prominent {{of whom was}} Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury. Long a formidable presence in English public life, Winchelsey had led the struggle against Edward I to uphold {{the autonomy of the}} church, and for this he had paid with suspension and exile. One of Edward II’s first acts as king had been to reinstate Winchelsey, but rather than responding with grateful loyalty, the archbishop soon reassumed a leadership role in the fight against the king. Although he was trying to appease Winchelsey, the king carried an old grudge against another prelate, Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield. Edward had Langton dismissed from his position as treasurer of the Exchequer and had his temporal possessions confiscated. Langton had been an opponent of Winchelsey during the previous reign, but Edward II’s move against Langton drew the two Ordainers together.|$|E

5|$|Athens' local country {{scene has}} never been <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> as the profusion of indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock takes many {{elements}} from the folk, bluegrass and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers.

Recent bands such as The Broken String Band have emerged influenced by the folk rock genre. The rapper Bubba Sparxxx, originally from South Georgia, has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his Dirty South style of hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that the Normans conquered England in 1066, the town of Southampton {{occupied}} a rectangular area overlooking the mouth of the River Test, an important medieval waterway. It was protected by water on most sides and by protective ditches and banks to the north and east. Southampton at this time was a relatively large town, but not <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> as in the later medieval period. The Normans built a castle within the town on the site of a probable large English hall, and considerable damage was caused to the surrounding local buildings as space was opened up for the new fortification.|$|E

Extensive tree damage was also reported across the island, as well as structural damage to weaker buildings, such as barns and silos. The hurricane left portions of the island without power. The narrow path meant that damage was quite localized; little damage was reported in New Brunswick or western Prince Edward Island. Voting in the PEI general election on September29 was also disrupted, though more than 80% of voters made it to polling stations.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in the Yankees' minor-league system, Hughes {{was one of the most}} highly {{anticipated}} prospects in baseball, but his major league career has thus far been marked by inconsistency. He debuted in the major leagues in 2007 as a starting pitcher and quickly demonstrated his potential with a bid for a no-hitter in only his second MLB start. However, injury cut short his outing, as well <b>as</b> <b>significant</b> portions of his 2007 and 2008 seasons. Hughes began 2009 in the minors but later returned to the major leagues, eventually converting to a relief pitcher in June; pitching as a setup man for Mariano Rivera, Hughes excelled in the new role during the regular season. Despite his struggles in the postseason, Hughes won a championship with the Yankees in the 2009 World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E

5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not <b>as</b> <b>significant.</b> Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E
