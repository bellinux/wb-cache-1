5|$|He was {{introduced}} to complex flamenco techniques by Spanish guitarist Paco de Lucía when the two shared <b>a</b> <b>loft</b> and performed together for the jet set in New York City in the early 1970s. In 1982, Laucke was selected by Andrés Segovia to perform for the PBS network at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. He became Segovia's pupil, and studied with other classical guitar players including Julian Bream and Alirio Díaz. Laucke performed mainly on classical guitar until 1990, {{and from then on}} his concerts consisted solely of flamenco and new flamenco.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, William Baziotes, David Hare, Robert Motherwell and Mark Rothko {{founded the}} Subjects of the Artist School, which held artists' discussions in <b>a</b> <b>loft</b> at 35 East Eighth Street, Manhattan {{which came to}} be known as Studio 35. A closed panel {{symposium}} took place from April 21 to 23, 1950. It was organised by Robert Goodnough and moderated by Richard Lippold, Robert Motherwell and Alfred H. Barr, Jr. director of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). The purpose was the framing of an art movement.|$|E

50|$|A {{turning point}} came just before half-time when Rabbitohs second rower Bob McCarthy swooped on <b>a</b> <b>lofted</b> pass from Canterbury's Col Brown {{intended}} for Johnny Greaves {{and ran the}} length of the field to take Souths into the break with a 10-8 lead.|$|R
5|$|The north-west corner {{tower is}} 14 feet by 10 feet 6 inches (4.3 by 3.20 m) across on the inside, with an {{entrance}} {{door on the}} east side, and originally had <b>a</b> <b>loft</b> floor. It remains uncertain {{if there was a}} second corner tower built in the south-east corner of the castle complex; excavations in 1978 in one possible location failed to find any traces, and a geophysical survey in 1998 proved inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Bedsitcom {{documented}} {{the lives of}} six young adults living in <b>a</b> <b>loft</b> flat in London. Eight episodes in total were created, which {{were divided into two}} distinct halves. The first four episodes centred on the lives of Mel, Paul and Rufus, the three actors, as they lived in the flat with Bob, Dave and Shirine, the three unaware members of the public who believed they were taking part in a genuine reality TV show. After Bob, Dave and Shirine had learnt {{the true nature of the}} show at the end of episode four, they moved out and were replaced by three new members of the public named Barrington, David and Jessica. These three new cast members remained on Bedsitcom for the final four episodes.|$|E
5|$|The east bay of {{the barn}} {{contains}} an animal stall in its northeast corner and a fully enclosed office in its opposite corner. The second-floor hayloft {{is supported by the}} two massive transverse beams. The full-sized loft is accessible via an enclosed staircase against the south wall. The building's exterior roof is fully supported by the brick walls. The result is <b>a</b> <b>loft</b> which is an entirely open space save for some pole and beam construction supporting the laminated beams, which act as tie rods {{at the base of the}} roof. The barn roof is a common gable roof pitched at a 45degree angle, it was originally covered with wooden shingles, those have been replaced over the years with asphalt.|$|E
5000|$|A bunker shot is a shot played from a sand trap. It is {{hit with}} <b>a</b> <b>lofted</b> wedge and is {{intended}} {{to hit the ball}} high so that it can carry over the lip of the bunker while still staying on the green.|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the kinematics of sports skills with the majority describing the kinematics of the technique or investigating significant kinematic variables that affect performance. Many sports skills are complex three-dimensional movements involving many joints. However, few studies {{have investigated the}} relationships between kinematic variables during performance of such skills. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the inter- relationships among three-dimensional kinematic variables during performance of <b>a</b> <b>lofted</b> instep soccer kick. A motion analysis system was used to collect kinematic data for 13 skilled amateur soccer players attempting <b>a</b> standardised <b>lofted</b> instep kick. Three-dimensional angular displacement patterns were reported for the thoracolumbar spine and right hip joints. Two-dimensional angular displacement data was reported for the right knee and ankle joints. An exploratory rather than confirmatory factor analysis was applied, as there is currently no established theory regarding the kinematics of <b>a</b> <b>lofted</b> instep kick. Factors were extracted using the Maximum Likelihood Solution and orthogonally rotated using Varimax with Kaiser normalisation. The inter-relationship among biomechanical variables within the seven extracted factors was analysed with each factor revealing previously unknown inter-relationships among variables for different aspects of the kick. The use of exploratory factor analysis has shown the complex three-dimensional kinematic inter-relationships for <b>a</b> <b>lofted</b> instep kick. An understanding of these relationships could prove useful to coaches when instructing, and in the development of coaching programmes related to the lofted instep kic...|$|R

5|$|Another of Gaudí's major {{projects}} and among his most admired works is the Casa Milà, {{better known as}} La Pedrera (1906–1910), commissioned by Pere Milà i Camps. Gaudí designed the house around two large, curved courtyards, with a structure of stone, brick and cast-iron columns and steel beams. The facade is built of limestone from Vilafranca del Penedès, apart from the upper level, which is covered in white tiles, evoking a snowy mountain. It has {{a total of five}} floors, plus <b>a</b> <b>loft</b> made entirely of catenary arches, as well as two large interior courtyards, one circular and one oval. Notable features are the staircases to the roof, topped with the four-armed cross, and the chimneys, covered in ceramics and with shapes that suggest mediaeval helmets. The interior decoration was carried out by Josep Maria Jujol and the painters Iu Pascual, Xavier Nogués and Aleix Clapés. The facade was to have been completed with a stone, metal and glass sculpture with Our lady of the Rosary accompanied by the archangels Michael and Gabriel, 4m in height. A sketch was made by the sculptor Carles Mani, but due to the events of the Tragic Week in 1909 the project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In Season 4, Kurt joins Rachel in New York {{after she}} reveals {{that she is}} unhappy with her roommate and life at that point. After the {{encouragement}} of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds <b>a</b> <b>loft</b> in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and his editor, Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, she leans on his support, and then quickly returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. <b>A</b> <b>loft</b> in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E

5|$|St Anne's Church, Hindsford was {{originally}} a mission occupying a barn which was replaced in 1901 by a church designed by Austin and Paley on Tyldesley Road. It {{has since been}} converted to residential use. St Michael and All Angels at Howe Bridge was built in 1877. There are chapels of the Wesleyan, Baptist, Independent Methodist, and Primitive Methodist denominations; a Congregational church at Howe Bridge was opened in 1904. Roman Catholics celebrated mass in <b>a</b> <b>loft</b> behind the Star and Garter public house on Tyldesley Square until Sacred Heart Church opened in Hindsford in 1869. The site was given by Lord Lilford with building materials donated by John Holland, manager of Yew Tree Colliery in Tyldesley. It served the growing Catholic population in Hindsford and Tyldesley. Sacred Heart closed in 2004 and its parish together with those of St Richard's in Mayfield Street which opened in 1928, Holy Family in Boothstown, St Ambrose Barlow in Astley, St Gabriel's, Higher Folds in Leigh are now united as a single community with St Margaret Clitherow as its patron.|$|E

25|$|The 6th Laird was {{involved}} in quarrying and limestone-burning, hence {{the need for a}} stable with room for three horses and loose box, with <b>a</b> <b>loft</b> above. Various modifications took place over the years and a Dutch barn was built in 1949. Dairying ceased in 1980 and the farm turned to raising beef cattle until 1992 when the National Trust for Scotland took over the running of the farm operations.|$|E

50|$|Present in some golfers' bags is the chipper, a club {{designed}} {{to feel like}} a putter but with <b>a</b> more <b>lofted</b> face, used with a putting motion to lift the ball out of the higher grass of the rough and fringe and drop it on the green, where it will then roll like a putt. This club replaces the use of a high-lofted iron to make the same shot, and allows the player to make the shot from a stance and with a motion nearly identical to a putt, which is more difficult with <b>a</b> <b>lofted</b> iron due to a difference in lie angle.|$|R

The Young Master went on to beat previous box office records set by Bruce Lee and established Chan as Hong Kong cinema's top star. With Dragon Lord, he began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences, including the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off <b>a</b> <b>loft</b> and falls to the lower ground.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Mauro Pezzente {{moved into}} <b>a</b> <b>loft</b> with his then-girlfriend in the Mile End of Montreal. Pezzente used the {{flat as a}} {{performance}} venue, dubbing it the Gallery Quiva. Around 1996, fumes from the mechanic's garage below the loft forced them to vacate it. Shortly after their departure, Efrim Menuck moved into the space and established Hotel2Tango, serving both as a recording studio and practice space. There, in 1997, the original recording of F♯ A♯ ∞ took place. By this time, the band had reached an unwieldy 15 members. In preparation of the album, they trimmed their numbers to ten.|$|E
