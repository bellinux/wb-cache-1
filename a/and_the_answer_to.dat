In his single review for Melody Maker, Nick Jones wrote: [...] "Superficially it's a very 'ordinary' Beatles record without cascading sitars, and the involved, weaving hallucinogenic sounds that we've grown to love so much. However, all the Beatles soul and feeling is shining through..."

His friend Ford Prefect informs him that the planet {{is about to be}} demolished by a Vogon constructor fleet [...] "to make way for a hyperspace bypass", and that Ford is in fact an alien writer for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a pan-galactic encyclopedia and travel guide. Hitching a ride aboard the Vogon ship which has just destroyed Earth, the pair find themselves aboard a stolen spaceship, The Heart of Gold. On board is Ford's semi-cousin and President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox; a woman Dent met at a party, Trisha [...] "Trillian" [...] MacMillan; and a depressed robot, Marvin. Beeblebrox is searching for the mythical planet of Magrathea <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the [...] "Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything", which it turns out is [...] "42". Dent and the others find themselves at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, then held captive aboard a Golgafrincham ship about to crash-land on prehistoric Earth.|$|E

You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns {{its place in the}} movie time capsule." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, [...] "For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive." [...] Richard Corliss of Time who was very critical in 1997 remained in the same mood, [...] "I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged." [...] In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the [...] "careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels." [...] Ann Hornaday for The Washington Post found herself asking [...] "whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> that is: They aren't." [...] She further added that the [...] "3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Keown, it is {{possible}} to reinterpret the Buddhist doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths, since the final goal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the problem of suffering is nirvana, and not rebirth. Some Western interpreters have proposed what is sometimes referred to as [...] "naturalized Buddhism". It is devoid of rebirth, karma, nirvana, realms of existence, and other concepts of Buddhism, with doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths reformulated and restated in modernistic terms. This [...] "deflated secular Buddhism" [...] stresses compassion, impermanence, causality, selfless persons, no Boddhisattvas, no nirvana, no rebirth, and a naturalists approach to well-being of oneself and others.|$|E

G. Wells, who said, 'It is not much good thinking of a thing unless you think it out.' It is not to deny that American officialism is rather peculiar on this point, but to inquire what it really is which makes America peculiar, or which is peculiar to America. In short, it is to get some ultimate idea of what America is; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> that question will reveal something much deeper and grander and more worthy of our intelligent interest.|$|E

Her thoughts wandered back along the night track she had traversed, until again her ears were haunted by that strange sound which had given Roaring City its name. She had been torn away from hope, love, almost life itself. Where was Neale? He had turned from her, obedient to Allison Lee and the fatal complexity and perversenes's of life. The vindication of her spiritual faith <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> her prayers lay {{in the fact that}} she had been saved; but rather than to be here in this car, daughter of a rich father, but separated from Neale, she would have preferred to fill one of the nameless graves in Benton.|$|E

The Person selling was Ahab, of whom the Text says expresly, there was none like him, who did sell himself to work Wickedness in the Sight of the LORD, 1 Kings xxi. 20, and the 25. I think it might have been rendred, if not {{translated}} in Spight of the Lord, or in Defiance of God; for certainly that's the Meaning of it; and now allowing me to preach a little upon this Text, my Sermon shall be very short. Ahab sold himself, who did he sell himself to?

6000|$|... 134. Farther. A {{great deal}} of the vulgarity, and nearly all the vice, of retail commerce, {{involving}} the degradation of persons occupied in it, depends simply on the fact that their minds are always occupied by the vital (or rather mortal) question of profits. I should at once {{put an end to this}} source of baseness by making all retail dealers merely salaried officers in the employ of the trade guilds; the stewards, that is to say, of the salable properties of those guilds, and purveyors of such and such articles to a given number of families. A perfectly well-educated person might, without the least degradation, hold such an office as this, however poorly paid; and it would be precisely the fact of his being well educated which would enable him to fulfil his duties to the public without the stimulus of direct profit. Of course the current objection to such a system would be that no man, for a regularly paid salary, would take pains to please his customers; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> that objection is, that if you can train a man to so much unselfishness as to offer himself fearlessly to the chance of being shot, in the course of his daily duty, you can most assuredly, if you make it also a point of honor with him, train him to the amount of self-denial involved in looking you out with care such a piece of cheese or bacon as you have asked for.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Fenwick {{in making}} for himself his hair shirt {{did not think}} it {{necessary}} to abstain from writing to the Marquis of Trowbridge. This he did on that same day after his return from Salisbury. In the middle of the winter he had written a letter to the Marquis, remonstrating against the building of the chapel opposite to his own gate. He now took out his copy of that letter, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> it, in which the agent of the Marquis had told him that the Marquis considered that the spot in question was the most eligible site which his lordship could bestow for the purpose in question. Our Vicar was very anxious not to disturb the chapel now that it was built; but he was quite as anxious to disturb the Marquis. In the formation of that hair shirt which he was minded to wear, he did not intend to weave in any mercy towards the Marquis. It behoved him to punish the Marquis,--for the good of society in general. As a trespasser he forgave the Marquis, in a Christian point of view; but as a pestilent wasp on the earth, stinging folks right and left with an arrogance, the ignorance of which was the only excuse to be made for his cruelty, he thought it to be his duty to set his heel upon the Marquis; which he did by writing the following letter.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried {{with the aim}} of {{determining}} what are the dancer's typical feelings and attitudes when dancing on stage. This was related to the dancer's personality traits and qualities of artistic performance. The research was carried among Portuguese dancers, comparing a group of professionals (n = 29), a group of semi-professionals (n = 14), and a group of amateurs (n = 30), all with performing experience in modern dance. With the purpose of comparison, a fourth group was studied with experience in popular dance (n = 13). A questionnaire (QEDC) about the experience of dancing on stage was created, based on literature, previous interviews with dancers, and personal experience as dancer <b>and</b> choreographer. <b>The</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> questionnaire were analysed, permitting to establish the profiles of each of the groups. A comparison was made using the Fisher exact probability test to each item of the QEDC, to find out where the groups differentiated. For the second part of <b>the</b> study <b>and</b> adaptation of Thill's Q. P. S. and Alfermann's personality tests to both amateur and semi-professional modern dancers was applied, to find the correlations between personality traits <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> QEDC.
