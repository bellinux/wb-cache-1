40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the presence of Default Mode Network (DMN) modifications in Fabry Disease (FD), and their possible correlations with structural alterations and neuropsychological scores. Thirty-two FD patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of classical FD (12 males, mean age 43. 3 [*]±[*] 12. 2) were enrolled, along with 35 healthy controls (HC) of comparable age and sex (14 males, mean age 42. 1 [*]±[*] 14. 5). Resting-State fMRI data were analyzed using a seed-based approach, with six different seeds sampling the main hubs of the DMN. Structural modifications were assessed by means of Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analyses. Between-group differences and correlations with neuropsychological variables were probed voxelwise over the whole brain. Possible correlations between FC modifications and global measures of microstructural alteration were also tested in FD patients with a partial correlation analysis. In the FD group, clusters of increased functional connectivity involving both supratentorial and infratentorial regions emerged, partially correlated to the widespread white matter (WM) damage found in these patients. No gray matter volume differences were found <b>at</b> <b>VBM</b> between the two groups. The connectivity between right inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus was significantly correlated with the Corsi block-tapping test results (p[*]=[*]. 0001). Widespread DMN changes are present in FD patients that correlate with WM alterations and cognitive performance. Our results confirm the current view of a cerebral involvement in FD patients not simply associated to major cerebrovascular events, but also related to significant and diffuse microstructural and functional changes...|$|E
40|$|Adsorption {{of ammonia}} at NH 3 /NH 2 /H covered GaN(0001) surface was {{analyzed}} using results of ab initio calculations. The whole configuration space of partially NH 3 /NH 2 /H covered GaN(0001) surface {{was divided into}} zones differently pinned Fermi level: at Ga broken bond state for dominantly bare surface (region I), <b>at</b> <b>VBM</b> for NH 2 and H covered (region II), and at CBM for NH 3 covered surface (region III). The extensive ab intio calculations show validity of electron counting rule (ECR) for all mixed coverage, for bordering these three regions. The adsorption was analyzed using newly identified dependence of the adsorption energy on the charge transfer at the surface. For region I and II ammonia adsorb dissociatively, disintegrating into H adatom and HN 2 radical for large fraction of vacant sites while for high coverage the ammonia adsorption is molecular. The dissociative adsorption energy strongly depends on the Fermi level at the surface (pinned) and in the bulk (unpinned) while the molecular adsorption energy is determined by bonding to surface only, in accordance to the recently published theory. The molecular adsorption {{is determined by the}} energy of covalent bonding to the surface. Ammonia adsorption in region III (Fermi level pinned at CBM) leads to unstable configuration both molecular and dissociative which is {{explained by the fact that}} Ga-broken bond sites are doubly occupied by electrons. The adsorbing ammonia brings 8 electrons to the surface, necessitating transfer of the electrons from Ga-broken bond state to Fermi level, energetically costly process. Adsorption of ammonia at H-covered site leads to creation of NH 2 radical at the surface and escape of H 2 molecule. The process energy is close to 0. 12 eV, thus not large, but the inverse process is not possible due to escape of the hydrogen molecule. Comment: 37 pages, 14 figure...|$|E

Here we present an experimental study of epitaxial Te deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate by molecular-beam epitaxy. Scanning tunneling microscopy of ultrathin layers of Te reveals rectangular surface cells with the cell size consistent with the theoretically predicted beta-tellurene, whereas for thicker films, the cell size is more consistent {{with that of the}} (10 - 10) surface of bulk Te crystal. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show the films are semiconductors with the energy bandgaps decreasing with increasing film thickness, and the gap narrowing occurs predominantly at the valance-band maximum (VBM).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Findings of {{standard}} MR imaging examinations are usually normal in primary CD. These findings are now increasingly challenged by studies using advanced neuroimaging techniques detecting abnormalities in brain areas {{that may be}} functionally involved in the pathophysiology of CD. Our purpose was to evaluate GM volumes in patients with CD at baseline and 5 years later. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 19 patients (F/M = 15 : 4, mean age = 53. 2 + 11. 2 years), 12 of whom were studied at baseline and again approximately 5 years later. Twenty-eight healthy volunteers acted as controls (F/M = 17 : 11, mean age = 47. 5 + 15. 6 years). The subjects were imaged with a 1. 5 T scanner by using a 3 D T 1 -weighted sequence on 150 contiguous axial 1 -mm-thick sections to apply <b>VBM.</b> RESULTS: <b>At</b> entry, <b>VBM</b> analysis disclosed significantly lower GM volumes in the left caudate head and putamen and in the premotor and primary sensorimotor cortices bilaterally in patients than in controls. No correlation was found between decreased GM volumes and patient age, severity of dystonia, or disease duration. At the 5 -year follow-up, GM volumes in the left primary sensorimotor cortex in patients had decreased significantly from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The findings obtained at entry and after a 5 -year follow-up consistently showed decreased caudate, putamen, and sensorimotor cortex GM volumes in patients with CD, and they probably play a pathophysiologic role in CD...|$|R
40|$|Boron {{arsenide}}, the typically-ignored {{member of}} the III–V arsenide series BAs–AlAs–GaAs– InAs is found to resemble silicon electronically: its Γ conduction band minimum is p-like (Γ 15), not s-like (Γ 1 c), it has an X 1 c-like indirect band gap, and its bond charge is distributed almost equally on the two atoms in the unit cell, exhibiting nearly perfect covalency. The reasons for these are tracked down to the anomalously low atomic p orbital energy in the boron and to the unusually strong s–s repulsion in BAs relative to most other III–V compounds. We find unexpected valence band offsets of BAs with respect to GaAs and AlAs. The valence band maximum (VBM) of BAs is significantly {{higher than that of}} AlAs, despite the much smaller bond length of BAs, and the VBM of GaAs is only slightly higher than in BAs. These effects result from the unusually strong mixing of the cation and anion states <b>at</b> the <b>VBM.</b> For the BAs–GaAs alloys, we find (i) a relatively small (∼ 3. 5 eV) and composition-independent band gap bowing. This means that while addition of small amounts of nitrogen to GaAs lowers the gap, addition of small amounts of boron to GaAs raises the gap (ii) boron “semi-localized” states in the conduction band (similar to those in GaN–GaAs alloys), and (iii) bulk mixing enthalpies which are smaller than in GaN–GaAs alloys. The unique features of boride III–V alloys offer new opportunities in band gap engineering. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{succession}} to {{the first}} paper (arXiv 1406. 6204 v 5), the impurity-atom concentrations when the Fermi levels are either at the valence band maximum (VBM) or the conduction band minimum (CBM) were identified for diamond, cubic boron nitride (cBN), and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) scheme using the local density approximation (LDA). In the present paper, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used instead of the LDA for exchange-correlation. The impurity atoms were B and N for diamond, Be, Si, and C for cBN, and Be for hBN; these impurity atoms were known in the first paper to form degenerate states by increased impurity-atom concentrations. The impurity-atom concentrations when the Fermi level was located either <b>at</b> the <b>VBM</b> or the CBM were as follows: (i) the B concentration was 0. 27 at. % in B-doped diamond, (ii) the N concentration was 0. 25 at. % in N-doped diamond, (iii) the concentration of Be substituting B was 0. 88 at. % in cBN, (iv) the concentration of Si substituting B was 0. 06 at. % in cBN, (v) the concentration of C substituting B was 0. 07 at. % in cBN, (vi) the concentration of C substituting N was 0. 88 at. % in cBN, and (vii) the concentration of Be substituting B was 1. 80 at. % in hBN. The values of (iv) and (v) were significantly smaller than the corresponding values in paper I, but it was attributed to the input parameters {{used in the present}} paper, hence it was concluded that the computed concentrations were not sensitive to the GGA used.

Electrons and holes are confined in wells and repelled from barriers much like in “a particle in a box”: as the well narrows, the kinetic energy of the confined particle rises.

40|$|GaN {{and related}} nitride {{compounds}} have found many applications in optoelectronic devices. Point defects introduce energy levels into the band gap and alter the electrical and optical properties of GaN. Previous studies focussed on studying point defects with density functional theory (DFT), periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and relatively inaccurate LDA energy functionals. We aim {{to improve on}} the defi�ciencies of this method by implementing a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) scheme, which has been specifically designed {{for the study of}} point defects; we use a hybrid functional and a formal charge scheme for the MM model. We o�ffer an explanation for why p-type doping is difficult to achieve in GaN; the exothermic formation energies of the Ga interstitial and N vacancy <b>at</b> the <b>VBM</b> are thought to be the main cause. We suggest that the processes responsible for a variety of DLTS signals between 0. 18 - 0. 67 eV below the CBM may be due to Ga interstitial 3 +/ 2 +, 2 +/ 1 + transitions, N interstitials (1 +/ 0) and Ga vacancies (2 -/ 1 -, 3 -/ 2 -). We attribute the ODMR signal indicating a deep donor state 0. 7 eV below the conduction band to the N interstitial 0 / 1 - transition. Finally, our results support previous suggestions that Ga vacancies may be the cause of yellow luminescence in GaN. Further refi�nements of the model, especially improving the basis set, are recommended in the future, as well as a more detailed investigation into the causes of discrepancy between our model and PBC calculations. We use the MM model to study the properties of ternary alloys of AlN, GaN and InN, and to �find their thermodynamically stable con�figurations. Our results are in good agreement with PBC DFT calculations. These structures are not observed experimentally; we suggest that this is a growth phenomenon.

It {{should also be noted}} that a 45 ° rotation exists between the coordinate axes of the 110 X nanonets and the 100 X nanonets, which lead to the difference of the special points shown in the band structure. The motion of CBM appears in the GZ path. When the porosity is lower than 30 %, the CBM stays at 1 / 6 GZ or 1 / 3 GZ (Fig. 2 f). However, when the porosity increases to 39 %, the CBM move from 1 / 6 GZ or 1 / 3 GZ to G (Fig. 2 g). As the <b>VBM</b> always stays <b>at</b> X, the 110 X nanonets exhibit indirect band gap in various porosities we study. The 110 D nanonets can be treated as the 100 X nanonets with the pore side orientation rotates a degree of 45 °. Similar to the 110 X nanonets, the 110 D nanonets with different porosities in our study present indirect band gap with the CBM at point X and the <b>VBM</b> <b>at</b> point M (Fig. 2 h).

40|$|Mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) may represent {{an early stage}} of dementia conferring a particularly high annual risk of 15 - 20 % of conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent findings suggest that not only gray matter (GM) loss but also a decline in white matter (WM) integrity may be associated with imminent conversion from MCI to AD. In this study we used Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to examine if gray matter loss and/or an increase of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) reflecting mean diffusivity (MD) are an early marker of conversion from MCI to AD in a high risk population. Retrospective neuropsychological and clinical data were collected for fifty-five subjects (MCI converters n =  13, MCI non-converters n =  14, healthy controls n =  28) at baseline and one follow-up visit. All participants underwent diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and T 1 -weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline to analyse changes in GM density and WM integrity using <b>VBM.</b> <b>At</b> baseline MCI converters showed impaired performance in verbal memory and naming compared to MCI non-converters. Further, MCI converters showed decreased WM integrity in the frontal, parietal, occipital, as well as the temporal lobe prior to conversion to AD.

Our results suggest that additionally to morphological changes of GM a reduced integrity of WM indicates an imminent progression from MCI stage to AD.

40|$|As {{outlined}} in various chapters throughout this book, a {{successful implementation of}} photoelectrochemical hydrogen production using sunlight PEC requires significant material science breakthroughs. A material needs to be found that simultaneously fulfils several requirements, among them an optimized bulk bandgap for efficient utilization of the incoming solar photon flux and its spectral distribution, an optimized electronic structure at the interface between the material and the surrounding electrolyte, and a sufficient chemical stability lifetime of the material under the conditions of a very high or a very low pH value in the electrolyte. While no single such material is in hand today, significant advances have been made {{with a variety of}} materials that fulfill {{at least one of these}} requirements, as {{outlined in}} this book. How can the search for the optimal holy grail material be facilitated? Ultimately, of course, a PEC candidate material will be judged by its ability to split water and to produce hydrogen in a cost effective way. To reach this goal, however, individual properties of particular materials need to be understood and optimized, and, in particular, fundamental barriers in one or more of the requirements need to be identified. It is thus crucially important to be able to characterize candidate materials with respect to each material requirement individually, that is, independent of the other requirements. It is the purpose of this chapter to demonstrate how soft X ray and electron based spectroscopic methods are a powerful and evolving tool chest to do just that to focus on a specific materials requirement and to collect information about the fundamental properties of a candidate material that are of direct relevance to the ultimate performance in a PEC cell. We will focus on two particular requirements the understanding of the electronic structure of the material surface and, ultimately, its interface with the electrolyte, as well as the chemical structure relevant for chemical stability, by discussing two examples. The first example is based on the need of a PEC material to exhibit suitable positions of the conduction band minimum CBM at the surface of the hydrogen electrode and of the valence band maximum <b>VBM</b> <b>at</b> the surface of the oxygen electrode, respectively. A detailed knowledge of these levels is of large importance for the choice and optimization of an electrode material. However, a direct determination of these levels especially at the surface of the material is not straightforward. In most studies related to this topic, one of the energy levels the VBM for p type systems or the CBM for n type systems is determined by electrochemical methods. These techniques require specific sets of assumptions about the possibility of achieving flat band conditions, and the position of the other band edge i. e., the CBM for p type systems or the VBM for n type systems is generally inferred from optically determined bulk bandgaps. However, in general, electronic bandgaps and band edge positions at the surface of compound semiconductors and thus also at the interface with the electrolyte are different from optical bulk gaps and bulk band edge positions see, for example, [1 3] for respective studies on chalcopyrite compound semiconductors. For a correct description it is thus necessary to measure band edge positions and gaps directly with surface sensitive techniques. This will be demonstrated in Section 6. 3. In terms of chemical stability, in particular of a multicomponent material system, a detailed understanding of the chemical composition at and near the surface is crucial. With such understanding, chemical changes during operation or, as in our case, air exposure can be monitored precisely, giving detailed insight into the fundamental chemical behavior of a PEC candidate material. Of particular interest is the ability to derive bond specific composition information, that is, no...|$|R
