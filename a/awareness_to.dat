5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the novel {{to bring more}} public <b>awareness</b> <b>to</b> the experience of war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses {{on the way in}} which the experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} aims {{to answer a}} {{recently}} raised controversy regarding the role that morphological <b>awareness</b> has <b>to</b> reading skills acquisition in Brazilian Portuguese. The aim was to investigate whether morphological <b>awareness</b> contributes <b>to</b> reading after controlling for non-verbal intelligence and phonological awareness in Brazilian Portuguese variables. The study included 52 elementary school students enrolled {{in a public school}} in the municipality of São Gonçalo, state of Rio de Janeiro. The hierarchical regression analyses showed that derivational morphological <b>awareness</b> contributes <b>to</b> reading independently of phonological processing and non-verbal ability. The results {{of this study indicate that}} morphological <b>awareness</b> contributes <b>to</b> reading words but not to reading comprehension. The results of this study corroborate with the hypothesis that even in an alphabetic language, such as Portuguese, morphological <b>awareness</b> is important <b>to</b> reading acquisition...|$|R

5|$|The first likely {{description}} of the disease was in 1841 by Charles Oscar Waters. The condition was described in further detail in 1872 by George Huntington, after whom it is named. The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort led by the Hereditary Disease Foundation. Research and support organizations began forming in the late 1960s to increase public <b>awareness,</b> <b>to</b> provide support for individuals and their families, and to promote research. Current research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease, improving animal models to aid with research, testing of medications to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease, and studying procedures such as stem cell therapy {{with the goal of}} repairing damage caused by the disease.|$|E

The decision came {{three days after the}} United States began conducting air attacks against the Islamic State. Tornados were pre-positioned to use their surveillance capabilities to gather situational <b>awareness</b> <b>to</b> help with humanitarian efforts. On 29 September 2014, three days after Parliament approved of airstrikes against Islamic State forces inside Iraq, two Tornados conducted their first armed reconnaissance mission over the country, in conjunction with other coalition aircraft, and were cleared to conduct airstrikes if needed. Britain's first airstrike was conducted the next day, when two Tornados hit a heavy weapons post and an armored vehicle in the process of supporting Kurdish forces in northwest Iraq. By 1 March 2015, eight RAF Tornados had been deployed to Akrotiri and conducted 159 airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq.|$|E
