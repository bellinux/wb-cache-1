5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career as <b>a</b> <b>writer.</b> He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so.

There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live as <b>a</b> <b>writer,</b> Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E
