2500|$|Third, in {{the realm}} of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and {{arguments}} whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce [...] "No quadrangle that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> square <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rectangle that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rhombus" [...] from [...] "No square that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> quadrangle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rhombus that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rectangle" [...] or from [...] "No rhombus that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rectangle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> square that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> quadrangle".|$|R
2500|$|Each part <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{categorical}} proposition, {{and each}} categorical proposition [...] contains two categorical terms.

[...] "All <b>A</b> <b>are</b> B," [...] and [...] "No <b>A</b> <b>are</b> B" [...] are termed universal propositions; [...] "Some <b>A</b> <b>are</b> B" [...] and [...] "Some <b>A</b> <b>are</b> not B" [...] are termed particular propositions. [...] More modern logicians allow some variation. Each of the premises has one term in common with the conclusion: in a major premise, this is the major term (i.e., the predicate of the conclusion); in a minor premise, this is the minor term (i.e., the subject of the conclusion).
