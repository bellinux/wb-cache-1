5|$|Sigmund Freud {{may have}} been among the first to stress the {{potential}} effect of loss of the mother on the developing child, but his concern was less with the actual experience of maternal care than with the anxiety the child might feel <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the nourishing breast. As little of Freud's theory was based on actual observations of infants, little effort was made to consider the effects of real experiences of loss.|$|E

News articles on 24 August in both The New York Times and the Chicago Daily Tribune reported the loss of West Bridge, and the mistaken information also made it into book form. Authors Benedict Crowell and Robert Forrest Wilson, in their work The Road to France: The Transportation of Troops and Military Supplies, 1917–1918, repeat the misinformation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> West Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Violence in Kentucky {{increased}} with {{the outbreak of}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Native Americans who were unhappy <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky in treaties saw the war as a chance to drive out the colonists. Isolated settlers and hunters became the frequent target of attacks, convincing many to abandon Kentucky. By late spring of 1776, fewer than 200 colonists remained in Kentucky, primarily at the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and Logan's Station.|$|E

Realizing the truth of this, Calloway surrenders.|$|E

She became mute, {{and suffered}} from {{other health problems}} prior to her death on October 27, 1945, {{at the age of}} 61. At the time of her death, Palsgraf was living in Richmond Hill, Queens with her daughter Elizabeth. Her former attorney, Wood, maintained a law office in the Woolworth Building until his death in 1972 at age 96. His opposing trial counsel, McNamara, remained with the LIRR's legal department until his retirement in 1959, while McNamara's superior and counsel of record, Keany, continued as the railroad's general solicitor until he died in 1935. Justice Humphrey retired in 1936, a year after he gained notoriety for presiding over the marriage of heiress Doris Duke; he died in 1940. Andrews retired at the end of 1928, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 70; he died in 1936. Cardozo was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1932 by President Herbert Hoover and served there until his death in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{occurred during}} World War II, with activity from a German U-boat {{expected in the}} Gulf of Mexico. As a result, ship reports were silenced. At the time, the Weather Bureau relied primarily on ship and land weather station observations for issue storm warnings. Additionally, advisories had to be cleared through the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans, Louisiana, causing them to be released hours late; moreover the advisories contained no forecast information, which would have allowed for preparation before the storm struck. The news media after the hurricane was heavily censored by the government due to national security, as information could not be leaked to the Axis powers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> production of war materials. Reportedly, the Federal Bureau of Investigation shut down a telegraph office in La Porte after a telegram was sent containing information about damage from the hurricane. The only news of this storm was published in Texas and Louisiana. After {{the loss of life}} in this storm, the Government of the United States has never censored hurricane advisories again.|$|E

5|$|While Shekhar {{is off to}} Darjeeling on a {{business}} trip, Naveen Roy violently thunders at Lalita <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> his hotel project, embarrassing and humiliating her. Roy gets a wall built between his and Gurcharan’s house symbolising {{the end of their}} association. Gurcharan, unable to digest this, suffers a heart attack. Upon Shekhar’s return, Roy informs him of the ill-health of his mother and Gurcharan and viciously adds a note of Lalita and Girish’s marriage. Shekhar is disgusted to hear of the marriage and in his anger he scowls at Lalita, humiliating her like his father. Meanwhile, Girish assists Gurcharan's family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the family’s return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lalita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri. The film returns to the night of Shekhar’s marriage when Girish hands him the ownership papers of Gurcharan’s haveli. He shocks Shekhar by telling him that he got married to Koel because Lalita denied his marriage proposal. As a conclusion, Shekhar confronts his father and symbolically breaks down the wall separating the two families. He then brings Lalita to his home as his bride much to the delight of his mother.|$|E

50|$|Nothing {{is known}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Turkish army. Frankish losses were {{probably}} light. In the spring, Bursuq's army was probably {{larger than the}} army of Roger and his Syrian allies. The Turkish general withdrew {{in the face of}} Baldwin's advance, indicating that the King of Jerusalem may have achieved superiority in numbers, or at least parity. Bursuq's army may have dwindled as the campaign dragged on, since it is known that some of the emirs were upset with his division of the spoils. Roger mustered 2,000 in the spring, but, without support from his recent Christian and Muslim allies, he may have called up a larger army for his fall campaign, perhaps 3,000 men.|$|R

Larbert's new closeness to surrounding communities raised concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> village independence.

25|$|After {{hearing about}} the fate of Knin, the {{citizens}} of nearby Skradin fled and left the town undefended, so it was easily taken by the Ottomans. Next day Drniš also fell into Ottoman hands. Ivan Karlović was at the time located in Topusko, so information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> Knin and Skradin arrived with a considerable delay. After conquering Knin the Ottomans moved towards Klis, another important fortress in Croatia. However, the fortress garrison was strong enough to repel the attacks of Husrev-bey's men, who had to break the siege and withdraw his forces. Croatian border captains expected that the Ottomans will try to compensate their failure under Klis by attacking the less defended towns of Udbina, Bihać and coastal cities.|$|E
