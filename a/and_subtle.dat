5|$|Directors include Homicide alumnus Clark Johnson, who {{directed}} several acclaimed episodes of The Shield, and Tim Van Patten, a Primetime Emmy Award winner {{who has worked}} on every season of The Sopranos. The directing has been praised for its uncomplicated <b>and</b> <b>subtle</b> style. Following the death of Colesberry, director Joe Chappelle joined the production staff as a co-executive producer and continued to regularly direct episodes.|$|E
5|$|Jack White's {{voice is}} a singular, evocative {{combination}} of punk, metal, blues, and backwoods while his guitar work is grand and banging with just enough lyrical touches of slide <b>and</b> <b>subtle</b> solo work... Meg White balances out the fretwork and the fretting with methodical, spare, and booming cymbal, bass drum, and snare... All D.I.Y. punk-country-blues-metal singer-songwriting duos should sound this good.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{programs}} in Singapore {{had a profound}} effect on the Communist leadership in China, who made a major effort, especially under Deng Xiaoping, to emulate his policies of economic growth, entrepreneurship, <b>and</b> <b>subtle</b> suppression of dissent. Over 22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods.|$|E

5|$|Super Monkey Ball {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised the simplicity <b>and</b> <b>subtle</b> depth of its control scheme {{as well as}} the new multiplayer modes not present in its arcade counterpart, although some felt its presentation was lacking. The game was commercially successful and remained one of Sega's best-sellers in the United States for much of 2002, eventually spawning a direct sequel, Super Monkey Ball 2, and an entire Super Monkey Ball franchise.|$|E
5|$|Thank Me Later has a languorous, ambient {{production}} that incorporates moody synthesizers, sparse beats, obscured keyboards, minor keys, <b>and</b> <b>subtle</b> arrangements. Thematically, the album focuses on Drake's introduction to fame and his romances {{over the course}} of confessional, club-oriented, and sexual songs. Drake's emotionally transparent, self-deprecating lyrics are delivered in both rapped and subtly sung verses, and explore feelings of doubt, insecurity, and heartbreak.|$|E
5|$|A pop ballad, {{the song}} {{includes}} instrumentation from guitars, keyboards, drums and a synthesizer, and its lyrics deal with deceit, mistrust and childhood scars. It {{is also about}} being strong, which Madonna recalled {{in an interview that}} she thought about her relationship with her parents, while writing the lyrics. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden blond hair, conservative wardrobe <b>and</b> <b>subtle</b> make-up. This toned down blond appearance was again inspired by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E

5|$|In the Diet, {{the group}} of middle-sized states, known as Mittelstaaten (Bavaria, Württemberg, the grand duchies of Baden and Hesse, and the duchies of Saxony–Weimar, Saxony–Meiningen, Saxony–Coburg, and Nassau), {{supported}} complete demobilization within the Confederation. These individual governments rejected the potent combination of enticing promises <b>and</b> <b>subtle</b> (or outright) threats Bismarck {{used to try to}} gain their support against the Habsburgs. The Prussian war cabinet understood that its only supporters among the German states against the Habsburgs were two small principalities bordering on Brandenburg that had little military strength or political clout: the Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They also understood that Prussia's only ally abroad was Italy.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail <b>and</b> <b>subtle</b> references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins are {{broad and}} rounded and are thickly muscled. The two similarly-sized dorsal fins are placed well {{back on the}} body. The anal fin is low and positioned {{just in front of}} the caudal fin. The caudal fin has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots <b>and</b> <b>subtle</b> darker bands. There is a very large black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin; this pair of spots are the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature. Epaulette sharks are typically 7090cm (2735 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107cm (42in).|$|E

60|$|This is, to my mind, the {{inevitable}} {{result of that}} method of reasoning which {{is applied to the}} confutation of Protestantism, with so much success, by one of the acutest <b>and</b> <b>subtlest</b> disputants who have ever championed Ecclesiasticism--and one cannot put his claims to acuteness and subtlety higher.|$|R

5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, <b>and</b> <b>subtle</b> takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E

60|$|I {{would suggest}} to you that this is only a very extreme {{instance}} of the general state of affairs, that there may be finer <b>and</b> <b>subtler</b> differences of level between one term and another, and that terms may very well be thought of as lying obliquely and as being twisted through different levels.|$|R
60|$|If, on {{the other}} hand, Shakespear's {{characters}} are mostly members of the leisured classes, {{the same thing is}} true of Mr Harris's own plays and mine.
