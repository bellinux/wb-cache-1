5|$|<b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began to take off. The first airplane flight in Alaska took place in Fairbanks on July 4, 1913, when a barnstormer flew from a field south of town. The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the Arctic Circle in an airplane.|$|E
5|$|At <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his {{union with}} Cacht, Donnchad aspired to become High King of Ireland. With {{powerful}} maritime forces at his command, Echmarcach would have certainly {{been regarded as}} an important potential ally. Clear evidence of an alliance between Echmarcach and the Uí Briain is preserved by the twelfth-century Banshenchas, a text which records the marriage of Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, to Tadc (died 1086), son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain (died 1086). Annalistic evidence of such an alliance is found well into the late eleventh century. In fact, kinship between Echmarcach's descendants and the Uí Briain even led to the accession of one of Echmarcach's maternal grandsons, Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115), to the kingship of the Isles at about {{the turn of the}} twelfth century.|$|E
5|$|Cases {{have been}} {{recorded}} by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when {{the body of a}} pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from the body of the pregnant woman <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> death or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{married his}} second wife, Ælfflæd, at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his father's death, {{probably}} because Ecgwynn had died, although {{she may have}} been put aside. The new marriage weakened Æthelstan's position, as his step-mother naturally favoured the interests of her own sons, Ælfweard and Edwin. By 920 Edward had taken a third wife, Eadgifu, probably after putting Ælfflæd aside. Eadgifu also had two sons, the future kings Edmund and Eadred. Edward had several daughters, perhaps as many as nine.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{following}} their repeated failures before Constantinople, {{and the continued}} resilience of the Byzantine state, the Muslims began to project the fall of Constantinople to the distant future. Thus the city's fall came {{to be regarded as}} one of the signs of the arrival of the end times in Islamic eschatology. The siege became a motif in Byzantine apocalyptic literature as well, with decisive final battles against the Arabs before the walls of Constantinople being featured in the early 8th-century Greek translation of the Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius and the Apocalypse of Daniel, written either at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the siege or a century later.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} there were 600 ships in the Persian fleet, {{provided}} by the Phoenicians (who were most eager to fight), the Egyptians, Cilicians, and the Cypriots, whose own revolt had recently been subdued. The Persian fleet may have been commanded by the veteran Median general Datis; Persian records {{seem to suggest that}} he was sent by Darius to Ionia at around <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Lade. However, Herodotus does not name any Persian commanders in this campaign.|$|E
50|$|From October 1945 until February 1947, Adler {{worked in}} the Jewish Museum in Prague, where he devoted himself chiefly to the {{building}} up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archives <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> persecution and <b>the</b> Theresienstadt camp.

5|$|The art {{of glass}} making {{is thought to}} have {{developed}} during Ahmose's reign. The oldest samples of glass appear to have been defective pieces of faience, but intentional crafting of glass did not occur until the beginning of the 18th dynasty. One of the earliest glass beads found contains the names of both Ahmose and Amenhotep I, written in a style dated to <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> their reigns. If glassmaking was developed no earlier than Ahmose's reign and the first objects are dated to no later than his successor's reign, it is quite likely {{that it was one of}} his subjects who developed the craft.|$|E
5|$|There {{were still}} fine mediaeval screens {{in the church}} in 1810, {{possibly}} lost when repairs were done in 1813–16; they were gone by 1862. According to the History and Antiquities of the County of Cardigan (1810) by Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick: The chancel and north transept are separated {{from the rest of}} the church by light and elegant carved screens, which, from the elaborate workmanship they display, were probably erected <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Henry the Seventh. They are coloured red, green and yellow, and though once very brilliant, are now so covered with dirt as to be scarce perceptible.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in 1857, the European and North American Railway {{opened its}} line from Moncton to nearby Shediac; this was {{followed}} by a line from Moncton to Saint John opening in 1859. At <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the arrival of the railway, the popularity of steam-powered ships forced an end to the era of wooden shipbuilding. The Salter shipyard closed in 1858. The resulting industrial collapse caused Moncton to surrender its civic charter in 1862.|$|E

5|$|Up until <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his death, Diarmait {{had been}} the most {{powerful}} king in southern Ireland. In consequence of the void left by his demise, Diarmait's erstwhile ally Toirdelbach seized the initiative, and moved to enforce his own claim to the high-kingship of Ireland. He immediately imposed his overlordship on Leinstera task almost certainly expedited by the aforesaid infighting amongst the Uí Chennselaigand took control of Dublin. Whilst the imposition of authority upon rival provincial kingdoms was a fundamental part in gaining the high-kingship, Toirdelbach's decision to march-on Dublin reveals that the acquisition of this coastal kingdom had also become {{an essential part of the}} process.|$|E
5|$|Óláfr {{is known}} to have been survived by three {{children}}; Haraldr (d. 1248), Rögnvaldr (d. 1249), and Magnús (d. 1265)—all of whom ruled as kings in their own right. Although the mother of Óláfr's children is not known for certain, she is thought to have been Christina. The Chronicle of Mann states that Óláfr's immediate successor, Haraldr, was only fourteen {{years old at the time}} of his father's death, which dates his birth to <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the marriage of Óláfr and Christina.|$|E
5|$|<b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> {{the first}} landing in 1969, {{it was decided}} to use an {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available {{for the development of the}} upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.|$|E

5|$|Laurence died on 2February 619, and {{was buried}} in the abbey of St Peter and Paul in Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's; his relics, or remains, were moved, or translated, to the new church of St Augustine's in 1091. His shrine was in the axial chapel of the abbey church, {{flanking}} the shrine of Augustine, his predecessor. Laurence came to be regarded as a saint, and was given the feast day of 3February. The ninth century Stowe Missal commemorates his feast day, along with Mellitus and Justus. A Vita (or Life) was written <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his translation, by Goscelin, but it is mainly based on information in Bede. His tomb was opened in 1915. Besides his feast day, the date of his translation, 13September, was also celebrated after his death. Laurence's tenure as archbishop is mainly remembered for his failure to secure a settlement with the Celtic church, and for his reconversion of Eadbald following Æthelbert's death. He was succeeded as archbishop by Mellitus, the Bishop of London.|$|E
5|$|The chronicle {{states that}} Óláfr then married Christina, {{daughter}} of Ferchar mac an t-sagairt (d. c. 1251). Óláfr's father-in-law emerges from historical obscurity in 1215 and, {{by the mid}} 1220s (<b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of,</b> or not long after, the marriage), Ferchar had obtained the Earldom of Ross from Alexander II, King of Scots (d. 1249) {{for his part in}} defeating the Meic Uilleim northern rebellion in 1215. The chronicle declares that Óláfr's separation from Lauon had enraged her sister, and Rögnvaldr's bitter queen sought to sow discord between the half-brothers. If the chronicle is to be believed, the queen secretly wrote under her husband's name to their son Guðrøðr, ordering him to seize and kill Óláfr. The chronicle states that Guðrøðr dutifully gathered a force on Skye and proceeded to Lewis, where he laid waste to most of the island before returning to Skye—Óláfr had narrowly escaped with a few men and fled to the protection of his father-in-law, on the mainland in Ross.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Chola coins {{discovered}} {{so far are}} not as many as those of Pandyas; {{most of them have}} been found from archeological excavations at Puhar and Arikamedu, and also beds of rivers Amaravathi near Karur and South Pennar near Tirukkoilur. An early Chola coin has also been found in Thailand. The Chola coins do not contain a portrait or a legend and all of them depict symbols of animals and other inanimate objects like the animal series of the Cheras. But, all of them carry the symbol of a tiger, the Chola emblem, on their reverse. One of the coins has been assigned a date earlier than 200 BCE and some others to <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Roman influence, which is around the dawn of the Christian era.|$|E

5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E
5|$|One {{of several}} ecclesiastical sources that deal {{specifically}} with Ragnall is an undated grant to the Cluniac priory at Paisley. Since this grant probably {{dates to the}} period after Ragnall's defeat to Áengus, it may be evidence of an attempt made by Ragnall to secure an alliance with Alan fitz Walter, Steward of Scotland (died 1204). The patrons of this priory were members of Alan's own family, a powerful kindred that had recently begun to expand its influence westwards from Renfrew, to the frontier of the Scottish realm and the fringes of Argyll. Since Bute seems to have fallen {{into the hands of}} this kindred at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Ragnall's grant, it is possible that Alan took advantage of the internal conflict between the meic Somairle, and seized the island before 1200. Alternately, Alan may have received the island from Ragnall as payment for military support against Áengus, who appears to have gained the upper hand over Ragnall by 1192. Alan's expansion and influence in territories outwith the bounds of the Scottish kingdom may have been perceived as a threat by William I, King of Scots (died 1214), and may partly explain the king's construction of a royal castle at Ayr in 1195. This fortress extended Scottish royal authority into the outer Firth of Clyde region, and was probably intended to dominate not only William's peripheral barons, but also independent rulers just beyond the borders of the Scottish realm. In fact, Alan's westward expansion appears to have suddenly ceased at about 1200, and may have been a consequence of royal anxiety concerning an alliance with Ragnall.|$|E
