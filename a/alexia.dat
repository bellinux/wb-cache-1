25|$|Damage {{and injury}} in the brain can {{severely}} lower ones ability to communicate, and therefore lower ones linguistic intelligence. Common forms of major damage are strokes, concussions, brain tumors, viral/bacterial damage, and drug-related damage. The three major linguistic disorders that result from these injuries are aphasia, <b>alexia,</b> and agraphia. Aphasia is the inability to speak, and {{can be caused by}} damage to Broca's area or the motor cortex. <b>Alexia</b> is the inability to read, which can arise from damage to Wernicke's area, among other places. Agraphia is the inability to write which can also arise from damage to Broca's area or the motor cortex. In addition, damage to large areas of the brain can result in any combinations of these disorders, as well as a loss of other abilities.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} King's {{marriage}} to their cousin, Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, the uninvited Prince Peter called {{a press conference}} in Athens and openly questioned the legality of the constitutional amendment. Above all, he attacked his cousin Paul's widow, the tremendously unpopular Queen Frederika, and accused her of having a bad influence on her son. King Constantine II and Queen Anne-Marie's first child, Princess <b>Alexia,</b> was born in 1965 and designated as the new heir presumptive, but Peter refused to recognise that either. Following the rupture between King Constantine and Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou the same year, the Prince openly criticised the King's conduct and suggested himself as an alternative to Constantine II. However, the abolishment of the monarchy and the proclamation of the Third Hellenic Republic in 1973 did not allow Peter to fulfill his dream of ascending the Greek throne.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Castles and Coltheart {{describe}} developmental dyslexia as two prevalent {{and distinct}} varieties using the subtypes of <b>Alexia</b> (acquired dyslexia), Surface and Phonological Dyslexia. Understanding these subtypes {{is useful in}} diagnosing learning patterns and developing approaches for overcoming visual perception impairments or speech discrimination deficits. Cestnick and Coltheart (1999) demonstrated what these underlying deficits are in part, through unveiling different profiles of phonological versus surface dyslexics. Surface Dyslexia is characterized by subjects who can read known words but who have trouble reading words that are irregular. Phonological Dyslexia is characterized by subjects who can read aloud both regular and irregular words but have difficulties with non-words and with connecting sounds to symbols, or with sounding out words. Phonological processing tasks predict reading accuracy and comprehension. Cestnick and Jerger (2000) and Cestnick (2001) further demonstrated distinct processing differences between phonological and surface dyslexics. Manis et al. 1996, concluded that there were probably more than two subtypes of dyslexia, which would be related to multiple underlying deficits.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, cinematographic {{production}} {{received a}} boost {{with the establishment}} of the Cinema Advisory Committee. As of the year 2000, the annual amount set aside in the national budget stands at Cy Pounds 500,000 (about 850,000 Euros). In addition to government grants, Cypriot co-productions are eligible for funding from the Council of Europe's Eurimages Fund, which finances European film co-productions. To date, four feature-length films in which a Cypriot was executive producer have received funding from Eurimages. The first was I Sphagi tou Kokora (1992), completed in 1996, Hellados (And the Trains Fly to the Sky, 1995), which is currently in post-production, and Costas Demetriou's O Dromos gia tin Ithaki (The Road to Ithaka, 1997) which premiered in March 2000. The theme song to The Road to Ithaka was composed by Costas Cacoyannis and sung by <b>Alexia</b> Vassiliou. In September 1999, To Tama (The Promise) by Andreas Pantzis also received funding from the Eurimages Fund. In 2009 the Greek director, writer and producer Vassilis Mazomenos filmed in Cyprus Guilt. The film was awarded in 2012 with the Best Screenwriting and Best Photography award in London Greek Film Festival (UK) and was official selection in Montreal World Film Festival, Cairo International Film Festival, India International Film Festival, Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, Fantasporto and opening film in the Panorama of European Cinema in Athens.
