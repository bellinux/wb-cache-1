There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in <b>any</b> <b>way.</b> <b>They</b> are usually printed in small print {{on the side of the}} package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E

5|$|The backstory {{presented}} in StarCrafts manual {{and in the}} novel Shadow Hunters also shows {{the rise of a}} second society of Protoss known as the Nerazim. They are a sizeable minority of the Protoss who reject the Khala out of fear of losing their individuality inside the psychic link. The Nerazim are treated as heretics by the Khalai Protoss and are forcibly evicted from Aiur. Despite their persecution, the majority of Dark Templar do not hold anything against their estranged brethren, seeking to defend Aiur in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> can. The Nerazim are presented as nomadic, liberal society, only settling on the planet Shakuras to study a Xel'Naga temple there. During the Brood War event, the Protoss lose their homeworld of Aiur to the Zerg (even with the Overmind being destroyed by Tassadar) and the Khalai Protoss are forced to escape and seek refuge on Shakuras, by then the homeworld of the Nerazim Protoss. After the conclusion of StarCraft, the two groups begin to reconcile, but the reconciliation is marred by mutual distrust.|$|E

25|$|Prince of Persia {{features}} open world exploration {{that allows}} the player to travel to any spot in the game world at any given point, and allows the player to witness the plot in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> want. Depending on how the player progresses, previously visited areas will become more challenging to traverse when the player re-visits them. However, when the player heals a spot of land, it becomes devoid of traps. The traps are manifested in various forms of the antagonist Ahriman's Corruption; black-colored blobs that coat the land and swallow the player if touched. The player can use acrobatic maneuvers to avoid these traps.|$|E
25|$|One {{experimental}} game used {{to measure}} levels of cooperation is the dictator game. In the standard form of the dictator game, there are two anonymous unrelated participants.

The allocator is assigned some amount of money, which they can divide in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> choose. If a participant is trying to maximize their payoff, the rational solution (nash equilibrium) for the allocator to assign nothing to the recipient. In a 2011 meta study of 616 dictator game studies, Engel found an average allocation of 28.3%, with 36% of participants giving nothing, 17% choosing the equal split, and 5.44% give the recipient everything.|$|E

25|$|The {{spectrum}} {{property rights}} model advocates that the spectrum resources {{should be treated}} like land, i.e. private ownership of spectrum portions should be permitted. The allocation of these portions should be implemented by means of market forces. The spectrum owners {{should be able to}} trade these portions in secondary markets. Alternatively, the spectrum owners would be able to use their bands in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> want through any technology they prefer (service and technology neutrality). Although the spectrum property rights model advocates exclusive allocation of transmission rights, it {{is not the same as}} a licensed regime. The main difference is the service and technology neutrality advocated in the spectrum property rights approach, as opposed to strict requirements on services and communications technologies inherent in licensed governance regimes.|$|E
25|$|People {{who are not}} {{registered}} {{players are}} not allowed to interfere with gameplay. Under the original rules, this includes spying on the other team, or helping players stay in a safe area by bringing them food or doing something for a player which would otherwise require them to leave a safe-zone. If a non-player is shot with a Nerf dart or attacked by a player in <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> should report the player(s) involved if the incident was intentional. Players who attack non-players will be banned under most rules. The original rules, and most University custom rules, stress the importance of safety in the game. The rules stress the safety of the players and non-players by not allowing realistic looking weaponry, weaponry which could hurt on impact, or dangerous behavior during gameplay.|$|E
25|$|The University of Leeds was the {{alma mater}} of Herbert Read, {{one of the}} leading {{international}} theorists of modern art from the mid-twentieth century, and also the teaching base for the Marxist art historian Arnold Hauser from 1951 to 1985. Partly due to Herbert Read's connection with the University, from 1950 to 1970 the University was the host of one of the first artist in residence schemes in Britain, using funding from the then owner of Lund Humphries books, Peter Gregory. The Gregory Fellowships, as the residencies were known, were given to painters and sculptors for up to two years to allow them to develop their own work and influence the University in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> saw fit.

25|$|In a 2015 study, BDSM {{relationships}} were suggested {{to have a}} higher level of connection, intimacy, trust and communication compared to individuals who do not practice BDSM. The study suggests that dominants and submissives exchange control for each other's pleasure and to satisfy a need. They mention that both parties enjoys pleasing their partner in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> can. Submissive and Dominants who participated in their research, felt {{that this is one of}} the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant.

25|$|When a goaltender blocks or stops a {{shot from}} going into his goal net, that action {{is called a}} save. Goalies often use a {{particular}} style, but in general they make saves <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> can: catching the puck with their glove hand, deflecting the shot with their stick, blocking it with their leg pads or blocker or another part of their body, or collapsing to butterfly position to block any low shot coming, especially in close proximity. After making a save, the goaltender attempts to control the rebound to avoid a goal scored by an opposing player when the goaltender is out of position ('scoring on a rebound'), or to allow the goalie's own team {{to get control of}} the puck. Goalies may catch or hold a puck shot at the net to better control how it re-enters play. If there is immediate pressure from the opposing team, a goalie may choose {{to hold on to the}} puck (for a second or more, with judgment from the referee) to stop play for a face-off. If a goalie holds on to the puck for too long without any pressure they may be subject to a 2-minute delay of game penalty. Recently, in the NHL and AHL, goalies have been restricted as to where they can play the puck behind the net.|$|E
25|$|English {{trust law}} {{concerns}} {{the creation and}} protection of asset funds, which are usually held by one party for another's benefit. Trusts were a creation of the English law of property and obligations, but also share a history with countries across the Commonwealth and the United States. Trusts developed when claimants in property disputes were dissatisfied with the common law courts and petitioned the King for a just and equitable result. On the King's behalf, the Lord Chancellor developed a parallel justice system in the Court of Chancery. Historically, trusts were mostly used where people left money in a will, created family settlements, created charities, or some types of business venture. After the Judicature Act 1873, England's courts of equity and common law were merged, and equitable principles took precedence. Today, trusts {{play an important role}} in financial investments, especially in unit trusts and pension trusts, where trustees and fund managers usually invest assets for people who wish to save for retirement. Although people are generally free to write trusts in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> like, an increasing number of statutes are designed to protect beneficiaries, or regulate the trust relationship, including the Trustee Act 1925, Trustee Investments Act 1961, Recognition of Trusts Act 1987, Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, Trustee Act 2000, Pensions Act 1995, Pensions Act 2004 and the Charities Act 2011.|$|E

The young men filed a lawsuit against the Dallas Independent School District, claiming the restriction interfered with their constitutional freedom of expression. Despite not knowing the boys involved, Marcus stepped forward to champion their case before the public, taking out a newspaper ad defending the choice as a simple fashion decision rather than rebellion against authority. Additionally, he offered legal support if needed, noting in a telegram to school board president Lee McShan, Jr., [...] "I don’t like long hair any more than the principal does, but I will fight for the rights of those students to wear hair <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> choose."
