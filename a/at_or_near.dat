40|$|Description The target {{equivalence}} range (TEQR) {{design is}} a frequentist {{implementation of the}} modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design and a competitor to the standard 3 + 3 design (3 + 3). The 3 + 3 is the work horse design in Phase I. It is good at determining if a safe dose exits, but provides poor accuracy and precision in estimating the level of toxicity at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The TEQR {{is better than the}} 3 + 3 when compared on: 1) the number of times the dose <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> the target toxicity level was selected as the MTD, 2) the number of subjects assigned to doses levels, <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> the MTD, and 3) the overall trial DLT rate. TEQR more accurately and more precisely estimates the rate of toxicity at the MTD because a larger number of subjects are studied at the MTD dose. The TEQR on average uses fewer subjects and provide reasonably comparable results to the continual reassessment method (CRM) in the number of times the dose <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> the target toxicity level was selected as the MTD and the number of subjects assigned doses, <b>at,</b> <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> the target and in overall DLT rate...|$|R

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> the margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
5|$|All {{historical}} eruptions at K카lauea {{have occurred}} {{at one of}} three places: its summit caldera, its eastern rift zone, or its southwestern rift zone. Half of K카lauea's historical eruptions have occurred <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> K카lauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous {{for much of the}} 19th century, capped by a massive explosive eruption in 1924 before petering out by 1934. Recent activity has mostly shifted to K카lauea's eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern rift zone has been relatively quiet, and has only been the site of five events to date.|$|E

5|$|Another noted shipwreck, {{that of the}} Surat, {{occurred}} on New Year's Day in 1874.

5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> the surface.|$|E
5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies <b>at,</b> <b>or</b> <b>near,</b> to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E
