5|$|In 1150, {{it looked}} like Caithness and the whole earldom of Orkney {{were going to come}} under {{permanent}} Scottish control. However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put <b>a</b> <b>spanner</b> in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unaware in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay fealty as a condition of his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the Orkney earldom of Harald's rival Erlend Haraldsson, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David's grant. David's weakness in Orkney was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared to stand back and let him reduce their power.|$|E
5|$|Abi starts dating Jordan, but {{months later}} he is {{attacked}} by Ben with <b>a</b> <b>spanner,</b> leaving him in a coma. They split up, but remain friends. Abi starts to {{take an interest in}} Max's lodger Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins), who is left uncomfortable when she tries to kiss him, telling her she is too young and is heartbroken when Darren proposes to Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington). Abi forms a close friendship with her mother's fiancé Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth). She later develops a crush on Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick), and the two begin dating. Believing Jay is only interested in Abi for sex, Max tries to split them up, but fails to do so. Jay and Abi plan to have sex several times, but on each occasion, they are unable to go through with it. At one time, Jay and Abi cuddle up as they are watching television, but Max believes they are about to have sex, so he throws Jay out and rips Abi's bridesmaid dress to Greg and Tanya's wedding. They go to buy a new one, but they have a car crash on Greg and Tanya's wedding day. They suffer minor injuries and both recover.|$|E

All {{four of the}} pirates from that confrontation were either killed or disappeared overboard. After the Mongolian vessel was able to proceed safely, {{the crew of the}} Choi Young recovered the remnants of the hijackers' motorboat. Three rusty AK-47 rifles and an ammunition magazine were retrieved, along with three small iron ladders for boarding and various tools, including a screwdriver, <b>a</b> <b>spanner,</b> and several fishing knives. As the pirates had only six AK-47 rifles in total and three of them had now been confiscated, they had lost half of their firearms and about a quarter of their personnel.|$|E
25|$|In autumn 1903 Childers {{travelled}} to the United States {{as part of}} {{a reciprocal}} visit between the Honourable Artillery Company of London and the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts of Boston. At the end of the official visit he elected to remain and explore New England on a hired motor cycle. One day by chance the machine broke down outside the Beacon Hill home of Dr Hamilton Osgood, a prominent physician in the city. Childers diffidently knocked to borrow <b>a</b> <b>spanner</b> and was invited in for dinner and introduced to Dr Osgood's younger daughter, Mary ("Molly") Alden Osgood. The well-read republican heiress and Childers found each other congenial company. Dr Osgood organised the rest of Childers's stay, with much time shared with Molly, and the pair were married at Boston's Trinity Church on 5 January 1904.|$|E

This prompts Homer and Marge to see Chief Wiggum, who suggests that they seek help from someone who can understand a murderer's twisted mind– Sideshow Bob, who is released from prison, much to Bart's discomfort. To ensure Bart's safety, Wiggum places a shock bracelet on Sideshow Bob's ankle to keep his murderous urges at bay {{when he comes to}} live at the Simpson house. Sideshow Bob asks Homer to list all the people who may want him dead, and decides to follow Homer around to investigate who the mystery assailant could be. During their day, they end up at a repair shop, where Homer chastises the mechanic, Junior.|$|E
25|$|One morning, Harold finds Elsie {{sitting on}} a log in the woods, crying {{about the state of}} her life. He comforts her and, as he escorts her back to the hotel, they come across one of the Polish women. He wonders how much she saw. That evening, Elsie bursts into Harold's room. Her husband has arrived at the hotel {{unexpectedly}} and is in a terrible rage. At that moment, Philip Clayton runs in. He is carrying <b>a</b> <b>spanner</b> and screams at Elsie, accusing her of having an affair just as one of the Polish women had told him. He chases Elsie out of Harold's room and back to her own. Harold runs after him and is in time to see Elsie throw a paperweight at her husband in self-defence. He falls to the ground and Elsie begs Harold to leave them before he gets himself into trouble. Half an hour later, Mrs Rice joins Harold and tells him that Philip is dead, killed by the blow.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{segment of}} the grooved wheel, made of {{hardened}} steel, projects through a slot cut to its precise dimensions {{in the base of}} the priming pan. The wheel is grooved on its outside circumference with three or more V-shaped grooves with transverse cuts at intervals to provide a friction surface for the iron pyrites. The wheel is fixed to a shaft, one end of which projects outside the lockplate. The outside projection is of square section to permit <b>a</b> <b>spanner</b> (wrench) to be engaged for subsequent tensioning of the lock. The other end of the shaft fits {{through a hole in the}} lockplate, and on this end is forged a cam, or eccentric. One end of a short, robust chain (made of three or four flat, parallel links like a short piece of bicycle chain) is fixed to the cam, while the other end of the chain is held in a groove at the end of the longer branch of a large heavy V-spring, which is generally retained by a screw and a headed bracket through upstands inside the lockplate.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} lap, Buemi led di Grassi, Piquet, Vergne, Heidfeld, Engel, Bird, Rosenqvist, Frijns, López, Abt, Evans, Gutiérrez, Turvey, Carroll, Félix da Costa, Prost, d'Ambrosio, Duval and Sarrazin. Buemi began to pull away from di Grassi, {{establishing}} a lead of one second over him. The field settled down for the next six laps with nothing notable of note occurring. On lap eight, Bird went over the kerbing at Tabac corner, lost control of the rear-end of his car, and veered into the barrier, damaging his rear suspension. Bird was forced to make a pit stop, while his teammate López was shown a black flag with an orange circle, requiring him to stop for repairs to his rear wing. Bird's mechanics repaired his vehicle's rear-end with <b>a</b> <b>spanner</b> and replaced López's rear wing. Both drivers returned to the track to commence a battle for the race's fastest lap. Buemi continued to extend his advantage over di Grassi and Piquet while Rosenqvist was challenging Engel for sixth. Frijns lost eighth when Abt passed him around the outside and closed up to the Engel and Rosenqvist battle. Piquet struggled to remain within sight of the leading drivers, and Vergne ran closely behind him, steering left onto the inside line. As both drivers locked their tyres, Piquet clambered with his steering wheel, and both cars made contact; Vergne ended his race in the Novelle Chicane barrier on lap 21.|$|E

2500|$|In response, Stewart campaigned with Louis Stanley (BRM team boss) for {{improved}} emergency services and better safety barriers around race tracks. [...] "We were racing at circuits {{where there were}} no crash barriers in front of the pits, and fuel was lying about in churns in the pit lane. A car could easily crash into the pits at any time. It was ridiculous." [...] As a stop-gap measure, Stewart hired a private doctor to be at all his races, and taped <b>a</b> <b>spanner</b> to the steering shaft of his BRM in case it would be needed again. Stewart pressed for mandatory seat belt usage and full-face helmets for drivers, which have become unthinkable omissions for modern races. Likewise, he pressed track owners to modernize their tracks, including organizing driver boycotts of races at Spa-Francorchamps in 1969, the Nürburgring in 1970, and Zandvoort in 1972 until barriers, run-off areas, fire crews, and medical facilities were improved.|$|E
