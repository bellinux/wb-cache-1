5|$|Unusually for a {{motorway}} service station, the {{two sites}} are <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> apart {{due to the}} proximity of junction 8 (for the M50 motorway). The services opened with the motorway in 1962 and have undergone many developments over time, {{largely due to the}} evolution of the motorway, which {{at the time of its}} opening ran from Birmingham to Strensham but now runs to Exeter some 100 miles southwards. It was the first service station on the M5.|$|E

5|$|The name of {{the cross}} is likely to derive {{from the village of}} Camuston. No trace of this village can be seen today, and it had ceased to exist {{by the time of the}} first Ordnance Survey map, {{published}} in 1888, but surveyed in 1857 to 1859. Its former location is indicated in the 1794 map by Ainslie, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> to the east of the cross. Camuston can be found with earlier spelling variations, for example, 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425 and 1426, and has a Celtic rather than Scandinavian etymology.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{building}} of Orford Castle, Suffolk was dominated by the Bigod family, who held {{the title of the}} Earl of Norfolk and owned key castles at Framlingham, Bungay, Walton and Thetford. Hugh Bigod had been {{one of a group of}} dissenting barons during the Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen, and Henry II wished to re-establish royal influence across the region. Henry confiscated the four castles from Hugh, but returned Framlingham and Bungay to Hugh in 1165. Henry then decided to build his own royal castle at Orford, near Framlingham, and construction work began in 1165, concluding in 1173. The Orford site was around two miles (3.2km) from the sea, lying on flat ground with swampy terrain slowly stretching away down to the river Ore, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> (0.8km) away.|$|E

60|$|We thought our voyaging {{was at a}} {{full stop}} now; but three of us, {{with a couple of}} our negroes, {{mounting}} the hills another way, to view the course of the river, we found a fair channel again after <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile's</b> march, and that it was like to hold us a good way further. So we set all hands to work, unloaded our cargo, and hauled our canoes on shore, {{to see if we could}} carry them.|$|R
5|$|Sebring Farms {{was reduced}} to piles of rubber, with four tall royal palm trees left standing. Only six people in the town survived. The hotel at Miami Locks (today known as Lake Harbor) was the sole {{structure}} to survive the storm. The bodies of many dead animals were resting on the canal banks. Ninety-nine people died in that town. In Chosen, only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people. At Henry Martin's store, the building lost its roof during the storm, forcing the occupants {{to move into the}} restroom. A house that was full of people floated <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> (0.8km) from its original location. The occupants were unaware that the house was moving until it collided with a railroad embankment. Twenty three people died in Chosen.|$|E
5|$|The Portway {{was planned}} by the Bristol Corporation in {{response}} to the decline of Bristol Harbour in the late 19th century in favour of Avonmouth Docks, which could handle larger vessels and containers. Construction started in May 1919, engineered by L.S.McKenzie. The southern section connected to the existing road network at Hotwells, and a portion of the new road near Clifton lay partly on the line of the Bristol Port Railway. The new build did not directly connect to Avonmouth Docks, but linked to the existing road via Shirehampton <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> from the dock gates. The original plan was to build a tramway {{along the length of the}} road, which would have linked Avonmouth to the Bristol Tramway system, but this was abandoned owing to cost.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Kymer began mining at Pwll y Llygod and Great Forest (near Carway) in 1760, {{and sought}} {{parliamentary}} approval {{to construct a}} canal at his own expense in early 1766. The Act of Parliament was granted on 19 February 1766. The canal was to run from his coal pits at Pwll y Llygod {{on the banks of}} the Gwendraeth Fawr river to Ythyn Frenig, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> (0.8km) to the west of Kidwelly, where he built a dock on the southern bank of the Gwendraeth Fach river. The Act included powers to divert the course of the Gwendraeth Fawr from Pwll y Llygod to Pont Spwdwr, where the Kidwelly to Llanelli turnpike road crossed the river. The canal was operational by May 1768.|$|E
50|$|Glenn {{built an}} earth and rock dam <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> west of Macleod Trail and {{diverted}} {{water from the}} creek into a ditch which diverted the water to irrigate his fields east of the Trail.

5|$|In August 1942 No. 3 Commando was {{involved}} in the ill-fated Operation Jubilee, an exploratory raid on Dieppe in France. The plan called for a frontal assault on the port by the Canadian 2nd Division. Before this would take place, however, Troops from No. 3 and 4 Commandos would land at beaches on the eastern and western flanks and neutralise two German artillery batteries that were covering the main anchorage. No. 3 Commando was assigned the task of attacking the Goebbels Battery, landing on the eastern flank, under Durnford-Slater's command. The battery was located near Berneval-le-Grand, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> from the sea with steep cliffs in front of it. It was decided that No. 3 Commando would land on two beaches to the east and west of the battery, from which gullies rose towards the battery and which would provide concealment while the Commandos approached the battery.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Corder {{left the}} house, Maria {{set out to}} meet him at the Red Barn which was {{situated}} on Barnfield Hill, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> from the Martens' cottage. This was the last time that she was seen alive. Corder also disappeared, but later turned up and claimed that Marten was in Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, or some other place nearby, and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking the anger of his friends and relatives. The pressure on Corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave the area. He wrote letters to Marten's family claiming that they were married and living on the Isle of Wight, and he gave various excuses for her lack of communication: she was unwell, she had hurt her hand, or the letter must have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock {{then went}} to Doncaster, where on 23 September, he started 1/2 {{favourite}} and beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Stakes over four miles.

Twenty-four hours later he beat Rasping to win a sweepstakes of 25 guineas each over four miles., {{and then went on}} to beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Club Stakes. This was his fourth race in the space of two days. At Richmond in October he won his second Dundas Stakes, this time beating King Corney. Later in the day Blacklock finished last of four runners behind winner Doctor Syntax in the Richmond Cup over four miles. Doctor Syntax had started in the lead, but was overtaken by Blacklock after only 200 yards. Blacklock held the lead until <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> from the finish, when Doctor Syntax joined him again. Blacklock then swerved out of line, allowing Doctor Syntax to win easily. By the time The Richmond Cup was run Blacklock was apparently unwell and was coughing repeatedly during the race.|$|E

60|$|It {{had been}} my intention, originally, to speak the strange ship, as I had told Sennit; but seeing there was no {{probability}} of her altering her course, so as to pass the boat, I changed my purpose, and stood directly athwart her fore-foot, at <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile's</b> distance. I set the Yankee bunting, and she showed the English ensign, in return. Had she been French, however, {{it would have made}} no odds to me; for, what did I care about my late captors becoming prisoners of war? They had endeavoured to benefit themselves at my cost, and I was willing enough to benefit myself at theirs.|$|R
