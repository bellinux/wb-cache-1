The show served as part {{one of the}} two-part [...] "Glorious Excess" [...] series, with the second installment [...] "Glorious Excess (DIES)" [...] due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series, stating, [...] "It Got {{to a point where}} the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me. It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things {{going on in the world}} right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make sense to me. <b>Add</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E

[...] Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave a rating 4 out 5 and wrote, [...] "Kaminey is certainly not a run of the mill album {{and this is where}} its prime strength lies. The album boasts of at least three chartbuster tracks'Dhan Te Nan' (sure shot superhit), 'Thode Bheege' (must for the hearts in love) and 'Raat Ke Dhai Baje' (for some 'masti' and 'hungama'). Songs like 'Fatak' and 'Kaminey' are innovative and situational which showcase the range of Vishal Bhardwaj. <b>Add</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 'Go Charlie Go– Theme Music' and you know that Kaminey is yet another addition to some excellent albums that have hit the stands during last one month." [...] Planet Bollywood rated the album 8.5 out of 10 and said it is the best soundtrack released that year, and that [...] "t has experimentations with both music and lyrics". Indo-Asian News Service praised the soundtrack and said that [...] "..."Kaminey" [...] is easily among 2009's finest scores. Experimental in its sound, yet very mainstream in appeal.

DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented positively on the episode, {{and said that}} [...] "if any show's taken a more unusual path to a story about xenophobia, I've not seen it."

The review continued, [...] "The parts with the immigrants are also good, especially since they make their point deftly. <b>Add</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hilarious sound of 'American Apu' {{and this is a}} strong program." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered {{the best part of the}} episode to be when Homer tries to teach Apu American history, noting Homer's [...] "relevant and complex" [...] diagram of a stovepipe hat. Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "One of the most outspoken, and certainly angriest of episodes succeeds as a savage satire on the scapegoating of immigrants. Homer has never been so frighteningly dumb, although he does come through with a rousing liberal speech." [...] The episode is The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's third favorite episode of the show. The episode received a negative review from Dave Foster of DVD Times. He considered [...] "Much Apu About Nothing" [...] to be one of the season's most [...] "tiring" [...] episodes, [...] "mostly because Apu is not a strong enough character to focus an episode on no matter how much writer David Cohen develops him". Foster commented that the episode deals with a political issue which is [...] "difficult to broach in twenty minutes and is therefore reached and sewn up in a rather haphazard manner".|$|E

[...] Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict said he had always liked flashback and alternate future episodes, and he thought [...] "Take My Life, Please" [...] put them together in a [...] "clever way". He added: [...] "Maybe it’s all the shiny newness, but I thought {{this was one of the}} best episodes this season. It took full advantage of the new widescreen format to cram in a ton of background detail and blink-and-you’ll-miss-’em jokes.
