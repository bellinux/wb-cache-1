25|$|It {{was never}} a success financially. In fact, we lost money, if I {{remember}} correctly, on every single release bar one. I did quite like it but it was terribly indulgent. Not as indulgent {{as it would have}} been had I not had a business partner, admittedly... I liked having a label. It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>business</b> man.|$|E

25|$|Vesey won {{a lottery}} and {{purchased}} his freedom around {{the age of}} 32. He had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>business</b> and a family, {{but was unable to}} buy his first wife Beck and their children out of slavery. Vesey became active in the Second Presbyterian Church; in 1818 he was among the founders of an independent African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in the city, which had the support of white clergy. It rapidly attracted 1,848 members, making this the second-largest AME congregation in the nation after Mother Bethel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|The congregations also {{competed with}} each other, each one {{desiring}} to bury him {{in its own}} cemetery. Congregation Adath Israel on Elridge Street promised to give his widow $1,000 on the spot and $10 a week {{all the rest of}} her life. Congregation Beis HaMidrash HaGadol was permitted to bury him in their plot at the Union Field Cemetery in Ridgewood, Queens. This became <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>business</b> venture, for the plots near the grave of the chief rabbi became extremely valuable. The widow received the amount promised for several years, and then they stopped sending her the money.|$|E
25|$|Fortunately, he {{realized}} that he was ruining his life, and took up new interests. He began to draw. Then he took up blacksmithing, so he could repair the iron farm implements that had recently been introduced to the area. Self-taught as usual, he made his own tools, forge and bellows. He was soon doing <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>business</b> either repairing items or selling items he had created himself. His spurs and bridle bits were in great demand because he liked to decorate them with silver. Although he maintained his store, he not only stopped drinking but stopped selling alcohol.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, Go Seigen won {{a special}} Nihon Ki-in tournament {{to have the}} {{opportunity}} to play a game against Honinbo Shusai Meijin. At that juncture, Honinbo Shusai embodied the highest go authority and tradition in Japan. In addition to inheriting the hereditary title of Honinbo, he was also the holder of the prestigious position of Meijin. The game between Go Seigen and Shusai was thus highly anticipated. The newspapers thought it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>business</b> idea to publicize the game as a confrontation between Japan and China. As a consequence, Go Seigen became the unfortunate victim of rising Japanese nationalism. Before and during the game, he was often harassed and threatened by nationalists, and the windows of his house were smashed in.|$|E

25|$|Albert Marsh of Mobile, Alabama {{established}} the commercial hamster {{industry in the}} United States in the 1940s. Marsh first got a hamster when he was gambling and won it in a wager. Somehow he got more hamsters after this one, perhaps from the breeding stock managed by Guy Henry Faget in Carville, Louisiana. At the time, Marsh was a highway engineer but unemployed. After getting his hamsters, he learned to breed them and founded Marsh Enterprises and the Gulf Hamstery, which promoted Syrian hamsters as pets, for laboratory use, and in business schemes. Marsh took advertisements in magazines, comics, and livestock trade journals which praised hamsters as pets and presented the idea that breeding hamsters was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>business</b> investment. In his business, he shipped hamsters to {{people who would be}} breeders, then he coordinated the shipment of various breeders' hamsters to other breeders or to laboratories.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays {{they are}} a rare sight in Japanese cities, and only 30-35 {{professional}} chindon'ya (puro no chindon'ya) still exist, mostly in and around Tokyo, with another 30 amateur and hobby chindon'ya (shirōto chindon'ya) performing at festivals. In recent years, however, {{there seems to be}} a very small increase again, as they can draw on their historic roots to evoke nostalgia. The social status of the performers has also improved. Thus, while far away from their golden days, chindon'ya hold a small niche in the advertising business in Japan. In Osaka, for example, Chindon Tsūshinsha (ちんどん通信社) performs for clothing stores, politicians, beauty salons, and restaurants, in addition to stage performances on weddings, company parties, and other events. They expand their traditional roles even further and even provide a sort of religious services based on old folk rituals, even though they are not in any way priests. They have also performed outside Japan. Another group Adachi in Fukuoka was formed five years ago and is still doing <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>business,</b> including new attractions as for example playing the saxophone while riding the unicycle, or displaying juggling, and balloon modelling performances.|$|E

500|$|After this album, {{the group}} planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to {{facilitate}} their solo careers. Beyoncé {{has noted that}} their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyoncé has said that [...] "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" [...] with the album before adding: [...] "We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to – not because it's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>business</b> move." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 1892 {{there had}} been no {{preparation}} at all for use of the river to ship products by water. [...] No roads led to the river, and there were no storehouses on the banks.

[...] One steamer regularly the whole year between Portland and Dayton, and made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>business.</b> [...] This steamer could have extended its route to McMinnville if {{there had been}} sufficient business on the river to make it worthwhile.|$|E

[...] The boat remained out of service as of September 21, 1906, lying at Portland at the Duniway dock on the east side of the Willamette River. [...] The steamer was still of service through February 1907 when there was talk of sale of the vessel for use in California on San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento River.|$|E
