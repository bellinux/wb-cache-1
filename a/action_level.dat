25|$|The current {{recommendations}} for residential exposure (not including amalgam fillings already accounted for) are as follows: The ATSDR <b>Action</b> <b>Level</b> for indoor mercury vapor in residential settings is 1µg/m3 and the ATSDR MRL (Minimal Risk Level) for chronic exposure is 0.2µg/m3 According to the ATSDR, the MRL(Minimal Risk Level) is {{an estimate of}} the level of daily exposure to a substance that is unlikely to cause adverse non-cancerous health effects. The <b>Action</b> <b>Level</b> is defined as an indoor air concentration of mercury that would prompt officials to consider implementing response actions. It is a recommendation and does not necessarily imply toxicity or health risks. Breathing air with a concentration of 0.2µg mercury/m3 would lead to an inhaled amount of approximately 4µg/day (respiratory volume of 20m3/day). About 80% of inhaled mercury vapor would be absorbed.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) {{has set a}} {{permissible}} {{exposure limit}} of 1 part of benzene per million parts of air (1 ppm) in the workplace during an 8-hour workday, 40-hour workweek. The short term exposure limit for airborne benzene is 5 ppm for 15 minutes. These legal limits were based on studies demonstrating compelling evidence of health risk to workers exposed to benzene. The risk from exposure to 1 ppm for a working lifetime has been estimated as 5 excess leukemia deaths per 1,000 employees exposed. (This estimate assumes no threshold for benzene's carcinogenic effects.) OSHA has also established an <b>action</b> <b>level</b> of 0.5 ppm to encourage even lower exposures in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|In northeastern Pennsylvania and New York a {{study of}} 68 private {{drinking}} wells, which included the Dimrock Township site, the methane concentration was high {{in close proximity to}} the natural gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing. The average was within the defined <b>action</b> <b>level</b> of less than 28mg/L and greater than 10mg/L for hazard moderation which is recommended by the U.S. Department of the Interior but the maximum of 64mg/L was above that threshold. The study found no evidence of contamination by Marcellus saline brines or by hydraulic fracturing fluid. John Hanger, former head of the Pennsylvania DEP, blamed the methane contamination on poor well construction, though he could not rule out fracking as the cause.|$|E

40|$|Background {{and aims}}   Musculoskeletal {{disorder}} {{is one of}} the biggest occupational health problems in workplaces of industries. According to the national statistics, the proportion of musculoskeletal diseases of all occupation diseases in the United States is 44 % (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1996). On the basis of report of National Institute Occupational Safety and Health of USA(NIOSH), WMSDs is in the second place between the work-related diseases. Poor working  postures constitute one of the main risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders. Recognition,  evaluation and control action for prevention of occur disorders is important to protect and  promotion of workers health. For evaluation of WMSDs risk factor, various methods have been  presented. Two practical methods for analyzing and controlling poor working postures in  workplaces are REBA and RULA.   Methods   This research is a cross-sectional study that was conducted in order to survey of  correlation between two evaluation methods of WMSDs risk factors REBA& RULAin one of the ophthalmic lens manufacture factory. At first, jobs were surveyed and all subtasks of jobs recognized and 40 jobs out of 77 were selected. Then REBA& RULAmethods were carried out  for this jobs. Also, The final scores and <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> were determined.   Results   The result revealed that: there was a significant correlation between final score of two  methods (r = 0. 781) and <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> of two methods (r= 0. 821).
