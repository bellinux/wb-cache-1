40|$|In this essay, Pierce and Weiss {{report the}} results of a study of {{judicial}} review <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> interpretations <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> rules. Prior studies found that, while courts at all levels uphold about 70 % <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> actions, the Supreme Court upholds 91 % <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> interpretations <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> rules. Pierce and Weiss find that lower courts do not confer this type <b>of</b> “super-deference” on <b>agency</b> interpretations <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> rules. District courts and circuit courts uphold 76 % <b>of</b> such <b>agency</b> actions. That is within the range of the findings of prior studies of judicial review of other types <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> actions and much lower than {{the rate at which the}} Supreme Court upholds <b>agency</b> interpretations <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> rules. Pierce and Weiss also find no evidence that judges are influenced by their political or ideological preferences when they review <b>agency</b> interpretations <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> rules. That finding is consistent with the findings of a prior study of judicial review <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> findings <b>of</b> fact, but it is inconsistent with the findings of several studies of judicial review <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> interpretations <b>of</b> agency-administered statutes and of judicial review <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> policy decisions...|$|R

5|$|As {{nuclear weapons}} {{development}} proceeded, the weapons became mass-produced, smaller, lighter, {{and easier to}} store, handle and maintain. They also required less effort to assemble.

It supported nuclear weapons testing, although after Operation Sandstone in 1948, this was increasingly in a planning and training capacity rather than a field role. In 1958, the AFSWP became the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), a field <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> the Department of Defense.|$|E
