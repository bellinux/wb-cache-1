25|$|A {{confined}} aquifer is an aquifer that is overlain by a relatively impermeable layer of rock or substrate {{such as an}} aquiclude or <b>aquitard.</b> If a {{confined aquifer}} follows a downward grade from its recharge zone, groundwater can become pressurized as it flows. This can create artesian wells that flow freely without the need of a pump and rise to a higher elevation than the static water table at the above, unconfined, aquifer.|$|E
25|$|An aquifer is an {{underground}} layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt) from which groundwater can be extracted using a water well. The study of water flow in aquifers and {{the characterization of}} aquifers is called hydrogeology. Related terms include <b>aquitard,</b> which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer, and aquiclude (or aquifuge), which is a solid, impermeable area underlying or overlying an aquifer. If the impermeable area overlies the aquifer, pressure could cause it to become a confined aquifer.|$|E
25|$|Groundwater is {{the primary}} water source in Costa Rica where it {{accounts}} for nearly 90% of Costa Rica’s agricultural, industrial, and domestic water demands {{with the exception of}} hydroelectric generation. Volcanic activity has formed highly permeable subterranean layers within the fragmented igneous lava. This phenomenon coupled with high rainfall has created the formation of aquifers in the central and northern part of Costa Rica’s Central Valley, where {{more than half of the}} population lives. These aquifers are called the Upper and Lower Colima and are separated by a layer that acts as a semi-permeable <b>aquitard,</b> which allows the descending and ascending vertical transfer of water.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Results {{of field}} and {{laboratory}} {{research on the}} hydraulic conductivity coefficient of near−surface <b>aquitards</b> are presented in the article. The research was conducted for Quaternary tills and Tertiary clays occurring {{in the area of}} the Wielkopolski National Park. Special cylinders equipped with a sealing device and a contact sensor of the water level position each were designed. The cylin− ders were sunk into the examined <b>aquitards</b> and then injected with water. After sealing the cylinder the air inside was compressed which caused water injection from the cylinder into the examined <b>aquitards.</b> The rate of the injection was observed by measuring the water level depression in the cylinder. Theoretical consideration has been carried out and an own algorithm enabling computation of the hydraulic conductivity coefficient value on the basis of measurements of: depression s, time t, pressure in the cylinder ∆H and effective porosity of the examined bodies ne has been developed.

Fracture-controlled aquifers in the drilled zone exist in depth deeper than 50  m. Groundwater level measurement data indicates a flow direction of NE-SW for the fracture-dominated aquifer.

25|$|Subsidence {{occurs when}} {{too much water}} is pumped out from underground, deflating the space below the above-surface, and thus causing the ground to collapse. The result can look like craters on plots of land. This occurs because, in its natural {{equilibrium}} state, the hydraulic pressure of groundwater in the pore spaces of the aquifer and the <b>aquitard</b> supports some {{of the weight of}} the overlying sediments. When groundwater is removed from aquifers by excessive pumping, pore pressures in the aquifer drop and compression of the aquifer may occur. This compression may be partially recoverable if pressures rebound, but much of it is not. When the aquifer gets compressed, it may cause land subsidence, a drop in the ground surface. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana is actually below sea level today, and its subsidence is partly caused by removal of groundwater from the various aquifer/aquitard systems beneath it. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the San Joaquin Valley experienced significant subsidence, in some places up to 8.5 metres (28 feet) due to groundwater removal. Cities on river deltas, including Venice in Italy, and Bangkok in Thailand, have experienced surface subsidence; Mexico City, built on a former lake bed, has experienced rates of subsidence of up to 40cm (1'3") per year.|$|E
2500|$|An aquifer {{is called}} semi-confined when a {{saturated}} layer {{with a relatively}} small horizontal hydraulic conductivity (the semi-confining layer or <b>aquitard)</b> overlies a layer with a relatively high horizontal hydraulic conductivity so that the flow of groundwater in the first layer is mainly vertical {{and in the second}} layer mainly horizontal.|$|E

40|$|In large {{sedimentary}} basins with {{layers of}} different rocks, the groundwater flow between aquifers depends on the hydraulic conductivity (K) of the separating low-permeable rocks, or <b>aquitards.</b> Three methods were developed to evaluate K in <b>aquitards</b> for areas with limited field data: • Coherence and harmonic analysis: estimates the regional-scale K based on water-level fluctuations in adjacent aquifers. • Cokriging and Bayes' rule: infers K from downhole geophysical logs. • Fluvial process model: reproduces the lithology architecture of sediment formations which {{can be converted to}} K. These proposed methods enable good estimates of K and better planning of further drillholes...|$|R
25|$|Semi-confined {{aquifers}} {{with one}} or more <b>aquitards</b> work as an anisotropic system, even when the separate layers are isotropic, because the compound Kh and Kv values are different (see hydraulic transmissivity and hydraulic resistance).|$|R
2500|$|There are two end {{members in}} the {{spectrum}} of types of aquifers; confined and unconfined (with semi-confined being in between). Unconfined aquifers are sometimes also called water table or phreatic aquifers, because their upper boundary is the water table or phreatic surface. (See Biscayne Aquifer.) Typically (but not always) the shallowest aquifer at a given location is unconfined, meaning {{it does not have}} a confining layer (an <b>aquitard</b> or aquiclude) between it and the surface. The term [...] "perched" [...] refers to ground water accumulating above a low-permeability unit or strata, such as a clay layer. This term is generally used to refer to a small local area of ground water that occurs at an elevation higher than a regionally extensive aquifer. The difference between perched and unconfined aquifers is their size (perched is smaller). Confined aquifers are aquifers that are overlain by a confining layer, often made up of clay. The confining layer might offer some protection from surface contamination.|$|E

50|$|In the Perth area, the Yarragadee Aquifer {{is located}} beneath the Leederville Aquifer, which itself is located beneath two {{superficial}} aquifers {{known as the}} Gnangara Mound and Jandakot Mound.

50|$|In the {{vicinity}} where the three ice lobes began to retreat, sits the recharge areas that allow surface water to enter {{back into the}} ground source. The speed of absorption depends on the density of aquifers and <b>aquitards.</b> Aquifers {{are made up of}} sand, gravel and silt where the water filters down relatively quickly. The shallow aquifers feed area bodies of water such as creeks and streams while the deeper aquifers feed down to replenish the ground water. The <b>aquitards</b> are the protective layers of clay that slowly filters the water and act to protect the main source from contamination. Left on its own, it is a naturally renewable way to gather fresh drinking water.|$|R
40|$|Groundwater is {{now being}} {{considered}} as an alternative water supply in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) because of the increasing demand for fresh water coupled with deterioration in river water quality {{as a result of}} rapid urbanization and industrialization. There are thick <b>aquitards</b> in the PRD as a result of several times transgression and regression in the Holocene. This study considers this <b>aquitards</b> as a research object because it has {{a significant impact on the}} underneath confined aquifer. It is necessary to analyze the hydraulic properties of the <b>aquitards.</b> A slug-test is a reasonable method to determine the hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of the low-permeability <b>aquitards</b> of silt and clay in the PRD. In this study, several slug-test methods were used to determine the hydraulic parameters of <b>aquitards</b> in several piezometers at the key site MZ 04 in the PRD. The results from these methods were compared to obtain the most reasonable group of hydraulic parameters. A reasonable equivalent numerical method is applied at the key site MZ 04 site after the calibration with the C-B-P solution and the KGS model. The natural groundwater regime is obtained, which is helpful for the further research. A three-dimensional numerical model using MODFLOW is carried out under some assumptions and the simplification for the sediments structure. The characteristics of regional groundwater flow and the influence of hydraulic properties of the aquifer-aquitard system on groundwater flow were analyzed. The simulated groundwater level both in the unconfined aquifer and confined aquifer agree reasonably well with the observed data. Study on the water budget of the groundwater showed that the quantity of ground water discharged from participation to participate the water exchange is very small. In the groundwater participated water exchange, 97 % of them flow into rivers, while only 3 % of them flow into the sea. Moreover, the vertical flow is more important than the horizontal flow to the regional ground water balance in <b>aquitards</b> according to the water budget obtained from the model. The research of the PRD needs numerous data due to the complicated deposition and evolution process of the sediments and the intensive river network. The modeling results are preliminary because of the complexity of the geological and hydrogeological conditions in the PRD and the limitation of the observed water level data. The hydraulic parameters calculated for this study and the model results can provide a basis for further research on groundwater in the PRD. published_or_final_versionEarth SciencesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Simulating {{flow and}} {{transport}} in layered geologic media comprising aquifers and <b>aquitards</b> still represents {{a challenge to}} current finite-difference modeling techniques. In aquifers, the flow direction is usually horizontal and accurate simulation requires a sufficiently fine horizontal discretization. In <b>aquitards,</b> the flow direction is often vertical which requires grid refinement in the vertical direction. In such a situation, three-dimensional grids typically require {{tens of thousands of}} grid blocks. To address such problems, the ground-water simulator SWIFT 11 was enhanced to include a dynamic coupling option. When using this technique, the aquifers are discretized into normal finite-difference grids. However, the <b>aquitards</b> are discretized into columns of one-dimensional vertical subgrids, which are condensed from the main solution matrix. Dynamic coupling reduces the matrix of a full aquifer-aquitard system to the order and band width of the individual aquifer matrices, resulting in a significant reduction of memory requirements and execution time. Dynamic coupling was successfully applied in the context of developing and optimizing the aquifer remediation plan for a chemical-plant site in Tacoma, Washington. Past production of an arsenic-based herbicide has resulted in arsenic contamination of the groundwater beneath the plant. A remediation plan was developed to provide a longterm solution to the ground-water contamination. The enhanced version of SWIFT 11 was used to simulate three-dimensional ground-water flow and arsenic transport during and subsequent to the aquifer remediation...|$|R
