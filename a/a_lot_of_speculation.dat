HYPERONS AND DIBARYONS IN NEUTRON STARS There has been <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>speculations</b> about the appearance of new particles in the interior of neutron stars. A traditional neutron star consists of neutrons, protons, and leptons only. Cameron suggested first in 1959, that hyperons will also appear at high baryon density [1]. A possible phase transition to quark matter was conjectured shortly after the quark model was introduced [2]. Pion condensation [3] as well as kaon condensation were considered later [4]. Finally, strange stars, built out of absolutely stable strange quark matter, have been studied within the MIT bag model [5, 6]. The appearance of one or the other exotic phase in the core of neutron stars is still a matter of active debates.

40|$|EPAs {{between the}} EU and ACP {{countries}} {{can be viewed}} as being anti mercantilist and there has been <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>speculations</b> about their outcome. The aim of the study is {{to determine the effects of}} the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) between the European Union (EU) and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) members using Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) version 7. Two scenarios are analysed: first when the other SACU member states sign the EPAs with the EU excluding South Africa and secondly when the entire SACU member states including South Africa sign a full EPA with the EU. Results show that South Africa does stand to lose when the other member states sign. However, signing of the EPA of the SACU as a bloc, including South Africa result in welfare gain in the region. Significantly, there is an increased export of livestock and processed foods to the EU from SACU region meaning that the region stands to gain in promoting these industries after an EPA. Besides these two sectors, most of the other sectors tend to lose out. It should be noted that full benefits of trade liberalisation agreements depend on speed of industry reform and therefore can only be realised in the long run. ...|$|R
