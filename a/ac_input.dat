25|$|The simple {{half-wave}} rectifier {{can be built}} in two electrical configurations with the diodes pointing in opposite directions, one version connects the negative terminal of the output direct to the AC supply and the other connects the positive terminal of the output direct to the AC supply. By combining both of these with separate output smoothing {{it is possible to}} get an output voltage of nearly double the peak <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> voltage.

25|$|Vibrating reed electrometers use a {{variable}} capacitor formed between a moving electrode (in {{the form of}} a vibrating reed) and a fixed input electrode. As the distance between the two electrodes varies, the capacitance also varies and electric charge is forced {{in and out of the}} capacitor. The alternating current signal produced by the flow of this charge is amplified and used as an analogue for the DC voltage applied to the capacitor. The DC input resistance of the electrometer is determined solely by the leakage resistance of the capacitor, and is typically extremely high, (although its <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> impedance is lower).|$|E

25|$|Modern {{electronic}} ballasts usually {{change the}} frequency of the power from a standard mains frequency of 50 or 60 Hz up to 40 kHz or higher, often using a Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) circuit topology with Power Factor Correction (PFC). First the <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> power is rectified to DC, and then it is chopped at a high frequency to improve the power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a film capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In the picture at right, the flat grey rectangular component {{in the middle of the}} ballast circuit is a polyester film capacitor used for PFC.|$|E
25|$|Cascaded diode and {{capacitor}} stages can {{be added}} to make a voltage multiplier (Cockroft-Walton circuit). These circuits are capable of producing a DC output voltage potential up to about ten times the peak <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> voltage, in practice limited by current capacity and voltage regulation issues. Diode voltage multipliers, frequently used as a trailing boost stage or primary high voltage (HV) source, are used in HV laser power supplies, powering devices such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) (like those used in CRT based television, radar and sonar displays), photon amplifying devices found in image intensifying and photo multiplier tubes (PMT), and magnetron based radio frequency (RF) devices used in radar transmitters and microwave ovens. Before the introduction of semiconductor electronics, transformerless vacuum tube receivers powered directly from AC power sometimes used voltage doublers to generate roughly 300VDC from a 100–120V power line.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} this is to use two {{capacitors}} in series for the output smoothing on a bridge rectifier then place a switch between the midpoint of those capacitors and one of the <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> terminals. With the switch open, this circuit acts like a normal bridge rectifier. With the switch closed, it act like a voltage doubling rectifier. In other words, this makes it easy to derive a voltage of roughly 320V (±15%, approx.) DC from any 120V or 230V mains supply in the world, this can then be fed into a relatively simple switched-mode power supply. However, for a given desired ripple, the value of both capacitors must be twice the value of the single one required for a normal bridge rectifier; when the switch is closed each one must filter the output of a half-wave rectifier, and when the switch is open the two capacitors are connected in series with an equivalent value of half one of them.|$|E
