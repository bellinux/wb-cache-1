50|$|The {{advanced}} ultra-light aeroplane (AULA) {{category is}} similar, but not identical, to the American light sport <b>aircraft</b> (LSA) <b>category.</b> Many <b>aircraft</b> are available as AULAs in Canada and LSAs in the United States.|$|R
25|$|In July 2012 {{the company}} {{announced}} its solution, that the design would {{be removed from the}} US light-sport category and moved to the primary <b>aircraft</b> <b>category.</b> Primary category acceptance would have included type and production certificates and would have allow the aircraft to be sold in Europe after the certification was validated. Primary Category certification was never completed.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{thoroughly}} {{studied the}} relationship between transport <b>category</b> <b>aircraft</b> and aircraft engine type certification. The installation consideration in aircraft engine certification {{and the use of}} substantiation data provided by engine manufacture in transport <b>category</b> <b>aircraft</b> certification were discussed. The potential certification principles for domestic civil aircraft certification program were proposed. And finally, the vision of future cooperation and coordination between domestic aircraft and engine certification offices was presented...|$|R
40|$|Current {{air traffic}} control target symbols are {{holdover}} designs developed for obsolete display technology to depict radar surveillance uncertainty. Given new technological capabilities and new surveillance techniques, {{it is time to}} reexamine the target symbology {{for a new generation of}} {{air traffic control}} displays. Symbicons (Smallman, St. John, Oonk, and Cowen, 2001 a, 2001 b) are a combination of icons and symbols that code meaningful information using simplified visual coding. This assessment focuses on creating and evaluating novel designs for target symbicons for Terminal Radar Approach Control displays while incorporating human factors standards and best practices. In this study, we evaluated different candidate symbicons that conveyed information such as <b>aircraft</b> <b>category</b> and <b>aircraft</b> conformance. We examined the heuristics controllers use that make certain symbicons better candidates to represent different <b>aircraft</b> <b>categories.</b> We discuss the almost universal agreement among the controllers for the tested aircraft conformance symbicons...|$|R

40|$|Noise {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{concerns}} of airports around the world. Several measures have been taken by regulators to reduce noise at airports. Some of these measures are meant to control noise at major or busy airports; however, certain operational restrictions (quota, curfew, and budget) are also implemented throughout the whole country regardless of the role and the size of the airports. An empirical example, using the Rotterdam Airport, a regional airport in the Netherlands, illustrates how regional airport should determine its night surcharges policies, especially with different type of <b>aircraft</b> <b>categories.</b> In this research, the night surcharges received from Business Jet <b>category</b> and Commercial <b>aircraft</b> <b>category</b> are being compared. The results indicate that the night surcharges did not compensate for the number of day time flight movements and potential revenues losses. Regional airport may need to be more selective in setting the night surcharges in order to maximise its revenues. Aerospace Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} algorithm is presented, {{based on the}} well-known algorithm for the traveling salesman problem, for scheduling aircraft arrivals into major terminal areas. The algorithm permits, but strictly limits, reassigning an aircraft from its initial position in the landing order. This limitation is needed so that no <b>aircraft</b> or <b>aircraft</b> <b>category</b> is unduly penalized. Results indicate, for the mix of arrivals investigated, a potential increase in capacity in the 3 to 5 percent range. Furthermore, it is shown that the computation time for the algorithm grows only linearly with problem size...|$|R
