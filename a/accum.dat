5|$|Probably {{the best}} known {{pictorial}} representation of <b>Accum</b> was an engraving by James Thomson made in July 1820 for the English journal European Magazine. It shows <b>Accum</b> {{sitting at a table}} close to a gas lamp. Thomson's engraving was probably based on an oil painting by the London portrait painter Samuel Drummond (1765–1844), who had shown <b>Accum</b> in a similar pose in a painting produced a few years prior to this. In addition, Accum's brother-in-law, the artist Wilhelm Strack, painted an oil portrait that shows <b>Accum</b> as a young man.|$|E
5|$|A few letter {{fragments}} and documents relating to <b>Accum</b> still exist in his family's possession. A certificate from the Gesellschaft naturforschender Freunde (society of natural philosophical friends), based in Berlin and granting honorary membership to <b>Accum,</b> dated November 1, 1814, was made available online in 2006. A letter from <b>Accum</b> written in London and addressed {{to his brother}} Philipp in Bückeburg, about life in London {{after the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars, is also available online at Wikisource.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Christian <b>Accum</b> or Frederick <b>Accum</b> (March 29, 1769 – June 28, 1838) was a German chemist, {{whose most}} {{important}} achievements included {{advances in the}} field of gas lighting, efforts to keep processed foods free from dangerous additives, and the promotion of interest in the science of chemistry to the general populace. From 1793 to 1821 <b>Accum</b> lived in London. Following an apprenticeship as an apothecary, he opened his own commercial laboratory enterprise. His business manufactured and sold a variety of chemicals and laboratory equipment. <b>Accum,</b> himself, gave fee-based public lectures in practical chemistry and collaborated with research efforts at numerous other institutes of science.|$|E

Cole, <b>Accum's</b> biographer states that this book, System of Theoretical and Practical Chemistry, [...] "was the first text-book of general chemistry {{written in the}} English language {{to be based on}} Lavoisier's new principles; it is outstanding, also, in that it is written in a popular style, the subject matter being graduated as with a modern text-book." ...|$|R

5|$|The second {{characteristic}} {{was that}} <b>Accum</b> did not limit {{his campaign to}} simply exposing problems. At {{the end of every}} chapter, he included names of merchants of who had in years prior to 1820 been caught adulterating foodstuffs. In this way, <b>Accum</b> tried to deprive them of business and thereby had an effect on the London economy.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of new laboratory apparatus, <b>Accum</b> positioned himself in the middle market range with respect to cost and usability. <b>Accum</b> developed portable laboratory kits, intended for farmers, for the analysis of soils and stones. With affordable prices ranging from three to eighty pounds sterling, these chests were the first truly portable laboratories.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after {{settling}} down in Berlin, <b>Accum</b> had a house built at 16 Marienstraße (later 21 Marienstraße), where he dwelt until his death. During his last years, he suffered from {{a bad case of}} gout, which ultimately led to his death. His illness took a serious turn for the worse in June 1838, and he rapidly deteriorated. On June 28, approximately 16 years after he return to Germany, <b>Accum</b> {{died at the age of}} 69 in Berlin. He was buried there at the Dorotheenstädtischen Friedhof.|$|E

5|$|<b>Accum</b> {{held his}} first lecture on {{chemistry}} and mineralogy {{in a small}} room in his house on Old Compton Street. His audience grew so rapidly that he soon had to rent the Medical Theatre on Cork Street. After resigning from the Royal Institution and taking a new position with the Surrey Institution, he continued with his popular lectures. An advertisement in The Times on January 6, 1809 indicates that <b>Accum</b> offered a course on mineralogy and the chemical analysis of metals every Wednesday evening.|$|E
5|$|For his {{customers}} in London, <b>Accum</b> compiled and distributed {{a catalog of}} his merchandise for sale. This catalog was also sent to other locales upon request.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{upon his}} arrival in Germany, <b>Accum</b> went {{to the town of}} Althaldensleben. There, the {{industrialist}} Johann Gottlob Nathusius had acquired various estates and was using them to found a sprawling industrial settlement. Nathusius was a German pioneer in the field of sugar production from beets, and had established a factory for its production in that town between 1813 and 1816. It was probably Nathusius’ extensive library and chemical laboratory that drew <b>Accum.</b> He remained only a short time in Althaldensleben, however, as he soon got a professorship at the Gewerbeinstitut and the Bauakademie in Berlin. His teaching in the areas of physics, chemistry, and mineralogy, were collected in the two volume work, Physische und chemische Beschaffenheit der Baumaterialien, deren Wahl, Verhalten und zweckmässige Anwendung, published in Berlin in 1826. It was the only work <b>Accum</b> published originally in German.|$|E

5|$|The Magistrate {{after hearing}} {{the whole of the}} Case {{observed}} that however valuable the books might be from which the leaves found in Mr <b>Accum’s</b> house had been taken, yet the leaves separated from them were only waste paper.

50|$|The second seminar, a week later, {{focused on}} 19th century {{research}} on food chemistry, notably Friedrich <b>Accum's</b> Culinary Chemistry (1821) and {{the writings of}} Justus Liebig. The third meeting became a general discussion of cookery books in their historical context. On this occasion Elizabeth David enunciated the rule-of-thumb {{that it takes a}} generation (a minimum of 25 years) for a newly devised dish to pass from the kitchen to the written record. Claudia Roden joined the group on 11 May; by 18 May participants included Jane Grigson, Elizabeth Lambert Ortiz, Sri Owen and the Dutch food writers Berthe Meijer and Titia Bodon.|$|R
5|$|In 1811, {{when the}} Parisian saltpetre {{manufacturer}} Bernard Courtois made iodine {{for the first}} time from the kelp ash, his discovery was greeted with great interest by experts. <b>Accum</b> was among the first chemists in England to undertake experiments to isolate iodine. In two articles published in Tilloch's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814, <b>Accum</b> described the iodine content of different kinds of seaweed and gave a detailed account of a process for iodine production.|$|E
5|$|Intrigued by {{the work}} of Frederick Winsor, who had been championing the {{introduction}} of gas lighting in London, <b>Accum</b> too, became fascinated by this innovation. At the request of the Gas Light and Coke Company, he carried out many experiments in this novel field of inquiry. After a time of close working association with this company, he became a member of its board of directors in 1812. The company was charged with founding the first gasworks in London to supply gas lighting to both private and public areas. <b>Accum</b> was instrumental in the conception and design of this extremely successful gasworks.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Accum's publications {{were written in}} English. They were executed in a style that made them quite accessible to the common man. Many scientific contributions were brought forth through his writings, which were influential in the popularization of chemistry during this era. In 1820, <b>Accum</b> published Treatise on Adulteration of Food, in which he denounced the use of chemical additives to food. This ground-breaking work {{marked the beginning of}} an awareness of need for food safety oversight. <b>Accum</b> {{was the first person to}} tackle the subject and to reach a wide audience through his activities. His book, controversial at the time, found a wide audience and sold well. However, it threatened established practices within the food processing industry, earning him many enemies among the London food manufacturers. <b>Accum</b> left England after a lawsuit was brought against him. He lived out the rest of his life as a teacher at an industrial institution in Berlin.|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of the ESP Culture System II (ESP II; <b>AccuMed</b> International, Westlake, Ohio), a continuously monitoring, nonradiometric mycobacterial culture system, for recovery of mycobacteria from sediments of blood collected in an Isolator tube was evaluated by comparing its performance to inoculation of the sediment onto Middlebrook 7 H 11 / 7 H 11 selective biplates. Of 1, 704 blood specimens, 73 (4. 3 %) were positive for mycobacteria (68 Mycobacterium avium complex and 5 M. tuberculosis). Fifty-three specimens were positive by both methods; 13 were positive by ESP II only, and 7 were positive by Middlebrook agar only (chi square = 1. 8; P > 0. 05). The mean times to positivity were 15. 6 days for ESP II and 19. 0 days for Middlebrook agar (P < 0. 01). The time to detection was the same for 13 specimens; ESP II was positive first for 33, and agar plates were positive first for 7. ESP II allowed recovery of more mycobacteria (90. 4 % of all isolates versus 82. 2 % for Middlebrook agar) from sediments of blood specimens collected in Isolator tubes, and it provided significantly faster detection than did Middlebrook plates...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} developed ESP Culture System II (<b>AccuMed,</b> Chicago, Ill.) was compared with radiometric BACTEC 460 TB (Becton Dickinson, Towson, Md.) and with Lowenstein-Jensen medium for recovery of mycobacteria from over 2, 500 clinical specimens both of respiratory and nonrespiratory origin, including blood. The {{majority of the}} 219 mycobacterial isolates (129) belonged to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, followed by 37 isolates of the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and 53 isolates of eight other mycobacterial species. Rates of recovery obtained with BACTEC, ESP, and Lowenstein-Jensen medium were 89, 79, and 64 %, respectively, with such differences being statistically significant. Different media and systems appeared to behave differently when the more frequently detected organisms were considered: M. tuberculosis complex isolates grew better with BACTEC, and MAC isolates grew better with ESP. An analysis of the combinations of Lowenstein-Jensen medium with BACTEC and with ESP did not reveal significant differences in recovery rates. With regard to the times needed {{for the detection of}} positive cultures, they were significantly longer on Lowenstein-Jensen medium (average, 28 days) than with the remaining two systems, between which there was no difference (average, 18 days). We conclude, therefore, that the ESP system, when used in combination with a solid medium, performs as well as the thoroughly validated radiometric BACTEC system and offers the advantages of full automation and absence of radioisotopes...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} optimal method for testing the susceptibilities of 100 clinical isolates and two reference strains of Enterococcus spp. to vancomycin in vitro. Six testing methods were studied by using the following media and incubation times: agar screen with the Synergy Quad Plate (Remel, Lenexa, Kans.), an in-house-prepared brain heart infusion (BHI) agar plate, and an in-house-prepared Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plate, all incubated for 24 or 48 h; broth microdilution (Sensititre Just One Strip; <b>AccuMed</b> International, Inc., West Lake, Ohio) with BHI or cation-adjusted MH broth incubated for 24 or 48 h; agar dilution with BHI or MH agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; epsilometer test (E test; AB BioDisk, Solna, Sweden) with BHI or MH agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; disk diffusion with BHI or MH agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; and the automated Vitek method with the gram-positive susceptibility Staphylococcus aureus card and R 02. 03 software (bioMerieux, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.). Growth failures occurred with MH media (n = 6) but not with BHI media. One growth failure occurred with the Vitek method. Results for each testing method for each Enterococcus strain were interpreted as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant according to current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) criteria and compared to the vancomycin resistance genotype (i. e., vanA, vanB, vanC- 1, or vanC- 2 / 3). For all methods, extension of the incubation time from 24 h to 48 h either produced {{no difference in the}} results or gave poorer results. The following methods produced no very major or major interpretive errors: broth microdilution with BHI media incubated for 24 h, agar dilution with BHI media incubated for 24 or 48 h, and E test with BHI media incubated for 24 or 48 h. Unacceptable frequencies of very major errors (> 1 %) occurred with all methods for which MH media were used. Minor interpretive errors were frequent with all methods. These minor interpretive errors also occurred most frequently with Enterococcus strains with vanC genes, which encoded low-level vancomycin resistance (MIC or = 64 microg/ml). Modification of NCCLS breakpoints, especially for motile Enterococcus spp. (E. casseliflavus, E. flavescens, and E. gallinarum), may resolve this problem; however, in the current study, one E. faecalis strain and one E. faecium strain carried only the vanC gene. The agar screen method may also require reformulation. The current agar screen plate contains 6 microg of vancomycin per ml, which may not detect all low-level resistance associated with vanC genotypes. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of this low-level vancomycin resistance remains unknown...|$|R
5|$|By 1803, <b>Accum</b> had {{published}} {{a series of}} articles in Nicholson's Journal, which discussed a number of subjects: investigating methods to determine the purity of medicines, determining the existence of benzoic acids in vanilla extract, observing the explosivity of sulphur-phosphorus mixtures.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{completely}} reprinted {{the minutes}} of an extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution of December 23, 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5, 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books <b>Accum</b> had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small {{hole in the wall}} of the reading room to watch <b>Accum</b> from an adjoining room. On the evening of December 20, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see <b>Accum</b> tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson’s Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages were indeed discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.|$|E
5|$|In March 1801, Frederick <b>Accum</b> {{was offered}} a {{position}} at the Royal Institution in Ablemarle Street, a research institute founded two years earlier by Count Rumford. Accepting the position, he began as laboratory assistant to Humphry Davy, who had been hired {{at the same time}} as director of the laboratory, and would later become the president of the Royal Society. Accum’s employment at the Royal came to an end in September 1803. His biographer, R. J. Cole, speculates this change was connected with the simultaneous departure of Count Rumford for employment in Paris. Rumford had been the driving force behind securing a position for <b>Accum.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{two years}} before his return to Germany, <b>Accum</b> had {{published}} {{a number of books}} dealing with nutrition chemistry. In 1820, he published two works, one on beer production (A Treatise on the Art of Brewing) and another on wine (A Treatise on the Art of Making Wine). The following year appeared Culinary Chemistry, in which <b>Accum</b> provided practical information about the scientific basis of cooking. He also published a book on bread (A Treatise on the Art of Making Good and Wholesome Bread). Even when he had returned to Germany, his works continued to be reprinted and were translated into French, Italian and German, reaching a wide readership in Europe, {{as well as in the}} US after it was reprinted there.|$|E
5|$|In 1820 <b>Accum</b> {{began the}} public {{struggle}} against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some additives derived from plants, {{and used as}} preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern. The production and distribution of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals {{and the absence of}} laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health. <b>Accum</b> was the first to publicly proclaim the hazards of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.|$|E
5|$|His {{increasing}} interest in mineralogy {{at this time}} is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals, which was reissued in 1808 as A Manual of Analytical Mineralogy. In 1809 he published Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Mineralogy. Beginning in 1808, while at the Surrey Institution, <b>Accum</b> also published, {{a series of articles}} on the chemical properties and composition of mineral water in Alexander Tilloch's Philosophical Journal.|$|E
5|$|Mr <b>Accum</b> acquaints the Patrons and Amateurs of Chemistry that he {{continues}} to give private Courses of Lectures on Operative and Philosophical Chemistry, Practical Pharmacy and the Art of Analysis, {{as well as to}} take Resident Pupils in his House, and that he keeps constantly on sale in as pure a state as possible, all the Re-Agents and Articles of Research made use of in Experimental Chemistry, together with a complete Collection of Chemical Apparatus and Instruments calculated to Suit the conveniences of Different Purchasers.|$|E
5|$|The first biographical {{sketch of}} Friedrich Accum's life {{was written by}} the American {{agricultural}} chemist and historian of science Charles Albert Browne, Jr. in 1925. He studied the life and works of <b>Accum</b> closely for ten years, which {{he was able to}} complement with information from civil and ecclesiastical sources in Bückeburg. His enthusiasm for the subject was so great that he traveled to Germany in July 1930 to meet with Hugo Otto Georg Hans Westphal (August 26, 1873 – September 15, 1934), a great-grandson of Accum's. Brown's last writing on the subject, which appeared in 1948 in Chymia, a journal for the history of chemistry, relied to a great extent on the information he gathered from Hugo Westphal. Three years later, R. J. Cole published an outline of Accum's life based on English sources. He was particularly concerned with bringing new information to light about the judicial process of 1821. Like Browne, Cole also provided relatively little data about the last part of Accum's life in Berlin. A modern presentation of Accum's life and works that fills in the lacuna in the available biographies has not been written. Lawson Cockroft of the Royal Society of Chemistry in London observed that Friedrich <b>Accum</b> was one of those chemists who, despite significant achievements in his lifetime, was by and large forgotten today.|$|E
5|$|The {{process that}} {{ultimately}} led to Accum's departure from England and return to Germany began {{a few months after}} the publication of his book on the poisoning of foodstuffs. For a long time, many contradictory accounts have been given of the exact circumstances of his exile. Finally in 1951, Cole, in an addendum to the minutes of Royal Institution, proved that the presentation of the events adopted in the article in the Dictionary of National Biography, and also later in the Allgemeinen Deutschen Biographie (according to which <b>Accum</b> was embroiled in charges of embezzlement as librarian of the Royal Institution and escaped to Germany), did not correspond to the facts.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Accum's {{establishment}} was {{the only}} significant institution in England that provided lectures on the theory of chemistry as well as training in laboratory practice. Amateurs were welcome to perform simple experiments on site to enhance their knowledge. Accum's teachings attracted various prominent students. These included the well-known London politician and later prime minister Lord Palmerston, the Duke of Bedford, and the Duke of Northumberland. Additionally, his laboratory {{was the first in}} Europe to be visited by students and scientists from the United States, among whom were Benjamin Silliman and William Dandridge Peck. When Silliman later became Professor of Chemistry at Yale College (precursor to Yale University) in New Haven, he ordered his first laboratory equipment from <b>Accum</b> in London. Accum's biographer, Charles Albert Browne, stated in his 1925 work that some of the older American colleges still had sales receipts from Accum's London business.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of the year 1799, a {{translation}} of Franz Carl Achard's ground-breaking work on the production of sugar from beets appeared in Nicholson's Journal. Until that time, sugar cane, which was grown overseas, was the only plant from which sugar could be derived. This information made possible the creation of a domestic sugar industry, and was greeted with great interest. A short time after the article's publication, <b>Accum</b> had samples of beet sugar sent from Berlin, and presented them to William Nicholson. This was the first time sugar derived from beets had ever been present in England. Following his careful analysis of both types of sugar, Nicholson published a detailed report in the January edition of his journal, stating that there was no appreciable difference in taste between the two.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Institution {{committee}} that met on December 23, 1820 was not, however, satisfied with this judgment, {{and decided to}} take further legal action against <b>Accum.</b> On January 10, 1821, an open letter directed to Earl Spencer, {{the president of the}} Institution, appeared in The Times defending <b>Accum.</b> The letter was signed [...] "A.C", and Cole supposed that the author was the surgeon Anthony Carlisle, who had been friends with <b>Accum</b> since {{the first years of the}} latter's stay in London. This unsought support availed <b>Accum</b> little, as the minutes of the Royal Institution from April 16, 1821 show. These report the commencement of a lawsuit against <b>Accum</b> for theft of paper valued at 14 pence. Two of his friends were included in the indictment: the publisher Rudolph Ackermann and the architect John Papworth. These three appeared in court and paid altogether 400 pounds sterling as surety. <b>Accum</b> did not make an appearance at the court session. He had fled England and returned to Germany.|$|E
