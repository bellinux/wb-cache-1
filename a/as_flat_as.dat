500|$|However, {{the show}} did {{come in for}} some criticism. San Jose Mercury News criticized the plot and the casting saying that [...] "the storylines usually involve the {{obligatory}} three-episode-arc drug problems or lost virginity with dialogue designed to keep a dog up to speed", and that [...] "Whoever at FOX thought Benjamin McKenzie (Ryan on [...] "The O.C.") could pass for anything younger than 25 should be fired". A DVD review was critical of the repetitive plot stating that [...] "the Ryan-Marissa fol-de-rol gets tiresome as it devolves into relentless bad timing", while Entertainment Weekly did not think the acting was always up to scratch, stating [...] "it's unfortunate to have all this potential for arm-flinging drama invested in Barton, an actress who can be <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> <b>as</b> a paper doll".

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Bob Strauss {{offered the}} game effusive praise, writing: [...] "If you liked playing with toy {{soldiers}} as a kid, you'll think you've {{stepped on a}} land mine and gone to heaven". Strauss believed that its cutscenes, voice clips and [...] "nonstop action" [...] served to [...] " [...] the usually stodgy war game genre". After highlighting its multiplayer and citing its installation process as [...] "the coolest [...] I've ever seen", he concluded that the game [...] "makes other war simulations look <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> <b>as</b> Risk." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation called it [...] "a game that any strategy fan has to pick up." [...] While complaining {{at the lack of}} a high-resolution mode, he applauded the gameplay for its combination of simple and intuitive control with deep and complex strategy, and said the full motion video cutscenes add considerably to the game's depth. He also complimented the soundtrack and fast pace. Peter Smith of Computer Games Magazine called Command & Conquer [...] "an adrenaline rush in a box", writing: [...] "Everything about this game shouts quality." [...] Smith lauded the game's music and sound effects, gameplay and story, and even its install program. Smith noted some minor problems, citing issues with the game's artificial intelligence, but finished by saying that [...] "Westwood has really raised the bar with this one." [...] Chris Hudak of GameSpot wrote: [...] "Starting from the load-screens and straight on 'til morning, Command & Conquer is one of the finest, most brilliantly-designed computer games I have ever seen." ...|$|E

[...] The bowling crease was smaller in those days, which restricted their angles of attack. He pointed out that he had used a larger ball and had smaller stumps to bowl at.

[...] "Flat Earthism" [...] lingered longest in Syriac Christianity, which tradition laid greater importance on a literalist interpretation of the Old Testament.

2500|$|Regardless of {{the advice}} of his bowlers Ted Dexter {{preferred}} to continue with the successful bowling attack from Melbourne, and may have been swayed by the Australians who dropped Peter Burge and Ken Mackay in favour of debutants Barry Shepherd and Colin Guest. Mackay was a loyal - if dour - servant of Australia and a great man in a crisis, but public opinion was vocal against his stonewalling and he and Burge were unfairly blamed for the defeat at Melbourne. The inclusion of the energetic captain of Western Australia pleased the England team, who had tried to play him into the Tests, but kept getting him out. Colin Guest was a fast-medium bowler who was brought into to support Alan Davidson and Garth McKenzie instead of Mackay. That Richie Benaud was content with three pace bowlers and the leg-spin of himself and Bobby Simpson on his home ground signalled that the wicket was not <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> <b>as</b> Trueman thought. Dexter was never a man to favour spinners and was disinclined to include the out-of-form David Allen or Ray Illingworth in the team. John Murray's neatness behind the stumps was finally recognised and he replaced the much criticised Alan Smith as wicket-keeper.

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} {{instalment}} of the series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Voldemort {{appears at the}} start and {{the climax of the}} book. Rowling lets many seemingly unrelated plot elements fall into order. It is revealed that Voldemort's minion Barty Crouch Jr, disguised as Hogwarts professor Mad-Eye Moody, has manipulated the events of the Triwizard Tournament in Harry's favour. Voldemort's goal is to teleport Harry under Dumbledore's watch as a reluctant participant to the Little Hangleton graveyard, where the Riddle family is buried. Harry is captured and, after Pettigrew uses Harry's blood to fulfil a gruesome magical ritual, Voldemort regains his body and is restored to his full power. For {{the first time in the}} series, Rowling describes his appearance: [...] "tall and skeletally thin", with a face [...] "whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was <b>as</b> <b>flat</b> <b>as</b> a snake’s with slits for nostrils". Rowling writes that his [...] "hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cat's, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness". It was revealed that, while in Albania, Pettigrew had captured the Ministry of Magic official Bertha Jorkins, who was tortured for information about the Ministry. After they learned that Barty Crouch Jr, a faithful Death Eater, had been smuggled out of Azkaban and was privately confined at his father's house, they killed her. With Pettigrew's help, Voldemort creates a small, rudimentary body, corporeal enough to travel and perform magic, and formulated a plan to restore his own body by capturing Harry. A portion of the plan had been overheard by Frank Bryce, a gardener, whom Voldemort then killed. Voldemort then completes his plan and returns to life in his full body as a result of the ritual with Harry's blood. He then summons his Death Eaters to the graveyard to witness the death of Harry as he challenges Harry to a duel. However, when Voldemort duels Harry, their wands become magically locked together due to the twin Phoenix feather cores of the wands. Because of a phenomenon later revealed as Priori Incantatem, ghost-like manifestations of Voldemort's most recent victims (including Harry's parents) then appear and distract Voldemort, allowing Harry just enough time to escape via Portkey with the body of fellow-student, Cedric Diggory, who was murdered by Pettigrew on Voldemort's orders.|$|E
