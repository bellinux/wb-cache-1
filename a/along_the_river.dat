5|$|In 2008, Groundwork Hudson Valley, the {{coordinator}} of the Saw Mill River Coalition, received a three-year, $889,183 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Targeted Watershed Grant. One of 15 recipients from a nationwide pool of more than 100 applicants, the group cleans up garbage, removes invasive species, and plants native trees <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> The group also marks storm drains that drain to the river. On September 25–26, 2009, the Saw Mill River Coalition organized a BioBlitz to catalog species of plant life, animal life, insects, fungi, and bacteria in the river and its watershed. The Coalition is also looking to restore the wetlands <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> {{in order to reduce}} flooding.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, a private American ship {{became the first}} {{non-indigenous}} vessel to enter the river; {{it was followed by}} a British explorer, who navigated past the Oregon Coast Range into the Willamette Valley. In the following decades, fur trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route. Overland explorers entered the Willamette Valley through the scenic but treacherous Columbia River Gorge, and pioneers began to settle the valley in increasing numbers. Steamships <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> linked communities and facilitated trade; the arrival of railroads in the late 19th century, many running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> supplemented these links.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Desert Archaic Culture {{were the}} {{earliest}} known inhabitants of the region; an archaeological site found <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> dates back 3,000 years. Mormon pioneers led by Brigham Young were the first European American settlers, arriving in July 1847 and establishing farms and settlements <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> and its tributaries. The growing population, needing water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use in an arid climate, dug ditches and canals, built dams, and installed pumps to create a highly regulated river.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{invasive}} plants live {{along the}} Saw Mill River. Porcelain berry is a vine with white berries that wraps around native trees and strangles them. Oriental bittersweet is also present <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> {{and it is}} slowly displacing the native American bittersweet. Oriental bitterweet can also form hybrids with the native bittersweet and making identification harder. Japanese honeysuckle and Japanese knotweed are two other invasive vines native to Asia. In addition, purple loosestrife, a perennial herb with magenta flower stalks, is also present <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b>|$|E

Major cities <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> include Jackson in Wyoming, Twin Falls, Idaho Falls, Boise, and Lewiston in Idaho, and the Tri-Cities in Washington (Kennewick, Pasco and Richland).
