5|$|Alprazolam {{is mostly}} {{used to treat}} <b>anxiety</b> disorders, panic disorders, and nausea due to chemotherapy. Alprazolam may also be {{indicated}} {{for the treatment of}} generalized <b>anxiety</b> disorder, {{as well as for the}} treatment of <b>anxiety</b> conditions with co-morbid depression. The FDA label advises that the physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anxiety</b> {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for <b>anxiety</b> disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of <b>anxiety</b> disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized <b>anxiety</b> disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of <b>anxiety.</b> In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute <b>anxiety.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} <b>anxiety</b> disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized <b>anxiety</b> disorder (GAD) or social <b>anxiety</b> disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the <b>anxieties,</b> the self-acceptances and the ego-identities in Japanese and Chinese college students, and to clarify the relationships among their <b>anxieties,</b> self-acceptances and ego-identities. The subjects were 928 Japanese college students and 866 Chinese college students. The following results were obtained: (1) Japanese college students had higher <b>anxieties</b> than Chinese college students. (2) The positive <b>anxieties</b> were higher than the negative <b>anxieties</b> in both Japanese and Chinese students. (3) Chinese students had higher self-acceptances than Japanese students. (4) The self-acceptances had positive correlations with the positive <b>anxieties</b> and negative correlations with the negative <b>anxieties,</b> and the self-denials had positive correlations with the negative <b>anxieties</b> in both Japanese and Chinese students. (5) About the ego-identity, there were more Japanese students in identity achievement, moratorium, or identity diffusion status than Chinese students. However, there were more Chinese students in identity achievement-foreclosure intermediate or foreclosure status than Japanese students. (6) Both Japanese and Chinese students in identity diffusion status had the highest negative <b>anxieties</b> and the lowest positive <b>anxieties.</b> And, the both students in identity achievement status had the highest positive <b>anxieties...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pioneering work of {{modelling}} financial <b>anxieties</b> {{was given}} by Kimura et al (1999) as psychological change of people due to financial shocks. Since they regressed financial position (easy or tight) by nonstationary interest rate, their results exhibit high peaks not only in financial crisis period of 1997 and 1998, {{but also in the}} bubble economy period of 1987 to 1989, which seems to be a spurious regression. Furthermore, defining financial <b>anxieties</b> as the conditional variance in TARCH model, one of estimated coefficients did not satisfy sign condition. We got rid of these difficulties by introducing a growth rate model, where a change of financial position (toward ''tight'') under a change of interest rate (toward ''fall'') is regarded as financial <b>anxieties.</b> Such <b>anxieties</b> are quantified by conditional variance of EGARCH model and shown to be stationary.

5|$|While benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{short-term}} benefits for <b>anxiety,</b> sleep and agitation in some patients, long-term (i.e., greater than 2–4 weeks) use {{can result in}} a worsening of the very symptoms the medications are meant to treat. Potential explanations include exacerbating cognitive problems that are already common in <b>anxiety</b> disorders, causing or worsening depression and suicidality, disrupting sleep architecture by inhibiting deep stage sleep, withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms in between doses mimicking or exacerbating underlying <b>anxiety</b> or sleep disorders, inhibiting the benefits of psychotherapy by inhibiting memory consolidation and reducing fear extinction, and reducing coping with trauma/stress and increasing vulnerability to future stress. <b>Anxiety,</b> insomnia and irritability may be temporarily exacerbated during withdrawal, but psychiatric symptoms after discontinuation are usually less than even while taking benzodiazepines. Fortunately, for those with benzodiazepine-induced problems, functioning significantly improves within 1 year of discontinuation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anxiety</b> {{disorders}} are {{a group of}} mental disorders characterized by feelings of <b>anxiety</b> and fear. <b>Anxiety</b> is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a fast heart rate and shakiness. There {{are a number of}} <b>anxiety</b> disorders: including generalized <b>anxiety</b> disorder, specific phobia, social <b>anxiety</b> disorder, separation <b>anxiety</b> disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. People often have more than one <b>anxiety</b> disorder.|$|E
25|$|People facing <b>anxiety</b> may {{withdraw}} from situations which have provoked <b>anxiety</b> in the past. There are {{various types of}} <b>anxiety.</b> Existential <b>anxiety</b> can occur when a person faces angst, an existential crisis, or nihilistic feelings. People can also face mathematical <b>anxiety,</b> somatic <b>anxiety,</b> stage fright, or test <b>anxiety.</b> Social <b>anxiety</b> and stranger <b>anxiety</b> are caused when people are apprehensive around strangers or other people in general. Furthermore, <b>anxiety</b> has been linked with physical symptoms such as IBS and can heighten other mental health illnesses such as OCD and panic disorder. The {{first step in the}} management of a person with <b>anxiety</b> symptoms is to evaluate the possible presence of an underlying medical cause, whose recognition is essential in order to decide its correct treatment. <b>Anxiety</b> symptoms may be masking an organic disease, or appear associated or {{as a result of a}} medical disorder.|$|E

40|$|Researchers have {{identified}} a trend of brain waste, brain abuse and brain drain {{on the part of}} internationally educated professionals (IEPs) after they immigrate to Canada. University-based bridging programs have been implemented in the past decade to meet the need of this population to integrate to the new society. My dissertation attempts to inquire into the experiences, emotional experiences in particular, of the IEPs who studied in the university-based bridging programs in Ontario. I raised four questions: First, how do the IEPs perceive their new realities? Second, what are the <b>anxieties</b> of the IEPs? Third, what realities lead them to those <b>anxieties</b> and how do their <b>anxieties</b> affect their perception of the challenges they face? Fourth, what role does higher education play in mirroring and shaping the way the IEPs perceive and feel the realities? Using in-depth interviewing as the research method, I had three one-hour interviews with each of the five research participants who volunteered in this study. When analyzing the five cases, I focused on the conflicts, contentions and contradictions that the interview transcripts revealed of the participants experiences in relation to others. I resorted to theories in psychoanalysis {{in order to understand the}} IEPs <b>anxieties</b> when they encountered various challenges both internally and externally. I find that the IEPs <b>anxieties</b> are partly inherent in the process of immigration, partly reflective of their own modes of learning and the need of external support and partly the side effect of higher education which, questionably, attempts to reproduce the correlation between knowledge and privileges. I argue that the bridging programs and the IEPs need to learn from their <b>anxieties</b> and the social <b>anxieties</b> and engage in a critical exploration of the difficult knowledge of the-self-in-the-changing-world...|$|R
