5000|$|During the Abbasid Caliphate, {{practically}} all Islamic traditional texts <b>about</b> <b>Islam's</b> beginnings were written.

5000|$|Diana Lodderhose of OPEN said, [...] "...the film {{explores the}} {{universal}} theme {{of love and}} generational conflict between the daughters’ ideas and their parents.

5000|$|Starting {{point for}} all {{researchers}} is the awareness {{that the traditional}} Islamic accounts <b>about</b> <b>Islam's</b> beginnings which came into being only 150 to 200 years after Muhammad are highly questionable as historical sources. The true events in early Islamic times have to be newly researched and reconstructed {{with the help of}} the historical-critical method.

25|$|In his lecture, the Pope, {{speaking}} in German, quoted a passage <b>about</b> <b>Islam</b> {{made at the}} end of the 14th century by Byzantine (Eastern Roman) emperor Manuel II Palaiologos.

25|$|The term Sufism {{came into}} being, not by Islamic texts or Sufis {{themselves}} but by British Orientalists {{who wanted to}} create an artificial divide between what they found attractive in Islamic civilization (i.e. Islamic spirituality) and the negative stereotypes that were present in Britain <b>about</b> <b>Islam.</b> These British orientalists, therefore, fabricated a divide that was previously non-existent. The term Sufism has, however, persisted especially in the Western world ever since.|$|E

25|$|On 21 March 2011, Oktar started {{television}} broadcasting on A9 satellite channel where his interviews and night lectures are broadcast live. His TV programs have gotten considerable attention from both Turkish and international media for its 'weirdness', {{and in particular}} for featuring what {{is referred to as}} his 'kittens', his female devotees.

25|$|Islam came to China {{during the}} Tang dynasty via Iranian traders, who were {{primarily}} concerned with trading and commerce and less concerned with spreading Islam. This low profile is indicated by the 845 anti-Buddhist edict during the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution that said nothing <b>about</b> <b>Islam.</b> It seems that trade rather than evangelism occupied {{the attention of the}} early Muslim settlers; that while they practised their faith in China, they did not campaign against Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, or the State creed, and that they constituted a floating rather than a fixed element of the population, coming and going between China and the West.|$|E

50|$|The {{arguments}} against {{the credibility of}} the classical Islamic traditions <b>about</b> <b>Islam's</b> beginnings were e.g. summarized by Prof. Hans Jansen in his work De Historische Mohammed. Jansen discusses chapter by chapter the depictions in the prophet's biography by Ibn Ishaq resp. Ibn Isham which is an important text for traditional Islam. Jansen reveals self-contradictions, contradictions to other historical sources, embellishments by later authors, politically or theologically motivated distortions of the depiction, symbolic meanings of allegedly historical names, literary construction of the depiction according e.g. to biblical models, and chronological and calendrical incredibilities.|$|R
