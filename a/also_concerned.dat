5|$|ATMOS is {{marketing}} {{a satellite}} navigation system developed by young prodigy Luke Rattigan (Ryan Sampson). The system also reduces {{carbon dioxide emissions}} to zero; UNIT requested the Doctor's help because the technology is not contemporary and might be alien. UNIT are <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> about fifty-two simultaneous deaths occurring spontaneously several days earlier. The Doctor travels to Rattigan's private school to investigate the system and discovers that the recent events have been plotted by an alien warrior race known as the Sontarans.|$|E
5|$|After opening, {{a long-running}} feud between {{the hotel and}} Lord Wimbourne, a steel magnate who lived next door at Wimbourne House, lasted for years {{in a dispute over}} land. A number of locals were <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> about the {{building}} and the impact it would have on their health.|$|E
5|$|Although Maryland {{remained}} in the Union, secessionist sentiment {{and support for the}} Confederacy was widespread in that state. Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> about the possibility of sabotage to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause derailment and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> with easing {{overland}} {{transport of}} goods to Virginia. In mid-1795, he, Robert Barr, Elijah Craig, and Harry Toulmin formed a committee {{to raise funds for}} a road connecting the Cumberland Gap to central Kentucky. Breckinridge was disappointed with the quality of the route, which was finished in late 1796, concluding that the individual maintaining it was keeping most of the tolls instead of using them for the road's upkeep.|$|E
5|$|He was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> by {{reports of}} the {{invasion}} of Kiska in the Aleutian Islands in August 1943, in which a large Allied force invaded an island {{that had already been}} evacuated by the Japanese. If this could happen, it was also possible that a force might attack where the Japanese were unexpectedly strong. Different levels of command sometimes came up with widely varying estimates of Japanese strength because they used different methods to estimate it.|$|E
5|$|Krikler {{comments}} that Mansfield's conclusions ignored the ruling precedent of his predecessor, Matthew Hale, that {{the killing of}} innocents {{in the name of}} self-preservation was unlawful. This ruling was to prove important a century later in R v Dudley and Stephens, which <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> the justifiability of acts of murder at sea. Mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle—that no insurance claim can be legal if it arose from an illegal act.|$|E

5|$|The law had its detractors, {{even among}} those groups {{protected}} by it. Puritans were concerned that the act and the proprietary government in general were royalist. They were <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> that by swearing allegiance to Calvert, who was Catholic, they were being required {{to submit to the}} Pope, whom they considered to be the antichrist. Some Anglicans also opposed the law, believing that the Church of England should be the colony's sole established church.|$|E
5|$|While the {{controversy}} raged, American Presbyterians were <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> with expanding their influence. In 1740, a New York Board of the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge was established. Four years later, David Brainerd was assigned as a missionary to the Native Americans. New Side Presbyterians {{were responsible for}} founding Princeton University (originally the College of New Jersey) primarily to train ministers in 1746.|$|E
5|$|AI {{behavior}} in Halo Wars 2 drew some criticism. Some reviewers described the pathfinding of units as substandard, and others considered the enemy AI {{to be too}} easy and not very smart on the normal difficulty setting. IGN reviews editor Dan Stapleton disliked that bases had to placed in predetermined locations; he {{found it to be}} limiting and said it constrained build order freedom. Rock, Paper, Shotgun writer Fraser Brown was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> about the restrictions on base building initially, however he became fond of the idea after playing the game for some time.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{served as}} a Ruling Elder at the Presbyterian General Assembly of 1832, then {{relocated}} to Princeton, New Jersey, to study under Samuel Miller at Princeton Theological Seminary. In November 1832, he succeeded his brother John as pastor of Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland. His tenure saw numerous converts, but he was put at odds with his brother and Samuel Miller over practices employed in his church. His counselors were <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> that he was wavering on {{his belief in the}} doctrine of limited atonement. Eventually, he was persuaded back into the doctrines of the orthodox Calvinism and became {{one of the leaders of}} the Old School Presbyterian movement.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist {{scholars}} living {{during the}} time of the Liao dynasty predicted that the mofa (末法), an age in which the three treasures of Buddhism would be destroyed, was to begin in the year 1052. Previous dynasties, including the Sui and Tang, were <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> with the mofa, although their predictions for when the mofa would start were different from the one selected by the Liao. As early as the Sui dynasty, efforts were made to preserve Buddhist teachings by carving them into stone or burying them. These efforts continued into the Liao dynasty, with Emperor Xingzong funding several projects in the years immediately preceding 1052.|$|E
5|$|By 24 May, the Germans had {{captured}} {{the port of}} Boulogne and surrounded Calais. The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under Generalmajor Rudolf Veiel built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to Dunkirk. On 23 May, Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks {{and the question of}} supply to his forward troops. He was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> that the marshy ground around Dunkirk would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30–50 percent). Hitler was also apprehensive, and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{projects}} such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct. Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis, under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Al-Kateb {{appealed the}} {{decision}} against {{him to a}} Full Court of the Federal Court, hoping that the reasoning applied in the Al Masri case (which was factually similar to his situation) would be applied to him. The appeal was removed into the High Court {{at the request of}} the then Attorney-General of Australia Daryl Williams, under provisions of the Judiciary Act 1903. Pending the appeal, Al-Kateb was released in April 2003, by an interlocutory consent order of the Federal Court. The case was argued alongside two other cases which <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> immigration detention and hearings were held on 12 November and 13 November 2003.|$|E
5|$|His {{policies}} ran {{afoul of}} the United Fruit Company, which lobbied the United States government to have him overthrown. The US was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> {{by the presence of}} communists in the Guatemalan government, and Árbenz was ousted in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état engineered by the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas replaced him as president. Árbenz went into exile through several countries, where his family gradually fell apart. His daughter committed suicide, and he descended further into alcoholism, eventually dying in Mexico in 1971. In October 2011, the Guatemalan government issued an official apology for Árbenz's overthrow.|$|E

50|$|There are <b>also</b> <b>concerns</b> about full {{disclosure}} of JCET activities to the U.S. Government from the armed forces, {{as the current}} reports to Congress (known as the Section 2011 report) {{are not required to}} mention JCET programs relating to counter-narcotic or anti-terrorism activities, however these form {{a large part of the}} worldwide JCET program, particularly in Latin America. There are <b>also</b> <b>concerns</b> that the report is incomplete due to problems with the definition of Joint Combined Exchange Training programs.|$|R
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, charges were printed in the April 16 issue of Close-Up, a celebrity tabloid, which claimed Aubrey was taking kickbacks from producers. The Federal Communications Commission made inquiries, and CBS learned that despite his $264,000 annual salary from the company, Aubrey's {{apartment}} on Manhattan's Central Park South was owned by Martin Ransohoff, the head of Filmways, the producer of the Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, Mister Ed, and other CBS programs. And though he had a chauffeur-driven car {{paid for by the}} network, Brasselle's Richelieu Productions was paying for another chauffeured car for Aubrey, done so Paley and Stanton would not know what Aubrey was doing after hours. CBS had not known of either the apartment or the car. The company was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> about the money spent to buy Gleason's former home.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the police}} focused their law {{enforcement}} efforts {{on dealing with}} the illegal consumption of alcohol, which was considered to promote violent behaviour among the First Nations. By the 1880s, however, the police also began to tackle horse theft. Horse stealing was common among the First Nations on the prairies: it formed part of intertribal competition and warfare, and the stolen horses enabled their hunting expeditions. In part the police crackdown was driven by the Department for Indian Affairs, who believed {{that the practice of}} horse theft was slowing the assimilation of the First Nations into broader Canadian society. The authorities were <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> that if the First Nations were allowed to steal horses from across the border in the United States, it could provoke a military intervention into Canada.|$|E
5|$|News of Barras' {{departure}} led the British {{to realize}} that the Chesapeake was the probable target of the French fleets. By 31 August, Graves had moved his five ships of the line out of New York harbor to meet with Hood's force. Taking command of the combined fleet, now 19 ships, Graves sailed south, and arrived {{at the mouth of the}} Chesapeake on 5 September. His progress was slow; the poor condition of some of the West Indies ships (contrary to claims by Admiral Hood that his fleet was fit for a month of service) necessitated repairs en route. Graves was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> about some ships in his own fleet; Europe in particular had difficulty manoeuvring.|$|E
