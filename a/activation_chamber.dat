With the main advantage of bringing some applications at industrial degree of feasibility. An example of process which benefits from this new process is silicon fusion bonding: by using plasma activation the bond process temperature and time are reduced at values which make wafer bonding compatible with industrial manufacturing requirements.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this thesis, a test stand Photo-CATCH for {{research}} on semiconductor photocathodes used at the spin-polarized electron injector of the superconducting Darmstadt electron linear accelerator S-DALINAC is constructed and brought into operation. Ultra-high vacuum conditions are achieved {{in all parts of the}} system. Atomic-hydrogen assisted low-temperature cleaning of cathodes in a chamber with base pressure better than 3 E- 11 mbar is used for preparing clean cathode surfaces for negative electron affinity (NEA) activation. Using a standardised activation procedure, atomic-hydrogen cleaning of heavily contaminated bulk-GaAs samples is optimized to an upper limit of 10 kL hydrogen-dosage. Cleaning of samples has been performed with a dosage as low as 0. 7 kL. Activation of photocathodes with Cs+O 2 and Cs+Li+O 2 have been studied in a dedicated vacuum chamber with base pressure better than 2 E- 11 mbar. By using a 405 nm laser, quantum efficiencies above 25 % have been achieved from an NEA-GaAs photocathode. Oxygen-induced quantum-efficiency degradation of NEA cathodes has been investigated. A vacuum lifetime of (298 +/- 35) hours was observed in the <b>activation</b> <b>chamber</b> for a novel two-stage activation using Cs, O 2 and Li. This system can provide photocathodes with high quantum efficiency and lifetime for polarized and unpolarized beam production at the 60 keV electron beamline of Photo-CATCH. Additionally, atomic-hydrogen cleaned cathode samples can be transported to the photoelectron source at S-DALINAC using a transport-vessel conceptualized in this work...|$|E

40|$|A new {{cryogenic}} optical testing capability {{exists at}} Marshall Space Flight Center's Space Optics Manufacturing Technology Center (SOMTC). SOMTC has been performing optical wavefront testing at cryogenic temperatures since 1999 in the X-ray Cryogenic Test Facility's (XRCF's) large vacuum chamber. Recently the cryogenic optical testing capability {{has been extended}} to a smaller vacuum chamber. This smaller horizontal cylindrical vacuum chamber has been outfitted with a helium-cooled liner that can {{be connected to the}} facility's helium refrigeration system bringing the existing kilowatt of refrigeration capacity to bear on a 1 meter diameter x 2 meter long test envelope. Cryogenic environments to less than 20 Kelvin are now possible in only a few hours. SOMTC's existing instruments (the Instantaneous Phase-shifting Interferometer (IPI) from ADE Phase-Shift Technologies and the PhaseCam from 4 D Vision Technologies) view the optic under test through a 150 mm clear aperture BK- 7 window. Since <b>activation</b> and <b>chamber</b> characterization tests in September 2001, the new chamber has been used to perform a cryogenic (less than 30 Kelvin) optical test of a 22. 5 cm diameter x 127 cm radius of curvature Si 02 mirror, a cryogenic survival (less than 30 Kelvin) test of an adhesive, and a cryogenic cycle (less than 20 Kelvin) test of a ULE mirror.

40|$|Two fungi growth {{chambers}} containing six growth tubes each {{are used}} in this experiment. One chamber is for the space experiment; the other is for the simultaneous ground control experiment. The hyphae of Neurospora crassa band A mutant are inoculated {{at one end of}} each tube. Both the chambers are kept at 3 C plus or minus 1. 5 C to stop hyphae growth until the Spacelab is activated. After the <b>activation,</b> each <b>chamber</b> is transferred simultaneously to the Spacelab and a phytotron in KSC and kept in continuous light at the same temperature. After about 24 hours of light exposure, each chamber is inserted into a growth chamber bag to keep it in constant darkness. The circadian rhythm of conidiation is initiated by this light to dark transition. After the dark incubation for 5 days at room temperature, both the growth chambers are kept at 3 C plus or minus 1. 5 C to stop growth of the hyphae. After the space shuttle lands, both conidiation patterns are compared and analyzed. It has been known that numerous physiological phenomena show circadian rhythms. They are characterized {{by the fact that the}} oscillation can persist under constant conditions of light and temperature. Therefore, it has been accepted by most investigators that the generation mechanism of the circadian rhythm is endogeneous. However, one cannot reject the possibility that these rhythms are caused by some geophysical exogeneous factor having a 24 -hour period, such as atmospheric pressure, gravity, or electromagnetic radiation. We use Neurospora crassa band A mutual which shows an obvious circadian rhythm in its spore-forming (conidiation) on the ground, and we intend to attempt the conidation of this mutant in the Spacelab where 24 -hour periodicity is severely attenuated and to elucidate the effect of the geophysical exogeneous factor in the generation mechanism of the circadian rhythm...|$|R
40|$|Maintenance of genome {{integrity}} in germ cells {{is crucial for}} the success of future generations. In Drosophila, and mammals, transposable element activity in the germline can cause DNA breakage and sterility. Recent studies have shown that proteins involved in piRNA (PIWI-interacting RNA) biogenesis are necessary for retrotransposon silencing in the Drosophila germline. Females mutant for genes in the piRNA biogenesis pathway produce eggs with patterning defects that result from Chk- 2 (checkpoint kinase- 2) DNA damage checkpoint activation. Here we show that large ribonucleoprotein aggregates form in response to DNA damage checkpoint <b>activation</b> in egg <b>chambers</b> of females defective in piRNA biogenesis. Aggregate formation is specific to piRNA biogenesis mutants, as other mutations that activate the same Chk- 2 -dependent checkpoint do not cause aggregate formation. These aggregates contain components of the dynein motor machinery, retrotransposon RNA, and protein and axial patterning RNAs. Disruption of the aggregates by colcemid treatment leads to increased retrotransposon RNA levels, indicating that these structures may be the destination of retrotransposon RNA transport and may be degradation or sequestration sites. We propose that aggregate formation is a cellular response to protect germ cells from DNA damage caused by elevated retrotransposon expression...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of the Bevalac facility of energetic heavy ions with range greater than the size of small mammals makes possible {{the determination of the}} biological effects of relatively well defined high LET, whole body irradiation. With the increasing application of high-energy heavy ions in radiobiology there is a corresponding need to develop reliable techniques of both relative and absolute absorbed dose measurement. This paper describes dosimetry studies by the Health Physics Department of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory with <b>activation</b> detectors, ionization <b>chambers,</b> nuclear emulsion, thermoluminescent dosimeters and X-ray film. The application of these techniques to an experiment designed to study the leukemogenic effect of the whole-body irradiation of mice by 250 MeV/amu carbon ions is briefly described. Values of absorbed dose in tissue, obtained during this experiment, with a nitrogen filled ionization chamber and $sup 7 $LiF thermoluminescent dosimeters are compared and shown to be in good agreement. As a result of this work a value for the average energy to produce an ion pair (W) in nitrogen by 250 MeV/amu $sup 6 +$C ions of 37 +- eV was determined. Values of the efficiency of $sup 7 $LiF relative to $sup 60 $Co $gamma$-rays for ions with dE/dx in the range 110 - 260 MeV g$sup - 1 $ cm$sup 2 $ are reported. (auth...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevention}} of pacemaker-mediated tachycardias requires a safe, reliable method for distinguishing retrograde from anterograde atrial <b>activation</b> by dual <b>chamber</b> pacemakers. In this study, a technique {{was developed to}} detect the morphological change that occurs in the waveform of the intra-atrial electrogram during retrograde atrial activation. The method employed for waveform analysis is based upon statistical correlation. In 19 patients undergoing electrophysiological studies, atrial electrograms were recorded from bipolar endocardial electrodes during sinus rhythm and 1 : 1 retrograde atrial depolarization while undergoing right ventricular pacing. Data were digitally sampled at 750, 1, 000, and 1, 500 Hz. Templates of anterograde atrial depolarization were constructed by signal averaging waveforms from an initial sinus rhythm passage. These were used for analysis of anterograde depolarizations from a subsequent passage of sinus rhythm and a passage of known retrograde atrial depolarization. In all 19 cases, a patient-specific threshold could be derived to separate anterograde from retrograde atrial depolarizations using 1, 000 Hz and 1, 500 Hz sampling rates. However, at a sampling rate of 750 Hz, separation of anterograde from retrograde atrial activation was possible in only 16 / 19 patients (84 %). We conclude that correlation waveform analysis of a suitably sampled atrial electrogram is a reliable method of discriminating retrograde atrial depolarization from anterograde atrial depolarization in intracardiac electrograms...|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerotic plaques develop {{preferentially}} in curved and branching arteries in-vivo. Lipids and {{inflammatory cells}} accumulation in the intimal {{layer of the}} arterial wall is considered as the main driving mechanism in the disease progression. Evidences suggest that this focal distribution of plaques may result from the combination of systemic risk factors including high plasma cholesterol, smoking, diabetis, hypertension or genetic pre-disposition and local hemodynamic risk factors such as low and oscillatory flows. The exact mechanism of the biological and biomechanical interactions between the endothelium, blood flow and the growing lesion underneath still remains unclear. This thesis is {{a study on the}} relationship between biomechanical factors found in proatherogenic flow and endothelial inflammation. The thesis focuses in particular on the effect of secondary flows on wall shear stress and mass transport distribution. To that end, we have combined different techniques from flow imaging, 3 D flow reconstruction, vascular biology and mathematical simulation of biological network. In particular, shear stress is involved in the regulation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor -kB (NF-kB) and the vasoregulator Nitric Oxide. The role of endothelial Nitric Oxide and wall shear stress on NF-kB activation is still controversial. We investigated here the hypothesis that NO negatively regulates NF- kB <b>activation</b> in flow <b>chamber</b> with sheared endothelial cells and using a mathematical model of the NF-kB-NO pathway. Understanding the underlying relationship between hemodynamic factors and inflammatory cells transport to the wall may {{contribute to the development of}} better therapies or interventional practices to treat patients with atherosclerotic diseases.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{rapid growth}} of tumor {{parenchyma}} leads to chronic hypoxia that can result {{in the selection of}} cancer cells with a more aggressive behavior and death-resistant potential to survive and proliferate. Thus, identifying the key molecules and molecular mechanisms responsible for the phenotypic changes associated with chronic hypoxia has valuable implications {{for the development of a}} therapeutic modality. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular basis of the phenotypic changes triggered by chronic repeated hypoxia. Methods Hypoxia-resistant T 98 G (HRT 98 G) cells were selected by repeated exposure to hypoxia and reoxygenation. Cell death rate was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method and protein expression levels were examined by western blot analysis. The invasive phenotype of the tumor cells was determined by the Matrigel invasion assay. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the expression of proteins in the brain tumor samples. The Student T-test and Pearson Chi-Square test was used for statistical analyses. Results We demonstrate that chronic repeated hypoxic exposures cause T 98 G cells to survive low oxygen tension. As compared with parent cells, hypoxia-selected T 98 G cells not only express higher levels of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl- 2, Bcl-X L, and phosphorylated ERK, but they also have a more invasive potential in Matrigel invasion <b>chambers.</b> <b>Activation</b> or suppression of ERK pathways with a specific activator or inhibitor, respectively, indicates that ERK is a key molecule responsible for death resistance under hypoxic conditions and a more invasive phenotype. Finally, we show that the activation of ERK is more prominent in malignant glioblastomas exposed to hypoxia than in low grade astrocytic glial tumors. Conclusion Our study suggests that activation of ERK plays a pivotal role in death resistance under chronic hypoxia and phenotypic changes related to the invasive phenotype of HRT 98 G cells compared to parent cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveVascular {{smooth muscle}} cell (SMC) {{migration}} {{is critical to}} the development of atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia. Hemodynamic forces such as shear stress and cyclic strain stimulate endothelial cell signal-transduction pathways, resulting in the secretion of several factors, including SMC chemoattractants such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). We hypothesized that mechanical forces stimulate endothelial cells to secrete SMC chemoattractants to induce migration via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. MethodsBovine aortic endothelial cells were exposed to shear stress, cyclic strain, or static conditions for 16 hours. The resulting conditioned medium was used as a SMC chemoattractant in a Boyden <b>chamber.</b> <b>Activation</b> of SMC extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) was assessed by Western blot analysis. Pathways were inhibited with anti-PDGF-BB or anti-interleukin- 1 α (IL- 1 α) antibodies, or the ERK 1 / 2 upstream pathway inhibitor PD 98059. ResultsConditioned medium from endothelial cells exposed to shear stress corresponding to arterial levels of shear stress stimulated SMC migration but lower levels of shear stress or cyclic strain did not. Both PDGF-BB and IL- 1 α were secreted into the conditioned medium by endothelial cells stimulated with shear stress. Both PDGF-BB and IL- 1 α stimulated SMC chemotaxis but were not synergistic, and both stimulated SMC ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of PDGF-BB or IL- 1 α inhibited SMC chemotaxis and ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation. ConclusionShear stress stimulates endothelial cells to secrete several SMC chemoattractants, including PDGF-BB and IL- 1 α; both PDGF-BB and IL- 1 α stimulate SMC chemotaxis via the ERK 1 / 2 signal-transduction pathway. These results suggest that the response to vascular injury may have a common pathway amenable to pharmacologic manipulation. Clinical relevanceOne difficulty in the pharmacologic treatment of atherosclerosis or neointimal hyperplasia leading to restenosis is the multiplicity of activated pathways and thus potential treatment targets. This study demonstrates that shear stress, a hemodynamic force that may be a biologically relevant stimulus to induce vascular pathology, stimulates endothelial cells to secrete PDGF-BB and IL- 1 α. Both of these mediators stimulate the SMC ERK 1 / 2 pathway to induce migration, a critical event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia. Therefore, this study suggests a relevant common target pathway in SMC that is amenable to manipulation for clinical treatment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Chronic {{activation}} of the sympathetic nervous system, via Î²-adrenoreceptor (AR) stimulation, contributes toward progressive heart failure. However, in this regard there are some outstanding issues which require clarity. First, in addition to contributing toward progressive heart failure, {{it is not clear}} whether chronic Î²-AR activation can also initiate cardiac decompensation. If so, the mechanisms of this effect also need to be determined. Second, the role of functional variants of Î²-AR genes as determinants of either the development or progression of heart failure requires elucidation. Moreover, whether there is any practical value in genotyping of patients for these variants has yet to be determined. These questions were addressed in the present thesis. With respect to the question of whether chronic Î²-AR activation initiates cardiac decompensation, the mechanisms responsible for the transition from compensated cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure in pressure overload states, such as hypertension, are uncertain. In this thesis I explored whether chronic sympathetic nervous system activation, produced by daily administration of a Î²-AR agonist, could promote the transition to cardiac pump failure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with compensated cardiac hypertrophy. After 5 months of daily administration of a Î²-AR agonist, SHR developed marked left ventricular pump dysfunction, whereas normotensive control rats maintained pump function. The pump dysfunction noted in SHR was attributed to marked chamber dilatation with wall thinning, whilst myocardial contractile function appeared to be intact. The changes in cardiac structure and function noted after chronic Î²-AR activation in SHR were similar to those noted in SHR with advanced heart failure. These data provided the first evidence to indicate that chronic Î²- AR activation can promote the transition to decompensated cardiac hypertrophy in pressure overload states, and that this effect is principally mediated by adverse structural remodeling of the cardiac chamber. iii The mechanisms responsible for the effect of chronic Î²-AR <b>activation</b> on cardiac <b>chamber</b> dilatation were subsequently studied. The identified mechanisms included {{activation of}} an enzyme that degrades myocardial collagen (matrix metalloproteinase 2) and an increase of myocardial collagen of the type that is susceptible to collagen degradation (non-cross-linked collagen). I also excluded alternative potential mechanisms such as necrosis, apoptosis and an accumulation of type III collagen. However, previous studies have indicated that increases in myocardial collagen concentrations determine myocardial stiffness and not cardiac chamber dilatation. Hence, I performed a study to examine whether the impact of increases in myocardial collagen concentrations on cardiac structure and function depends on the qualitative changes in myocardial collagen. Indeed, using a variety of models of pressure overload hypertrophy associated with increases in myocardial collagen concentrations, I was able to provide evidence to support the theory that increases in myocardial collagen of the cross-linked phenotype will promote myocardial stiffness, whereas increase in myocardial collagen of the non-cross-linked phenotype promotes cardiac dilatation. With respect to the question of whether functional variants of Î²-AR genes contribute toward either the development or progression of heart failure, I studied the role of both functional Î² 1 -AR and Î² 2 -AR (together with a Î± 2 C-AR) gene variants in black South Africans with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). In a prospective study I obtained data to indicate that the relationship between functional Î² 2 -AR genotypes and the progression to hospitalization, death or transplantation; a reduced exercise capacity, and left ventricular functional responses to b-blocker therapy, as described by other groups, is unlikely to be attributed to an independent effect of genotype on cardiac chamber dimensions and pump function. Moreover, I was able to show that contrary to what had previously been suggested, genotyping black subjects for functional Î± 2 C-AR iv and Î² 1 -AR gene variants is of little use when predicting the development or severity of IDC in this population group...|$|R
