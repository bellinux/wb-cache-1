40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a Swedish national experiment with different types of Intelligent Speed Adaptation, 300 vehicles are being equipped with an <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> in the city of Lund. The <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> provides drivers with counter-force whenever they try to exceed the pre-set speed limit. During the experiment the equipment will be continuously set on the actual speed limit. The vehicles will also be equipped with digital maps with all the speed limits within the city limit and a GPS system. Both private- and company cars, including professional drivers will participate in the trial. All vehicles will be equipped with data logging facilities. The selection of the test drivers is made by age groups, gender and attitude to the <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> (positive and negative). An extensive evaluation will be carried out in order to study driver behaviour, acceptance and effects on safety, travel time and the environment. In {{order to be able to}} observe any attitude changes in the city, surveys with 750 citizens are carried out before the start of the project and after the project has been realised. In order to study driver reactions and behaviour, in-car observations with the help of “Wiener fahrprobe” will be carried out. In order to see any changes in the attitude and acceptance of the test drivers, they will be interviewed when recruited, during the test drives and after the trial. A number of drivers will also be asked to fill in a diary every day on their driving. Driving data will be logged in the test cars and speed profiles, gas pedal activity, travel time and exhaust emissions will be analysed. In order to measure possible system effects, a number of studies will be carried out in the field: traffic counting, speed measurements, observations of interactions between road-users, observation of frequency in driving against red. Accidents in the city also will be analysed. Similar studies will be carried out in a control city in order to be able to see if possible changes in Lund are due to the ISA-equipped cars...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the Swedish national trial with Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) in urban areas, 284 cars have been equipped with an <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> for a period of up to 11 months in the city of Lund. When evaluating the effects of the system, there is a special interest in the behavioural adaptation effects the system might bring. Alongside data-logging and interaction studies, in-car observations was used to study this. Twenty-eight drivers have been studied by two observers in an instrumented vehicle during a 45 minute drive (33 km). The observations where carried out twice, before driving with active gas-pedal and after driving with it for 5 - 11 months. One of the observers carried out coding observations, which means he studied standardised behaviour such as yielding behaviour and speed adaptation. The other carried out free observations which means that he studied communication, interaction and events that occurred irregularly e. g. conflicts. One of the variables that where studied in this experiment was behaviour towards pedestrians / cyclists at crossings. The observers also registered yielding behaviour. Speed was of course of interest in this study and it was registered both by a data-logger and the observers. The use of an instrumented vehicle made it possible to study car-following distances with a laser-radar that measured the distance to the vehicle in front. No difference could be found in drivers ’ speed adaptation in low speed situations when they where driving with ISA. Behaviour towards other road users improved as well as car following and yielding behaviour improved so {{it was not possible to}} trace any sign of negative compensatory behaviour. Some indication on the occurrence of the phenomenon “delegation of responsibility ” to the system could be traced: in some cases the drivers forgot about the speed-limit outside the test area...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} ACC conceptions {{were evaluated}} with their different extent of driver support under human-machine aspects on {{the background of}} different situation specific influencing factors. In addition to the classical ACC concept, where the driver delegates within certain limits the distance and speed control completely to the system, a system is examined under the term 'Active Gas Pedal', which, while supporting the driver, leaves him involved in then longitudinal vehicle control. 16 subjects were selected independently and carried out a field test with both prototypes in balanced order. Findings: 1. the 'classical' conception is perceived as supporting particularly in traffic situations with low complexity. 2. unlike the 'classical' conception the extent of delegation during the longitudinal vehicle control with the <b>Active</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>Pedal</b> is lower, what is perceived as less comfortable. On the other hand {{it is expected that}} the 'Active Gas Pedal' has a positive effect on traffic safety. 3. a clear defined minority preferred the 'Active Gas Pedal' altogether, however, the data show a higher acceptance for the classical conception. 4. on the background of the limited sensor performance, especially in curves, the assessment concerning the production stage of both systems is quite reserved. The following consequences can be drawn: 1. the sensor performance should be optimized situation specifically (curve negotiation especially while overtaking vehicles on the right lane). 2. due to the situation specific complementary support function both concepts should be at the driver's disposal to choose the optimal extent of driver support. 3. the methodological approach (short term testing) has to be supplemented by long term testing.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation focuses on supporting drivers in the longitudinal control of their vehicle during car-following. The goal of the research is the human-centred development of a haptic <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> interface that comfortably supports drivers in maintaining a safe separation with a leading vehicle during car-following. Two different approaches {{were found to be}} suitable for implementation as haptic information providers through the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal.</b> The first approach was to add a force to the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> dynamics which would have {{to be related to the}} safe-field-of-travel ahead of the own vehicle and changes therein. The <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> dynamics, that is, the force/pedal-position relationship is not changed by this approach. The second approach was to change the stiffness of the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> by adding a virtual stiffness to the inherent stiffness of the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal.</b> By doing so, the dynamics of the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> are changed depending on the changes detected in the safe-field-of-travel. In both approaches, an electrical actuator provides the additional force or stiffness. The main hypothesis of this dissertation is the assumption that with the appropriate haptic feedback of longitudinal traffic information drivers will adopt a force-task in controlling the haptic <b>gas</b> <b>pedal.</b> Experimental verification leads to the conclusion that the stiffness feedback design with time-to-contact information scaled by time headway performs best in this respect.

40|$|A haptic <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> {{feedback}} system is developed that provides car-following information via haptic cues from the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal.</b> During normal car-following situations, the haptic feedback (HF) cues were sufficient to reduce control activity and improve car-following performance. However, in more critical following situations, drivers use the brake pedal to maintain separation with the lead vehicle. A deceleration control (DC) algorithm is designed that, {{in addition to}} the HF, provided increased deceleration upon release of the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> during car-following situations that required faster deceleration than releasing the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> alone would do. For the design, a driver model for car following in different situations was estimated from driving simulator data. A Monte Carlo analysis with the driver model yielded subjective decision points, where drivers released the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> to start pressing the brakes. This enabled the definition of a reaction field, which determined the needed deceleration input for the DC algorithm. The tuned DC algorithm was tested in a fixed-base driving simulator experiment. It was shown that the active deceleration support improved the car-following performance while reducing the driver brake pedal input magnitude in the conditions tested. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{literature}} suggests that haptic <b>gas</b> <b>pedals</b> can assist the driver in search of maximum fuel economy. This study investigated three haptic pedal designs, each with high and low intensities of feedback, in a rapid prototyping, paired comparison design. Twenty drivers took part, experiencing the systems in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Results suggested that drivers were best guided towards an “idealized” (most fuel efficient) <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> position by force feedback (where a driver feels a step change in <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> force) as opposed to stiffness feedback (where a driver feels a changing <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> firmness). In either case, high levels of force/stiffness feedback were preferred. Objective performance measures mirrored the subjective results. Whilst the short-term nature (brief system exposure) of this study led to difficulties in drawing longer-term conclusions, {{it would appear that}} force feedback haptics are better suited than stiffness feedback to augment an effective driver interface supporting “green” driving...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of accident data suggests that human distance control {{has to be}} supported. Within the framework of this study, a system was developed that permanently informs the driver about {{the distance to the}} vehicle in front. In contrast to the 'classical' ACC the system is not permanently involved in longitudinal control, but it warns and, if necessary, interferes. The driver information is realized by an optical display and the system intervention. is performed by an <b>Active</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>Pedal</b> and an Autonomous Brake System. The functional definition of single components and the complete system were developed and tested within three workpackages with a total number of nine experiments. The test method is based on standardized and 'free driving' tasks in real traffic. The integral of the difference between actual and desired distance was brought in as the main objective evaluation criterion of the quality of control. A non scaled and coloured (red, yellow, green) display based on the distance in seconds is preferred for distance information. Pushing back the gas pedal completely is preferred in contrast to the single kick as tactile warning. The driver should be able to deactivate the intervention system in certain situations, the force of pushing back the pedal should be adjustable and approximate 60 N. An early intervention with moderate deceleration is preferrd at the Active Brake System. Here, the sum-concept is recommended, where system's and driver's brake pressure are added, in contrast to the min-max-concept, which uses the maximum of driver's and system's brake pressure. A positive effect of the driver support system for distance control and with that for traffic safety was proved in different experiments. The concept is a supplement for permanent controlling ACC-Systems and reached a similar level of acceptance. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract- Visual cues {{that are}} {{relevant}} to safe car driving are generally not supported by redundant non-visual cues, resulting in increased accident risk when visual attention is misallocated. Haptic <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> feedback, also referred to as longitudinal impedance, may assist drivers in proper and timely reallocation of their visual attention. A solution is presented for translating the relevant two-dimensional situation in front of the driver into a total hazard level from which <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> feedback force is calculated. Car driving simulations, that include a RADAR-like sensor model and a human driver model, were performed for several highway maneuvers. The simulations indicated that the calculated <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> feedback force is a weighted mix of hazard-defining variables depending on the positions of the lead vehicles in front of the own vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Real-time, {{in-vehicle}} {{guidance on}} eco-driving {{is likely to}} produce substantial improvements in vehicle fuel economy. However, the benefits of such in-vehicle systems should be achieved without impairing driver safety. A simulator study evaluated both visual and haptic eco-driving feedback systems, which provided advice on <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> usage. Hill driving scenarios with variable traffic density were used to test drivers’ prioritization of safe and fuel-efficient driving. A visual, second-order display and a haptic force feedback <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> created the smallest errors in <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> usage and so maximized fuel efficiency. The visual display increased time spent looking away from the road, implying reduced driver safety. Participants were worse at eco-driving in more demanding, high traffic conditions. Drivers appeared to prioritize safety over eco-driving, however safety margins were shorter in the high density traffic condition, despite the degradation in eco-driving performance. The findings suggest which modality could be most appropriate for presenting in-vehicle eco-driving guidance, and hint that these systems should advise drivers based on the prevailing traffic conditions...|$|R

40|$|Enabling a {{humanoid}} robot {{to drive a}} car, requires {{the development of a}} set of basic primitive actions. These include: walking to the vehicle, manually controlling its commands (e. g., ignition, <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> and steering), and moving with the whole-body, to ingress/egress the car. In this paper, we present a sensor-based reactive framework for realizing {{the central part of the}} complete task, consisting in driving the car along unknown roads. The proposed framework provides three driving strategies by which a human supervisor can teleoperate the car, ask for assistive driving, or give the robot full control of the car. A visual servoing scheme uses features of the road image to provide the reference angle for the steering wheel to drive the car at the center of the road. Simultaneously, a Kalman filter merges optical flow and accelerometer measurements, to estimate the car linear velocity and correspondingly compute the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> command for driving at a desired speed. The steering wheel and <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> reference are sent to the robot control to achieve the driving task with the hu-manoid.
