5|$|The Ravens were {{volunteer}} Air Force {{officers who}} already had 500 flying hours (six months) as FACs in South Vietnam <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> serve six-month tours in Laos. There were {{always going to be}} shortages of both personnel and aircraft in the new program. Only six Ravens were assigned between 1966 and 1968 to control the ever-expanding amounts of U.S. airpower being utilized in Laos. Even {{at the height of the}} program, when they would control one-third to two-thirds of the tactical air strikes in the Barrel Roll area, there were never more than 22 Ravens.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} assigned labour quotas {{for each}} district to native commissioners across the territory {{who in turn}} called on local chiefs and headmen to provide workers. The tribal leaders decided who was required at the kraal <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> report to the district native commissioner for work. This system, known locally as the chibaro, cibbalo, isibalo or chipara—according to Charles van Onselen, synonymous etymologically with concepts ranging from contract labour to slavery—had been relatively widespread during Company rule (1890–1923), but {{had fallen out of}} use by the 1930s. Some tribal communities were resettled {{to make room for the}} airstrips.|$|E
5|$|The two generals {{came up with}} a plan, and Middleton {{was sent}} to six Army {{installations}} in Tennessee, Colorado, and Washington D.C. with a brief stopover to visit his family in Baton Rouge. Middleton would be taking command of VIII Corps in England, and was sent to the various locations to confuse the enemy about the personnel change. Accompanying him was a sergeant who had been a physical therapist in civilian life, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> massage Middleton's knees twice a day for the next year. When asked what staff he needed to take with him, Middleton replied that he would keep the staff that was already in place, except that for an aide he would like his old LSU friend, Mack Hornbeak, who had served with him through Sicily and Italy.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Fermi teamed up with a fellow student named Franco Rasetti with whom he would indulge in light-hearted pranks <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> later become Fermi's close friend and collaborator. In Pisa, Fermi was advised by the {{director}} of the physics laboratory, Luigi Puccianti, who acknowledged that there was little that he could teach Fermi, and frequently asked Fermi to teach him something instead. Fermi's knowledge of quantum physics reached such a high level that Puccianti asked him to organize seminars on the topic. During this time Fermi learned tensor calculus, a mathematical technique invented by Gregorio Ricci and Tullio Levi-Civita that was needed to demonstrate the principles of general relativity. Fermi initially chose mathematics as his major, but soon switched to physics. He remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, quantum mechanics, and atomic physics.|$|E

5|$|The {{last round}} of matches, {{featuring}} {{all three of}} the teams that had qualified for finals day, determined who went directly to the final, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> face off first in the semi-final. The Southern Vipers faced the Loughborough Lightning, and batting first a team effort saw them reach 156 for 4; Bates scored 38, Sara McGlashan got 34* and Lydia Greenway 29. Despite scores in the thirties from Perry and Evelyn Jones, a strong bowling performance from the Vipers, in which Linsey Smith and Brindle each took three wickets, saw them to victory by 59 runs. That victory guaranteed the Vipers a place in the final, while the Loughborough Lightning had to face Western Storm in a semi-final. The result of the other match that day was of no consequence to the tournament; Beth Mooney scored 56 runs for the Yorkshire Diamonds, who scored 118 runs. Anya Shrubsole finished the match with five wickets for the Western Storm, taking a four–wicket maiden in the final over of the match. Storm opening batsmen Taylor and Priest shared a 101-run partnership to take their side to the brink of victory before being dismissed from subsequent deliveries, but despite two further wickets, the Storm won by six wickets with 21 balls remaining.|$|E
5|$|To {{strengthen}} the puppet government, Danckelmann {{wanted to find}} a Serb who was both well-known and highly regarded by the population who could raise some sort of Serbian armed force <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be willing to use it ruthlessly against the rebels whilst remaining under full German control. In response to a request, the Foreign Office sent SS-Standartenführer Edmund Veesenmayer to provide assistance in establishing a new puppet government that would meet German requirements. Five months earlier, Veesenmayer had engineered the proclamation of the NDH. Veesenmayer engaged in a series of consultations with German commanders and officials in Belgrade, interviewed a number of possible candidates to lead the new puppet government, then selected former Yugoslav Minister of the Army and Navy General Milan Nedić as the best available. The Germans had to apply significant pressure to Nedić to encourage him to accept the position, including threats to bring Bulgarian and Hungarian troops into the occupied territory and to send him to Germany as a prisoner of war. Unlike most Yugoslav generals, Nedić had not been interned in Germany after the capitulation, but instead had been placed under house arrest in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|When {{deciding}} on Charlotte staff, Toba {{thought it would}} be better not to have exactly the same team that produced Angel Beats!. Having already decided to stick with Maeda, Na-Ga and P.A.Works, Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process, and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!. With that in mind, Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel Beats! <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> also be suitable as Charlotte director, leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai. Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel Beats!, and he thought that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first-time series director. Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments. When Horikawa first looked at Charlotte incomplete script, he told Maeda that it did not feel like it had the same kind of zeal that Angel Beats! had. However, once he saw the whole script, his concerns with it were dispelled, much to Maeda's relief.|$|E

25|$|Touch on / touch off {{has both}} {{benefits}} and costs.

25|$|One of {{the last}} major battles {{involving}} Vikings was the Battle of Clontarf on 23 April 1014, in which Vikings fought both for the Irish over-king Brian Boru's army and for the Viking-led army opposing him. Irish and Viking literature depict the Battle of Clontarf as a gathering of this world and the supernatural, including witches, goblins and demons. A Viking poem portrays the environment as strongly pagan, with chanting Valkyries deciding who would live <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> die.|$|E
