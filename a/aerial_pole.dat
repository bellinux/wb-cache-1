50|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war years, Queensland Police acquired wireless equipment from the Civil Defence Organisation, which {{was installed in}} a number of suburban police stations to receive broadcasts from station VKR. Improvements to the two-way transmission system in 1946-47 increased the coverage to a 60 miles radius of Police Wireless Station VKR. In the late 1940s a 70-foot <b>aerial</b> <b>pole</b> was erected in the Petrie Terrace Police Depot grounds to support transmitting aerials for the interstate police wireless service, which became increasingly important as a police tool.|$|E

50|$|Modern cables {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of sheathings and armor, {{designed}} for applications such as direct burial in trenches, dual use as power lines, installation in conduit, lashing to <b>aerial</b> telephone <b>poles,</b> submarine installation, and insertion in paved streets.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} {{land-based}} D/F stations preferred by the Allies in World War II was the U-Adcock system, {{which consisted of}} a small, central operators' hut that was surrounded by four 10 m vertical <b>aerial</b> <b>poles,</b> usually placed at the four compass points. Aerial feeders ran underground and {{came up in the}} centre of the hut and were connected to a direction finding goniometer and a wireless receiver, that allowed the bearing of the signal source to be measured. In the UK some operators were located in an underground metal tank. These stations were usually in remote places, often in the middle of farmers' fields. Traces of World War II D/F stations can be seen as circles in the fields surrounding the village of Goonhavern in Cornwall.|$|R

25|$|The choreography {{incorporates}} {{several types}} of acrobatics and martial arts, including fight scenes using the Wushu style of martial arts, Chinese opera, Poi for manipulating staves and batons, Brazilian Capoeira dance, bungees, <b>aerial</b> straps, swing <b>poles,</b> and a wheel of death.|$|R
25|$|Modern cables {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of sheathings and armor, {{designed}} for applications such as direct burial in trenches, high voltage isolation, dual use as power lines, installation in conduit, lashing to <b>aerial</b> telephone <b>poles,</b> submarine installation, and insertion in paved streets. Multi-fiber cable usually uses colored coatings and/or buffers to identify each strand. The cost of small fiber-count pole-mounted cables has greatly decreased due to the high demand for fiber to the home (FTTH) installations in Japan and South Korea.|$|R
50|$|The Condenser system {{equipment}} was located {{at each end}} of a telegraph line in the telegraph equipment rooms. This limited the installation works to easy accessible buildings and avoided work on the <b>aerial</b> lines and <b>poles</b> that may extend for many kilometers, 50 kilometers and longer were not unusual.|$|R
50|$|Even though Polish {{success was}} complete, the Germans quickly re-organized their defence, {{and called for}} <b>aerial</b> support. The <b>Poles,</b> on the other hand, did not have men {{experienced}} enough to utilise the captured equipment, and decided to destroy most of it with grenades. The 49th Hutsul Regiment managed to reach Lwów on September 19, and there it capitulated to the Red Army, together with Lwów's garrison.|$|R
50|$|Pole-mounted {{transformers}} {{often include}} accessories such as surge arresters or protective fuse links. A self-protected transformer includes an internal fuse and surge arrester; other transformers have these components mounted separately outside the tank. Pole-mounted transformers may have lugs allowing direct mounting to a pole, {{or may be}} mounted on crossarms bolted to the <b>pole.</b> <b>Aerial</b> transformers, larger than around 75 kVA, may be mounted on a platform supported {{by one or more}} poles. A three-phase service may use three identical transformers, one per phase.|$|R
5000|$|Fiber spans are {{fiber optic}} cables that connect two nodes. In practice, these cables are bundled on one {{concrete}} conduit or power/telephone <b>pole</b> (<b>aerial),</b> which creates a shared risk link Group. If, for example, {{if there is}} a cut on a fiber span, it takes down all circuits (upper layer logical links) that use that particular SRLG. The term SRLG may have first appeared in 2000. Early work (from 1990s) that considered SRLG (before the term was coined) in understanding implications due to SRLG, and designing for survivability and restoration by considering SRLG can be found in ...|$|R

50|$|Such a tour is {{currently}} being promoted and produced in the United Kingdom by The European Events Corporation, a company formed for this specific purpose. Since 1995, individual artistes {{have been able to}} take advantage of new post-Soviet freedoms to agree to terms and travel abroad. The current production, which began touring in April 2011, is entitled Babushkin Sekret ('Grandmother's secret') and is themed around the Russian story of The Twelve Chairs. There is a cast of twenty-seven performers, including clowns, acrobats and jugglers, and the show features a wide variety of acts that involve perch <b>pole,</b> static trapeze, <b>aerial</b> silk, chinese <b>pole,</b> and high wire techniques. The show climaxes with a spectacular chair balancing act involving a tower of chairs approximately 10 metres high.|$|R
50|$|Outside plant cabling, whether copper or fiber, is {{generally}} installed as <b>aerial</b> cable between <b>poles,</b> in an underground conduit system, or by direct burial.Hardware {{associated with the}} outside plant must be either protected from the elements (for example, distribution frames are generally protected by a street side cabinet) or constructed with materials suitable for exposure to the elements. Installation of the outside plant elements often require construction of significant physical infrastructure, such as underground vaults. In older large installations, cabling is sometimes protected by air pressure systems designed to prevent water infiltration. While {{this is not a}} modern approach, the cost of replacement of the older cabling with sealed cabling is often prohibitively expensive. The cabling used in the outside plant must also be protected from electrical disturbances caused by lightning or voltage surges due to electrical shorts or induction.|$|R
5000|$|The seventh anuvaka of Shiksha Valli is an {{unconnected}} lesson {{asserting that}} [...] "everything {{in this whole}} world is fivefold" [...] - sensory organs, human anatomy (skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow), breathing, energy (fire, wind, sun, moon, stars), space (earth, <b>aerial</b> space, heavens, <b>poles,</b> intermediate poles). This section does not contextually fit with the sixth or eighth lesson. It is the concluding words of the seventh anuvaka that makes it relevant to the Taittiriya Upanishad, by asserting the idea of fractal nature of existence where the same hidden principles of nature and reality are present in macro and micro forms, there is parallelism in all knowledge. Paul Deussen states that these concluding words of the seventh lesson of Shiksha Valli assert, [...] "there is parallelism between man and the world, microcosm and macrocosm, and he who understands this idea of parallelism becomes there through the macrocosm itself".|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} pole {{inspection}} system for outdoor environments comprising a high-speed camera on a {{vertical take-off and landing}} (VTOL) <b>aerial</b> platform. The <b>pole</b> inspection task requires {{a vehicle to}} fly close to a structure while maintaining a fixed stand-off distance from it. Typical GPS errors make GPS-based navigation unsuitable for this task however. When flying outdoors a vehicle is also affected by aerodynamics disturbances such as wind gusts, so the onboard controller must be robust to these disturbances {{in order to maintain the}} stand-off distance. Two problems must therefor be addressed: fast and accurate state estimation without GPS, and the design of a robust controller. We resolve these problems by a) performing visual + inertial relative state estimation and b) using a robust line tracker and a nested controller design. Our state estimation exploits high-speed camera images (100 Hz) and 70 Hz IMU data fused in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We demonstrate results from outdoor experiments for pole-relative hovering, and pole circumnavigation where the operator provides only yaw commands. Lastly, we show results for image-based 3 D reconstruction and texture mapping of a pole to demonstrate the usefulness for inspection tasks...|$|R
50|$|Laplante is {{originally}} from Canada {{and was a}} gymnast {{at the age of}} 6 years old. Before the age of 8, he had won numerous medals, many trophies and awards from various gymnastic and Judo competitions and events he participated in. He attended Herbert School in St. Francois; a sports and high school program designed for the Canadian Gymnastic Team at Polyvalent de Mortagne in Boucherville, and also had an orange belt in Judo. He trained in numerous circus disciplines including teeter board, bungee, Chinese <b>pole,</b> <b>Aerial</b> hoop, Russian swing, flying trapeze, and more. He was recruited by Cirque du Soleil when he was 16 years of age. He was with them for more than 10 years, performing around the world in shows such as Saltimbanco in Tokyo and the European Tour and O at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. In 2005, he was hired to create the show concept for Cirque Hawaii, with part of his duties including making the final decisions on casting, music, and scenery creation. He also worked as the acrobat consultant and head coach on House of Dancing Water directed by Franco Dragone which won a Thea Award in 2012 from the Themed Entertainment Association.|$|R
5000|$|The wooden hulled 42ft Watson {{featured}} a long tapering aluminium superstructure running {{forward from the}} aft cockpit. The forward part of this, ahead of the engine room, was a survivor cabin. A major departure from previous RNLI practice {{was the use of}} commercially available engines, in the form of two Gardner 4LW 4-cylinder marine diesels producing 48bhp each. The exhaust from the engines was taken up the forward mast, as with the later [...] boats. With the exception of the last boat, ON 967, which came four years after the previous example, all of the boats originally had open cockpits. In 1965, the first boat, ON 907, was given an enclosed wheelhouse and ON 937 followed in 1967. The others, {{with the exception of the}} [...] boat, had the wheelhouse enclosed in 1971. Aldeburgh's ON 946 was the only boat fitted with a mizzen mast, at the request of the crew, for a steadying sail in rough weather and was the only boat to retain an open cockpit to the end. The last boat built had an enclosed wheelhouse from the start. During the course of their service, the boats were fitted with radar and the original aerial rigging was replaced by a long <b>pole</b> <b>aerial.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The wooden hulled 46 ft 9in Watson-class {{was built}} in two {{different}} variations, with the first five closely resembling the preceding 46 ft type. From 1948 the design was completely revised to provide a midships steering position in an open cockpit. There was a large aft survivor cabin which also housed the radio. At the rear of this cabin was a small aft cockpit with a hatch for stretchers to be passed in and an emergency helm position. A smaller forward cabin gave access to the engine room and contained the engine controls. The boats were powered by the same twin 40 bhp Ferry VE4 installation as the earlier boats, but the exhaust was taken up the foremast to outlets well above the deck. The 46 ft 9in Watsons had long lives and were updated through their careers. The first major modification was the enclosing of the cockpit, done to all boats from 1960 onwards. The wheelhouse fitted resembled that of the [...] {{but there was no}} room to install sliding doors, weathershields being installed instead. Radar was later installed on the wheelhouse roof and the original aerial rigging and the aft mast was removed and replaced by <b>pole</b> <b>aerials.</b> Most, but not all, of the boats were re-engined with various examples of Ford based 6-cylinder diesel engines as described below. Finally, from the early 1980s all of the midships steering types (except ON 908, lost in the Fraserburgh disaster) were fitted with an air bag on the aft cabin roof to give a once only self-righting capability.|$|R
50|$|Compared to the {{preceding}} , the new boats had a hull extended by 3 inches in both length and beam. The wheelhouse was fully enclosed with sliding doors {{on either side}} and there were bulwarks above the fenders fore and aft and, from the second boat, the forward cabin was increased in size. As with the previous year's , the boats were powered by commercial diesel engines rather than the RNLI designed units used previously. In this case, two 60 bhp Gardner 5LW five cylinder diesels were fitted with the exhaust being taken up the mast as on the later 46 ft 9in boats. As built, the boats had line aerials rigged from the forward mast to a pole mast aft of the rear cabin. During their careers, this rig was replaced by twin <b>pole</b> <b>aerials</b> and the aft mast was removed. Radar was fitted on a bracket {{on the port side}} of the rear cabin roof (some had it fitted to the wheelhouse roof). From 1973, the boats were modified to become self-righting by, in most cases, the fitting of an air bag on the starboard side of the rear cabin roof, adjacent to the radar. This gave a once only self-righting ability which was successfully deployed when 's The Baltic Exchange capsized on service in 1983. Six boats were rebuilt with larger forward and aft superstructures (akin to the 48 ft 6in Oakley and Solent classes) which made them inherently self-righting. In these boats the masts were removed and the exhaust outlets were {{on the side of the}} hull. The engines in these six were uprated to 70 bhp and these modified boats were the longest lasting of the type, all but one serving into the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|After {{five years}} {{production}} of the 37ft boat, the RNLI decided to extend the water ballast self-righting principal to a larger boat suitable for slipway launching and lying afloat. In 1962 a prototype boat was built, 48-01 Earl and Countess Howe (ON 968) and in appearance it resembled an extended [...] with a long tapering superstructure running forward from an aft cockpit which was covered, but open to the stern. The boat's water ballast system used 2 tons of water compared to 1 tons in the smaller boats. Power came from two 110 bhp Gardner 6LX six cylinder diesel engines, the redesigned and uprated version of the engine fitted to the last ten 52ft [...] class boats. Displacing 29 tons and built {{at a cost of}} £40,000, [...] was the first RNLI lifeboat to be built with radar installed and went on station at [...] in February 1963. It was four years before further examples were built, by which time a major redesign of the superstructure had resulted in the Mk. II version. In this an enclosed wheelhouse was positioned amidships, accessed by sliding doors on either side at the forward end. Behind the wheelhouse was an aft cabin which could accommodate a loaded stretcher. Initially, radio aerials were rigged between the foremast and a bipod mast {{at the back of the}} aft cabin, on the roof of which the radar scanner was mounted on a pylon. Later, the masts were removed and twin <b>pole</b> <b>aerials</b> fitted to the aft cabin just behind the wheelhouse with a small tripod mast fitted to the wheelhouse roof. [...] went on station at [...] in March 1967, followed by [...] which took up duties at [...] in July 1967.|$|R
