40|$|The American {{secondary}} school system has structural prob-lems that are long-standing and pervasive. Too few students are engaged by their classes. Teachers can spend {{too little time}} on engrossing activities that lead to long-term learning, partly because they must {{spend too much time}} on classroom man-agement, student preparation for high-stakes tests, and ex-tracurricular responsibilities. The profession of teaching itself is held in low regard. Is it <b>any</b> <b>wonder,</b> then, <b>that</b> few college students aspire to the profession? Yet the attraction to service is strong among the current generation of undergraduates, as shown by their willingness to participate during the period immediately after earning their bachelor’s degrees when of-fered an opportunity such as Teach for America, Peace Corps, or other structured service (Dote et al., 2006; Johnson, 2011). In the areas of science, technology, engineering, and math-ematics (STEM), the need for skilled teachers is even more pronounced than in general. A large number of public school districts are understaffed in these disciplines and cannot at-tract highly qualified teachers. As a result, crucial elemen-tary, middle school, and high-school STEM courses are of-ten taught by teachers who are themselves not educated in STEM. Students of such teachers cannot help but absorb atti-tudes of discomfort and unfamiliarity, no matter how strong the encouragement at home.

But all these difficulties were at least sources of interest, if not in themselves pleasures. The new Harold, seemingly freshly created by a year of danger and strenuous toil, of self-examining and humiliation, of the realisation of duty, and--though he knew it not as yet--of the dawning of hope, found delight in the thought of dangers and difficulties to be overcome. Having taken his bearings exactly so as to be safe in finding the place again, he took his specimens with him and set out to find the shortest and best route to the nearest port.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt} Michael Cohen, James March, and Johan Olsen 9 have {{developed}} an influential, agent-based representation of organizational decision-making processes. They submit that organizations are—at least in part {{and part of the}} time—distinguished by three general properties: (i) problematic preferences, (ii) unclear technology, and (iii) fluid participation. Citing, “Although organizations can often be viewed conveniently as vehicles for solving well-defined problems or structures within which conflict is resolved through bargaining, they also provide sets of procedures through which participants arrive at an interpretation of what they are doing and what they have done while {{in the process of doing}} it. From this point of view, an organization is a collection of choices looking for problems, issues and feelings looking for decision situations in which they might be aired, solutions looking for issues to which they might be the answer, and decision makers looking for work. ” Decision opportunities characterized by problematic preferences, unclear technology, and fluid participation, viz., ambiguous stimuli, generate three possible outcomes, each driven by the energy it requires within the confines of organizational structure. These outcomes, whose meaning changes over time, are resolution, oversight, and flight. Significantly, resolution of problems as a style for making decisions is not the most common; in its place, decision making by flight or oversight is the feature. Is it <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> then <b>that</b> the relatively complicated intermeshing of elements does not enable organizations to resolve problems as often as their mandates demand...|$|R
