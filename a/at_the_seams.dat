25|$|The {{documentary}} segregates {{the experiences}} of these teachers into two major categories. The first category {{can be characterized as}} the material artifacts such as ceramic wares, Ajrak – a special kind of blockprinted shawl that serves as a symbol, woodwork, and bangles that represent Sindh’s outer surface. This also includes rides on a Bullock cart, an Auto rikshaw, and the public bus which is world-famous for ornamental art on the outside as well as the inside. Rebecca Bailey volunteers to try everything from making and painting intricate pottery to taking a ride on a public bus that is crowded enough to burst <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seams.</b>|$|E

40|$|The use of hot-dip {{galvanized}} steel sheets as base material for laser brazing {{led to the}} formation of spatter and a wavy appearance of <b>the</b> <b>seam.</b> High-speed imaging revealed that spatter formation occurs mainly close to <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> edges. Thermography of the brazing process showed that the type of zinc coating affects the resulting temperature distribution and thereby changes the conditions for the zinc evaporation. Higher temperatures were observed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> edges on electro galvanized and phosphated substrates. The cross sections and the process analysis indicate that the zinc evaporation on electro galvanized substrates takes place prior to the wetting with the molten filler material. On the other hand a merely partial evaporation of the zinc coating and the accumulation of zinc <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> edges takes place during the brazing of {{hot-dip galvanized}} substrates. The formation of spatter is caused by the zinc dissolution and the subsequent evaporation of the zinc rich alloy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> edges. <b>The</b> optical properties of the base material are considered to be a crucial factor for the temperature distribution and the resulting zinc evaporation. Brazing trials on hot-dip galvanized and phosphated substrates, which show a reflectance similar to electro galvanized and phosphated specimens, confirm this assumption, as no spatter formation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> edge was observed...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{properties}} and corrosion behaviour of welded seams {{have been investigated}} in dependence of welding conditions. X-ray microanalytical studies show an enhanced copper transition from the copper electrode wire to <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> surface following higher welding currents.

In 1959, a new and larger church was completed with a seating capacity of 500. The congregation first worshiped in the new church on Palm Sunday, 1959, and when the mortgage was paid off in 1974, a new Truro Church building was consecrated. The old church building is now known as the Chapel. Numerous services are still held throughout the week in the historic chapel, including contemporary worship services.|$|E
25|$|The World War II era {{also brought}} on rising {{production}} costs {{that resulted in}} a reduced number of elaborate gags and outdoor sequences, Del Lord's stock in trade; as such, the quality of the team's films (particularly those directed by Lord) began to slip after 1942. According to Okuda and Watz, entries such as Loco Boy Makes Good, What's the Matador?, Sock-A-Bye Baby (all 1942), I Can Hardly Wait and A Gem of a Jam (both 1943) are considered to be lesser quality works than previous films. Spook Louder (1943), a remake of Mack Sennett's The Great Pie Mystery (1931), is often cited as the Stooges' worst film because of its repetitious and rehashed jokes. Three Smart Saps (1942), a film considered to be an improvement, features a reworking of a routine from Harold Lloyd's The Freshman (1925), in which Curly's loosely basted suit begins to come apart <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> while he is on the dance floor.|$|E
25|$|Amerike – The Golden Land {{tells the}} journey of America’s Jewish {{ancestors}} who emigrated from their towns and cities in Europe and Russia (especially the Pale of Settlement) {{to start a new}} life in America. The characters in this story start off with a tremendous amount of hope in leaving their homes and starting new lives in NYC. However, their notions of America as a free land are shattered at Ellis Island when they witness families being torn apart to Ellis Island’s selection process. Life turns out to be quite difficult in America, the characters in the show soon discover. Poor wages, long hours, and sweatshop conditions are horrors that tug <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> of the characters. Events such as the Triangle Factory Fire, Workers Unionization, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, The Great Depression, World War I, and the Holocaust – World War II are telling points of the story in showing these immigrants growth, participation, and contribution to American economy and culture. The story ends on a hopeful and spirited note where survivors of the Holocaust are welcomed into the United States by the immigrants who fought to create a life for themselves there. Told in popular songs of the day, Amerike – The Golden Land is performed in Yiddish with Russian and English supertitles.|$|E

40|$|Severe {{corrosion}} attack <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> weld {{was observed}} in Zn–Al coated steel pipes of a closed heating system. This system was operating with tap water at about 70 °C and {{in the presence of}} an unknown amount of oxygen due to water reintegration. The corroded pipes showed a preferential corrosion of <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> weld along <b>the</b> longitudinal direction of the pipe. In order to investigate the cause of this attack, the electrochemical behavior of <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> weld was studied by means of an electrochemical micro-cell. This technique was used for the characterization of non-corroded and corroded pipe samples. The study proves that the damage mechanism is due to Zn–Al coating depletion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seam</b> weld and <b>the</b> potential coupling reversal between the coating and the steel substrate under service conditions.

In 1960, Mansfield topped press polls for more words in print {{than anyone else in}} the world, made more personal appearances than a political candidate, and was regarded as the world's most-photographed Hollywood celebrity. She made news on a regular basis, from dresses falling off, to clothing that burst strategically <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seams,</b> to low cut dresses worn without a bra. Things started to get over the top, even by her standards, when she took charge of her own publicity without advice. According to Shiffrin, [...] "She became a freak."

500|$|Front {{projection}} {{had been}} used in smaller settings before 2001, mostly for still photography or television production, using small still images and projectors. The expansive backdrops for the African scenes required a screen [...] tall and [...] wide, far larger than {{had been used}} before. When the reflective material was applied to the backdrop in [...] strips, variations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> of the strips led to visual artifacts; to solve this, the crew tore the material into smaller chunks and applied them in a random [...] "camouflage" [...] pattern on the backdrop. The existing projectors using [...] transparencies resulted in grainy images when projected that large, so the crew worked with MGM's special effects supervisor Tom Howard to build a custom projector using [...] transparencies, which required the largest water-cooled arc lamp available.

It helps that the album ... segued together with interludes that are more interesting than the actual songs. Flesh Tone should sound desperate, but it often sounds inspired instead. Kelis seems electrified by her new genre shift, and the result is an album that's one of her most consistent to date." [...] Kaya Burgess of The Times pointed out that 'Acapella' and 'Home' are the only tracks which [...] "stand out from an otherwise rather copy-and-paste collection of electronic numbers". Magaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times expressed that Kelis has managed to [...] "make a spirited but disciplined set of classic Euro-club bangers. Sometimes they're darkly contemplative, slipping into trance; other times they nearly rip <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seams</b> ... it's clear that Kelis has carved out a new niche for herself, dancing in front of the turntables till the lights come on, if they dare." [...] Sam Richards of Uncut complimented its fusion of [...] "R sass to thumping club beats" [...] and stated [...] "most everything Kelis touches drips with class".

50|$|Conduction welding {{also known}} as laser welding or {{radiation}} welding is a highly precise form of fusion welding.
