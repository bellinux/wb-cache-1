In this paper, by {{examining}} the more tangible, more physically intuitive classical mechanics, we aim to motivate more natural axioms of quan-tum mechanics than those usually given in terms of Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we plan to replace the assumptions that observable are self-adjoint operators on a separable Hilbert space <b>and</b> <b>states</b> are normalized vectors in that Hilbert space with more natural assumptions about the observables <b>and</b> <b>states</b> in terms of C∗-algebras. Then, with these assumptions in place, we plan to derive the aforementioned assumptions about observables <b>and</b> <b>states</b> in terms of Hilbert spaces from our new assumptions about observables <b>and</b> <b>states</b> in terms o...|$|R
