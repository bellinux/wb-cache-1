5|$|Gelsomina's {{difficulties}} with her forced partnership <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of frequent soul searching. Before Zampanò's release from prison, Il Matto proposes {{that there are}} alternatives to Gelsomina's servitude, and imparts his philosophy that everything and everyone has a purpose – even a pebble, even her. A nun suggests that Gelsomina's purpose in life is comparable to her own. But, when Gelsomina offers Zampanò marriage, he brushes her off.|$|E

Due to characteristic early onset many {{studies have focused on}} parental factors around conception and during gestation. Factors investigated have included occupation (i.e. exposure to chemicals in specific industries), smoking, alcohol consumption, use of medicinal drugs during pregnancy and birth factors; however, results have been inconclusive.|$|E

50|$|In {{sentence}} a, {{the first}} criterion (agreement) {{and the second}} criterion (position occupied) suggest that there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> whereas <b>the</b> third criterion (semantic role) suggests rather that problems <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> In sentence b, in contrast, agreement and semantic role suggest that problems <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> whereas position occupied suggests that there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> In such cases then, one can take the first criterion as the most telling; <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> should agree with the finite verb.|$|R

5|$|C. b. graptogyne, (Endangered) {{known as}} the {{south-eastern}} red-tailed black cockatoo, is found in southwestern Victoria and southeastern South Australia in an area bordered by Mount Gambier to the west, Portland to the south, Horsham to the northeast and Bordertown to the north. The smallest of the five subspecies, it was only recognised as distinct in the 1980s. It is predominantly dependent on stands of Eucalyptus baxteri (brown stringybark), Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river redgum) and Allocasuarina luehmannii (buloke) for feeding and nesting. These tree species have been all threatened by land clearing and most remaining are on private land; possibly only 500–1000 individuals remain. The subspecies and its habitat <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of a national recovery plan. In 2007 local landowners are being reimbursed for assisting in regenerating suitable habitat.|$|E

5|$|Earth is {{the only}} planet known to support life, and its natural {{features}} <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of many fields of scientific research. Within the solar system, it is third closest to the sun; {{it is the largest}} terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region. Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the permanent works which <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of this article, the City of Westminster also hosts several temporary displays of sculpture.

Temporary outdoor displays of sculpture {{can also be seen}} at the Royal Academy and the Chelsea College of Arts. In 2010 Westminster City Council inaugurated the City of Sculpture project, which has seen contemporary sculpture installed in locations across the borough.|$|E

5|$|In its {{broadest}} definition, mimicry {{can include}} non-living models. The specific terms masquerade and mimesis are sometimes used when the models are inanimate. For example, {{animals such as}} flower mantises, planthoppers and geometer moth caterpillars resemble twigs, bark, leaves or flowers. Many animals bear eyespots, which are hypothesized to resemble the eyes of larger animals. They may not resemble any specific organism's eyes, {{and whether or not}} animals respond to them as eyes is also unclear. Nonetheless, eyespots <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of a rich contemporary literature.|$|E
5|$|Insects in {{the group}} are plant-eaters, with a few species at times {{becoming}} serious pests of cereals, vegetables and pasture, especially when they swarm in their millions as locusts and destroy crops over wide areas. They protect themselves from predators by camouflage; when detected, many species attempt to startle the predator with a brilliantly-coloured wing-flash while jumping and (if adult) launching themselves into the air, usually flying for only a short distance. Other species such as the rainbow grasshopper have warning coloration which deters predators. Grasshoppers are affected by parasites and various diseases, and many predatory creatures feed on both nymphs and adults. The eggs <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of attack by parasitoids and predators.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 1945, {{during the}} Siege of Budapest by the Red Army, Wallenberg was {{detained}} by SMERSH {{on suspicion of}} espionage and subsequently disappeared.

The motives behind Wallenberg's arrest and imprisonment by the Soviet government, along with questions surrounding {{the circumstances of his}} death and his possible ties to US intelligence, remain mysterious and <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of continued speculation.|$|E

5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed from}} space or when the Sun is high in the sky.

When the Sun is low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of debate.|$|E
