40|$|In {{the early}} years of the present century the French school of haematologists {{appreciated}} that acute <b>acquired</b> <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia was dependent upon the presence of abnormal antibodies in the blood (Chauffard, Troisier and Vincent, 1908; Hayem, 1908; Widal, Abrami and Brule, 1907). During the first world war this important work was largely forgotten. Although Lederer (1925, 1930) gave his first classical description of the clinical picture in 1925, it was not until 1940 that Dameshek and Schwartz (1940) again stressed the immunological aspects of the disease. More recently, improved technical methods (Dacie and de Gruchy, 1951) have made possible the demonstration of abnormal antibodies in many cases in which gross agglutination is absent, thus confirming the early studies. The reason for the development of these abnormal antibodies is still obscure, but an infective origin for acute <b>acquired</b> <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia has long beeni postulated. This theory has recently received some support from the work of Hagberg (1952). He was able to demonstrate considerable diminution in the survival time of normal red cells transfused into children suffering from apparently simple post-infective anaemia. The knowledge that A. C. T. H. and cortisone interfere with antibody reactions has given fresh significance to these findings. During the last two years numerous reports (Best, Limarzi and Poncher...|$|R

40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} {{is becoming}} a recognized complication of the hereditary and <b>acquired</b> <b>haemolytic</b> anaemias, associated with a poor prognosis. Recently we reported that patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) {{have high levels of}} N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a biomarker associated with both right and left ventricular dysfunction and cardiac dysfunction. In the current study we evaluated a cohort of patients (N = 29) with haemolytic PNH for elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure and cardiac function by Doppler-echocardiography. Of the 29 patients, eight were further studied using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as two additional patients (number of patients studied using cardiac MRI = 10). Plasma from the first cohort (N = 29) demonstrated intravascular haemolysis associated with a 12 -fold increase in median nitric oxide (NO) consumption when compared with healthy volunteers (P < 0 · 001). Doppler echocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricular function and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure in 41 % of patients. Cardiac MRI from the second cohort (N = 10) demonstrated depressed right ventricular function in 80 % of PNH patients tested, and 60 % had findings suggestive of subclinical small pulmonary emboli.

40|$|Objective: To define {{indications}} {{and outcome}} in haematologic cases undergoing splenectomy. Study design: A retrospective review of clinica l records from consecutive patients having open or laparoscopic {{removal of the}} spleen in an academic centre in the private sector. Endpoints were survival, operating time, spleen size, histopathology, requirements for blood or related products complications and average costs. Results: In the total group (n = 69) there were two deaths. Referrals were for immune thrombocytopaenia (41 %), <b>acquired</b> <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia (10 %), myeloproliferative syndrome (9 %), acute or chronic leukaemia (19 %), lymphoma (13 %) and a miscellaneous group (8 %), comprising cholelithiasis, aplasia or as a diagnostic procedure for otherwise unexplained splenomegaly. An open midline approach was predicated by spleens greater than twice normal size {{and a history of}} any bleeding disorder. Here the mean operating time was 83 -min (range 40 - 295) whereas for laparoscopy this was 251 -min (range 181 - 272). Summary: Careful stratification between the two options facilitated optimum haemostasis and consequently reduced requirement for packed red cells and platelets. Neither underlying pathology nor the choice of treatment influenced morbidity or mortality. Overall local experience is consistent with published international standards of surgical practice. Outcome is directly proportional to the number of each procedure carried out by a single team, observance of consistent protocols for preoperative evaluation and standardized proactive management through the recovery period. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{peripheral blood}} count analysis in-cluding laboratory screening tests of haemostasis and coagulation {{should be done}} in every patient before surgery, in order to detect specific abnor-malities for primary or secundary haematologic disorder. These abnormalities might be very im-portant couse of perioperative and postoperative complications. Anaemia is the most frequent haema-tologic abnormality seen during preoperative period. Therapy approach depends on the type and anaemia degree, and also on the type and time of surgery. If surgery is not urgent specific therapy according to the anaemia type (iron therapy, vitamin B 12, folic acid, corticosteroids, recombinant erythropoietin) should be given in all anaemias with deficiency of iron, mega-loblastic anaemias, <b>acquired</b> <b>haemolytic</b> anaemias and anaemias in end stage renal disease. Transfusion of red cells are most frequently given in patients with no-rmovolemic anaemias with haemoglobin level of 10, 0 g/dl and hematocrit of 0, 30, but lower levels in ha-emodynamic stable patients.

40|$|Background: Paroxysmal nocturnal {{hemoglobinuria}} is {{a serious}} form of <b>acquired</b> <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia characterized by a defect in the membrane of red blood cells and also platelets and neutrophils. Clinically, it is typified by the classical triad of (1) intravascular haemolysis, (2) venous thrombosis and (3) bone marrow failure with cytopenia. As an advanced life threatening disease, it leads to end-organ failure and premature death. Until recently, the only treatment options were allogeneic stem-cell transplantation or supportive care with transfusions of packed red blood cells, glucocorticoids and anticoagulant terapy. Case presentation: The first patient developed aplastic anemia {{at the age of}} 17 years (y. 2000). She received immunosuppressive therapy including anti-lymphocyte globulin, methylprednisolone and oral cyclosporine A. Some years after this treatment, increasing PNH clone up to 92 % evolved. Haemolysis parameters were very high (LDH to 82 μkat/L, increased indirect bilirubin, reticulocyte count > 300 x 109 /L). She became dependent on red blood transfusions. Regular prophylaxis with warfarin and folic acid was introduced. In June 2011, we started eculizumab treatment by standard protocol. The parameters of haemolysis sharply decreased; the need for blood transfusions has decreased, though not completely. The second patient presented with severe pancytopenia in August 2011. Bone marrow showed evidence of hemolysis. PNH clone was 65 %. He was not prone to infections or bleeding, but monthly he needed blood transfusions. Hemolysis parameters were moderately increased (LDH to 13. 5 μkat /L, bilirubin increased marginally, reticulocyte 95 x 109 /L). In October 2011, he started receiving eculizumab treatment. Pancytopenia persisted, he was still blood-transfusion dependent, and so we decided to start immunosuppressive therapy. At this time we await the effect of immunosuppressive therapy and continue the treatment with eculizumab. Conclusions: In recent years, major {{progress has been made in}} PNH treatment with the development of monoclonal antibody directed against C 5 protein of the complement system–eculizumab. Blockade of C 5 effectively prevents intravascular haemolysis, development of anemia and reduces the need for blood transfusions. It significantly reduces complications such as haemolysis, renal impairment and pulmonary hypertension, reduces thrombosis-related complications and prolongs patients’ survival...|$|R

His {{candidature}} citation read: Distinguished for his {{experimental studies of}} tissue transplantation after lethal doses of ionising radiation. Skilful experiments led Loutit to form the opinion that, contrary to the prevailing view, the survival of irradiated mice after the implantation of haematropoietic tissue was due to colonization by living cells. The truth of this interpretation has been rapidly confirmed. Loutit {{was the first to}} recognize 'secondary disease' in irradiated mice restored by the transplantation of foreign cells, and his interpretation of the disease as the consequence of a reaction of the grafted cells against their recipient is now accepted. Loutit has further shown that a substantial proportion of mice with leukaemia can be cured by whole body irradiation followed by the grafting of bone marrow cells. Earlier, he separated the mechanisms of origin of congenital <b>haemolytics</b> and <b>acquired</b> <b>icterus</b> and developed a practical method of increasing the storage time of bllod for transfusion.

40|$|The {{phagocytosis}} of {{red blood}} cells (RBCs) is due to changes on the erythrocyte surface: specific modifications of RBC membrane components, alteration of surface molecules, loss of RBC membrane phospholipid asymmetry and irreversible oxidative damage of SH groups (Bratosin et al., 1998). In man erythrophagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes is detectable in the autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria and has been observed in some patients manifesting clonal hematopoietic malignancies with myelodysplasia (Mukhopadhyay et al, 2003; Lewandowski et al., 2011). Phagocytosis by macrophages is a highly conserved phenomenon among vertebrates {{and it has been}} postulated that the pathophysiology of erythrophagocytosis may likewise be similar in reptiles and mammals (Nevill, 2009). In Caretta caretta the heterophils, analogous to the mammalian neutrophils, can phagocyte both parasitized and normal-appearing erythrocytes. On circulating blood smears stained with MGG-stained smears of circulating Caretta blood demonstrated that 4 - 51 % of the heterophils were emitting pseudopodia that made contact with erythrocytes and that others had progressively encircled individual erythrocytes. These are mature erythrocytes containing a typical inclusion body, recognized as Heinz body (Basile et al., 2011). Moreover, teardrop-shaped RBCs were also identified in the blood films suggesting that the phagocytosing cell aspirates or selectively removes the inclusion body from the erythrocyte and permits the resultant dacrocyte to remain in the circulation. A comparable phenomenon, the pitting function of the spleen, is well know in man. In this case the phagocytic cells of the spleen remove remnants of DNA (Jolly bodies) from denucleated erythrocytes and allow them to persist in circulation. This pitting results in a efficient removal of the inclusion bodies contained in RBC cytoplasm by releasing dacryocytes into circulation. The positivity to ALP MPO and CAE reactions also confirmed that the loggerhead’s phagocyting cells are heterophils. In conclusion loggerhead’s erythrophagocytosis is a defense mechanism allowing both the complete degradation of infected/parasitized erythrocytes and the pitting of the inclusion body and the release of an healthy erythrocyte into circulation.

40|$|The {{laboratory}} diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) {{is based on}} several screening and confirmatory tests; our algorithm includes clinical features, red blood cell morphology analysis and cryohaemolysis test, and, in case of positive screening, sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a diagnostic test. Using the UniCel DxH 800 (Beckman Coulter) haematology analyser, we investigated automated reticulocyte parameters as HS screening tool, i. e. mean reticulocyte volume (MRV), immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) and mean sphered cell volume (MSCV). A total of 410 samples were screened. Gel electrophoresis was applied to 159 samples that were positive for the screening tests. A total of 48 patients were diagnosed as HS, and seven were diagnosed as <b>acquired</b> autoimmune <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia (AIHA). Some other 31 anaemic conditions were also studied. From the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, both delta (mean cell volume (MCV) -MSCV) and MRV presented an area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 98. At the diagnostic cut-off of 100  % sensitivity, MRV showed the best specificity of 88  % and a positive likelihood ratio of 8. 7. The parameters IRF, MRV and MSCV discriminated HS not only from controls and other tested pathologies but also from AIHA contrary to the cryohaemolysis test. In conclusion, automated reticulocyte parameters might be helpful for haemolytic anaemia diagnostic orientation even for general laboratories. In combination with cryohaemolysis, they ensure an effective and time-saving screening for HS for more specialised laboratories. JOURNAL ARTICLESCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|AIMS [...] To {{determine}} the maturity of reticulocytes {{in patients with}} anaemia {{as a result of}} various haematological disorders including those with qualitative abnormalities such as ineffective erythropoiesis or dyserythropoiesis. METHODS [...] The number of mature reticulocytes was measured with flow cytometry in venous blood samples from 122 patients with haematological disorders and 100 healthy controls. Reticulocytes were classified into three categories by the fluorescence intensity of auramin O staining: low fluorescence ratio (LFR), medium fluorescence ratio (MFR), and high fluorescence ratio (HFR). Immature reticulocytes were determined as the aggregate of MFR and HFR (%). RESULTS [...] The mean (2 SD) number of immature reticulocytes in 100 normal subjects was 9. 0 (7. 0) %. Significantly high mean values of immature reticulocytes with a normal or reduced reticulocyte count were shown in 90 patients with dyserythropoietic or ineffective erythropoietic conditions, such as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n = 37), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 35), aplastic anaemia (AA) (n = 8), or megaloblastic anaemia (MA), (n = 6). Reticulocyte ratios returned to normal after successful treatment of patients with AML (n = 10) and MA (n = 3). However, high percentages of immature reticulocytes with increased reticulocyte counts were consistently observed in patients with enhanced erythropoiesis such as those with <b>acquired</b> autoimmune <b>haemolytic</b> anaemias (AIHA) (n = 4) or acute blood loss (ABL) (n = 4). Reticulocyte maturity was within the normal range in patients with reduced erythropoiesis such as occurs in chronic renal failure (CRF) (n = 11), or in iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) (n = 13). CONCLUSIONS [...] The evaluation of reticulocyte maturity with total reticulocyte count seems to be clinically useful for estimating the qualitative impairment of erythropoiesis, and so could help differentiate haematological disorders...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS Folic acid {{deficiency}} {{with the}} picture of a megaloblastic bone marrow may develop in haemolytic anaemia, and, on the other hand, both vitamin B 12 and folic acid deficiency may produce signs of haemolysis. As the correct interpretation of a positive antiglobulin reaction associated with megaloblastic erythropoiesis is particularly important, the effect of deficiency of vitamin B 12 and folic acid on the results of the test was investigated in 32 patients with vitamin B 12 or folic acid deficiency and a positive antiglobulin reaction was obtained in ten. There was no correlation between the result of the test and the degree of anaemia, and {{there was no significant difference}} between the incidence of positive results associated with deficiency of vitamin B 12 or folic acid. In determining the significance of a positive result, the time interval before agglutination occurs is sometimes of greater value than the strength of the reaction or the result of the gamma globulin neutralization test. In both the acquired and hereditary types of haemo-lytic anaemia, the demands of increased red cell production may result in folic acid deficiency and a megaloblastic bone marrow (Chanarin, Dacie, and Mollin, 1959). It is important, therefore, to look for evidence of associated haemolytic disease in patients with megaloblastic erythropoiesis. As deficiency of both vitamin B 12 and folic acid reduces the erythrocyte life span, resulting in a low hapto-globin level (Owen, Carew, Cowling, Hoban, and Smith, 1960) and sometimes an increase in un-conjugated bilirubin in the serum, the diagnosis of a primary haemolytic disorder may be difficult to determine initially. The result of the direct antiglobulin test is of particular importance in the diagnosis of <b>acquired</b> auto-immune <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia. However, a positive result is not absolutely specific (Dacie and Lewis, 1963), and there has been one detailed report of a patient in whom a positive antiglobulin test was produced by pernicious anaemia (Selwyn and Alexander, 1951). In order to clarify the interpret-ation of a positive reaction in patients with megalo-blastic erythropoiesis, we have investigated the effect of vitamin B 12 and folic acid deficiency on the results of the test...|$|R
