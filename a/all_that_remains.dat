5|$|Thornham Marsh, {{immediately}} west of Titchwell, {{was used}} between 1914 and 1918 by the Royal Flying Corps as a bombing range. Some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> {{of a military}} hospital dating from that period. A First World War concrete building along the west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the British Army returned in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> of a Devonian volcano {{that met}} a cataclysmic {{end in the}} Carboniferous period around 350 million years ago. Evidence near the summit shows light-coloured granite (which had cooled in {{subterranean}} chambers several kilometres beneath the surface) lies among dark basaltic lavas (that only form on the surface). The two lying side-by-side is evidence the huge volcano collapsed in on itself creating an explosion comparable to Thera (2nd millennium BC) or Krakatoa (1883).|$|E
5|$|In 1788, a small Episcopal church {{called the}} Zion Chapel of Ease was {{constructed}} for plantation owners. The chapel's old cemetery, {{located near the}} corner of William Hilton Parkway and Mathews Drive (Folly Field), is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains.</b> Charles Davant, a prominent island planter during the Revolutionary War, is buried there. Davant was shot by Captain Martinangel of Daufuskie Island in 1781. This location {{is also home to}} the oldest intact structure on Hilton Head Island, the Baynard Mausoleum, which was built in 1846.|$|E

5|$|Kilve has {{the remains}} of a red-brick retort built in 1924 after the shale in the cliffs was found to be rich in oil. Along this coast, the cliffs are layered with {{compressed}} strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown Lias embedded with fossils. The Shaline Company was founded in 1924 to exploit these strata but was unable to raise sufficient capital. The company's retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil and is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E
5|$|Reading Abbey {{was founded}} by Henry I in 1121. He was buried there, as were parts of his {{daughter}} Empress Matilda, William of Poitiers, Constance of York, and Princess Isabella of Cornwall, among others. The abbey {{was one of the}} pilgrimage centres of medieval England; it held over 230 relics including the hand of St. James. Today <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> of the abbey are the inner rubble cores of the walls of many of the major buildings of the abbey, together with a much restored inner gateway and the intact hospitium.|$|E
5|$|The Mount Loretto Spur is an {{abandoned}} {{branch of the}} Staten Island Railway whose purpose was to serve the Mount Loretto Children's Home. The spur diverged off of the Main Line south of Pleasant Plains. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad served the Mount Loretto non-electrified branch until 1950, which had some industry and a passenger station. The Mount Loretto branch track was removed in the 1960s and 1970s but some ties were visible until the 1980s. A coal dump trestle is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains,</b> located behind the powerhouse.|$|E
5000|$|Aberdyfi Castle is {{a castle}} located near Glandyfi, Ceredigion, in Wales. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> now <b>remains</b> is the motte, which is {{referred}} to as Domen Las (traditionally meaning [...] "green mound" [...] in Welsh).|$|R
50|$|San Lazzaro is a Roman Catholic {{church in}} Modena, Italy. It is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> now <b>remains</b> {{of the former}} lazaretto or lepers' {{hospital}} built {{to the east of}} the city in the 12th century.|$|R
50|$|<b>All</b> <b>that</b> {{currently}} <b>remains</b> is the bar {{which was}} issued liquor license #1. Many people traveling on Highway 2 between Assiniboia and Moose Jaw stop {{in for a}} beer to split the drive in half.|$|R
5|$|The Sankt Laurentii Church Tower is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> of the Romanesque Sankt Laurentii Church, {{built of}} {{travertine}} in the 13th century. It was torn down after the Reformation {{leaving only the}} tower which was built {{at the beginning of}} the 16th century and now forms part of the former town hall on Stændertorvet. It contains a museum where archaeological finds from 1998 can be seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{on the site of}} the prison houses Southwark Council's John Harvard Library and Local Studies Library, at 211 Borough High Street, just north of the junction with Tabard Street. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> of the Marshalsea is the brick wall that marked the southern boundary of the prison, separating it from St George's churchyard, now a small garden. It can be reached by underground on the Northern line to Borough tube station, or by train to London Bridge station.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{embedded}} within an ornamental landscape, with two gardens laid {{out at the}} same time as the castle was founded and a third created later. Wressle was intended as a high-status residence rather than a fortress and was never besieged. However, it was held by Parliament during the English Civil War and demolished in 1646–50. Nearly 150 years later, it was further damaged by fire and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> above ground of the building is the south range.|$|E
50|$|Nininger Township was {{organized}} in 1858, and {{named after the}} village of Nininger, Minnesota. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> currently <b>remains</b> {{of the city of}} Nininger are a few buildings dedicated to township management and two historical markers.|$|R
5000|$|Astrop was {{the site}} of a famous Spa {{discovered}} in the 17th century. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> now <b>remains</b> is a small well known as St. Rumbald's Well, south of the house in a valley (see [...] "History" [...] section).|$|R
50|$|The village once {{housed a}} manor house. The house was {{purchased}} by the Compton family from Castle Ashby {{and they had the}} house demolished. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> now <b>remains</b> is the plot of the house surrounded by Lebanon Cedars.|$|R
5|$|The {{village of}} Blue Water {{was built to}} house workers and their {{families}} in Chemical Valley during the construction of Polymer Corporation {{and at one point}} had nearly 3,000 residents. In 1961, all the residents were relocated, mostly to the North End, to make way for expansion of the chemical industry. The village was demolished, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> now is an historical marker at the corner of Vidal Street and Huron Avenue. This neighbourhood was largely forgotten until historian Lorraine Williams penned two books about it and was instrumental in the dedication of the plaque.|$|E
5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} of the castle, which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and {{it may not have been}} in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather. West of the castle is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.|$|E
5|$|Artillery {{may have}} been {{installed}} at Gun Hill on the coast near Burnham Overy during the Napoleonic wars, {{but there were no}} modern fortifications in north Norfolk at the start of World War I. Following the German naval attack on Great Yarmouth in November 1914, defences such as trenches, concrete pillboxes and gun batteries were constructed along much of the Norfolk coast. The main bases were outside the SSSI boundaries, but Thornham Marsh was used between 1914 and 1918 by the Royal Flying Corps as a bombing range. A World War I concrete building on Titchwell's west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the British Army returned in 1942; some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> of a military hospital dating from that period.|$|E

50|$|The site {{seems to}} have been {{abandoned}} around the middle of the fifteenth century. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> now <b>remains</b> is the low-lying motte and bailey in a field to the east of the village. The castle is a scheduled monument.|$|R
60|$|And now, as I {{close my}} task, subduing {{my desire to}} linger yet, these faces fade away. But one face, shining on me like a Heavenly light by which I see all other objects, is above them and beyond them <b>all.</b> And <b>that</b> <b>remains.</b>|$|R
5|$|At Kilve are {{the remains}} of a red brick retort, built in 1924, when it was {{discovered}} that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. The beach is part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils. In 1924 Forbes-Leslie founded the Shaline Company to exploit them. This retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil but the company was unable to raise sufficient capital and this is now <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{bricks and}} {{brickwork}} were also imported and utilized in other colonies throughout the Dutch Empire in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Fort Zeelandia {{was built on}} a small island off Tainan in Formosa (Taiwan) between 1624 and 1634 after the Dutch acquired Formosa from China as a trading colony. It was built using bricks from Batavia (Jakarta), where the Dutch East India Company had its headquarters. After a siege in 1662, the Dutch surrendered the fort to Koxinga, a Ming dynasty general. The fort was destroyed by an explosion in 1873 when a shell from a British warship blew up the ammunition storehouse. The masonry was later used for other purposes. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> {{is part of the}} southern wall.|$|E
5|$|Following the eviction, Killakee House {{was briefly}} {{used as an}} {{operations}} base by the Detective Unit of the Garda Síochána in 1931 while they hunted IRA subversives who were hiding explosives at Killakee. When the bank {{was unable to find}} a buyer for the estate, it was acquired by a builder who stripped the house and then demolished it in 1941. The lands were eventually acquired by the State and opened to the public. In the late 1930s, the Director of Forestry, a German called Otto Reinhard, laid out the area as an urban forest. The trees have reclaimed most of the land once occupied by the formal gardens: <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> is the brickwork {{at the rear of the}} Turner glasshouses and the system of irrigation canals and ponds for the exotic plants contained within.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} {{once part of}} the lands of Greenhill. It {{takes its name from}} the Burgh Muir, an area of oak forest which {{stretched}} over much of today's south Edinburgh; <b>all</b> <b>that</b> now <b>remains</b> is the parkland of Bruntsfield Links.|$|R
50|$|The Astrakhan Tatars number about 10,000 and are, {{with the}} Kalmyks, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> now <b>remains</b> of the once so {{powerful}} Astrakhan empire. They also are agriculturists and gardeners; while some 12,000 Kundrovsk Tatars still continue the nomadic {{life of their}} ancestors.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{the site}} where the old {{reformatory}} existed is now the Alan Lamport Stadium. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> structurally <b>remains</b> from the original site is the superintendent's house at the corner of King Street and Fraser Avenue (pictured in the Infobox above).|$|R
