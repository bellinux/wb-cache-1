[...] "Naturally, when he {{told you}} about himself, he did not ask it to be kept a secret, {{because he did not}} know you would meet any one that knowed him. But when you did meet such, you thought that it was right to say nothing about it, and I agree with you; but of course this matter of the Squire going queer in his mind makes all the difference, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> you says, Captain Mervyn ought to be fetched home.

But whether eleven or twelve it makes no difference. No doubt he posted the letter he speaks of the first thing on leaving; but, you see, it is a cross post to your place, and the letter could not anyhow have got there for delivery this morning.

[356] [...] "On the 12th of October, Sir Walter left Abbotsford for London, {{where he}} had been promised access to the papers in the Government offices; and thence he {{proceeded}} to Paris, in the hope of gathering from various eminent persons authentic anecdotes concerning Napoleon. His Diary shows that he was successful in obtaining many valuable materials for the completion of his historical work; and reflects, with sufficient distinctness, the very brilliant reception he on this occasion experienced both in London and Paris. The range of his society is strikingly (and unconsciously) exemplified in the record of one day, when we find him breakfasting at the Royal Lodge in Windsor Park, and supping on oysters and porter in [...] "honest Dan Terry's house, like a squirrel's cage," [...] above the Adelphi Theatre in the Strand. There {{can be no doubt that}} this expedition was in many ways serviceable in his Life of Napoleon; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>as</b> little that it was chiefly so by renewing his spirits. The deep and respectful sympathy with which his misfortunes, and gallant behaviour under them, had been regarded by all classes of men at home and abroad, was brought home to his perception in a way not to be mistaken. He was cheered and gratified, and returned to Scotland with renewed hope and courage for the prosecution of his marvellous course of industry."--Life, vol. ix. pp. 2, 3.|$|E

60|$|Much of the time, {{while my}} wife {{was looking at the}} drawings, I sat observing the crowd of Sunday visitors. They were {{generally}} of a lower class than those of week-days; private soldiers in a variety of uniforms, and, for the most part, ugly little men, but decorous and well behaved. I saw medals on many of their breasts, denoting Crimean service; some wore the English medal, with Queen Victoria's head upon it. A blue coat, with red baggy trousers, was the most usual uniform. Some had short-breasted coats, made in the same style as those of the first Napoleon, which we had seen in the preceding rooms. The policemen, distributed pretty abundantly about the rooms, themselves looked military, wearing cocked hats and swords. There were many women of the middling classes; some, evidently, of the lowest, but clean and decent, in colored gowns and caps; and laboring men, citizens, Sunday gentlemen, young artists, too, no doubt looking with educated eyes at these art-treasures, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> a general thing, each man was mated with a woman. The soldiers, however, came in pairs or little squads, accompanied by women. I did not much like any of the French faces, and yet I am not sure that there is not more resemblance between them and the American physiognomy, than between the latter and the English. The women are not pretty, but in all ranks above the lowest they have a trained expression that supplies the place of beauty.|$|E
60|$|The Rose {{has been}} for many centuries a symbol of spiritual love and supreme beauty. The Count Goblet D'Alviella thinks that it was once {{a symbol of the}} sun,--itself a {{principal}} symbol of the divine nature, and the symbolic heart of things. The lotus was in some Eastern countries imagined blossoming upon the Tree of Life, as the Flower of Life, and is thus represented in Assyrian bas-reliefs. Because the Rose, the flower sacred to the Virgin Mary, and the flower that Apuleius' adventurer ate, when he was changed out of the ass's shape and received into the fellowship of Isis, is the western Flower of Life, I have imagined it growing upon the Tree of Life. I once stood beside a man in Ireland when he saw it growing there in a vision, that seemed to have rapt him out of his body. He saw the garden of Eden walled about, and {{on the top of a}} high mountain, as in certain mediæval diagrams, and after passing the Tree of Knowledge, on which grew fruit full of troubled faces, and through whose branches flowed, he was told, sap that was human souls, he came to a tall, dark tree, with little bitter fruits, and was shown a kind of stair or ladder going up through the tree, and told to go up; and near the top of the tree, a beautiful woman, like the Goddess of Life associated with the tree in Assyria, gave him a rose that seemed to have been growing upon the tree. One finds the Rose in the Irish poets, sometimes as a religious symbol, as in the phrase, 'the Rose of Friday,' meaning the Rose of austerity, in a Gaelic poem in Dr. Hyde's 'Religious Songs of Connacht;' <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> a symbol of woman's beauty in the Gaelic song, 'Roseen Dubh;' and a symbol of Ireland in Mangan's adaptation of 'Roseen Dubh,' 'My Dark Rosaleen,' and in Mr. Aubrey de Vere's 'The Little Black Rose.' I do not know any evidence to prove whether this symbol came to Ireland with mediæval Christianity, or whether it has come down from Celtic times. I have read somewhere that a stone engraved with a Celtic god, who holds what looks like a rose in one hand, has been found somewhere in England; but I cannot find the reference, though I certainly made a note of it. If the Rose was really a symbol of Ireland among the Gaelic poets, and if 'Roseen Dubh' is really a political poem, as some think, one may feel pretty certain that the ancient Celts associated the Rose with Eire, or Fotla, or Banba--goddesses who gave their names to Ireland--or with some principal god or goddess, for such symbols are not suddenly adopted or invented, but come out of mythology.|$|E
5000|$|A cover {{version was}} {{recorded}} by American country singer Blake Shelton. Shelton's version of Bublé's song landed him {{top of the}} charts for R&R Singles Chart and MediaBase Singles. Shelton was quoted in saying," [...] I loved 'Home' the first time I heard it, and I really love it now," [...] said Shelton. [...] "I'm glad I'm not the only one that thought it was a country song. I've had the honor of performing [...] "Home" [...] with Michael Bublé on a couple of occasions and can honestly say he is a really great guy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>as</b> a writer he's probably pretty excited that it's reached number one, too." [...] Bublé attributes the song's popularity to its relatable themes, stating that [...] "we all know what it's like to be homesick. It's one of the worst feelings. I know about that as well as anybody." [...] "Home" [...] was also featured on the soundtrack of the 2005 American romantic comedy The Wedding Date along with other songs from Bublé's albums.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, around 2001, Lowe {{began playing}} and {{recording}} again, on both guitar and alto saxophone. In 2007 he recorded Jews in Hell: Radical Jewish Acculturation with Matthew Shipp, Lewis Porter, Randy Sandke, Marc Ribot, Scott Robinson, and Erin Mckeown. A mix of jazz, punk rock, and American roots music, it received little national notice, but high praise {{from the likes}} of Anthony Braxton who said “Allen Lowe is a great writer. It’s hillbilly music but it’s trans-national. Allen Lowe {{is one of the few}} musicians doing anything new today. He is the tradition. I’m a big fan of Allen Lowe <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>as</b> a musician and a scholar he is very important and I think he is deeply misunderstood because he doesn’t hate himself.” Jews in Hell also led to Lowe’s inclusion in a book called Jazz Jews in which it was advised that Lowe “extracts the most soulful sounds out of a synthesizer since Steve Wonder, composes ambient-evocative instrumentals, and songs with vernacular lyrics that stick in the mind like those of Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, Mose Allison or Lou Reed.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Customs duties are, no doubt, in {{at least}} one aspect [...] "{{taxation}}" [...] within the meaning of that term as ordinarily used <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> used in the B.N.A. Act, s. 91 (3). They are a mode or system of taxation for the raising of money and are a typical form of indirect tax. But they are, it seems to me, something more—they are tolls levied at the border as a condition of permission to import goods into the country being granted by the governmental authority clothed with jurisdiction either entirely to prohibit their entry, or to prescribe conditions on which such entry may be effected. In legislating for such prohibition or for permission to enter conditional upon payment of certain duties, Parliament is exercising its authority for [...] "the regulation of trade and commerce", as well as its right to provide for [...] "the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation". In their aspect as tolls imposed in exercise of the power to regulate trade and commerce customs duties are not [...] "taxation".|$|E
5000|$|On February 2016 Robert Schwartzman {{announced}} in a newsletter that {{the band is}} in the process of recording new material and will feature an entirely new line-up. They also released a new song for free download entitled [...] "Come On Baby". Regarding the decision to continue with a new line-up, Schwartzman stated, [...] "I met all the guys who played with Rooney for so many years in high school, and it was sort of like a high school relationship where you marry your high school sweetheart kind of thing, right out of school. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>as</b> you grow up, you realize, like, 'Who am I? What do I want?', and you start to connect with new people. And I started to meet all these other musicians that I had collaborated with, and it was over that hiatus that I kind of came back around to recording music that just felt like Rooney, kind of returning to this Rooney sound. I think everyone in the band for so long has been pursuing so many other things, that I think naturally it was time to make a change and shift to bring in new people." ...|$|E

5000|$|In May 2016, after ABC had {{canceled}} Marvel's Agent Carter {{and passed}} on Marvel's Most Wanted, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said that Marvel and ABC were looking [...] "at series {{that would be}} beneficial to both brands" [...] moving forward. In November, Feige said that [...] "Inhumans will happen for sure. I don’t know when. I think it’s happening on television. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>as</b> we get into Phase 4 as I’ve always said, it could happen as a movie." [...] Shortly after, Marvel Television and IMAX Corporation announced the eight-episode television series Inhumans, to be produced in conjunction with ABC Studios and air on ABC; Marvel Studios decided that the characters were better suited to television, and a series {{would be better than}} trying to fit the multiple planned franchise films around the studio's existing film franchises. Inhumans is not intended to be a reworking of the planned film, nor a spin-off from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., but it is set in the same shared universe. In December, Scott Buck, the showrunner for the first season of the Marvel Netflix series Iron Fist, was revealed to also be executive producing and showrunning Inhumans. Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory also executive produce the series.|$|E
5000|$|Riegel said of {{heterosexual}} couples being given more passionate kisses than her lesbian romances, [...] "...I think they're {{a couple of}} reasons. I don't {{think that you can}} necessarily say, you know, that they were scared of it...because I think they didn't want to turn people off because they wanted people to invest in the story.

[...] She cited a [...] "nice kissing scene" [...] between Bianca and Lena Kundera, and said that she remembered thinking why more scenes between gay/lesbian couples could not be like that, where it is [...] "no big deal" [...] and not heavily advertised. Hearing Lena's name brought resentment from Hendrickson, who felt that Lena [...] "stole everything" [...] from Maggie, such as the first lesbian kiss on an American soap opera and Bianca herself. Riegel said, despite this, that Maggie had won Bianca's heart.|$|E
5000|$|Dear Friend!I {{will now}} take and write {{to you a}} few lines, {{to let you know}} that I am yet alive, and doing well. I joint(sic) the Army in January, 86 and had a good fight with Geronimo and his Indians. I also had two hard fights, where i came very near getting killed, but i got true alright. I was made Corporal when i first enlisted, but have now got high enough to be in Charge of Troop D. 6th U.S. Cavalry and it {{requires}} a good man for to get that office, and that is more than i expected. Charley White from Cranbury came out with me and got in the same Troop with me, and I sent him with twenty more men out on a Scout after Indians and Charley was lucky enough to be shot down by Indians the first day, and only three of my men returned. I was very sorry but it could not be helped.The Territory of New Mexico is a very nice place never no Winter and lots of Gold and Silver Mines all around but for all that it is a disagreeable place on account of so many Indians. I like it first rate <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>as</b> soon as my five years are up I will go bak(sic) to Old New Jersey but not today. My name isn't Charley Winters no more since i shot that man at Jefferson Barracks when he tried to get away from me.
