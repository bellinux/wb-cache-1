40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{basically}} a design project aimed to find a safe and reliable <b>automatic</b> <b>safety</b> <b>device,</b> {{which is designed to}} be suitable for highly automated industrial situations. This device fits with ABB / Jokab Safety’s fence systems. These are built up around machines to create safety distances. The automatic protection device assist the operator in situations when loading or {{going in and out of}} the danger zone. Therefore, safety is a big matter in these types of devices control circuits. In this design project the solution is being prepared for the future purpose that is to be CE-marked. The work has had a wide topic range with not just elements within the design subject, but also areas such as risk analysis, reliability, and pneumatics. This has resulted in many stimulating destinations in the design process before it finally led into a prototype that has been function tested. The pneumatic control system was then installed to the mechanical design witch led to the final product. During testing some disturbance in the function occurred and this will have to be corrected before some good results can be shown. Testing the prototype generated a lot of information about the product that could be used to optimize its performance...|$|E
50|$|A more {{sophisticated}} fuze is the double-acting fuze, which {{is sensitive to}} both contact and grazing. An {{example of such a}} double-acting fuze is the British WW II Fuze, D.A. and percussion, No. 119 This fuze uses a nose striker, as for the original No. 106, but is rather more complex with an added inertia mechanism for grazing impacts and also three <b>automatic</b> <b>safety</b> <b>devices.</b> Simple contact impacts drive the striker back into the detonating pellet, as before. Graze impacts trigger the inertia mechanism, where instead the pellet in a heavy carrying plug travels forwards onto the striker. The striker is protected in storage by a nose safety cap. Normally this is removed before loading, but it may also be left in place if the target is behind cover. This reduces the sensitivity of the striker to light impacts through vegetation, but the fuze will still function through the inertia mechanism, or through a hard impact. Three <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> are provided, one released by inertia during firing, which then unlocks a second that is released by centrifugal force of the spinning shell. These are mechanical locks that prevent the striker contacting the pellet. A third device is a centrifugal shutter that initially blocks propagation from the detonator pellet to the booster explosive.|$|R
5000|$|The CZ 100 has {{a number}} of {{important}} handgun features. It is hammerless DAO (double action only), meaning that the firing system is under no tension unless the trigger is pulled. There is an <b>automatic</b> firing pin <b>safety</b> <b>device.</b> It is constructed for one-handed cocking, with a protrusion on the slide behind the ejection port intended for pushing against the edge of a fixed surface. The gun uses the usual Browning cam for action. There is a simple compensator on [...]40 S&W version.

40|$|Abstract. Compared with {{traditional}} substation, smart substation process layer network, {{which has the}} same meaning as relay protection and <b>safety</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>devices,</b> is actually equivalent to the secondary circuit of traditional substation protection. Once an exception occurs in the network traffic of process layer, it will directly affect the reliability, rapidity and agility of relay protection action. According to the characteristics of network traffic of smart substation, this paper proposed a novel dynamic grey Markov model (DGMM) based network traffic prediction approach, which could assist decision making for the network performance analysis and prediction, network failures and viruses invasion warning of smart substation. Experiments demonstrated the effective and efficiency of the proposed approach, which could guarantee the security operation of power grid...|$|R

MDCH limits Class AA installations public exposure to be less than two millirem per hour, measure 5 cm from any accessible external surface point, while the accelerator is operating at maximum radiation output. Therefore, the design team's was to limit the dose to less than 2 mR/hr at any external wall of the test cell by optimizing the dose rate at the cave. The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements Report No. 144, “Radiation Protection for Particle Accelerator Facilities,” provides guidelines for the safety design, including shielding, facility planning, safety systems and other considering for accelerator facilities such at the D711. NCRP 144 also recommends a maze be used to protect users from excess exposure for neutron generators with output greater than 10 MeV.

40|$|Abstract—In many safety-critical applications, battery perfor-mance is a {{significant}} limiting factor that affects the feasibility of electronic <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> intended to alert workers to hazardous situations. In particular, battery capacity and lifetime are difficult to predict when <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> are exposed to extremes of temperature, humidity, shock, and vibration that are common in construction, excavation, drill rigs, and mining work sites. Because battery failure is unacceptable in <b>safety</b> <b>devices,</b> periodic preventative maintenance is required, adding to device cost and labor cost and reducing acceptance of electronic <b>safety</b> <b>devices.</b> Energy harvesting and communications techniques based on passive UHF RFID technology may offer an alternative to battery power for some types of <b>safety</b> alert <b>devices,</b> particularly where hazardous conditions are created by powered heavy equipment.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview {{on the results of}} an ENAV feasibility study, where we exploited an <b>automatic</b> <b>safety</b> data gathering tool to analyze the ATM system performances.

The contribution {{of this study is to}} explore how analysis methods derived from complex systems theory (i. e. network analysis) can assist in the understanding, monitoring and management of the performance of ATM systems. Our data show that a large number of STCAs do not occur in isolation, but rather that in roughly half of the cases the aircraft involved in an STCA are subsequently involved in other STCAs with other aircraft in a sort of chain (or cascade) process. In the concluding section, we reflect on open issues and areas of future research that would need to be addressed for an optimal use of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Safety</b> Data Gathering tools...|$|R
