Existing country-specific landfill emissions have been estimated from solid waste statistics {{and a series of}} assumptions regarding methane generation and emission rates. There has been no attempt to reconcile the national and global estimates with limited field data on landfill methane emissions which range over six orders of magnitude (Bogner and Scott, 1995). This paper <b>addresses</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>field</b> measurements of methane emissions at sites in Illinois and California (USA) using a closed chamber technique. Overall, observed rates from various controlled monitoring experiments during 1988 - 1994 ranged from 0. 003 to more than 1000 g CH 4 m- 2 d-t. Rates were related to {{the presence or absence of}} gas recovery wells, physical properties of cover soils (texture, moisture, and temperature) relating to their aeration status for diffusional flux, and rates of methane oxidation by indigenous methanotrophs. Surprisingly, at the Illinois site during spring, 1994, the landfill surface was consuming atmospheric methane rather than emitting landfill methane. This was attributed to high capacities for methane oxidation in well-aerated soils which had reduced landfill methane compared to 1993, the result of an effective pumped gas recovery system. Three independent methods confirmed that the landfill cover soil...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the quantum-control task of obtaining a target unitary operation via <b>control</b> <b>fields</b> that couple to the quantum system and are chosen to best mitigate errors resulting from time-dependent noise. We allow for two sources of noise: {{fluctuations in the}} <b>control</b> <b>fields</b> and those arising from the environment. We {{address the issue of}} error mitigation by means of a formulation rooted in the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) approach to noisy, classical statistical-mechanical systems. We express the noisy control problem in terms of a path integral, and integrate out the noise to arrive at an effective, noise-free description. We characterize the degree of success in error mitigation via a fidelity, which characterizes the proximity of the sought-after evolution to ones achievable in the presence of noise. Error mitigation is then accomplished by applying the optimal <b>control</b> <b>fields,</b> i. e., those that maximize the fidelity subject to any constraints obeyed by the <b>control</b> <b>fields.</b> To make connection with MSR, we reformulate the fidelity in terms of a Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) path integral, with the added twist that the `forward' and `backward' branches of the time-contour are inequivalent with respect to the noise. The present approach naturally allows the incorporation of constraints on the control fields; a useful feature in practice, given that they feature in real experiments. We illustrate this MSR-SK approach by considering a system consisting of a single spin s freedom (with s arbitrary), focusing on the case of 1 /f noise. We discover that optimal error-mitigation is accomplished via a universal <b>control</b> <b>field</b> protocol that is valid for all s, from the qubit (i. e., s= 1 / 2) case to the classical (i. e., s →∞) limit. In principle, this MSR-SK approach provides a framework for <b>addressing</b> quantum <b>control</b> in the presence of noise for systems of arbitrary complexity. Comment: 25 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|We {{show how}} a single linearly {{polarized}} <b>control</b> <b>field</b> {{can produce a}} sharply tunable group velocity of a weak probe field at resonance in a four-level atomic configuration of alkali vapors. The dispersion can be switched from normal to anomalous along with vanishing absorption, just by changing intensity of the resonant <b>control</b> <b>field.</b> In addition, by allowing different intensities of the different polarization components of the <b>control</b> <b>field,</b> the anomalous dispersion can be switched back to the normal.

40|$|We {{consider}} dynamical decoupling schemes {{in which}} the qubit is continuously manipulated by a <b>control</b> <b>field</b> at all times. Building on {{the theory of the}} Uhrig Dynamical Decoupling sequence (UDD) and its connections to Chebyshev polynomials, we derive a method of always-on control by expressing the UDD <b>control</b> <b>field</b> as a Fourier series. We then truncate this series and numerically optimize the series coefficients for decoupling, constructing the CAFE (Chebyshev and Fourier Expansion) sequence. This approach generates a bounded, continuous <b>control</b> <b>field.</b> We simulate the decoupling effectiveness of our sequence vs. a continuous version of UDD for a qubit coupled to fully-quantum and semi-classical dephasing baths and find comparable performance. We derive filter functions for continuous-control decoupling sequences, and we assess how robust such sequences are to noise on <b>control</b> <b>fields.</b> The methods we employ provide a variety of tools to analyze continuous-control dynamical decoupling sequences.

40|$|We {{consider}} two copropagating {{fields in}} a nonlinear Kerr medium, {{each with a}} particular phase and intensity. The Kerr medium possesses an intensity-dependent refractive index and the phase shift of each field thus depends on the intensities of the fields. Classically {{it is possible to}} induce an arbitrary phase shift of one field (the signal field) by either increasing the intensity of the other <b>field</b> (the <b>control</b> <b>field)</b> or by increasing the interaction legnth. We show that if the intensity of the <b>control</b> <b>field</b> is low, the phase shift on the signal is limited by the discrete nature of the photon-number distribution in the <b>control</b> <b>field</b> and cannot be increased simply by increasing the interaction length.
