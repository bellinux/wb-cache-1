50|$|The <b>Alien</b> <b>Office</b> {{was formed}} in 1793 to {{implement}} the Aliens Act 1793, {{which was the first}} statutory control of foreign visitors created to control the influx of French refugees and suspected revolutionaries. It was created as sub-department of the Home Office, which itself had only come into existence in 1782. The first Superintendent of Aliens appointed was William Huskisson. In July 1798, the <b>Alien</b> <b>Office</b> relocated from the Home Office building in Whitehall to 20 Crown Street, Westminster which ran parallel to Downing Street.|$|R
5000|$|Although ostensibly {{part of the}} Home Office, its wider remit {{included}} the domestic and external surveillance of foreign people of interest. The <b>Alien</b> <b>Office</b> {{was part of the}} wider Government machinery of national security and intelligence, and its work needs to be seen {{in the context of this}} and of other legislation passed at the time, such as the Westminster Police Bill in 1792 (which created a system of stipendiary magistrates as part of an attempt to coordinate policing). William Wickham was appointed Superintendent of the <b>Alien</b> <b>Office,</b> in succession to Huskisson, in the summer of 1794. During Wickham’s tenure, the office was enlarged in 1798 and, until his departure in 1802, it was, in reality, a functioning intelligence agency. Elizabeth Sparrow describes it as [...] "the first comprehensive British secret service in the modern sense, and therefore the forerunner of not only Special Operations Executive (S.O.E.) but also the euphemistically named Military Intelligence (M.I.5 and M.I.6)". The most famous scalp claimed by the <b>Alien</b> <b>Office</b> under the new regulations was arguably that of the French diplomat and intriguer, Talleyrand. In March 1794 Talleyrand was told to leave the country within five days.|$|R
50|$|The Channel Islands {{were the}} only British {{territory}} in Europe occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. The policy of the Island governments, acting under instructions from the British government communicated before the occupation, was one of passive co-operation, although this has been criticised, particularly {{in the treatment of}} the few Jews in the islands. These measures were administered by the Bailiff and the <b>Aliens</b> <b>Office.</b> One Jew from Jersey died in a Jersey mental hospital during the war, three who had come to Guernsey were deported to France and from there were rounded up and sent to a camp and died.|$|E

On 25 October 1994 the Swiss authorities confirmed that they would not be pressing any charges against Cherney. On 20 November 1996 the Swiss Federal <b>Aliens</b> <b>Office</b> confirmed that he was no longer subject to a prohibition order and that there was nothing to prevent his coming into Switzerland.|$|E

50|$|Windham, a {{politician}} {{rather than an}} official, used King (an older Christ Church contemporary) as an intermediary with Greville in 1792, when entering a covert role. In 1794 Nepean moved on from the Home Office, leaving King the senior of the Under-Secretaries of State, {{and he started to}} plan for a future seat in Parliament. After the passing of the Aliens Act 1793, King also worked in the <b>Alien</b> <b>Office.</b> From an initial task of dealing with correspondence, assigned at the end of 1794, he took on further duties as the <b>Alien</b> <b>Office</b> addressed intelligence needs and countered subversion.

50|$|The {{end of the}} <b>Alien</b> <b>Office</b> and {{its staff}} of {{registry}} clerks and messengers came with the Registration of Aliens Act 1836.

The two legal entry channels for low skilled migrants with view of long term residence: 1) 	asylum 2) 	family reunification. Regularisation on an ad hoc basis also provides a channel for obtaining residence and settlement rights. Legal entry for a short-term residence include: students, researchers and guest professors, skilled workers (earning minimal annual income of 33. 082 euro), managers and CEOs of multinationals (earning minimal annual income of 55. 193 euro), tourists and short-term business travelers.

The Chinese emigration is Europe already set off at the end of the 19 th century. However the recent wave from China needs to be contextualised in the current era of transnationalism and globalisation (Ong and Nonini 1997). Since contemporary migration is best represented and understood as a configuration of different actors and processes in the countries of origin, transit and destination, attention is also paid to the European dimension. Migration is a powerful force in the imagination of the Chinese as an individual and as a community. Migration stands for a channel for improvement of the livelihood of the family. When Chinese migrants are intercepted, they do not loose heart. On the contrary interceptions and imprisonment are obstacles in the migration project and trajectory. It is a conscious act, in which the family as a group is involved. The migrants see themselves not as victims but as actors, who deliberatley opt for migration as an instrument of social mobility. For some family, it is a survival strategy, for others it means an accelerated means of gaining more respect in the country of origin Among the Chinese newcomers, there is the ever-growing number of Chinese students and researchers. They will contribute to a more diversified image of the Chinese community in Europe. A similar trend is noticeable in business travel by Chinese. Those, who enter through family reunification, are at the current moment negligeable. The major bulk enters the country as illegal economic migrant. Generally these migrants rely on criminal networks for organising the journey. Given the restrictive immigration regime within the Schengen area, migrants travel in different steps, with stops in the newly emerged migration hubs such as Moscou, Prague, Kiev but also Istanbul and other major cities at the periphery, bordering 'Fortress Europe'. Concerning the forecasts, there are few indications that the migration movement will dry up. On the contrary it is very likely that the current trend will be sustained if not accelerated as the direct result of economic growth, more access to information, etc. in China. Thus, the diversification of the Chinese in Europe will be continued and reinforced consisting of skilled as well as unskilled migrants. Even when the current immigration policies in Europe do not change, there will be still a growing number Chinese entering as illegal economic migrants, students and researchers, highly skilled workers and probably also family reunification with the economic expansion of China.

40|$|The dangers {{arising from}} the French Revolution, an {{indigenous}} radical-republican movement and an Irish multi-faith nationalism persuaded the Pitt government from the outbreak of war in 1793 to consider new forms of state security. The process undertaken was pragmatic {{and the result was}} deliberately transitory. At the centre of developments was a phalanx of Christ Church-educated public servants, the most important of whom was William Wickham (1761 - 1840). Situated in a tiny sub-department of the <b>Alien</b> <b>Office,</b> Wickham's plan for an all-source centre of intelligence reached fruition during the great crisis of 1798 - 99. Contrary to received wisdom, this was not the result of a political policy that sought the development of a police state along French lines in Britain. Rather, it was a temporary wartime expedient which never lost sight of the values of traditional constitutional whiggism. With the Treaty of Amiens, the organisation was allowed to wither. The result was the unpreparedness of the Irish government for Robert Emmet's émeute of 1803. Wickham, ironically, as Chief Secretary for Ireland had to pick up the pieces. He resurrected his intelligence system in Dublin and, at the expense of his health and wellbeing, winkled out the last vestiges of revolutionary republicanism in Ireland. Wickham went into retirement and his vision of an all-source registry of intelligence was lost for another hundred years...|$|R

In 1795 he began his professional career as an artist, and in 1796 exhibited {{for the first time at}} the Royal Academy, showing a portrait and The Incredulity of St. Thomas; the latter forming the altar-piece of the chapel (once the hall of the house of Lord Chief Justice George Jeffreys) in Duke Street, Westminster.In 1800 Masquerier revisited Paris, and claimed, through the interest of Madame Tallien, whose portrait he painted, to have made a drawing of Napoleon Bonaparte as first consul. He certainly {{returned to}} England with sketches and notes, and with the help of Charles Turner and Henry Bernard Chalon very hurriedly painted in his London studio a picture of Napoleon reviewing the Consular Guards in the Court of the Tuileries, which he exhibited in Piccadilly in 1801. This picture attracted large crowds on the assumption that it was the first authentic likeness of Napoleon exhibited in England. The writer [...] "Peter Porcupine" [...] (an alias of William Cobbett, then a fierce critic of the French Revolution) accused him of being an alien spy and emissary of Napoleon. As a result he was summoned to the <b>Alien</b> <b>Office</b> by John Reeves, and only saved himself from deportation by the producing the registration of his birth at Chelsea.|$|R

50|$|From April 1915 only {{passengers}} with exit permits {{were allowed}} to leave the UK, and then only from certain ports. In an extension to their duties that would be repeated during World War 2, officers were tasked with retrieving ration documents from departing passengers. In 1916 a “Traffic Index” was created from the landing and embarkation cards collected at ports and matched together at the Home <b>Office’s</b> <b>Aliens</b> Branch HQ to show whether the person had complied with their conditions of entry. This simple process was the only mechanism for measuring {{the effectiveness of the}} control and continued until 1998 when embarkation controls were abolished. By 1920 the number of Aliens' Officers had reached 160.|$|R
2500|$|Once {{the legal}} {{exclusion}} of Jews from Hungarian society was complete, the National Central <b>Alien</b> Control <b>Office</b> (Külföldieket Ellenőrző Országos Központi Hatóság, KEOKH), turned its attention {{almost exclusively to}} expelling “undesirable” Jews. By the summer of 1941, the Hungarians carried out their first series of mass murders, and again in early January 1942 when they slaughtered 2,500 Serbs and 700 Jews, demonstrating that the political leadership in Hungary authorized the commission of atrocities even before the German occupation. Sometime in August 1941, the Hungarian authorities deported 16,000 [...] "alien" [...] Jews, {{most of whom were}} shot by the SS and Ukrainian collaborators. In the spring of 1942, the Hungarian Minister of Defense ordered the majority of Jewish forced labor to the theater of military operations. Due to this order as many as 50,000 Jews worked in forced labor companies starting in the spring of 1942 through 1944. Accompanying Hungarian troops during Operation Barbarossa, Jews in these units were poorly treated, insufficiently housed, [...] ill-fed, routinely used to clear minefields, and placed in constant unnecessary danger; estimates indicate that “at least 33,000 Hungarian Jewish males in the prime of life” died in Russia.|$|R
50|$|Valenti becomes {{convinced}} that Max {{was in the}} Crashdown that day and that he somehow healed Liz. He steals Liz's waitress uniform, which has a bullet hole in it, and gives it {{to a friend of}} his in the FBI for analysis. His son Kyle then tells him that he saw a silver handprint on Liz's stomach when they were on a date, similar to the one in the photograph, and Sheriff Valenti suspects that Max is not a teenager but rather a decades-old alien and a murderer. The FBI agent returns, telling him there was nothing found on the dress, and proceeds to remove any files on <b>aliens</b> from Valenti's <b>office.</b> Valenti is convinced, however, that the FBI is lying to him and conducting its own investigation.|$|R
6000|$|The {{members of}} this faction leave no doubt {{of the nature and}} the extent of the {{mischief}} they mean to produce. They declare it openly and decisively. Their intentions are not left equivocal. They are put out of all dispute by the thanks which, formally and as it were officially, they issue, in order to recommend and to promote the circulation of the most atrocious and treasonable libels against all the hitherto cherished objects of the love and veneration of this people. Is it contrary to the duty of a good subject to reprobate such proceedings? Is it <b>alien</b> to the <b>office</b> of a good member of Parliament, when such practices increase, and when the audacity of the conspirators grows with their impunity, to point out in his place their evil tendency to the happy Constitution which he is chosen to guard? Is it wrong, in any sense, to render the people of England sensible how much they must suffer, if, unfortunately, such a wicked faction should become possessed in this country of the same power which their allies in the very next to us have so perfidiously usurped and so outrageously abused? Is it inhuman to prevent, if possible, the spilling their blood, or imprudent to guard against the effusion of our own? Is it contrary to any of the honest principles of party, or repugnant to any of the known duties of friendship, for any senator respectfully and amicably to caution his brother members against countenancing, by inconsiderate expressions, a sort of proceeding which it is impossible they should deliberately approve? ...|$|R
60|$|I am {{now trying}} an {{experiment}} very frequent among modern authors, {{which is to}} write upon nothing, when the subject is utterly exhausted to let the pen still move on; by some called the ghost of wit, delighting to walk {{after the death of}} its body. And to say the truth, {{there seems to be no}} part of knowledge in fewer hands than that of discerning when to have done. By the time that an author has written out a book, he and his readers are become old acquaintance, and grow very loathe to part; so that I have sometimes known it to be in writing as in visiting, where the ceremony of taking leave has employed more time than the whole conversation before. The conclusion of a treatise resembles the conclusion of human life, which has sometimes been compared to the end of a feast, where few are satisfied to depart ut plenus vitae conviva. For men will sit down after the fullest meal, though it be only to dose or to sleep out the rest of the day. But in this latter I differ extremely from other writers, and shall be too proud if, by all my labours, I can have any ways contributed to the repose of mankind in times so turbulent and unquiet as these. Neither do I think such an employment so very <b>alien</b> from the <b>office</b> of a wit as some would suppose; for among a very polite nation in Greece {157} there were the same temples built and consecrated to Sleep and the Muses, between which two deities they believed the strictest friendship was established.|$|R
5000|$|During 1942, Trump became Secretary of the Microwave Committee, a {{sub-committee}} of the NDRC. The {{director of}} the Microwave Committee was Alfred Lee Loomis, the millionaire physicist, who decided to create a laboratory. He selected a site for it, chose a suitably discreet and ambiguous name for it and funded the construction, until the Federal administration was established. The new institution was the MIT Radiation Laboratory, or the [...] "Rad Lab". The British were also researching radar, which they termed Radio Direction Finder (RDF), and had started much earlier. Their Tizard Mission to the US showed how much more sophisticated they were {{with some of the}} technologies, particularly the magnetron. The US decided to send a team to Britain to help coordinate the efforts of the two Allies. The unit was known as the [...] "British Branch of the Radiation Laboratory" [...] (BBRL) and operated as a department of Britain's Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) at Malvern, in Worcestershire. In 1943, as the technical aide in Division 14 of the NDRC, Trump reviewed and analyzed the papers of Dr. Nikola Tesla when Dr. Tesla died in a New York City hotel. The research was completed on behalf of he <b>Alien</b> property Custodian <b>office</b> in Washington DC. From February 1944 {{to the end of the}} war in Europe, Trump was the Director of the BBRL. During this time, Trump also served in the Advisory Specialist Group on Radar, advising USAAF General Carl Spaatz on navigational radar, precision-bombing radar, and also defenses against the German radars found in their night-fighters and in their flak units. The systems included: Gee, Oboe, LORAN, H2X, MEW & SCR-584. Trump worked with all the most important British radar experts, including Sir Robert Watson-Watt, A.P. Rowe and Bernard Lovell. At the end of the war, Trump also had interviews with Germany's main radar technicians. Trump received recognition for his war-work from both the United States and the United Kingdom.|$|R
