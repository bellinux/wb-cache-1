Two rifts existed, one <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> contributions to the war in Afghanistan, and the other concerning whether or not NATO should assume a more global role.|$|E

5|$|Leo VI died in May 912 and was {{succeeded by}} his brother Alexander (r. 912–913), who reigned for {{little over a year}} before dying in June 913. Leo's empress, Zoe Karbonopsina, and his son and titular co-emperor, Constantine VII (r. 913–959), were sidelined during the reign of Alexander, who also {{restored}} Zoe's old adversary, Nicholas Mystikos, as Patriarch of Constantinople. Thus, at the death of Alexander (6 June 913), with Constantine VII not even eight years old, a power struggle ensued between Zoe and Patriarch Nicholas, who headed the regency council. It was at this point that Constantine Doukas launched a rebellion aiming for the throne. The Life of Euthymius hagiography, a source hostile to Patriarch Nicholas, reports that the Patriarch was also involved, although the other Byzantine sources include this as a widespread rumour rather than a fact. According to these sources, unaware that he would be appointed regent (Alexander named him to the regency council on his deathbed), fearful of losing his pre-eminent position, and anxious <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> threat posed by the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon, which required a more experienced hand {{at the helm of the}} state, the Patriarch summoned Doukas to assume the throne.|$|E
5|$|Nolan {{was born}} on 4 January 1818 to Babington and Elizabeth Nolan, in York County, Upper Canada. Following his father's {{dismissal}} from his minor diplomatic post at the British consulate in Milan, Nolan was accepted into the Austrian Inhaber Pioneer School at Tulln, where {{he was known as}} Ludwig by his fellow cadets. His father's desire to see him given a chance to enter a prestigious branch of the armed forces meant that Nolan was regularly transferred to other cadet schools to learn more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b> Enthusiastic about the cavalry, he was noted as an excellent horseman and student of military theory, as well as history. With the multi-lingual nature of Austro-Hungary, he also studied languages, including Hungarian. Other subjects studied there included fortification, water engineering, mathematics, fencing, swimming and bridge-building. Nolan graduated from the Pioneer School a year early in May 1835, probably following a recommendation from Prince Liechtenstein, and was made a subaltern in the 10th Austrian Hussar regiment.|$|E

25|$|Jawaharlal Nehru's {{concept of}} nonalignment brought India {{considerable}} international prestige among {{newly independent states}} that shared India's concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> confrontation between the superpowers {{and the influence of}} the former colonial powers. New Delhi used nonalignment to establish a significant role for itself as a leader of the newly independent world in such multilateral organisations as the United Nations (UN) and the Nonaligned Movement. The signing of the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Cooperation between India and the Soviet Union in 1971 and India's involvement {{in the internal affairs of}} its smaller neighbours in the 1970s and 1980s tarnished New Delhi's image as a nonaligned nation and led some observers to note that in practice, nonalignment applied only to India's relations with countries outside South Asia.|$|E
25|$|On the 14th, Eugene {{received}} {{an order to}} remain at Halle and that the main army was falling back in his direction. That day he heard the cannonade from the Jena-Auerstedt battles.

He instructed the detachment at Merseburg, which had been reinforced to two and a half battalions, to pull back to Halle. The Leipzig force was also recalled, while he sent back a detachment to hold Dessau on the Elbe River. He deployed his main force on high ground on Halle's south side, with his battle line facing northwest toward the city and his left bent back. The two and a half battalions from Merseburg were left to defend the bridges {{on the east side of}} Halle, together with a dragoon regiment. The Usedom Hussars were nearby, at the junction of the Saale and the Weisse Elster Rivers, just south of Halle. The Treskow Regiment was at Eisleben, to the west-northwest of Halle.|$|E
25|$|On 15 August 1975 President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and {{his family}} were assassinated at home as part of a {{military}} coup. One of Mujibur Rahman's cabinet ministers and a leading conspirator Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad gained the presidency and following the removal of Major General K M Shafiullah, appointed Ziaur Rahman (then deputy chief of army staff and Major General) army chief. It is thought that Zia knew <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> coup before it happened. However, the coup of 15 August caused a period of instability and unrest in Bangladesh and in the ranks and files of the army. Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf and the 46th Brigade of Dhaka Cantonment under Colonel Shafat Jamil staged a counter-coup on 3 November 1975, and Ziaur Rahman was forced to relinquish his post and put under house arrest. This was followed by (Sipoy-Janata Biplob) (Soldiers and People's Coup) ("National Revolution and Solidarity Day") on 7 November, a mutiny staged by the Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal (JSD or National Socialist Party) under retired Lieutenant Colonel Abu Taher and a group of socialist military officers. Khaled Mosharraf was killed and Colonel Jamil arrested, while Ziaur Rahman was freed by the 2nd Artillery regiment under Lt. Col. Rashid and re-appointed him as army chief.|$|E

500|$|According to Sadat, it {{was only}} when the Israelis cut off the Egyptian {{garrison}} at Sharm el-Sheikh that Nasser became aware of the situation's gravity. After hearing of the attack, he rushed to army headquarters to inquire <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> situation. The simmering conflict between Nasser and Amer subsequently came to the fore, and officers present reported the pair burst into [...] "a nonstop shouting match". The Supreme Executive Committee, set up by Nasser to oversee the conduct of the war, attributed the repeated Egyptian defeats to the Nasser–Amer rivalry and Amer's overall incompetence. According to Egyptian diplomat Ismail Fahmi, who became foreign minister during Sadat's presidency, the Israeli invasion and Egypt's consequent defeat was a result of Nasser's dismissal of all rational analysis of the situation and his undertaking of a series of irrational decisions.|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} was keen {{to avoid the}} break-up {{of the state and}} was increasingly inward-looking following the loss of Cuba. Regional nationalism, perceived as separatism, was frowned upon. In 1905 the army attacked the headquarters of two satirical magazines in Catalonia believed to be undermining the government. To appease the military, the government outlawed negative comments <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> or Spain itself in the Spanish press. Resentment of the military and of conscription grew with the disastrous Rif War of 1909 in Spanish Morocco. Lerroux's support of the army's aims lost him support. Events culminated in the Tragic Week (...) in Barcelona in 1909, when working class groups rioted against the call-up of reservists. 48 churches and similar institutions were burned in anti-clerical attacks. The riot was finally ended by the military; 1,725 members of such groups were put on trial, with five people sentenced to death. [...] These events led to the establishment of the National Confederation of Labour ( [...] , CNT), an anarchist-controlled trade union committed to anarcho-syndicalism. It had over a million members by 1923.|$|E
