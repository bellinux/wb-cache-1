5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease, women {{were less likely to be}} operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E

5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E
5|$|Globally, women's <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> {{remains a}} challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated {{by the fact that}} women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In the United Kingdom and worldwide, {{there is}} {{significant}} policy interest in {{improving the quality of}} care for patients with mental health disorders and distress. Improving quality of care means addressing not only the effectiveness of interventions but also the issue of limited <b>access</b> <b>to</b> care. Research to date into improving <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> has not been strongly rooted within a conceptual model, nor has it systematically identified the different elements of the patient journey from identification of illness to receipt of care. This paper set out to review core concepts underlying patient <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> synthesise these <b>to</b> develop a conceptual model of access, and consider the implications of the model for the development and evaluation of interventions for groups with poor <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> such as older people and ethnic minorities. Methods Narrative review of the literature to identify concepts underlying patient <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> and synthesis into a conceptual model to support the delivery and evaluation of complex interventions <b>to</b> improve <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Results The narrative review adopted a process model of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> care, incorporating interventions at three levels. The levels comprise (a) community engagement (b) addressing the quality of interactions in primary care and (c) the development and delivery of tailored psychosocial interventions. Conclusions The model we propose can form the basis for the development and evaluation of complex interventions in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> We highlight the key methodological challenges in evaluating the overall impact of access interventions, and assessing the relative contribution of the different elements of the model. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> service {{remains a}} major problem globally, but more obvious in {{developing}} countries including the Gambia. In general, mental illnesses even though are acknowledged as great contributors to the global burden of disease, they receive little attention at global, regional and local levels compared to other illnesses such as communicable diseases. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in the Gambia deserves urgent attention. Whereas no recent study is done to examine the prevalent rate and treatment gap, the available data shows that 90 % of mentally ill patients who require treatment do not receive it. The {{aim of this study}} was to contribute to the improvement of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> service by exploring factors that influence <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> service in the Gambia using a qualitative research design. In-depth interviews with 15 mentally ill patients using the community mental health services and 5 focus group discussions with the general population in the same health region were conducted. The findings of this study highlight many factors that could influence <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> service among people with mental illness in the Gambia. The most important of these factors that shed light on <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> service include; perception of and believed causes of mental illness, the scarcity of biomedical service for most of the population, resulting in patients and their families using what is available and long distance <b>to</b> <b>access</b> services. The lack of satisfaction from these services also leads to syncretic use of different treatment systems, coupled with high cost of treatment (traditional system) and antipsychotic medicine. The findings further show that the patient’s family shoulder the responsibility of providing the required financial resources for treatment and medication, but also decide where treatment is sort from. Efforts <b>to</b> improve <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> services should be approached holistically, as it is influenced by social, family and health system factors. This study however provides a base for action <b>to</b> address <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> service. Collaboration with traditional healers, provision of mental health services through the community mental health team and long term plan to address poverty can improve <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> service in Gambia...|$|R
