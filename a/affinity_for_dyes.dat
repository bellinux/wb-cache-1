30|$|In this review, a {{wide range}} of {{agricultural}} waste materials, as low-cost adsorbent has been presented. The use of these low-cost biosorbents is recommended since they are relatively cheap or of no cost, easily available, renewable and show highly <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> <b>dyes.</b> The process of biosorption requires further investigation in the direction of modeling, regeneration of biosorbent and immobilization of the waste material for enhanced efficiency and recovery. Further more interest should be concentrated by the researchers to predict the performance of the adsorption process for dye removal from real industrial effluents.|$|E

30|$|Dyeing {{potential}} of a natural dye extracted from Quercus robur L. (fruit cups) {{with a combination of}} Salix alba L. and Populus deltoides Bartram ex marsh (wood ash) mordants was studied on wool, cotton, silk and pashmina fabrics. Experiment was carried out in different combinations including and excluding mordants by adopting different mordanting methods. Dyeing performance was assessed in terms of dye absorption (%), Colour values (CIELAB), Colour strength (K/S), and fastness properties. The dye in combination with mordants showed significant importance and resulted in different shades on wool, silk and pashmina fabrics. However, the cotton fabric did not show much <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dye</b> and mordant and showed less <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dye</b> and mordants with lower values of colour quality and retention grades. Fastness properties of all dyed fabrics recorded excellent grades with slightly lower grades in unmordanted dyed samples.|$|R

The particle size of indigo dye agglomerates is influenced by cellulase origin and concentra tion.

Furthermore, we investigate the effects of different levels of mechanical action on cellulase adsorption on undyed and indigo dyed fabrics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{research into}} three different but interrelated technologies that can add value to commodity printing substrates by {{taking advantage of}} developments in synthetic chemistry, materials science and plasma physics. These investigations have been conducted in a Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) in Australia, called CRC Smartprint. Research into ink receptive coatings based on pigments possessing a positive surface charge has led to coatings that display improved resolution and colour saturation compared with silica based formulations. Although silica exhibits a high level of liquid absorption, it has relatively poor <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> <b>dye</b> molecules contained in ink-jet ink. The second development involves the use of plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition at atmospheric pressure to change surface functionality with particular emphasis on absorptive and printing properties. Thirdly, the development of a prototype labelling system based on the application of electrochromic conductive polymer to a flexible substrate that responds to electrical stimuli is discussed. Taken together, these three developments illustrate how both impact and non-impact printing technologies can be judiciously used to apply not only improved visual imagery to paper and paperboard, but also have the potential to enable printing of micro-electronic circuitry directly onto packaging materials, or onto labels that will enable a wide range of improved tracking, security and marketing functions to be incorporated cost-effectively into packaged goods in future...|$|R

Most of the organic material of the tube is secreted by the ventro-lateral epithelial cells which surround the main ducts of the calcium-secreting glands. These cells are always filled with a basiphil mucigen which contains some free a-glycol groups. This material retains its <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> basic <b>dyes</b> and <b>for</b> ferric iron at a low pH. The <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> iron is retained when the pH is low enough to exclude carboxyl and phosphoric acid groups from the reaction and it is probable that the sulphuric acid groups are respon-sible [...] The reactions of this mucigen to histochemical tests together with the similarity in behaviour of a precipitated heparin preparation make it likely that the material is a sulphomucopolysaccharide...|$|R
40|$|YB- 1, a {{multifunctional}} DNA- and RNA-binding nucleocytoplasmic protein, {{is involved}} in the majority of DNA- and mRNA-dependent events in the cell. It consists of three structurally different domains: its central cold shock domain has the structure of a b-barrel, while the flanking domains are predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Recently, we showed that YB- 1 is capable of forming elongated fibrils under high ionic strength conditions. Here we report that it is the cold shock domain that is responsible for formation of YB- 1 fibrils, while the terminal domains differentially modulate this process depending on salt conditions. We demonstrate that YB- 1 fibrils have amyloid-like features, including <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> specific <b>dyes</b> and a typical X-ray diffraction pattern, and that in contrast to most of amyloids, they disassemble under nearly physiological conditions...|$|R
30|$|The dye and mordants {{extracted}} from unexplored plant materials {{were found to}} be effective colouring agents <b>for</b> the <b>dyeing</b> of pashmina, wool and silk fabrics. The mordants enhanced the colour quality of the fabrics due to the increased efficiency in absorption, colour strength, colour coordinates and fastness grades in terms of washing, light and rubbing, respectively. However, the cotton fabric showed less <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dye</b> and mordant with lower values and grades. The most excellent results of the dye and mordant were recorded in pashmina followed by wool and silk fabrics. The dye applied on fabrics showed striking shades with the change in mordant and method both in combination and in isolation which were represented by fast and light colours of brown, red and yellow with varying shades and tones. Thus, the recorded observations recommend natural dyeing agents as a potential colouring material for wool, pashmina and silk fabric which can be explored commercially at national and international levels.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{the basic}} {{preparation}} processes of cotton knit fabric include scouring and bleaching. These treatments remove natural and human induced impurities, that is, noncellulosic constituents and other unwanted substances. Thus increase the <b>affinity</b> of cellulose <b>for</b> <b>dyes</b> and finishes. It {{may also be}} possible that any impurities remained in the fabric could not be removed at the elementary preparation processes and they also remained in the dyed fabrics, which were finally removed due to alkaline reductive stripping action. As a result, absorbency of the stripped fabric might also be increased showing higher wicking distant.|$|R
30|$|In this work, the preparation, characterization, and {{sorption}} of rhodamine 6 G and humic acids on {{a composite}} sodium alginate–bentonite were investigated. Their structure and morphology {{were analyzed by}} several techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and N 2 adsorption at −[*] 196  °C. A synergetic sorption mechanism was observed in binary systems; humic acids adsorption was enhanced {{by the presence of}} Rh 6 G in the mixture. The kinetic studies revealed that the sorption follows a pseudo-first-order kinetic model and the sorption capacities of Rh 6 G increased with the pH value. The Langmuir isothermal model well described the adsorption isotherm data, showing a maximum adsorption capacity for Rh 6 G up to 429.5  mg/g at 20  °C. On the basis of the data of the present investigation, it is possible to conclude that the composite exhibited excellent <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dye</b> and humic acids, and it can be applied to treat wastewater containing dye and natural organic matter.|$|R
40|$|Modification and {{characterization}} of bentonite from location Bogovina, Serbia {{was performed in}} order to obtain material applicable in wastewater purification. The < 75 μm bentonite fraction was used in organobentonite synthesis while the < 2 μm bentonite fraction, obtained by hydroseparation was used in pillaring procedure. Organo-modification of bentonite was performed with (1 -hexadecyl) trimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br). Pillared bentonite was obtained using standard procedure. Al 3 + and Fe 3 + ions were incorporated in pillars in 4 : 1 ratio and applied as catalyst in catalytic wet peroxide oxidation. Differences in structure of starting and modified bentonites were established by XRD analysis and nitrogen physisorption on - 196 °C. The (001) smectite peak around 2 θ = 6 ° shifts during the modification process. The Na-exchange process lowered d 001 from 1. 53 nm (2 θ = 5. 78 °) for starting clay to 1. 28 nm (2 θ = 6. 92 °), but the clay retained its swelling properties. The pillaring process increased and fixed the basal spacing to 1. 74 nm. Intercalation of HDTMA ions into smectite structure increased d 001 to 2. 00 nm for organobentonite. Specific surface area, SBET, was affected by particle size and type of modification. The samples with finer bentonite fraction had higher SBET due to increased smectite content. Na-exchanged bentonite samples had higher SBET value than starting clay samples of same granulation. Organomodification caused dramatic decrease in SBET value, while the pillaring process lead to an increase of SBET value. Adsorptive and catalytic purification of wastewaters containing dyes was tested using Acid Yellow 99 as a model dye. Na-exchanged bentonite had greater adsorption <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> <b>dye</b> adsorption than raw bentonite owing to higher SBET. By organomodification this affinity was enhanced more than 70 times due to transition of bentonite surface from hydrophilic to organophilic. Al,Fe pillared bentonite was proven to be efficient in catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of Acid Yellow 99 dye at room temperature...|$|R
30|$|As far as adsorptive {{properties}} are concerned, bentonite clay has an overall neutral charge; {{it has an}} excess negative charge on its lattice and {{is characterized by a}} three-layer structure with two silicate layers enveloping an aluminate layer. This arises from the partial replacement of tetravalent silica with trivalent aluminium that leads to the replacement of trivalent aluminium with divalent calcium. Since opposite charges attract, the negatively charged surface lattice of the bentonite clay may have an <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> cationic <b>dye.</b> Thus, it could be assumed that bentonite clay may have a greater capacity to adsorb cationic dye as it exhibited high removal of cationic Basic Blue 9 and Thioflavin T dyes (Ramakrishna and Viraraghavan 1997). Bentonite has been used to remove a number of chemical species: amines (Breen 1991); organic pigments (β-carotenes) (Gonzalez-Pradas et al. 1991); cations (Ni, Zn), phenol and ketones (Stockmeyer and Kruse 1991); phosphates (Gonzalez-Pradas et al. 1992); pesticides (Gonzalez-Pradas et al. 1993); chlorophyll (Gonzalez-Pradas et al. 1994); and non-ionic contaminants (Smith and Jaffe 1994; Espantaleón et al. 2003). Bentonite {{has proven to be a}} promising economic material for the removal of dyes due to its abundance and availability (Bellir et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Protein folding {{intermediates}} {{have been}} implicated in amyloid fibril formation involved in neurodegenerative disorders. However, the structural mechanisms by which intermediates initiate fibrillar aggregation have remained largely elusive. To gain insight, we used CPMG Relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy to determine the atomic-resolution three-dimensional solution structure of a 2 % populated, on-pathway folding intermediate of the A 39 V/N 53 P/V 55 L Fyn SH 3 domain. To this end, we used the backbone chemical shifts and RDCs/RCSAs of the “invisible” intermediate reconstructed from CPMG experiments as experimental input for structure calculations based on chemical shift restrained replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations via the CamShift approach (1). The COOH-terminus remains disordered in this intermediate (2), thereby exposing the aggregation-prone NH 2 -terminal beta-strand. Accordingly, mutants lacking the COOH-terminus and thus mimicking the intermediatea fail to safeguard the folding route and spontaneously form β-sheet-rich fibrillar aggregates with a diameter of several nanometers and an <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dye</b> Congo red. The structure provides a detailed characterization of the non-native interactions stabilizing an aggregation-prone intermediate under native conditions and insight into how such an intermediate can derail folding and initiate fibrillation...|$|R

The protein seemed to be enzymatically active either as a dimer of a 40, 000 -dalton peptide at pH 8. 6 or as a tetramer of 160, 000 molecular weight at pH 7. 0. The enzyme activity was present at high levels in cells growing anaerobically on glycerol, but disappeared with a half-life of about 45 min if molecular oxygen was introduced to the culture. In contrast, no such phenomenon occurred with dihydroxyacetone kinase activity, the second enzyme in the pathway. Immunochemical analysis showed that the inactivation of the oxidoreductase did not involve degradation of the protein. Furthermore, subunits of the active and inactive forms of the enzyme were indistinguishable in size on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and had similar isoelectric points (pH 4. 7). Inactivation did, however, alter the gel filtration properties of the enzyme protein and, more importantly, reduced its <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dye</b> Cibacron F 3 GA and the coenzyme NAD+...|$|R
40|$|The {{neuronal}} perikarya of the grasshopper contain sudanophilic lipochondria which exhibit an <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> vital <b>dyes.</b> These lipochondria are membrane-delimited {{and display}} acid phosphatase activity; hence they correspond to lysosomes. Unlike those of most vertebrates, these lysosomes also hydrolyze thiamine pyrophosphate and adenosine triphosphate. Like vertebrate lysosomal "dense bodies," they are electron-opaque and contain granular, vesicular, or lamellar material. Along with {{several types of}} smaller dense bodies, they are found in close spatial association with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi complexes are frequently arranged in concentric configurations within which these dense bodies lie. Some of the smaller dense bodies often lie close to or {{in association with the}} periphery of dense multivesicular bodies. Further, bodies occur that display gradations in structure between these multivesicular bodies and the dense lysosomes. Acid phosphatase activity is present in the small as well as the larger dense bodies, in the multivesicular bodies, and in some of the Golgi saccules, associated vesicles, and fenestrated membranes; thiamine pyrophosphatase is found in both the dense bodies and parts of the Golgi complex. The close spatial association of these organelles, together with their enzymatic similarities, suggests the existence of a functional or developmental relationship between them...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the immobilized triazine dye Cibacron Blue 3 G-A with rat, rabbit, sheep, goat, bovine and human serum albumins was studied by affinity gel electrophoresis. Dissociation constants were estimated in each instance and showed human serum albumin to have a significantly higher <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dye</b> than did albumin from any other species. Pretreatment of the defatted proteins with bilirubin (3 mol of bilirubin/mol of protein) did not increase the dissociation constants of the serum albumins, whereas pretreatment with palmitate (7 mol of palmitate/mol of protein) increased the dissociation constant in all cases: 3 -fold for human serum albumin, 15 -fold for other serum albumins. Increasing the bilirubin/albumin ratio (to 7 : 1) {{did not affect the}} dissociation constant of the albumins studied. Decreasing the palmitate/albumin ratio decreased the dissociation constant for human serum albumin, but did not affect those of bovine and rat albumins. Altering the chain length of the presaturating fatty acid dramatically changed the dissociation constant of both human and bovine serum albumins. Butyrate, hexanoate, octanoate and decanoate did not significantly influence the dissociation constants of bovine and human serum albumins for Cibacron Blue, whereas laurate, myristate and palmitate greatly increased the dissociation constant. These data are discussed in relationship to the behaviour of albumins during dye [...] agarose column chromatography. In Addendum the effect of nucleotide presaturation on the interaction between Bacillus stearothermophilus 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and the immobilized triazine dyes Cibacron Blue 3 G-A and Procion Red HE- 3 B was examined, and the implications <b>for</b> <b>dye</b> [...] ligand chromatography are discussed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHeterozygous {{nonsense}} {{mutations in}} the CDSN gene encoding corneodesmosin (CDSN), an adhesive protein expressed in cornified epithelia and hair follicles, cause hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp (HSS), a nonsyndromic form of alopecia. Truncated mutants of CDSN ((mut) CDSN), which bear the N-terminal adhesive Gly/Ser-rich domain (GS domain) of the protein, abnormally accumulate as amorphous deposits at {{the periphery of}} hair follicles and in the papillary dermis of the patient skin. Here, we present evidence that the (mut) CDSN deposits display an <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> amyloidophilic <b>dyes,</b> namely Congo red and thioflavin T. We also detected the serum amyloid protein component in the dermis of HSS patients. We demonstrated that recombinant forms of (mut) CDSN and of the GS domain assemble in vitro into ring-shaped oligomeric structures and fibrils. The amyloid-like nature of the fibrils was demonstrated by dye binding and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry measurements. We showed that the ring-shaped oligomers of (mut) CDSN, but not the fibrillar forms, are toxic to cultured keratinocytes. Finally, online algorithms predicted the GS domain to be a particularly disordered region of CDSN in agreement with circular dichroism measurements. This identifies HSS as a human amyloidosis related to the aggregation of natively unfolded (mut) CDSN polypeptides into amyloid fibrils...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{organization of}} bacterial ribosomes {{has been determined}} mainly {{from the study of}} purified fractions of disintegrated cells. In sections of cells from the exponential phase of growth, the cytoplasmic components are usually so densely packed that neither their shape nor their size is readily distinguishable. As a consequence, little work has been reported correlating biochemical information with bacterial morphology in sections at good resolution. Bacteria are one of the richest sources of ribonucleoprotein. According to Tissi~res et al.

The continuous electrocoagulation-adsorption system was more efficient <b>for</b> removing <b>dyes</b> than electrocoagulation alone. The thermodynamic parameters suggested the feasibility {{of the process and}} indicated that the adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic (ΔS= 0. 037 and − 0. 009 for MG and RY, resp.).

40|$|Histochemical {{properties}} and histologic staining {{characteristics of a}} variety of procedures are delineated for the three types of adenohypophyseal mucoid cells whose function has been identified by immunostaining methods. Content of glycoprotein hormones may, in part, account for the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reactivity in the thyrotropic and gonadotropic but not the melanocorticotropic cell types. The melanocorticotropic cells evidence basophilia attributable to sialic acid residues, sulfate esters and possibly an additional unidentified component with atypical reactivity. The finding that basophilia of thyrotropic and gonadotropic cells appears largely attributable to sulfate esters indicates the presence of acid mucosubstance other than the glycoprotein hormone in these cells. The effect of oxidation in inducing basophilia indicative of cysteine- or cystine-rich protein varies in the different cell types.

The Fc fragments of the γGa-, γGb-, γGc-, and -γA-globulins have been shown to possess unique antigenic determinants. Common γG- and γA-Fc fragment antigenic determinants, which were absent from the 10 Sγ 1 - and γM-globulins, have also been observed. All antibody populations share two antigenically distinct light (B, L) chain variants. The association of anti-Lac antibody with the hapten p-(p-dimethylamino-benzeneazo) -phenyl-β-lactoside has been measured by equilibrium dialysis and by fluorescence quenching. A variation in the affinity of anti-Lac antibody for hapten has been observed. The affinity of antibody was unaltered by enzymatic removal of the Fc fragments by peptic digestion or dissociation of the two combining sites on the papain 3. 5 S Fab fragments, indicating that the observed heterogeneity of affinities was not a direct function of the heterogeneity in structure of the Fc fragments. Isolated heavy (A, H) chains of γA-anti-Lac antibody have been shown to have retamed <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> Lac <b>dye</b> by equilibrium dialysis and by analytical ultracentrifugation, employing a combination of schlieren and absorption optics.

40|$|Despite {{the complex}} {{phenomena}} involved in encoding template molecule information within stable synthetic polymers to yield selective and efficient molecular recognition processes, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) are increasingly finding broad areas of application. Molecular interactions, both during the polymerization of the functional monomers {{in the presence}} of the template and during the processes of specific recognition after template removal, are key determinants of an effective MIP. Covalent and noncovalent template imprinting have been employed to achieve specific recognition sites. In the present study, a molecularly imprinted biocompatible polymer, having a high capacity and <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dye</b> template, nickel(II) phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid, has been prepared. UV-visible spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, and ICP analysis were used to investigate the aspects of the synthesis, binding capacity, and adsorption kinetics of the system. Poly(allylamine) cross-linked with epichlorohydrin has been used to represent an amino-functional receptor. Binding isotherms and capacities were correlated with the degree of template removal. Kinetic studies of binding allowed diffusion mechanisms to be evaluated for the fine particulate MIP. Ab initio molecular orbital calculations were performed using Hartree-Fock, MP 2, and density functional theory methods to determine the most likely mechanisms of molecular imprinting. Suitable theoretical models have been constructed to mimic the interactions between the template molecule and the polymer. Simulation of the vibrational spectra was also undertaken to make meaningful assignments to experimentally determined spectral bands resulting from these template MIP receptor interactions...|$|R

This spectral alteration could not be reversed but could be prevented by inclusion of 10 millimolar diethyldithiocarbamate and 140 millimolar 2 -mercaptoethanol in homogenization buffers. Similar blue shifts were induced in purified rye phytochrome by addition of the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent, 5, 5 ′-dithiobis-(2 -nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). In spectrally normal phytochrome (i. e., no detectable blue shift), Pfr had three to four more sulfhydryls available for rapid reaction with DTNB than did Pr. This difference was maintained over a 2. 5 -hour time course. Phytochrome purified under conditions resulting in a blue-shifted Pr absorption maximum exhibited a decreased short-term reactivity of Pfr to DTNB. Comparison of the binding and elution of altered and unaltered phytochrome from agarose-immobilized Cibacron blue 3 GA confirmed that the Pfr form of spectrally normal phytochrome had a greater <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dye</b> than did the Pr form but that spectral alteration of phytochrome {{was accompanied by a}} loss of this difference as evidenced by an increased binding of Pr to the dye.

The number of superhelical turns, τ, present in I is calculated at each dye concentration using Fuller and Waring's (1964) estimate of the angle of duplex unwinding per intercalation. The results reveal that SV 40 DNA I contains about - 13 superhelical turns in concentrated salt solutions. The free energy of superhelix formation is calculated {{as a function of}} τ from a consideration of the effect of the superhelical turns upon the binding isotherm of ethidium bromide to SV 40 DNA I. The value of the free energy is about 100 kcal/mole DNA in the native molecule. The free energy estimates are used to calculate the pitch and radius of the superhelix {{as a function of the}} number of superhelical turns. The pitch and radius of the native I superhelix are 430 Å and 135 Å, respectively. A buoyant density method for the isolation and detection of closed circular DNA is described. The method is based upon the reduced binding of the intercalating dye, ethidium bromide, by closed circular DNA. In an application of this method it is found that HeLa cells contain in addition to closed circular mitochondrial DNA of mean length 4. 81 microns, a heterogeneous group of smaller DNA molecules which vary in size from 0. 2 to 3. 5 microns and a paucidisperse group of multiples of the mitochondrial length. II. The general theory is presented for the sedimentation equilibrium of a macromolecule in a concentrated binary solvent in the presence of an additional reacting small molecule. Equations are derived for the calculation of the buoyant density of the complex and for the determination of the binding isotherm of the reagent to the macrospecies. The standard buoyant density, a thermodynamic function, is defined and the density gradients which characterize the four component system are derived. The theory is applied to the specific cases of the binding of ethidium bromide to SV 40 DNA and of the binding of mercury and silver to DNA. ...|$|R
40|$|The binding {{of genetically}} {{engineered}} Family II cellulose binding domains (CBDs) of Cellumonas fimi cellulases to cotton fabrics was studied and possible textile applications were investigated. Family II CBDs bound to cotton cellulose increased <b>dye</b> <b>affinity,</b> especially <b>for</b> acid <b>dyes,</b> but with very poor washing fastness. Ironing of the protein bound fabrics before dyeing increases dye affinity, which is probably due to protein denaturation and thus increases exposition of ionic groups. For desorption of CBD proteins from the cotton fabric, high levels of mechanical agitation and alkaline conditions (pH > 7) are necessary. Binding of Family II CBDs to cellulose releases fine particles, whereas migration and desorption did not. Long time storage of cotton fabrics with adsorbed CBD proteins did not cause changes in their physical properties and did not damage cotton cellulose. The presence {{of water on the}} surface of cellulose was found to be essential for the interfabric migration of Family II CBDs. The double binding cellulose domain binds strongly on cotton and their interfabric migration is smaller. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|The mordant {{and methods}} of {{mordanting}} showed the significant variation in colour strength (K/S) of the dyed fabrics. The dye, mordants, methods, interaction of dye × mordant, dye × method, mordant × method and dye × mordant × method showed {{a significant effect on}} colour strength of the dyed fabrics. Among the selected fabrics, maximum colour strength values (K/S) 0.739 and 0.736 were recorded in pashmina fabric using Salix alba and Populus deltoides in post-mordanting method (Fig.  1 a, b), whereas, the lowest value (0.662) was recorded with Salix alba in simultaneous mordanting, highest colour strength (0.689) was recorded in wool fabric with Salix alba in post-mordanting and lowest value (0.602) was recorded with Populus deltoides in simultaneous mordanting. Cotton fabric does not show much <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dye,</b> mordant and their combinations. Silk fabric exhibited the highest value of 0.695 with Populus deltoides in post-mordanting (Fig.  2 b), while the lowest value (0.555) was recorded with Salix alba in pre- and post-mordanting (Fig.  2 a). The pashmina fabric recorded the maximum K/S value followed by the wool, silk and cotton fabrics. The mordants used in combination with the dyes and in isolation showed a significant change in the colour strength of the fabrics as per the type of the fabrics and method adopted. However, unmordanted samples also showed fair K/S values for each fabric and method. The relative colour strength followed the similar trend and altered as per the efficiency in the K/S of the dyed fabrics in different methods (Fig.  2 a, b; Fig. 3 a, b). The lower values of the colour strength of the cotton fabric can be related to the unsaturated moiety of the natural dyes bearing ionizable hydroxyl and carboxylic groups. Cotton by its nature is negatively charged in water, thus exhibiting poor absorption <b>for</b> natural <b>dyes</b> due to the repulsion effect which causes lower colour strength of the dye on the fabric (Kampeerapappun et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of dyes and heavy metals is usual in industrial processes like chrome tanning in tannery industry and their removal {{may be an}} environmental problem. Different techniques were developed and applied {{for the treatment of}} dyes and heavy metals in effluents. Among them, adsorption showed to be an economic, simple operation and an effective technique. Zeolites have a strong <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> cations of transition metals, but only little <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> anions and non-polar organic molecules. The application of a zeolite to heavy metal removal may be improved by the {{presence of}} microorganisms. The aim of this work is the treatment of an effluent containing dyes and toxic metals. Several operation parameters such as pH, concentration and kinetic behavior were studied. This innovative process <b>for</b> treating <b>dyes</b> and heavy metal effluents showed that the zeolite-biomass system is able to perform the removal of a combination of Azure B and chromium(VI).

30|$|Presently, the {{applications}} of metal nanoparticles as adsorbents {{have been on}} increase due to their morphology such as highly reactive sites, controlled size and high surface area. Multi-walled carbon nanotube (Yang and Xing 2010), MgO (Li et al. 2012; Mahmoud et al. 2015), chitosan–zinc oxide (Salehi et al. 2010), zero-valent iron (Satapanajaru et al. 2011), silver (Satapathy et al. 2013), gold (Xu, 2010), NiO (Samiey and Farhadi 2013), TiO 2 (Hsiao et al. 2014; Lyu et al. 2014) nanoparticles have been employed in wastewater purification and {{have proved to be}} faster in action and more effective in performance. Also, catalytic degradation of dyes has been achieved using nanoparticles (Bogireddy et al. 2015; Han et al. 2013; Kumari and Philip 2015; Lateef et al. 2016 a, b, c; Ojo et al. 2016; Oladipo et al. 2017). Despite the excellent adsorptive capacity of nanoparticles, toxicity arising from their use has been of great concern. Nano-TiO 2 has limited adsorption <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> anionic <b>dyes,</b> and was reported to cause unusual sedimentation, haemagglutination, haemolysis of erythrocytes in humans and physical changes to aquatic ecosystem (Li et al. 2008; Canesi et al. 2010). Nano-Fe 3 O 4, nano-ZnO and nano-MgO were found to be toxic to human lung alveolar epithelial cells, neurons as well as animal cells (Choi and Choy 2009; Lu et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2009). Carbon nanotubes are reported to be toxic to human dermal fibroblast cells. This might not be unconnected with their methods of preparation which are chemical/reduction methods (Patlolla et al. 2010). To avoid toxicities arising from physical and chemical-based synthetic routes, green (biological) synthesis of nanoparticles which does not involve the use of hazardous chemicals provides effective route for non/less toxic and eco-friendly nanoparticles (Vanaja et al. 2014; Adelere and Lateef 2016; Lateef et al. 2016 d, e; Pavya et al. 2016; Shukla and Iravani 2017).|$|R
40|$|The glomerular {{epithelial}} polyanion is {{a specialized}} cell surface component found on renal glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) that {{is rich in}} sialoprotein(s), as detected by staining with cationic dyes (colloidal iron, alcian blue) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). We have isolated rat glomeruli and analyzed their protein composition by SDS PAGE in 5 - 10 % gradient gels. When the gels were stained with alcian blue or "Stains All," a single band with an apparent Mr of 140, 000 was detected that also stained very prominently with silver, but not with Coomassie Blue. This band predominated in fluorograms of gels of isolated glomeruli that had been labeled in their sialic acid residues by periodate-[3 H]borohydride. In lectin overlays, the 140 -kilodalton (kd) band was virtually {{the only one that}} bound [125 I]wheat germ agglutinin, and this binding could be prevented by predigestion with neuraminidase. [125 I]Peanut lectin bound exclusively to the 140 -kd band after neuraminidase treatment. An antibody was prepared that specifically recognizes only the 140 -kd band by immunoprecipitation and immuneoverlay. By immunoperoxidase and immunogold techniques, it was localized to the surface coat of the glomerular epithelium and, less extensively, to that of endothelial cells. When analyzed (after electroelution from preparative SDS gels), the 140 -kd band was found to contain approximately 20 % hexose and approximately 4. 5 % sialic acid. These findings indicate that the 140 -kd protein is the major sialoprotein of the glomerulus, and it is the only component of glomerular lysates with an <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> cationic <b>dyes</b> and lectins identical to that defined histochemically for the epithelial polyanion in situ. Since this molecule is a major component of the cell coat or glycocalyx of the podocytes, we have called it "podocalyxin. ...|$|R
40|$|Large {{quantities}} of sodium chloride (NaCl) or sodium sulfate (N%SO,) {{are used in}} the exhaust dyeing of cellulose with fiber reactive dyes. Many traditional fiber reactive dyes require 50 - 100 g/L of the salts to promote adequate exhaustion. Even with the large {{quantities of}} water required for rinsing the dyeings, the effluent still averages 2000 - 3000 ppm NaCl when it is used, [I]. This level exceeds the current toxicity limit for NaCl established by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and many dyers are discharging at or above this level [2]. Recent attempts to lower the levels of NaCl or NqSO, in waste water effluent have involved the selection of <b>dyes</b> with higher <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> cellulose and <b>dyeing</b> at lower liquor ratios [3]. Also, many dyestuff manufacturers have developed a line of fiber reactive dyes that require less salt to promote exhaustion [4]. Neither of these efforts has proven to be totally satisfactory. This work was undertaken to explore the use of other compounds for promoting exhaustion and fixation of fiber reactive dyes on cellulosic fibers. Experimental 10. 0 g bleached cotton skeins from Testfabrics, Inc. were used in all experiments. Unfinished C. I.

30|$|The {{presence}} of NaCl (an electrolyte) greatly enhanced the adsorption capability of activated clay as the charge density in the diffusion layer was significantly increased, {{which in turn}} minimized the volume of diffusion layer required to neutralize the surface charge. Sodium cation had a thinning effect on the diffusion layer formed {{on the surface of}} the particles. Although the total net charge did not change, the thickness of the diffusion layer diminished significantly (Benefield et al. 1982). Similar results with little discrepancies were obtained for BR 18 and BY 28 due to the differences in the molecular structures of the dyes. The wastewater temperature affected the adsorption rate as well as the adsorption capacity; in some positively and in others negatively. However, lower temperatures facilitated the adsorption of BR 46 with similar results observed for BY 28 and BR 18, although they were not as significant as for BR 46. The activated clay showed excellent <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the basic <b>dyes</b> and the degree of adsorbability depended greatly on the species of basic dyes, temperature and relative concentrations of the adsorbate and the adsorbent. Sodium chloride contained in the wastewater exerted a positive effect on the adsorption (Hsu et al. 1997).|$|R
