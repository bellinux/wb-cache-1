5|$|Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, {{but a small}} {{minority}} experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started observing the sky <b>at</b> <b>radio</b> wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (e.g. the One-Mile Telescope).|$|E

5|$|Before {{pre-production}} began, songwriters Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber {{were commissioned}} {{to integrate the}} film's soundtrack.

It {{became a major}} box-office success, making four times more money than any other motion picture released in 1938.

5|$|Jean-Michel Jarre {{was born}} in Lyon on 24 August 1948, to France Pejot, a French Resistance member and {{concentration}} camp survivor, and composer Maurice Jarre. When Jarre was five, his parents split up and his father moved to America, leaving him with his mother. He did not see his father again until reaching the age of 18. For the first eight years of his life, Jarre spent six months each year at his maternal grandparents' flat on the Cours de Verdun, in the Perrache district of Lyon. Jarre's grandfather was an oboe player, engineer and inventor, designing an early audio mixer used <b>at</b> <b>Radio</b> Lyon. He also gave Jean-Michel his first record player.
