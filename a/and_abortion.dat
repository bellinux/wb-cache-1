These regions will be than deliminated into several groups based on the similarity of the developement of fertility <b>and</b> <b>abortions.</b> The {{first part of this}} report is mainly focused on explanation of basic terms, delimination of indicators and description of the methods of adjusting these indicators. Second part describes the developement of aggregate fertility <b>and</b> <b>abortions</b> indicators <b>and</b> also specific levels of fertility <b>and</b> <b>abortions</b> since the beginning of 1990 's. Third part is dedicated to delimination of Czech Republic regions after the NUTS classification and to the following analysis of fertility <b>and</b> <b>abortions</b> indicators in several regions of Czech Republic.

5|$|Feminist {{campaigns are}} {{generally}} considered to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender neutrality in English, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives <b>and</b> <b>abortion),</b> and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims because men are also harmed by traditional gender roles.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, {{a number}} of {{activities}} which are or were illegal in other Australian states were legalised in the ACT. These include the sale of X-rated pornographic materials (1989) and prostitution in brothels (1992), although brothels are only permitted {{to operate in the}} suburbs of Hume, Mitchell and Fyshwick. The personal use of cannabis was decriminalised in 1992 <b>and</b> <b>abortion</b> was decriminalised in 2002. In 2006, the ACT Government attempted to introduce a law recognising civil unions, but it was overturned by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|During the Qing Dynasty's two-century {{rule over}} Taiwan, the {{population}} of Han on the island increased dramatically. However, {{it is not clear}} to what extent this was due to an influx of Han settlers, who were predominantly displaced young men from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian province, or from a variety of other factors, including: frequent intermarriage between Han and aborigines, the replacement of aboriginal marriage <b>and</b> <b>abortion</b> taboos, and the widespread adoption of the Han agricultural lifestyle due to the depletion of traditional game stocks, which may have led to increased birth rates and population growth. Moreover, the acculturation of aborigines in increased numbers may have intensified the perception of a swell in the number of Han.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{coronary}} artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most {{years of life}} lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.

50|$|Pope Benedict XVI later gave a {{controversial}} speech in Angola where {{he appeared to}} blur the distinction between indirect <b>abortion</b> <b>and</b> direct <b>abortion.</b> He condemned all forms of abortion, even those considered to be therapeutic.

5|$|Millett {{graduated}} in 1956 magna cum laude from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature; {{she was a}} member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. A wealthy aunt paid for her education at St Hilda's College, Oxford gaining an English literature first-class degree, with honors, in 1958. She was the first American woman to be awarded a degree with first-class honors having studied at St. Hilda's. After spending about 10 years as an educator and artist, Millett entered the graduate school program for English and comparative literature at Columbia University in 1968, during which she taught English at Barnard. While there, she championed student rights, women's liberation, <b>and</b> <b>abortion</b> reform. She completed her dissertation in September 1969 and was awarded her doctorate, with distinction, in March 1970.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{election}} date was set as September 10, national organizations {{on both sides}} of the gun-control debate started to weigh in. On the recall, pro-gun rights side was the National Rifle Association and Americans for Prosperity, while on the gun control side was the Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Mayor Bloomberg. Morse went door-to-door in an effort to gain voter support and both sides of the campaigns accused the other side of mud-slinging. Morse supporters were upset about an ad alleging ethical misconduct by Morse, noting that he had been cleared of those allegations. Giron supporters were accused of misrepresenting the issue as a choice on women's rights <b>and</b> <b>abortion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer <b>and</b> <b>abortion,</b> the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E
40|$|Serum {{concentrations}} of pregnancy-associated plasma pro-tein A (PAPP-A) were measured {{in patients with}} pregnancy-related gynaecologic emergencies including ectopk pregnancy (n = 124) <b>and</b> intrauterine <b>abortion</b> (n = 40). The results were compared with those in normal pregnancy {n = 136) and non-pregnant women (n = 460). In ectopic pregnancy <b>and</b> intrauterine <b>abortion,</b> the PAPP-A levels were lower than in normal pregnancy. In patients with a pregnancy-related gynaecologic emergency PAPP-A was undetectable in 82 % of the ectopic pregnancies and in 55 % of the intrauterine abortions. Considering the frequency of ectopic pregnancy (35. 8 %) <b>and</b> intrauterine <b>abortion</b> (52. 3 %) among all patients with pregnancy-related disorders, {{the likelihood that a}} preg-nant patient with undectable PAPP-A has an ectopic preg-nancy is 30 %, <b>and</b> intrauterine <b>abortion</b> is 29 %. These results indicate that although PAPP-A levels in ectopic pregnancy <b>and</b> intrauterine <b>abortion</b> are lower than in normal preg-nancy, PAPP-A measurement cannot be used to distinguish between ectopic pregnancy <b>and</b> intrauterine <b>abortion.</b> Key words: PAPP-A/ectopic pregnancy/intrauterine abortio...|$|R

5|$|Some bioethicists deem it {{reasonable}} {{for parents to}} select a child who would have the highest well-being. One criticism of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue that Down syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement {{does not have a}} position on screening, although some members consider testing <b>and</b> <b>abortion</b> discriminatory. Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled, while others do not. Of a group of 40 mothers in the United States who have had one child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. teenage {{pregnancy}} rate is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991. In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, {{and the lowest}} in Wyoming. Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births <b>and</b> <b>abortion</b> rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15â€“44 remain {{higher than those of}} most Western nations. In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.|$|E
5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, <b>and</b> <b>abortion.</b> This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E

5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>Abortion,</b> Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, one pressing problem was the very high number of unwanted pregnancies of rape victims. Estimates of the number of pregnancies resulting in births range from 25,000 to the Bangladeshi government's figure of 70,000, while one publication by the Centre for Reproductive Law and Policy gave a total of 250,000. A government-mandated victim relief programme was set up with the support of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation, among whose goals it was to organise abortion facilities to help rape victims terminate unwanted pregnancies. A doctor at a rehabilitation centre in Dhaka reported 170,000 abortions of pregnancies caused by the rapes, and the births of 30,000 war babies during the first three months of 1972. Dr. Geoffrey Davis, an Australian doctor <b>and</b> <b>abortion</b> specialist who worked for the programme, estimated that there had been about 5,000 cases of self-induced abortions. He also said that during his work he heard of numerous infanticides and suicides by victims. His estimate of the total number of rape victims was 400,000, twice as high as the official estimate of 200,000 cited by the Bangladeshi government. Most of the victims also contracted sexual infections. Many suffered from feelings of intense shame and humiliation, and a number were ostracised by their families and communities or committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} birth-control clinic {{was established}} in Britain in 1921 by Marie Stopes working with the Malthusian League. The clinic, run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors, offered women's birth-control advice and taught them {{the use of a}} cervical cap. Her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms. In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League, which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. In 1924 the Society for the Provision of Birth Control Clinics was founded to campaign for municipal clinics; this led to the opening of a second clinic in Greengate, Salford in 1926. Throughout the 1920s, Stopes and other feminist pioneers, including Dora Russell and Stella Browne, {{played a major role in}} breaking down taboos about sex. In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control <b>and</b> <b>abortion</b> into the political sphere â€“ three months later, the Ministry of Health, in the United Kingdom, allowed local authorities to give birth-control advice in welfare centres.|$|E

40|$|Under Peruvian law, {{abortion}} is illegal {{unless it is}} necessary {{to save the life of}} the mother. At the same time a woman can be imprisoned if she receives an illegal abortion. Yet, despite its illegality and the threat of punishment, there are over 350, 000 illegal <b>and</b> clandestine <b>abortions</b> performed each year in Peru and nearly 65, 000 of these women are hospitalized due to complications. Peru has the second-highest maternal mortality rate in South American <b>and</b> unsafe <b>abortions</b> account for nearly one quarter of the deaths. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women may provide an answer to the problem of unsafe <b>and</b> illegal <b>abortions</b> in Peru. Although it doesn 2 Ì† 7 t explicitly provide that a woman has a right to access safe <b>and</b> legal <b>abortions,</b> it impliedly does so. This Note argues that the actions of the Conventionâ€™s Committee reveal that a woman has a right to safe <b>and</b> legal <b>abortions</b> <b>and</b> that Peruvian women should take the next step by asserting their claim to this right through the formal complaint procedure...|$|R
