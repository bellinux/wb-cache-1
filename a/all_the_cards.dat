5|$|Afterwards, Eriol Hiiragizawa, a {{transfer}} student from England, arrives in Tomoeda and begins causing disturbances with two guardian-like creatures, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Sakura is suddenly unable {{to use the}} Clow Cards and transforms her wand, beginning the process of evolving the cards into Sakura Cards as Eriol causes strange occurrences that forces her to use and thus transform certain cards. Once <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting the cards so they would not lose their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. Cardcaptor Sakura concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with a promise to return. Two years later, Syaoran moves back to Tomoeda permanently.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} loop, Crusher again has {{a feeling of}} déjà vu during the poker game, but when Data deals the next hand, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind. The number 3 begins appearing throughout {{other parts of the}} ship's operations while, again, they determine they are stuck in a time loop. When they reach the anomaly and the ship appears from it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, and executes Riker's option instead of his own. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew realize they have been trapped in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has been missing for over 90 years. Picard welcomes the Bozemans crew to the 24th century.|$|E

25|$|Drawing {{continues}} {{until everyone}} has drawn 25 cards and {{a pool of}} reserve cards (usually consisting of about eight cards), remains. The dealer then picks up <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards,</b> integrates them into his hand, and then discards {{the same number of}} cards into a pile in the center, known as the kitty. These cards are kept unopened throughout the duration of that round and {{may or may not be}} turned over thereafter, depending on the result of the last trick in the round.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} a {{compromise}} and hastily prepared, apparently {{so it could}} be launched in time for the anniversary of Tsushima, but appeared well thought out, well organized, and finely timed when viewed from a Japanese viewpoint. Against four carriers, two light carriers, 11 battleships, 16 cruisers and 46 destroyers likely to be {{in the area of the}} main battle the US could field only three carriers, eight cruisers, and 15 destroyers. The disparity appeared crushing. Only in numbers of carrier decks, available aircraft, and submarines was there near parity between the two sides. Despite various mishaps developed in the execution, it appeared that—barring something unforeseen—Yamamoto held <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|E

25|$|Thus the re-organized ND {{was in a}} {{situation}} where it sold PCs, Sintran systems and Unix systems. In January 1990, the business units started negotiating the internal prices. Although top management had originally proposed that the partners could buy services from outside the company and the teams sell outside the company, such transactions were stopped by top management. ServiceTeam achieved high internal prices through the negotiations as they held <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b> With the introduction of standard hardware platforms, computer manufacturers had to deliver unique software portfolios to avoid a pure price competition. With the spin-off of Notis, ND allowed one of their few competitive advantages to be available for all platforms. The three partner divisions were pure sales divisions and secured all the revenue for the team-divisions and DataShop. However, the partner divisions had very low margins so the profits were being made in the other business units, and thus receiving the praise of top management.|$|E
25|$|In the 2008 PBA Fiesta Conference, the team, bannered by 6-ft 9-in hulking import Steve Thomas with Gary David and Arwind Santos, {{entered the}} Finals {{for the first}} time in {{franchise}} history. They then faced the crowd-darlings of Philippine basketball, the Barangay Ginebra Kings. During Game 1, Ginebra took the game via a 105–96 decision. The Express came roaring back in Game 2 by plastering the Kings to a 124-90 route. Game 3 was also bagged by the Express. However, the Kings managed to tie the series in Game 4 with a 90–77 win. In Game 5, Air21 squeaked past the Kings with a 76–73 dogfight and a 3–2 advantage in the series. Needing only one game to win the series and the very first championship of the team, Air21 was prevented by a depleted lineup of the Kings due to injury, and forced a deciding Game 7 with an 80–75 victory in Game 6. And in Game 7, with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> in place, the two teams fought gallantly to the finish, but the more experienced Ginebra showed resiliency and defeated the Express, denying them the title. Even with the shortcoming, it was still the best showing of the team since they entered the league in 2002.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "" [...] tournament formats, a {{small number}} of cards are opened for play from booster packs or tournament packs, and a minimum deck size of forty cards is enforced. The most popular limited format is draft, in which players open a booster pack, choose a card from it, and pass it to the player seated next to them. This {{continues}} until <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> have been picked, and then a new pack is opened. Three packs are opened altogether, and the direction of passing alternates left-right-left.|$|E

2500|$|A {{panelist}} {{chosen by}} Daly would begin the game. If his question elicited a yes answer, he continued questioning. When a question was answered no, questioning {{passed to the}} next panelist and $5 {{was added to the}} prize. The amount of the prize was tallied by Daly who flipped one of 10 cards on his desk. A contestant won the top prize of $50 by giving ten no answers, or if time ran out, with Daly flipping <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b> As Daly occasionally noted, [...] "Ten flips and they (the panel) are a flop!" [...] Daly later explained, after the show had finished its run on CBS, the maximum payout of $50 was to ensure the game was played only for enjoyment, and that there could never be even the appearance of impropriety. Later in the series, Daly would throw <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> over with increasing frequency and arbitrariness (frequently to give a particularly interesting or worthy panelist the maximum available prize money), evidence the prize was secondary to game play.|$|E
2500|$|After the shuffle, {{the dealer}} {{will offer a}} cut to the player on their right, then {{distribute}} the cards. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> are dealt in partnership pinochle. In variations for odd numbers of players like three, a [...] "widow's hand" [...] (also called a [...] "kitty", [...] "talon", or [...] "stock") of cards remain.

The deal rotates clockwise, so the dealer's left-hand opponent will deal next.|$|E

2500|$|Soon after O'Neill's death, {{his widow}} Carlotta Monterey demanded that Random House {{contravene}} O'Neill's explicit wishes and publish the play at once. [...] "We refused, of course," [...] wrote publisher Bennett Cerf in his memoirs, [...] "but then were horrified {{to learn that}} legally <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> were in her hand. … I do not regret that we took the stand we did, because I still think we were right."

2500|$|A {{few days}} later Tito arrived and Maclean had to convey Churchill's displeasure at his sudden and unexplained departure. [...] Tito had been to Moscow at Stalin's invitation, to arrange matters with the Soviet High Command. [...] Maclean helped to hammer out a draft agreement, and went to London with it, while Tito's envoys took it to Moscow. [...] "It was a {{difficult}} and thankless task. King Peter, quite naturally, {{was not easy to}} reassure, and Tito, sitting in Belgrade with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> in his hand, was not easy to satisfy." [...] The bargaining went on for months, and meanwhile Maclean's staff wanted to get away, to assist guerrilla wars elsewhere. [...] When the Big Three (Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin) met at Yalta in February 1945, and made it clear that Tito and Šubašić had to get on with it, King Peter gave in, and all the pieces fell into place. The regents were sworn in, as was the united government, and the British ambassador flew in. [...] Maclean was finally able to leave.|$|E

Shortly before the wedding Tony becomes intoxicated and has sex with a woman who Darren has paid. Tony admits this to Cindy who in turn admits she and Darren had been planning to scam Tony. Waring said Tony has [...] "been a good man telling the truth and Cindy takes that as her opportunity to tell him the truth. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> are on the table". Pickard said he was [...] "surprised that Tony would go through with it because of their volatile relationship and the fact that Tony knows Cindy's into Darren. I think he wanted to just go for it with her, and hopefully it'll work out for him". Pickard later stated that he didn't think Cindy was right for Tony stating: [...] "I don't think she's the one for him, to be honest". Tony meets Gabby Sharpe (Phina Oruche) which allows him to realise [...] "his marriage is over and he intends to tell Cindy that as soon as he gets home".|$|E
