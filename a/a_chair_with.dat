5|$|The pig-faced women {{exhibited}} at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it {{large amounts of}} strong beer, and then shave it. Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would {{be attached to the}} bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> a hole in the back, and securely tied to the chair.|$|E

Both ride in silence up to the fourth floor, with Scully somewhat unsettled by the experience. At Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) apartment, Mulder and Scully begin discussing a case the pair are working on, wherein {{the heart of the}} victim had been removed with the absence of any significant physical evidence. Mulder believes the heart was removed with a technique known as psychic surgery.

5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} {{cinematic}} black bars expanding {{to reveal the}} scenery, which {{is set in a}} beach. Individual takes of the girls are shown momentarily as Dinah sings the chorus. The camera shifts to Fetty Wap, who is sitting down in <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> a guitar next to him. As he sings, the girls are seen dancing in the water, with Lauren kicking the water as the video goes into a slow-motion take for less than a second. Several of the scenes include Normani alone in a rock cliff, a close-up of Dinah singing and a shot of the girls together near the water.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> his head turned in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to his temptations and walk {{to the end of the}} table where Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends. The video was made available to download digitally via iTunes on May 12, 2008.|$|E

5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>with</b> the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of a leopard with glowing blue eyes (later {{revealed}} to be Kesha) walking down an alleyway. The song's title flashes {{on the screen and}} the video pans to Kesha. She walks down the alleyway with two men who grab another man. Kesha spray-paints a dollar sign on his chest. They come to a party where she and her friends flash their tattooed dollar signs on their wrists and forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> two men by her side. Jeffree Star then approaches Kesha. Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid spilling {{over the top of the}} glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from the cup and turns back into a leopard.|$|E

25|$|All six cover sleeves for Japonesque were {{photographed by}} {{photographer}} and designer Kazuyoshi Shimomura. The standalone CD has {{a close-up of}} Koda looking down to the camera, holding a cigarette holder. The CD and DVD format has a long shot of Koda sitting at on <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> different flowers sitting on the head piece. The three limited edition box set cover sleeves are similar images with different poses; the first box set has Koda {{standing in front of}} a wall with Japanese design; Koda is holding a traditional Oil-paper umbrella and is dressed in a pink kimono. The second box set artwork has Koda facing towards the camera, similar to the previous box set. The only change in the third box set artwork is that Koda is seen without holding the umbrella. The digital release uses the first limited edition box set artwork. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Japanese designer Jun Hirota, and the design was based on traditional Japanese culture and the emphasizing of geisha art. The photo album that came with the second limited edition box set features a 28-page spread, featuring different images from the Japonesque photo shoot.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor, her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her right hand on her heart as she looks up, adoringly, at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests {{on the edge of a}} table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood crucifix. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen. Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's stole. Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of Christ's crucifixion is hung on the wall behind the woman. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer. <b>A</b> <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone.|$|E
