5|$|By 7,000 BC, sowing <b>and</b> <b>harvesting</b> {{reached the}} fertile soil of Mesopotamia, where Sumerians systematized it and scaled it up. By 8,000 BC, farming was entrenched {{on the banks}} of the River Nile. About this time, {{agriculture}} was developed independently in the Far East, probably in China, with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop. Maize was domesticated from the wild grass teosinte in West Mexico by 6,700 BC.|$|E

5|$|Sowing <b>and</b> <b>Harvesting</b> and Market, popularly {{referred}} to as the Vršac triptych, is a three-panel oil painting by the Serbian realist Paja Jovanović. Painted around 1895, it shows the everyday interactions of the inhabitants of Vršac, a multi-ethnic and multi-religious town in the Banat region of Austria-Hungary of which Jovanović was a native. The painting was commissioned by the Vršac city council in 1895 for the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} the North American river otter has been {{significantly}} reduced by habitat loss, beginning with the European colonization of North America. In some regions, though, their population is controlled to allow the trapping <b>and</b> <b>harvesting</b> of otters for their pelts.

5|$|Also in 1878 he drew up {{the plans}} for a theatre in the former town of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (now a {{district}} of Barcelona); Gaudí did not {{take part in the}} construction of the theatre, which no longer exists. The following year he designed the furniture and counter for the Gibert Pharmacy, with marquetry of Arab influence. The same year he made five drawings for a procession in honour of the poet Francesc Vicent Garcia i Torres in Vallfogona de Riucorb, where this celebrated 17th-century writer and friend of Lope de Vega was the parish priest. Gaudí's project was centred on the poet and on several aspects of agricultural work, such as reaping <b>and</b> <b>harvesting</b> grapes and olives; however, as a result of organisational problems Gaudí's ideas were not carried out.|$|E

30|$|The cabbage variety Bronco {{was less}} {{preferred}} by thrips. The more preferred variety Lennox when planted <b>and</b> <b>harvested</b> {{earlier in the}} growing season harbored fewer thrips and experienced lower damage than Lennox planted <b>and</b> <b>harvested</b> later in the season. Planting varieties with tolerance to thrips damage may serve to protect cabbages without use of insecticides. For organic growers on PE Island, there are currently no available chemical products to protect their crop. Thrips have demonstrated a preference for certain cabbage varieties {{in other parts of}} the world and these have been used successfully to reduce thrips damage. Timing of planting <b>and</b> <b>harvest</b> may also play a role in avoiding damage from thrips. This study demonstrates that commercially available varieties planted <b>and</b> <b>harvested</b> early in the season on PE Island exhibit reduced damage from thrips.|$|R

5|$|Manuel Belgrano {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{politicians}} to advocate the development of an important educative system. He did so at the first report he made as head of the Consulate of Commerce, suggesting the creating of schools of agriculture and commerce. A school of agriculture would teach about important topics such as crop rotation, the specific ways to work with each crop, methods of seeding <b>and</b> <b>harvesting,</b> preservation of seeds, and identification of pests. Until that time, the only previous attempts to teach agriculture was done by the Jesuits, who were banished in 1767.|$|E
5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where planting <b>and</b> <b>harvesting</b> one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E

It is habitat for the drill monkey, which is found in the wild only in this area and across the border in Cameroon. The areas surrounding Calabar, Cross River State, also in this forest, are believed to contain the world's largest diversity of butterflies. The area of southern Nigeria between the Niger and the Cross Rivers has lost most of its forest because of development <b>and</b> <b>harvesting</b> by increased population, with it being replaced by grassland (see Cross-Niger transition forests).|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} {{suffered a}} downturn {{between the two}} world wars, as working horses were replaced by lorries and peat demand dropped, but after the Second World War peat {{was used by the}} horticultural industry in increasing volumes, <b>and</b> <b>harvesting</b> expanded again. From 1947, experiments were made with locomotives on the tramways, and they soon replaced horses. A total of 23 had worked on the system {{by the time it was}} closed down. The extraction process was mechanised in the 1960s, with the introduction of machines that could cut and stack the peat turves. In 1981 mechanical loading of the turves into the trains was introduced. Surface milling of the peat was introduced in 1985, which completely stripped the surface of large areas of the moors.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of {{settlers}} {{were attracted}} to the Dakota Territory in the 1870s and 1880s for its cheap land, and the population began to rise. Many established small family farms, but some investors bought thousands of acres for bonanza farms, where they supervised the cultivation <b>and</b> <b>harvesting</b> of wheat as a commodity crop. The city grew quickly after {{the arrival of the}} Great Northern Railway in 1880 and the Northern Pacific Railway in 1887.

40|$|This {{technical}} document supports the Forest Service’s requirement {{to assess the}} status of renewable natural resources as mandated by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (RPA). It updates past reports on national and regional trends in population <b>and</b> <b>harvest</b> estimates for species classified as big game and small game. The trends reported here were derived from State Wildlife Agency biologists and supplemented with data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey for those bird species that are commonly sought by upland game hunters. Big game populations <b>and</b> <b>harvests</b> have generally increased over the 1975 - 2000 period. Small game populations <b>and</b> <b>harvests,</b> particularly those associated with grassland and agricultural systems, show strong patterns of decline. However, population <b>and</b> <b>harvest</b> trends for both groups need to {{be interpreted with caution}} because: (1) not all state agencies reported both population <b>and</b> <b>harvest</b> statistics for all species that are commonly sought by recreational hunters, and (2) there were cases of inconsistent reporting at the species level within RPA reporting regions that necessitated aggregating across species. The trends documented here are consistent with trends documented in past RPA reports completed in 1989 and 1999, although those data were also qualified by the same interpretational caveats that apply to the current report. Trends observed generally among big game species were encouraging, but the continual decline in small game populations <b>and</b> <b>harvest</b> remains an important wildlife resource management issue. Until population <b>and</b> <b>harvest</b> monitoring is improved among institutions that share the stewardship responsibility for recreationally important wildlife, national and regional trends will have to be interpreted carefully...|$|R

5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing <b>and</b> <b>harvesting</b> techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Millet cultivation: The {{discovery}} in northern China of domesticated varieties of broomcorn and foxtail millet from 8500 BC, or earlier, suggests that millet cultivation might have predated that of rice {{in parts of}} Asia. Clear evidence of millet began to cultivate by 6500 BC at sites of Cishan, Peiligang and Jiahu. Archaeological remains from Cishan sum up to over 300 storage pits, 80 with millet remains, with a total millet storage capacity estimated for the site of about 100,000kg of grain. By 4000 BC, most Yangshao areas were using an intensive form of foxtail millet cultivation, complete with storage pits and finely prepared tools for digging <b>and</b> <b>harvesting</b> the crop. The success of the early Chinese millet farmers is still reflected today in the DNA of many modern East Asian populations, such {{studies have shown that}} the ancestors of those farmers probably arrived in the area between 30,000 and 20,000 BP, and their bacterial haplotypes are still found in today populations throughout East Asia.|$|E
