5|$|There {{were serious}} {{scientific}} {{objections to the}} process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no <b>adaptive</b> <b>advantage</b> could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.|$|E

Because variation is not always controlled by selection, we need to know the size of a population before we can predict its evolutionary dynamics.|$|E

25|$|Ricord's iguana, {{like most}} Cyclura ssp is {{primarily}} herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, berries, and fruits from different plant species.

25|$|Forest tent {{caterpillars}} are ectotherms so {{they rely}} on sources of heat from the environment to raise their body temperatures. In order to do this, they bask together and benefit from group thermoregulation. Elevating body temperature is essential in increasing metabolic rates for movement and food processing, so proper thermoregulation leads to an increased rate of development. This {{is very important for}} M. distria caterpillars, which rely on fast growth in spite of low environmental temperatures to benefit from the high food quality and the smaller predation risk in the spring. Thus, it is an <b>adaptive</b> <b>advantage</b> to bask in groups. However, as caterpillars grow, thermoregulatory needs decrease and the benefit of group living is gradually overridden by other factors such as food competition.|$|E

It seems odd that evolution left humans in this vulnerable position, unless there are some advantages to individuals or groups, under at least some conditions, of anxious and avoidant attachment styles. I argue that a social group containing members with different attachment patterns may be more conducive to survival than a homogeneous group of securely attached individuals because each attachment disposition has specific <b>adaptive</b> <b>advantages</b> that promote the survival of the individual and people around him or her when facing threats and perils.

25|$|Fungal prions are {{considered}} {{by some to be}} epigenetic because the infectious phenotype caused by the prion can be inherited without modification of the genome. PSI+ and URE3, discovered in yeast in 1965 and 1971, are the two best studied of this type of prion. Prions can have a phenotypic effect through the sequestration of protein in aggregates, thereby reducing that protein's activity. In PSI+ cells, the loss of the Sup35 protein (which is involved in termination of translation) causes ribosomes to have a higher rate of read-through of stop codons, an effect that results in suppression of nonsense mutations in other genes. The ability of Sup35 to form prions may be a conserved trait. It could confer an <b>adaptive</b> <b>advantage</b> by giving cells the ability to switch into a PSI+ state and express dormant genetic features normally terminated by stop codon mutations.|$|E
25|$|As black colored wolves occur more {{frequently}} in forested areas than on the tundra (black coats occur in about 62% of wolves in the forested areas of the Canadian Arctic, compared with about 7% in the icy tundra), melanism was concluded by the researchers to give those wolves an <b>adaptive</b> <b>advantage.</b> The mutation’s purpose {{has not yet been}} identified. Dr Barsh ruled out camouflage, as wolves have few natural predators, and {{there is no evidence that}} a black coat color leads to any increase in hunting success rates. Dr. Barsh observed that beta-defensin is involved in providing immunity to viral and bacterial skin infections, which might be more common in forested, warmer environments. It has been suggested that the mutation's association with forested habitats means that the prevalence of melanism should increase as forests expand northward. Dark fur is believed to be dominant in wolves. A mating between a black and a gray wolf resulted in ten pups with dark fur out of a total of fourteen.|$|E

500|$|Other philosophers, however, have {{suggested}} that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes. No one has given a causal explanation, they argue, of why {{it would not be}} possible for a functionally equivalent non-conscious organism (i.e., a philosophical zombie) to achieve the very same survival advantages as a conscious organism. If evolutionary processes are blind to the difference between function F being performed by conscious organism O and non-conscious organism O*, it is unclear what <b>adaptive</b> <b>advantage</b> consciousness could provide. As a result, an exaptive explanation of consciousness has gained favor with some theorists that posit consciousness did not evolve as an adaptation but was an exaptation arising as a consequence of other developments such as increases in brain size or cortical rearrangement. Consciousness in this sense has been compared to the blind spot in the retina where it is not an adaption of the retina, but instead just a by-product of the way the retinal axons were wired. [...] Several scholars including Pinker, Chomsky, Edelman, and Luria have indicated the importance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and memory {{in the context of the}} development of higher-order consciousness (see Neural correlates section above).|$|E
500|$|Pinker is {{critical}} of theories about the evolutionary origins of language that argue that linguistic cognition might have evolved from earlier musical cognition. He sees language as being tied primarily to the capacity for logical reasoning, and speculates that human proclivity for music may be a spandrel — a feature not adaptive in its own right, but that has persisted through other traits that are more broadly practical, and thus selected for. In How the Mind Works, Pinker reiterates Immanuel Kant's view [...] that music is not in itself an important cognitive phenomenon, but that it happens to stimulate important auditory and spatio-motor cognitive functions. Pinker compares music to [...] "auditory cheesecake", stating that [...] "As far as biological cause and effect is concerned, music is useless". This argument has been rejected by Daniel Levitin and Joseph Carroll, experts in music cognition, who argue that music has had {{an important role in}} the evolution of human cognition. In his book This Is Your Brain On Music, Levitin argues that music could provide <b>adaptive</b> <b>advantage</b> through sexual selection, social bonding, and cognitive development; he questions the assumption that music is the antecedent to language, as opposed to its progenitor, noting that many species display music-like habits that could be seen as precursors to human music.|$|E
500|$|As noted earlier, {{even among}} writers who {{consider}} consciousness to be a well-defined thing, {{there is widespread}} dispute about which animals other than humans {{can be said to}} possess it. Edelman has described this distinction as that of humans possessing higher-order consciousness while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with non-human animals (see previous paragraph). Thus, any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties. [...] Nevertheless, some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of [...] evolutionary biology as an adaptation {{in the sense of a}} trait that increases fitness. [...] In his article [...] "Evolution of consciousness", John Eccles argued that special anatomical and physical properties of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness (" [...] psychon ... linked to [...] dendron through quantum physics"). [...] Bernard Baars proposed that once in place, this [...] "recursive" [...] circuitry may have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms. Peter Carruthers has put forth one such potential <b>adaptive</b> <b>advantage</b> gained by conscious creatures by suggesting that consciousness allows an individual to make distinctions between appearance and reality. This ability would enable a creature to recognize the likelihood that their perceptions are deceiving them (e.g. that water in the distance may be a mirage) and behave accordingly, and it could also facilitate the manipulation of others by recognizing how things appear to them for both cooperative and devious ends.|$|E

In previous two-choice laboratory experiments, we found the highest relative proportion of oviposition on cabbage to correspond either to plant growth stages ≈ 7 – 8 wk or ≈ 9 – 11 wk old, depending on the alternate host plant with which it was presented. In cabbage-only trials, leaves from 7 - to 8 -wk-old plants were preferred.

2500|$|In some {{lines of}} descent from the {{earliest}} organisms, the diploid stage of the sexual cycle, which was at first transient, became the predominant stage, because it allowed complementation — the masking of deleterious recessive mutations (i.e. hybrid vigor or heterosis). Outcrossing, the second fundamental aspect of sex, is maintained by the advantage of masking mutations and the disadvantage of inbreeding (mating with a close relative) which allows expression of recessive mutations (commonly observed as inbreeding depression). This is in accord with Charles Darwin, who concluded that the <b>adaptive</b> <b>advantage</b> of sex is hybrid vigor; or as he put it, [...] "the offspring of two individuals, especially if their progenitors {{have been subjected to}} very different conditions, have a great advantage in height, weight, constitutional vigor and fertility over the self fertilised offspring from either one of the same parents." ...|$|E

[...] Pain has the <b>adaptive</b> <b>advantage</b> that it invokes a level of learning, thereby preventing the animal from repeatedly exposing itself to potential injury. Pain cannot be directly measured in other animals, including other humans; responses to putatively painful stimuli can be measured, but not the experience itself.
