40|$|The Australian fitness {{profession}} has grown {{rapidly in the}} past three decades, but there has been unequal growth in the ethical practices of its workers. The purpose of this book is to examine the ethical beliefs and behaviours of Australian fitness professionals. Several questions are of particular interest: 1) How ethical are the beliefs and behaviours of Australian fitness professionals? 2) How do the ethical beliefs and behaviours of Australian university trained fitness professionals compare with TAFE (community) college trained fitness professionals? This book explores the ethical knowledge and practices of Australian fitness professionals and compares their beliefs <b>and</b> <b>behavious</b> with practitioners from other helping professions such as psychology. Issues examined in this book include: 1) the ethics education of fitness professionals; 2) the regulation of questionable behaviours by practicing members of the fitness profession; 3) and the professional boundaries of Australian fitness workers. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — There {{are many}} {{difference}} algorithms used for unknown worm detection. Some algorithms use static features, while others use dynamic features. However, no algorithm that can perfectly detect all unknown worms. Because, each detection method {{has its own}} drawbacks. It’s difficult to detect polymorphic worms with only static features or it takes more time to execute dynamic detection algorithms. This paper describes an algorithm for detecting unknown worms and its variations based on features previously extracted from the analyzed files. This set of features is statically defined in this proposal and the method for extracting such features is also described. The proposed algorithm can detect worm and its variations with a small sample features set. This approach is not only applied well to detect worms with static features but also can be developed to detect worms based on their dynamic features <b>and</b> <b>behavious.</b> This is a first-attempt for demonstrating {{the effectiveness of the}} detection algorithm that uses both static features and dynamic features.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. In {{order to}} reduce the number of road accidents, the causes must be {{identified}} and measures adopted to minimise these causes. Causes of road accidents can be categorised into human factors, vehicle factors and road factors. In South Africa, road accidents are primarily caused by human factors and to a lesser degree, vehicle and road factors. December is the month of the year with the highest number of road fatalities in South Africa. Measures adopted to reduce the road carnage in December, need to be applied throughout the year. Jaywalking and speeding are the main contributory factors of road accidents in South Africa. Jaywalking would be reduced by re-settling residents of informal settlements adjacent to freeways away from these high-mobility routes. South African road users are aggressive with a lot of road rage compounded by alcohol abuse. Education of pedestrians and motorists is vital in changing driver <b>and</b> pedestrian <b>behavious.</b> Enforcement is required to ensure that traffic rules and regulations are adhered to.

This event was {{in stark contrast to}} the well wishers and clear blue sky that engulfed Space Shuttle Columbia STS 107 as she took off on the 16 th of January with eight Australian spiders on a sixteen-day mission into space. Students of the Glen Waverley Secondary College with RMIT University and the Royal Melbourne Zoo designed the experiment. This process has led the students into direct contact and collaboration with established space entities NASA, Bioserve and Spacehab as well as international researchers. The class activities include the design of the experiment and investigations into issues such as life-support, flight clearance and mission simulation. The hypothesis tested whether spiders can build orb-webs in Microgravity conditions, and how Microgravity affects the web structure, method of production and quality of silk. Despite the tragic loss of Columbia and her crew during the STS 107 mission, the STARS experiment has yielded some insight that has assisted biological researchers in investigating the effect of micro gravity on the health <b>and</b> <b>behavious</b> of spiders for the development of a space Greenhouse. The development of habitat and automated feedings for spiders and similar life forms also provide valuable experience and insights into supporting life in space.

40|$|We {{consider}} one of {{the fundamental}} problems of classical invariant theory - the research of Poincare series for an algebra of invariants of Lie group SL_ 2. The first two terms of the Laurent series expansion of Poincare series at the point z = 1 give us important information about the structure of the algebra I_d. It was derived by Hilbert for the algebra I_d=C[V_d]^ SL_ 2 of invariants for binary d-form (by V_d denote the vector space over C consisting of all binary forms homogeneous of degree d). Springer got this result, using explicit formula for the Poincare series of this algebra. We consider this problem for the algebra of joint invariants I_ 2 n=C[V_ 2 ⊕ V_ 2 ⊕ [...] . ⊕ V_ 2 _n times]^SL_ 2 and the algebra of joint covariants C_ 2 n=C[V_ 2 ⊕ V_ 2 ⊕ [...] . ⊕ V_ 2 _n times⊕C^ 2]^SL_ 2 of n quadratic forms.

Such political ambient is suitable to proliferation of nationalistic, confrontational and anti-constitutional rhetoric and practices, which reach its peak during period of pre-election campaigns. Unfinished legislative election framework, purposeful obstruction of international election standards and domestic legislative on behalf of most of political subjects, deficiency of professional and independent media, undeveloped civic society, and politicized and undercapacitated institutions which are involved with subject of regularity of the election process, are the reason for lack of candidate's will for constitutional, legislative <b>and</b> ethical <b>behavious</b> during pre-election campaign. Due to this, pre-election campaign of most of political subjects is mainly negative, and not focused on elementary questions of standard of living and priority challenges of state and society (necessary constitutional reforms, Euro-Atlantic integrations, structural economic reforms, unemployment etc.), but on mutual confrontations, stress on big political questions {{of the status of}} entities and constituent nations, then on nationalistic rhetorics of negating consitutional and historical facts, and on mutual ungrounded discreditation, which generates atmosphere of fear, national homogenization and searching of the culprit for bad situation in society, inside of other national corpus, and not among own political representtatives...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{draws on}} four theories to analyse {{the linkage between}} firms’ attributes, from the ownership structure perspective, and their internationalisation strategies by integrating international business research with ideas of corporate governance and institutional analysis.

Based on a sample of 338 foreign market entries by 267 non-diversified Chinese firms from assorted industries and secotrs between 2010 and 2013, the findings indicate that the greater equity ownership by institutional shareholders and insiders is positively associated with a preference for full-control entry modes. By contract, state ownership has nagative but unstable implication to the choice of full-control modes. The resrults from empirical study provide new {{evidence to support the}} pervasive influence from ownership structure to firms’ strategic choice in the international arena...|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{frequency}} and severity of eating disorder psychopathology amongst female adolescents and young adults, research examining the development and prevention of disordered eating has focused predominantly on these populations. However dieting awareness <b>and</b> weight control <b>behavious</b> are evident in {{children as young as}} seven, and are particularly apparent in girls. Psycho-educational and early intervention programs subsequently developed for pre-adolescent children have had limited success due to their theoretical grounding in adult and adolescent research and their focus on the 'pathological', rather than an understanding of what constitutes 'normal' versus 'non-normal' eating behaviours for children. In an attempt to redress this lack of understanding, the present study used semi-structured interviews to examine the eating and dieting related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of nineteen girls (aged six to 13 years). The findings from the qualitative analysis indicated that young girls' eating and dieting related beliefs and behaviours are shaped via a complex interplay between developmental and socialisation processes and individual differences. The findings of this study will provide the basis for programs promoting positive health outcomes for young girls...|$|R

Well characterized human and murine monoclonal antibodies and Fab/Fv fragments thereof as well as mouse/human chimeric antibodies were employed. While, lgG 1, 2 and 4 antibodies with identical specificities (affinity constants) have identical partition properties, lgG antibodies with different partition properties reacted with different partition epitopes or had different affinities against the same epitope. Hence, the surface properties of the antigen binding sites dominate over all other surfaces of the free antibody molecule. LLPC may {{also be used to}} detect conformational changes occuring upon binding of antigen by antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes formed by different lgG antibodies against a large antigen like HSA all had similar surface properties. different from those of both antigen and antibody. In contrast, the surface properties of complexes formed by small antigens haptens are related to those of the lgG antibody. In addition, antigen-antibody complexes were found to have similar surface properties irrespective of the molar ratio of antigen to antibody at which the complexes had been formed...|$|R
