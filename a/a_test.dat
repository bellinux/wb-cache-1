5|$|In August 1957, the US assented to {{a two-year}} testing {{moratorium}} {{proposed by the}} Soviet Union, but required that it be linked to restrictions on the production of fissionable material with military uses, a condition that the Soviet Union rejected. While Eisenhower insisted on linking <b>a</b> <b>test</b> ban to a broader disarmament effort (e.g., the production cut-off), Moscow insisted on independent consideration of <b>a</b> <b>test</b> ban.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Soviet military–industrial complex also opposed <b>a</b> <b>test</b> ban, {{though some}} scientists, {{including}} Igor Kurchatov, were supportive of antinuclear efforts. France, {{which was in}} the midst of developing its own nuclear weapon, also firmly opposed <b>a</b> <b>test</b> ban in the late 1950s.|$|E
40|$|Arsenic (<b>As)</b> <b>testing</b> {{could help}} 22 million people, using {{drinking}} water sources that exceed the Bangladesh As standard, to identify safe sources. A cluster randomized controlled trial {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effectiveness of household education and local media in the increasing demand for fee-based <b>As</b> <b>testing.</b> Randomly selected households (N = 452) were divided into three interventions implemented by community workers: 1) fee-based <b>As</b> <b>testing</b> with household education (HE); 2) fee-based <b>As</b> <b>testing</b> with household education and a local media campaign (HELM); and 3) fee-based <b>As</b> <b>testing</b> alone (Control). The fee for the <b>As</b> <b>test</b> was US-Dollars 0. 28, higher than the cost of the test (US-Dollars 0. 16). Of households with untested wells, 93 % in both intervention groups HE and HELM purchased <b>an</b> <b>As</b> <b>test,</b> whereas only 53 % in the control group. In conclusion, fee-based <b>As</b> <b>testing</b> with household education is effective in the increasing demand for <b>As</b> <b>testing</b> in rural Bangladesh...|$|R

5|$|The AEC would {{eventually}} concede, as well, that even {{low levels of}} radiation were harmful.

40|$|All {{evaluation}} {{tests were}} performed at room ambient pressure and temperature, with discharges at a 2 hour rate. Tests consisted of phenolphthalein leak tests, three capacity <b>tests,</b> <b>an</b> auxiliary electrode <b>test,</b> <b>a</b> charge retention <b>test,</b> <b>an</b> internal short <b>test,</b> <b>a</b> charge efficiency <b>test,</b> overcharge <b>tests,</b> and <b>a</b> pressure versus capacity test.

5|$|Aged 19, Harvey was the {{youngest}} player of the touring party. An attacking left-handed middle-order batsman, he had become {{the youngest}} Australian to score <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> century by compiling 153 in the Fifth Test against India in the preceding Australian summer of 1947–48. However, Harvey struggled {{early on in the}} tour, having difficulty adapting to English conditions. After being omitted from the first-choice team {{in the first half of}} the tour, Harvey's performances improved with his increasing familiarity with local conditions and he was called into the team for the Fourth Test at Headingley after an injury to Sid Barnes. Harvey scored 112 in a first innings counter-attack to keep Australia in contention after they had suffered a top-order collapse. Harvey hit the winning boundary in the second innings as Australia won the match with <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> world record successful run-chase of 3/404. He retained his place for the Fifth Test, ending the series with 133 runs at a batting average of 66.50.|$|E

5|$|An inept batsman with {{an average}} of 5.78 in his {{first-class}} career, Toshack managed <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> average of 51.00 on the 1948 tour after being dismissed only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in a freewheeling tenth-wicket stand with Johnston.|$|E

5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. <b>A</b> <b>test</b> is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Morris {{was a key}} {{member of}} Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948. The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches; this {{unprecedented}} feat by <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles.|$|E
5|$|As a team, the Australians {{were greeted}} by record crowds and gate {{receipts}} across the country, even when wet weather curtailed the matches. The record attendance for <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> match in England was broken three times, in the Second Test at Lord's, the Third Test at Old Trafford, and the Fourth Test at Headingley. The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> on English soil.|$|E
25|$|Taking <b>a</b> genealogical DNA <b>test</b> {{requires}} the submission of a DNA sample. The most common way {{to collect a}} DNA sample, which {{can be done by}} either visiting <b>a</b> DNA <b>test</b> clinic or by ordering <b>a</b> home <b>test</b> through <b>an</b> independent DNA <b>test</b> supplier, is by a cheek-scraping (also known as a buccal swab). Other methods include spit-cups, mouthwash, and chewing gum. After collection, the sample is mailed to <b>a</b> <b>testing</b> lab.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 195455 season, along with Neil, Ray was called into an Australian XI for <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> trial against Len Hutton’s touring English team, the closest that two Harveys came to playing in <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> for Australia together. Ray did not make an impact in the match, scoring only seven in his solitary innings, and was not {{selected}} for Australian duty. He came in at No. 4 after the dismissal of his brother. Ray was selected for all six of Victoria’s matches and played in all of these matches alongside Neil, as the domestic season was shortened and there were no scheduling clashes between the Tests and the domestic matches. Mick also played in all of Queensland's matches, and three brothers met in their states’ only meeting for the season.|$|E
5|$|Back in England, Trescothick {{was called}} upon to captain England after Michael Vaughan {{sustained}} a knee injury. Although other England captains had seemed to suffer a lack of batting form, the extra authority did not affect Trescothick, and he forged a good partnership with debutant Andrew Strauss against New Zealand. This understanding developed in the second Test with a first-wicket partnership of 153; Trescothick went on to score 132, his sixth Test century. Trescothick's partnerships with Strauss were to average 52.35 in 52 innings. His first century against the West Indies followed in the second Test, and Trescothick became {{the first player to}} make centuries in both innings of <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> match at Edgbaston, and the ninth England player to score a century in each innings of <b>a</b> <b>Test</b> match. Trescothick was again England's best One Day International batsman in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, scoring 261 runs in just four innings, including a century in the final; he also took his fourth ODI wicket.|$|E
