5000|$|Before General Motors invited Bel Geddes {{to submit}} a {{proposal}} for the exhibit, they had planned to put in another production line as was featured at their exhibit in the Century of Progress Exposition of 1933 in Chicago. However, after they heard Bel Geddes outline his project <b>all</b> <b>other</b> plans were <b>scrapped</b> as they favoured his design for its appeal to a broader audience. [...] The Futurama exhibition was subsequently presented {{as one of the}} 1939 New York World Fair’s main attractions, as it was the [...] "number-one hit show". It captured the fancy of the public and critics alike, with journalists competing to find adequate words to convey Bel Gedde's [...] "ingenuity", [...] "daring", [...] "showmanship" [...] and [...] "genius". One neutral survey of 1000 departing fairgoers awarded the General Motors exhibit 39.4 points to only 8.5 points for second place Ford as the most interesting exhibit. Business Week described the scene: More than 30,000 persons daily, the show’s capacity, inch along the sizzling pavement in long queues until they reach the chairs which transport them to a tourist’s paradise. It unfolds a prophecy of cities, towns, and countrysides served by a comprehensive road system.|$|R

6000|$|Fourthly, Graham's {{statement}} from Martinsburg that Imboden is in retreat for Harrisonburg. This last matches {{with the idea}} that Lee has retained his cavalry, sending Imboden and perhaps <b>other</b> <b>scraps</b> to join Ewell. Upon this probability what is to be done? ...|$|R

5000|$|Tompkins's quilts {{were not}} made from old clothes or <b>other</b> <b>scraps</b> but from fabrics she {{purchased}} for their textures and light-reflecting qualities, including velvet, fake fur, wool, silk and Lurex.

50|$|Originally, two weights {{would have}} driven {{the time and}} strike trains. The clock would have been rewound {{manually}} on a weekly or semi-weekly basis.

50|$|Some {{fragments}} of bronze rivets and <b>other</b> <b>scraps</b> of bronze {{have been identified}} as the remains of a knife that would have been at least 200 years older {{than the rest of the}} items.

50|$|Hargrove {{was held}} captive by FARC-associated guerrillas in several {{different}} primitive campsites in the Colombian Andes {{for a total of}} 11 months.
