5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, {{including}} {{many of the}} players involved, released books expressing various points of view about bodyline. Many {{argued that it was}} a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see what all the fuss was about. The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities. The MCC asked Harold Larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion,</b> pointing out that he had been following orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood refused, never played for England again, and became vilified in his own country. Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, In Quest of the Ashes, described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful. The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised. This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.|$|E

Garth is killed and joins the Black Lanterns himself. Mera rejects the corpse before fleeing. In the climax of the miniseries, Aquaman is among those resurrected by The White Lantern Entity, and is reunited with Mera. Because the Black Lantern Ring helps reconstruct Orin's body, when he is resurrected his hand is restored as well.|$|E

40|$|We aim <b>at</b> formalizing <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of distinguishability. Intuitively, distinguishability {{refers to}} the {{transitions}} between different levels of detail with which different agents refer to the same objects. We frame our work within <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of contexts, {{as a way to}} provide agents with local reasoning capabilities and to express their compatibilities. We believe distinguishability {{plays an important role in}} any effort to build or describe interaction between arbitrary agents. We show as well how <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of distinguishability can be used by agents to state in a local way their beliefs about other agents without having to reify their formulae. Finally, after giving a generic formalization and a simple example, we show how distinguishability can be formalized within a certain logic of context. Keywords: contexts, logics of context, distinguishability, granularity. 1 Introduction We firstly aim <b>at</b> formalizing <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of distinguishability.

500|$|Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes each named a Socratic {{dialogue}} after Aspasia (though neither survives {{except in}} fragments). Our major sources for Aeschines Socraticus' Aspasia are Athenaeus, Plutarch, and Cicero. In the dialogue, Socrates recommends that Callias send his son Hipponicus to Aspasia for instructions. When Callias recoils <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> {{of a female}} teacher, Socrates notes that Aspasia had favorably influenced Pericles and, after his death, Lysicles. In {{a section of the}} dialogue, preserved in Latin by Cicero, Aspasia figures as a [...] "female Socrates", counseling first Xenophon's wife and then Xenophon himself (the Xenophon in question is not the famous historian) about acquiring virtue through self-knowledge. Aeschines presents Aspasia as a teacher and inspirer of excellence, connecting these virtues with her status as hetaira. According to Kahn, every single episode in Aeschines' Aspasia is not only fictitious but incredible.|$|E

His ancestry and surname made him the object of xenophobia in his childhood during World WarI, which carried on into {{the early part of}} his military career and beyond; as late as 1941, an anonymous letter writer from RAAF Station Wagga would tell Prime Minister Robert Menzies that his [...] "blood ran cold" [...] <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of someone called [...] "Scherger" [...] commanding trainee Australian pilots. Scherger nevertheless entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1921 and graduated as a lieutenant in 1924, winning the King's Medal. Two days prior to graduation, he volunteered for an Air Force secondment, which was later made permanent. He commenced his flight training as a pilot officer (temporary flying officer) in 1925 at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria.|$|E

500|$|Susan Hill herself did {{not like}} some of the changes that Kneale had made to The Woman in Black. It has been {{observed}} that Kneale on some occasions operated a double-standard with adaptations; being unhappy when others made changes to his stories, but willing to make changes to stories he was adapting into script form. Referring to The Woman in Black adaptation, the writer and critic Kim Newman noted that: [...] "He was very offended <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of Susan Hill using the name of Kipps from HG Wells as the hero of The Woman in Black, and so he decided not to use it and to change the hero's name to Kidd. I'm sure if somebody thought that Quatermass was a silly name and changed it, he'd be furious!" [...] However, Kneale's adaptations were by no means always unpopular with the original author. In 1991, a four-part version he wrote of Kingsley Amis's novel Stanley and the Women, met with approval from the original author, with Amis regarding it as the most successful adaptation of any of his work.|$|E
