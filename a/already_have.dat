5|$|Krause {{wrote that}} UA 8699 {{was the first}} {{marsupial}} to be identified from Madagascar and the first from the Mesozoic of any part of Gondwana. Marsupials {{date back to the}} Eocene in Australia and Africa and to the Paleocene in South America; although Cretaceous marsupials have been recorded there, none of the records are unambiguous. Marsupials were certainly present in the Northern Hemisphere during the late Cretaceous. He interpreted UA 8699 as evidence that marsupials must <b>already</b> <b>have</b> colonized the southern continents by the late Cretaceous, presumably having reached Madagascar through South America and Antarctica. By the late Cretaceous, boreosphenidans must <b>already</b> <b>have</b> been in the process of replacing archaic mammals like gondwanatheres on the southern continents, as suggested by the presence of Deccanolestes, a placental, in the Cretaceous of India.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} {{is most likely}} extinct, and may <b>already</b> <b>have</b> been close to {{extinction}} by the time Europeans arrived in its native area. The species may have disappeared due to being over-hunted and being preyed upon by introduced animals. Hume suggested that the bird may have survived until the 1820s.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the rocks}} beneath the city {{contained}} a vast reservoir of fresh water, {{known as the}} Trarza Lake, it is running out, owing to the large growth of the city. Engineers have warned it could run out by 2054, since it is not rain-fed, and is therefore non-renewable. The problem is particularly bad in the sandy shanty towns {{where the majority of}} the population lives.

5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some <b>already</b> <b>have</b> endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E

Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dodo may <b>already</b> <b>have</b> been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climactic changes shows the bird was resilient within its ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Planarians, a {{subgroup}} of seriates, {{are famous for}} their ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that, in fragments that do not <b>already</b> <b>have</b> a head, a new head grows most quickly on those closest to the original head. This suggests the growth of a head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes from head to tail. Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding.|$|E

A monastery built by St. Aldhelm in 685 is the earliest evidence of Saxon occupation of Frome. The Saxon kings appear to have used Frome as a base from which to hunt in Selwood Forest and in 934 a witenagemot was held there, indicating that Frome must <b>already</b> <b>have</b> been a significant settlement.
