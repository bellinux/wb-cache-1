5|$|John Jackson, Patrick Martin and Harriet Hughes, {{all members}} of the Countryside Alliance, sought {{judicial}} review of the use of the Parliament Acts to pass the Hunting <b>Act.</b> They claimed that the 1949 <b>Act</b> had not been lawfully passed either because the 1911 <b>Act</b> could not be used to amend itself or because it provided a method of making delegated or subordinate legislation which could not alter the process of legislating. Consequently, they claimed, the 1949 <b>Act</b> had not reduced the delay specified in the 1911 <b>Act</b> and the Hunting <b>Act,</b> which was passed only in accordance with the requirements as amended by the 1949 <b>Act,</b> was invalid.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{passed through}} the Parliament <b>Act,</b> {{without the consent of}} the Lords, is still {{considered}} primary legislation. The importance of this was highlighted in Jackson v Attorney General, in which the lawfulness of the Parliament <b>Act</b> 1949 was questioned. The challenge asserted that the 1949 Parliament <b>Act</b> was delegated rather than primary legislation, and that the 1911 Parliament <b>Act</b> had delegated power to the Commons. If this were the case, then the House of Commons could not empower itself through the 1949 Parliament <b>Act</b> without direct permission from the House of Lords. Since it was passed under the 1911 <b>Act,</b> the 1949 <b>Act</b> had never received the required consent of the Lords. However, the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords found that the 1949 <b>Act</b> had been lawfully enacted. The 1911 <b>Act,</b> it concluded, was not primarily about empowering the Commons, but rather had the purpose of restricting the ability of the Lords to reject legislation. This ruling also appears to mean that efforts to abolish the House of Lords (a major constitutional change) by using the <b>Act</b> could be successful, although the issue was not directly addressed in the ruling.|$|E
