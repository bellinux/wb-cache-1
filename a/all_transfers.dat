In addition to suspending USAEC contracts of uranium supply, U.S. officials also pressed the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) Supply Agency to cease <b>all</b> <b>transfers</b> of special nuclear material to Brazil. Likewise, the U.S. pushed West Germany to remove ultracentrifugation technology from its agreement with Brazil and tried to craft a complementary safeguards agreement with the IAEA.|$|E

The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered by U.S. Navy divers 1 week after the accident; they were immediately shipped to the NTSB laboratory in Washington, D.C., for readout.

25|$|The Bx6, a {{critical}} Bronx crosstown corridor, was split off into 2 different routes {{from the original}} Bx6 local on September 3, 2017. The Bx6 local continues to make all local stops along the route. The Bx6 SBS will operate a similar route as the local, but the eastbound service will match the westbound service instead of exiting the Macombs Dam Bridge to Jerome Avenue. The Bx6 SBS supplements the existing Bx6 local service, making stops at select high-ridership locations and <b>all</b> <b>transfers</b> points to Metro-North and subways. The Bx6 SBS is based out of the West Farms Bus Depot, as is the Bx6 local. It is also the third Bronx Bus line to have Select Bus Service {{and the first one}} since the Bx41 on June 30, 2013. The Bx6 is also the MTA's 15th Select Bus Service line to date.|$|E

Nine states require universal background checks {{at the point}} of sale for <b>all</b> <b>transfers,</b> including purchases from unlicensed sellers. Maryland and Pennsylvania laws in this regard are limited to handguns. [...] Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey require any firearm purchaser to obtain a permit. (Illinois formerly required the permit to be verified with the state police only at gun shows, but in 2013 the law was changed to require verification for all private sales.) Four more states (Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, and North Carolina) do the same, but only for handguns. A majority of these jurisdictions require unlicensed sellers to keep records of firearm sales. In November 2016, Nevada voters approved referendum Question 1, changing the law to require background checks for private sales. The following table summarizes these state laws.|$|E

2500|$|The {{transfer}} mezzanine, {{also known}} as the IND mezzanine, has effectively replaced the former network of passageways and ramps—which loosely connected the various lines with each other—as well as made redundant several adjacent entrances. In January 2010, reconstruction of the transfer mezzanine over the Fulton Street IND platform resulted in traffic flow changes. The transfer passageway leading to the Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line station had previously been modified. Effectively, <b>all</b> <b>transfers</b> were made through the [...] platform; construction sites on the platform, combined with the loss of transfer passageways, substantially congested the platform during the construction of the new mezzanine.|$|E

In 1994, the Constitution was amended to allow statutory boards and Government companies to transfer their reserves to the Government, provided that the Minister for Finance gave a written [...] that these sums would be added to past reserves. This effectively excluded such transfers from the President's scrutiny {{while at the same time}} adding another safeguard in the form of the Minister's undertaking.|$|E

Using a deep result from mathematics, it is shown that there exists no uniformly bounded basis for stable linear systems, in general.

2500|$|The 6600 was {{the first}} {{commercial}} supercomputer, outperforming everything then available by a wide margin. While expensive, for those that needed the absolutely fastest computer available {{there was nothing else}} on the market that could compete. [...] When other companies (namely IBM) attempted to create machines with similar performance, they stumbled (Stretch/IBM 7030). Indeed, the 6600 solved a critical design problem — [...] "imprecise interrupts" [...] — that was largely responsible for IBM's failure. He did this by replacing I/O interrupts with a polled request issued by one of 10 so-called peripheral processors, which were built-in mini-computers that did <b>all</b> <b>transfers</b> {{in and out of the}} 6600's central memory.

2500|$|... all subway trips (Green Line, Blue Line, Orange Line, Red Line, Ashmont-Mattapan Line, and the Waterfront {{section of}} the Silver Line) cost $2.25 for CharlieCard holders and $2.75 for CharlieTicket or cash payers. Local bus and {{trackless}} trolley fares (including the Washington Street {{section of the}} Silver Line) are $1.70 for CharlieCard holders and $2.00 for others. <b>All</b> <b>transfers</b> between subway lines are free with all fare media. Passengers using CharlieCards can transfer free from a subway to a bus, and from a bus to a subway for the difference in price ("step-up fare"). CharlieTicket holders can transfer free between buses, but not between subway and bus, except between rapid transit and the Washington Street section of the Silver Line. Paying directly with cash is only available on buses, Green Line surface stops, and the Ashmont-Mattapan Line; a higher price is charged because it slows the process of boarding.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Memorandum's {{signing the}} U.S. has {{transferred}} 3,082 detainees to Afghan control according to Afghan Army General Ghulam Farouk. He said on September 10, 2012 that the U.S. {{was in the}} process of transferring the remaining 30 inmates picked up before the memorandum was signed plus another 600 captured after the signing. But a few weeks ago, the U.S. stopped <b>all</b> <b>transfers.</b> A coalition official told CNN the United States is holding on to several Afghan detainees because of concerns about whether Afghan authorities will properly handle their cases and under what circumstances they might be released. The U.S. also is keeping several prisoners of other nationalities who were not part of the agreement the source said. [...] "Some 99 percent of the detainees captured before 9 March have already been transferred to Afghan authority, but we have paused the transfer of the remaining detainees until our concerns are met," [...] said Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman for the U.S.-led military coalition. Graybeal would not describe the concerns, but a report released in early September 2012 by the New York-based Open Society Foundations said the rift was over whether the Afghans will have a so-called [...] "internment" [...] system that allows some detainees to be held without charge or trial. The U.S. has been holding detainees in internment at Bagram for years. Although the Afghan government agreed to embrace an internment system by signing the accord in March, some top Afghan officials and legal experts contend it violates the Afghan constitution, the report said. Moreover, Karzai himself is opposed to administrative detention (Detaines are held without access to lawyers, public trials or other legal rights), according to the report. The U.S. is now worried that the Afghan government will discontinue internment and either release dangerous detainees or forward their cases to the loosely run Afghan judicial system, which is tainted by corruption and secrecy, the group said. [...] "There are concerns on the U.S. side about division in the Afghan government over internment and that it is not constitutional," [...] said Rachel Reid, a senior policy adviser on Afghanistan for the Open Society Foundations. [...] "The basic concern is that if they don't have internment, they will be released." [...] On the flip side of the legal issue, some Afghan legal experts are worried about Afghan officials abusing any authority to hold detainees without trial. [...] "Consider the fact that even our regular laws are ignored by powerful people," [...] said Abdul Qawi Afzali of the Legal Aid Organization Afghanistan. [...] "What will happen when you give them the actual, legal power to detain people like this law does?" ...|$|E
