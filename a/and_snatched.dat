25|$|Warne had an undistinguished Test debut {{when called}} into the Australian team in January 1992 for a Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He took 1/150 (Ravi Shastri caught by Dean Jones for 206) off 45 overs. He took 0/78 in the fourth Test in Adelaide, {{recording}} overall figures of 1/228 for the series, and was dropped for the fifth Test on the pace-friendly WACA Ground in Perth. His poor form continued in the first innings against Sri Lanka at Colombo, in which he recorded 0/107. However, on 22 August 1992, he took the last three Sri Lankan wickets without conceding a run in the second innings precipitating a second innings collapse and contributing to a remarkable 16-run Australian win. Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga commented in an interview that, 'a bowler with Test average of more than 300 came <b>and</b> <b>snatched</b> the victory from our hands'.|$|E

With the victory, Temple clinched the Philadelphia Big Five title with a perfect 4–0 record. Allen became the 46th Temple player to score 1,000 points in his career {{in a game against}} George Washington. This earned him Atlantic 10 (co-)player of the week honors for the week of March 7.|$|E

500|$|John Roebling was a {{contrasting}} {{character to}} Charles Ellet. [...] Whereas Ellet embellished his proposals with fanciful words and deeds, Roebling presented papers filled with meticulous calculations and drawings. [...] The elder engineer was stern and driven to achieve, taking a scientific approach to all interests. [...] Rarely did he show emotions in his dealings, even to his closest associates. [...] The man, however, dared to confront his detractors and make bold exaltations about his work. [...] He openly called European suspension bridges—including American suspension bridges built with European techniques—weak, and occasionally sniped at Ellet's and Stephenson's works. [...] He announced that his Brooklyn Bridge, when completed, [...] "will {{not only be}} the greatest bridge in existence, {{but it will be}} the greatest engineering work of this continent, and of the age." [...] Roebling's history with Ellet started before the bidding for the Niagara Suspension Bridge, early in their careers. [...] During the bidding for the Schuylkill Suspension Bridge project, Ellet had written a proposal that was published in the American Railroad Journal. [...] Mistakenly believing Ellet had won the contract, Roebling wrote to offer his congratulations and requested to be Ellet's assistant. [...] He received a formal reply without any reference to his request, and his subsequent letter was ignored. [...] When Roebling learned that a contractor had won the bid, he successfully applied to be the contractor's chief engineer. [...] Ellet, however, persisted with his tactics <b>and</b> <b>snatched</b> the project away from the contractor; he promoted himself to the bridge company and offered to accept land instead of cash as payment. [...] From then on, Ellet and Roebling became rivals, vying with each other for suspension bridge projects in North America. [...] Roebling learned from their rivalry. [...] His losses to Ellet showed him that he needed to promote himself and gain backers to effectively secure the contracts he desired.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, {{having given}} advance warning of his intentions, Paisley {{interrupted}} a speech being delivered by Pope John Paul II in the European Parliament. Paisley shouted [...] "I denounce {{you as the}} Antichrist!" [...] and held up a poster reading [...] "Pope John Paul II ANTICHRIST". Other MEPs jeered Paisley, threw papers at him <b>and</b> <b>snatched</b> his poster, but he produced another and continued shouting. He was admonished by Parliamentary President Lord Plumb, who formally excluded him. He was then forcibly removed from the chamber. Paisley claims he was injured by other MEPs—including Otto von Habsburg—who struck him and threw objects at him. Paisley believed the European Union {{is a part of}} a conspiracy to create a Roman Catholic superstate controlled by the Vatican. He claimed in an article that the seat no. 666 in the European Parliament is reserved for the Antichrist.|$|E
2500|$|On June 25, 2009, American {{recording}} artist, Michael Jackson, {{died from}} cardiac arrest {{at the age}} of 50, later revealed to be from a drug intoxication of the anesthetic drug Propofol (also known as [...] "Diprivan"). Jackson was friends with musicians Chris Brown, Diddy, Boyz II Men and The Game. Aside from being friends with some of the musicians involved on the song, others involved had also respected and admired Jackson. According to The Game, prior to Jackson's death Jackson, Diddy and Eminem had tried to end the feuding and tension between rapper 50 Cent and The Game in 2005. The Game stated that in 2005, Jackson called him and offered to help end the feud, remembering [...] "I was on tour in Canada, sitting in my room, cutting my hair [...] I was messing my hair up.

2500|$|Snap-dragon (also {{known as}} Flap-dragon, Snapdragon, or Flapdragon) was a parlour game popular from about the 16th century. It was played during the winter, {{particularly}} on Christmas Eve. Brandy was heated {{and placed in}} a wide shallow bowl; raisins were placed in the brandy which was then set alight. Typically, lights were extinguished or dimmed to increase the eerie effect of the blue flames playing across the liquor. The aim of the game was to pluck the raisins out of the burning brandy and eat them, at the risk of being burnt. Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language (1755) describes it as [...] "a play in which they catch raisins out of burning brandy and, extinguishing them by closing the mouth, eat them". According to an eighteenth-century article in Richard Steele's Tatler magazine, [...] "the wantonness of the thing was to see each other look like a demon, as we burnt ourselves, <b>and</b> <b>snatched</b> out the fruit." [...] Snap-dragon was played in England, Canada, and the United States, but there is insufficient evidence of the practice in Scotland, or other countries.|$|E
2500|$|On [...] "Ladies Days", Berlin champion, WTA No. 14 Dinara Safina {{advanced}} {{to her first}} ever Grand Slam final, dominating World No. 4 and 2006 French Open runner-up Svetlana Kuznetsova during nearly an-hour-and-a-half, to eventually claim victory on the score of 6–3, 6–2. Kuznetsova's loss, following Sharapova's fourth round exit, meant that the second semifinal between Australian Open finalist and Indian Wells Tier I titlist Ana Ivanovic and Rome winner Jelena Janković was bound to decide {{who would be the}} next World No. 1. Janković took the first advantage in the match, leading 4–2 when Ivanovic made a comeback <b>and</b> <b>snatched</b> the first set, extending her dominance to the midst of the second, when she saw her adversary win seven games in a row, even the score to one-set-all, and take the early advantage in the final set. Ivanovic broke back once to 3–3 but lost her serve, before breaking again to even the score at 4–4, win her serve, and take Janković's to finally win, after over two hours of play, on the score of 6–4, 3–6, 6–4, advance to her third Grand Slam final, her second consecutive in Roland-Garros, and be assured to become the new World No. 1 on June 9, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Nina Wadia has praised Womack and Wallace {{for their}} [...] "acting skills" [...] during the storyline. Wadia told The Sun: [...] "Sam and Jessie were amazing {{and it all}} got taken away from them because people made it out like a real baby had died. It's a soap. It's portraying fictional characters!" [...] Marc Elliott added: [...] "The storyline got whipped up into a massive frenzy. It's not {{representative}} in any way, shape or form of mothers {{who have lost their}} babies." [...] EastEnders actress Patsy Palmer has also praised the plot for its [...] "great acting". In an interview with Take It Easy, asked whether the show's bosses handled the storyline well, Palmer replied: [...] "I think they did. I know there's been loads of bad press, but something like that {{is always going to be}} sad to watch and it will upset people. But at the end of the day, it's a drama and it's not real. I think it got blown out of all proportion. Unfortunately, things like that do happen in real life. Babies get swapped <b>and</b> <b>snatched</b> in hospitals. I'm sure that any parent who has lost a child will find even talking about their experience very difficult, let alone watching it being acted out on television. Even my daughter got upset but she is only 9 so maybe I shouldn't have let her watch it. I just didn't realise it was going to be so heart-wrenching, which was down to the great acting." ...|$|E
