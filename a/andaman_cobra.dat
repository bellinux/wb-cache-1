Plaques formed by extracellular deposits of amyloid β (Aβ) are the prime player of AD’s neuropathology. Studies have implicated the varied role of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) in brain where it contributes to neuronal growth and inflammatory response. Overall contour and chemical nature of the substrate-binding channel in the low molecular weight PLA 2 s are similar. This study involves the reductionist fragment-based approach to understand the structure adopted by N-terminal fragment of Alzheimer’s Aβ peptide in its complex with PLA 2. In the current communication, we report the structure determined by X-ray crystallography of N-terminal sequence Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Arg-His-Asp-Ser (DAEFRHDS) of Aβ-peptide with a Group I PLA 2 purified from venom of <b>Andaman</b> <b>Cobra</b> sub-species Naja naja sagittifera at 2. 0 Å resolution (Protein Data Bank (PDB) Code: 3 JQ 5).

This is probably the first attempt to structurally establish interaction between amyloid-β peptide fragment and hydrophobic substrate binding site of PLA 2 involving H bond and van der Waals interactions. We speculate that higher affinity between Aβ and PLA 2 has the therapeutic potential of decreasing the Aβ–Aβ interaction, thereby reducing the amyloid aggregation and plaque formation in AD...|$|E
