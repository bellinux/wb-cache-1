Although the backpressure framework is conceptually viewed as layered, {{the decisions of}} routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> are made jointly, which imposes several challenges in practice. In this work, we present Diff-Max, an approach that separates routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> has three strengths: (i) Diff-Max improves throughput significantly, (ii) the separation of routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> makes practical implementation easier by minimizing cross-layer operations; i. e., routing is implemented in the network layer <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> is implemented in the link layer, and (iii) the separation of routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> leads to modularity; i. e., routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> are independent modules in Diff-Max and one can continue to operate even if the other does not. Our approach is grounded in a network utility maximization (NUM) formulation {{of the problem and}} its solution. Based on the structure of Diff-Max, we propose two practical schemes: Diff-subMax and wDiff-subMax.

40|$|Abstract. 1 The {{conventional}} wisdom and practice is that planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> tasks are solved separately using different methods and approaches. However, recent development in industrial planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> demands for mixing both tasks to allow modelling of wider class of problems. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present a framework for mixing planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> tasks within single system. We analyse traditional views of planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> we highlight the drawbacks of separating both tasks when applied to modelling complex process environments. We give some real-life examples where the mixed approach helps to model the problems and we propose a generic framework for such mixture. We also argue for using constraint programming as underlying solving technology and, finally, we describe some constraint models based on the proposed framework. Although, we concentrate on planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> in complex process environments we believe that the results contribute to both planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> communities in general. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> attracts an unceasing {{attention}} of computer science community. However, despite of similar character of both tasks, in most current systems planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems are solved independently using different methods. Recent development of Constraint Programming brings a new breeze to these areas. It allows {{using the same}} techniques for modelling planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems as well as exploiting successful methods developed in Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research. In the paper we analyse the problems behind planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> in complex process environments and we propose to enhance the traditional schedulers by planning capabilities to solve these problems. We argue for using dynamic models to capture such mixed planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> environment. Despite of studying the proposed framework using the complex process environment background {{we believe that the}} results are applicable in general to other (nonproduction) problem areas where mixed planning <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> capabilities are desirable. ...|$|R

These algorithms exploit the two-faceted decision structure inherent to this problem class: First, assigning demands to vehicles and, second, routing each vehicle through its assigned demand stops. We describe {{the application of}} cyclic transfers to vehicle routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems. Then we determine the worst-case performance of these algorithms for several classes of vehicle routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems. Next, we develop computationally efficient methods for finding negative cost cyclic transfers. Finally, we present computational results for three diverse vehicle routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems, which collectively incorporate a variety of constraint and objective function structures. Our results show that cyclic transfer methods are either comparable to or better than the best published heuristic algorithms for several complex and important vehicle routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems. Most importantly, they represent a novel approach to solution improvement which holds promise in many vehicle routing <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem domains...|$|R
