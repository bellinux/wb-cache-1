5|$|St. Seiriol {{established}} a cell {{and a community}} on Puffin Island (in Welsh, Ynys Seiriol or Seiriol's Island) half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coast {{at the same time}} as he founded the monastery. There is a tower of a 12th-century church on Puffin Island still. There is a tradition that St. Seiriol and perhaps Maelgwn Gwynedd (king of Gwynedd in the first half of the 6th century) were buried there. The island once had large numbers of puffins and guillemots. However, rats reduced the bird population to 40 in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The coastal {{resort and}} port town of Ramsgate was {{historically}} {{served by a}} complex network of unconnected railway lines, the legacy of competition between two rival companies to provide links to London and to neighbouring Margate. The town's first railway station, Ramsgate Town, was opened by the South Eastern Railway on 13April 1846, on {{what was then the}} outskirts of the town, about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> seafront. Lines from the station ran north, before splitting west to Canterbury and on to London, and north to Margate.|$|E
5|$|The seafront {{stretches}} {{for approximately}} half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pier to Salthouse Field, and includes ornamental gardens, a Victorian bandstand, a bowling green, tennis courts, crazy golf and other amusements. An {{addition to this}} list is Marine Lake, which was once a Victorian swimming pool, is now used for boating activities, {{as well as a}} small festival once a year where people can try out new sports. The Salthouse Field has a light railway running round the perimeter and is still used for donkey rides during the summer.|$|E

5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie {{closer to the}} water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to higher elevations. Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly 150 miles up the Columbia River. In 2004 a healthy sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles upstream from the San Francisco Bay and half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> San Joaquin River.|$|E
5|$|Force B {{commenced}} its attack {{after the}} Tallboy Lancasters had completed theirs {{so that the}} shock waves from bomb explosions did not prematurely set off the JW mines. As none of the Force B aircrew were able to spot Tirpitz due to the smokescreen, they dropped the mines on the battleship's estimated position. These weapons did not cause any damage. The smokescreen over Kaafjord prevented the Allied aircrew {{from being able to}} assess the results of their bombing, though several large spouts of water and explosions were observed. Tait was also pleased to see a column of black smoke rising through the smokescreen. However, some of the bombs and mines landed up to <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battleship. Tirpitzs anti-aircraft guns and a further 98 guns located in nearby shore batteries and warships fired on the bombers throughout the attack. However, only four Lancasters suffered any damage.|$|E

5|$|In August 1942 No. 3 Commando was {{involved}} in the ill-fated Operation Jubilee, an exploratory raid on Dieppe in France. The plan called for a frontal assault on the port by the Canadian 2nd Division. Before this would take place, however, Troops from No. 3 and 4 Commandos would land at beaches on the eastern and western flanks and neutralise two German artillery batteries that were covering the main anchorage. No. 3 Commando was assigned the task of attacking the Goebbels Battery, landing on the eastern flank, under Durnford-Slater's command. The battery was located near Berneval-le-Grand, about half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea with steep cliffs in front of it. It was decided that No. 3 Commando would land on two beaches to the east and west of the battery, from which gullies rose towards the battery and which would provide concealment while the Commandos approached the battery.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Jack Thorpe filed {{a federal}} {{lawsuit against the}} borough of Jim Thorpe, seeking to have his father's remains {{returned}} to his homeland and re-interred near other family members in Oklahoma. Citing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Jack was arguing to bring his father's remains to the reservation in Oklahoma, {{where they would be}} buried near those of his father, sisters and brother, <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> place he was born. He claimed that the agreement between his stepmother and Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, borough officials was made against the wishes of other family members who want him buried in Native American land. Jack Thorpe died at 73 on February 22, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Other mammals {{found in}} Greater London are hedgehogs, rats, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and squirrels, In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, {{a wide variety}} of mammals are found {{including}} hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to fox, squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, nathusius and common pipistrelles, noctule, serotine, barbastelle, daubenton's, brown Long-eared, natterer's and leisler's.|$|E

5|$|Planning began for {{the third}} U.S. orbital mission in February 1962, aiming for a six-or-seven-orbit flight {{to build on the}} {{previous}} three-orbit missions. NASA officially announced the mission on June 27, and the flight plan was finalized in late July. The mission focused on engineering tests rather than on scientific experimentation. The mission finally launched on the morning of October 3, having been delayed two weeks because of problems with the Atlas booster. A series of minor booster problems during launch and a faulty temperature controller in Schirra's pressure suit were the only technical problems noted during the flight. The spacecraft orbited in both automated and passive flight modes for prolonged periods while the pilot monitored it and carried out some minor scientific experiments. After six orbits, the capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> recovery carrier, and was hoisted aboard for Schirra to disembark.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that it took {{about half an hour}} for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau County police officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Corder {{left the}} house, Maria {{set out to}} meet him at the Red Barn which was {{situated}} on Barnfield Hill, about half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Martens' cottage. This was the last time that she was seen alive. Corder also disappeared, but later turned up and claimed that Marten was in Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, or some other place nearby, and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking the anger of his friends and relatives. The pressure on Corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave the area. He wrote letters to Marten's family claiming that they were married and living on the Isle of Wight, and he gave various excuses for her lack of communication: she was unwell, she had hurt her hand, or the letter must have been lost.|$|E

5|$|The Portway {{was planned}} by the Bristol Corporation in {{response}} to the decline of Bristol Harbour in the late 19th century in favour of Avonmouth Docks, which could handle larger vessels and containers. Construction started in May 1919, engineered by L.S.McKenzie. The southern section connected to the existing road network at Hotwells, and a portion of the new road near Clifton lay partly on the line of the Bristol Port Railway. The new build did not directly connect to Avonmouth Docks, but linked to the existing road via Shirehampton about half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dock gates. The original plan was to build a tramway {{along the length of the}} road, which would have linked Avonmouth to the Bristol Tramway system, but this was abandoned owing to cost.|$|E
5|$|With {{his main}} and mizzen masts {{collapsed}} and escape impossible, Leissègues turned his ship towards the shore at 11:30, outdistancing the {{fire from the}} drifting Northumberland and leaving Superb behind, Duckworth reluctant to risk his ship in the shallow coastal shoals. Canopus maintained the pressure, pursuing the French flagship until it was clear at 11:40 that Impérial was hard aground on a coral reef, less than <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beach. Diomède, under attack by Atlas and the recently returned Spencer, followed Impérial ashore. As they struck the reef, both French ships lost their remaining masts and suffered severe damage to their hulls. Their crews then gathered on deck and made preparations to abandon ship as the British squadron pulled back {{out of range of}} fire from the shore. During the engagement the French frigates and corvette had all slipped between the battling squadrons and the shoreline and escaped to the westwards. The British frigates were too preoccupied with boarding and towing prizes to initiate a chase.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock {{then went}} to Doncaster, where on 23 September, he started 1/2 {{favourite}} and beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Stakes over four miles. The same day he also walked over for a sweepstakes of 50 guineas each over the St. Leger course. Twenty-four hours later he beat Rasping to win a sweepstakes of 25 guineas each over four miles., {{and then went on}} to beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Club Stakes. This was his fourth race in the space of two days. At Richmond in October he won his second Dundas Stakes, this time beating King Corney. Later in the day Blacklock finished last of four runners behind winner Doctor Syntax in the Richmond Cup over four miles. Doctor Syntax had started in the lead, but was overtaken by Blacklock after only 200 yards. Blacklock held the lead until about half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> finish, when Doctor Syntax joined him again. Blacklock then swerved out of line, allowing Doctor Syntax to win easily. By the time The Richmond Cup was run Blacklock was apparently unwell and was coughing repeatedly during the race.|$|E

5|$|Dunster Beach, which {{includes}} {{the mouth of the}} River Avill, is located half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> village, and used to have a significant harbour, known as Dunster Haven, which was used for the export of wool from Saxon times; however, it was last used in the 17th century and has now disappeared, as new land was laid down among the dykes, meadows and marshes near the shore. During the Second World War, considerable defences were built along the coast as a part of British anti-invasion preparations, though the north coast of Somerset was an unlikely invasion site. Some of the structures remain to this day. Most notable are the pillboxes on the foreshore of Dunster Beach. These are strong buildings made from pebbles taken from the beach and bonded together with concrete. From these, soldiers could have held their ground if the Germans had ever invaded. The beach site has a number of privately owned beach huts (or chalets as some owners call them) along with a small shop, a tennis court and a putting green. The chalets, measuring , can be let out for holidays; some owners live in them all the year round.|$|E
5|$|Half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{start of}} the bypass and a short {{distance}} before the arterial makes a turn eastward to traverse Canandaigua Lake to the southeast, US20 and NY5 meet NY21 at a four-way intersection. Like US20 and NY5, NY21 once continued directly into downtown, in this instance via Bristol Street {{to the east of}} the junction, but now follows US20 and NY5 along the east–west leg of the bypass. Past Bristol Street, the bypass widens from two to four lanes and, after meeting two local streets, enters the city of Canandaigua as the limited-access Western Boulevard, albeit with no exits. The route loses this distinction prior to intersecting South Main Street, where US20, NY5 and NY21 meet the southern terminus of NY332. NY21 departs the bypass, following NY332 into downtown, while US20 and NY5 continue onto the four-laned, median separated Eastern Boulevard, the original section of the US20 and NY5 bypass of Canandaigua. The roadway acts a center of commerce for the city, sporting restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets along its length within the city limits.|$|E
5|$|In the 5th century, {{after the}} {{withdrawal}} of the Roman legions, Saint Illtud came to the Hodnant valley from Brittany and founded the monastery of Illtud on the Ogney Brook, and a college, close to the current St Illtyd's Church, about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea. The exact date of its founding is unknown, but some sources indicate around the year 500; the blue plaque on the church today also gives this date. Because of its monastery and teaching centre it became a major centre for education and Celtic Church evangelism, attracting scholars from across Wales, Devon, Cornwall and Brittany and the wider world. The college of Llantwit, known as the College or Seminary of Theodosius (Cor Tewdws in Welsh) or College of St. Illtyd, at its peak reputedly had seven halls, over 400 houses and over 2000 students, including seven sons of British princes, and scholars such as St. Patrick, St. Paul Aurelian, the bard Taliesin, Gildas the historian, Samson of Dol, Paulinus, Bishop of Leon; St. David is believed to have spent some time there. Samson was known to have been summoned by Dyfrig to join the monastery in 521 and he was briefly elected abbot before leaving for Cornwall. King Hywel ap Rhys (d. 886) was buried at the monastery.|$|E
