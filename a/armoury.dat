Fort Nelson, a 19th-century fort and museum near Portsmouth specialising in artillery was taken over by the Royal <b>Armouries</b> in 1995.

5|$|Under the <b>Armoury</b> System, a character's {{equipped}} weapon {{determines the}} character class and players may change their class at will by changing weapons. Classes {{are divided into}} four disciplines: Disciples of War, masters of physical combat; Disciples of Magic, practitioners of the magical arts; Disciples of the Hand, crafters and handymen who synthesize and repair items; and Disciples of the Land, gatherers who collect resources from the environment. Certain abilities learned under one class may be equipped and used by other classes. The Job System builds upon the <b>Armoury</b> System for Disciples of War and Magic. In exchange for restricting the range of equippable abilities from other classes, players gain access to powerful skills, magic, weapons, and armor exclusive to the job corresponding to that class. These jobs, based on classic Final Fantasy character jobs, are more suited to party-based combat.|$|E

5|$|Historian Michael Crawford {{attributes}} {{the disappearance of}} much of Tiberius Gracchus' support to the reduced level of citizen participation due to dispersal far from Rome, and sees his tribunate as marking {{a step in the}} Hellenization of Roman aristocracy. Crawford asserts that Gaius Gracchus' extortion law shifted {{the balance of power in}} Rome and that the Gracchi made available a new political <b>armoury</b> which the oligarchy subsequently sought to exploit.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the year, {{over the}} night of 26/27December, several attacks were carried out by the Irgun on police stations, Palestine Railways {{installations}} and one British Army <b>armoury.</b> The 3rd Parachute Brigade again enforced a night time curfew on Tel Aviv.

5|$|The Office of Ordnance and <b>Armoury</b> Office {{were founded}} in the 15thcentury, taking over the Privy Wardrobe's duties of looking after the monarch's arsenal and valuables. As there was no {{standing}} army before 1661, {{the importance of the}} royal <b>armoury</b> at the Tower of London was that it provided a professional basis for procuring supplies and equipment in times of war. The two bodies were resident at the Tower from at least 1454, and by the 16thcentury they had moved to a position in the inner ward. The Board of Ordnance (successor to these Offices) had its headquarters in the White Tower and used surrounding buildings for storage. In 1855 the Board was abolished; its successor (the Military Store Department of the War Office) was also based there until 1869, after which its headquarters staff were relocated to the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich (where the recently closed Woolwich Dockyard was converted into a vast ordnance store).|$|E
5|$|The mutineers {{broke into}} the base's <b>armoury</b> {{on the morning of}} 20 February and pillaged the white quarter of the town. The town's {{inhabitants}} fled, and a Belgian officer and two white civilians were killed. The mutineers attacked visible signs of the colonial authorities and proclaimed their desire for independence. The mutineers then dispersed to their home villages, pillaging on the way; they failed to spread the insurrection to neighbouring garrisons. Two mutineers, including Mukalabushi, were executed for their part in the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|The {{south side}} visitor entrance, which now houses a shop and visitor facilities, was {{previously}} the airfield's <b>armoury.</b> The various buildings are arranged roughly {{parallel to the}} A505; AirSpace is furthest east, with Hangars 2, 3, 4 and 5 running westwards, followed by the American Air Museum and the Land Warfare Hall. The museum site is approximately 1800m {{from one end to}} the other, and a visitor bus operates during opening hours.|$|E
50|$|Charles I {{hoped that}} quick {{victories}} would negate Parliament's advantage in materiel {{and as the}} <b>armouries</b> in London were beyond his reach he hoped to take the large arsenal at Hull to supplement the <b>armouries</b> he did have access to, {{such as those of}} the Derbyshire and Staffordshire trained bands.|$|R

5|$|Alexander Stuart, an Army {{captain who}} served as the last {{governor}} of the castle, stripped down what remained of the fortification in the mid-1700s. Some of the stone was reused to build the Bowling Green House – later renamed the Castle Inn – on {{the north end of the}} tennis courts, while the north side of the outer bailey was used to make the bowling green itself. Stuart lived in a house in Ludlow itself, but decorated the Great Hall with the remains of the castle <b>armoury,</b> and may have charged visitors for admittance.|$|E
5|$|For the Canadian Corps, {{participation}} in the Battle of Mount Sorrel is commemorated with the Hill 62 (Sanctuary Wood) Memorial. The nearby Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62 contains a preserved/simulated section of front line trenches occupied by the British and Canadians between 1916 and 1917. Allied soldiers killed during the battle are buried in the nearby Sanctuary Wood Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, Hooge Crater Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, Maple Copse Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery and Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery. Those killed during the battle with no known resting place are commemorated on the Menin Gate in Ypres, Belgium. The Royal Regiment of Canada conducts a Sorrel Day parade, open to the public, at the Fort York <b>Armoury</b> every year on the second Sunday in June.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1944, Mickl was {{promoted}} to Generalleutnant. He identified that the Partisan 13th Division was using the Drežnica valley as a huge <b>armoury,</b> hiding captured Italian arms and ammunition in villages, basements, and even in fake graves in cemeteries. This was of major concern if the feared Allied landing eventuated. In mid-April, Mickl ordered Operation Keulenschlag (Mace Blow) to clear the area, using the 846th Infantry Regiment {{and parts of the}} 847th Infantry Regiment, supported by the divisional artillery and flak battalion. Over the next two weeks, the division pushed the Partisan 13th Division north to the area of Mrkopalj and Delnice, and captured sufficient material to equip two divisions, including 30 tons of small arms ammunition and 15 tons of artillery ammunition.|$|E
