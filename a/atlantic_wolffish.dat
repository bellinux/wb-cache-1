50|$|In 2014, HELCOM {{classified}} the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> {{population in}} the Baltic Sea as endangered on the IUCN Red List scale.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{related species}} (Atlantic, {{northern}} and spotted wolffish) {{occur in the}} north <b>Atlantic.</b> The northern <b>wolffish</b> has loose gelatinous flesh, but the other species are esteemed as food, both fresh and preserved. They are marketed in Britain as [...] "Scotch halibut" [...] and [...] "Scarborough woof", or, simply [...] "woof" [...] {{in other areas of}} the northeast coast, and are a popular ingredient in fish and chips. The oil extracted from the liver is said to be equal in quality to the best cod liver oil.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} found {{offshore}} in cold, deep water, usually below [...] and between 50 - 800 m in depth but as shallow as 25 m in Canadian Arctic populations. They prefer a coarse sand and sand/shell hash bottom with rocky areas nearby for shelter and nest-building. Spawning occurs in summer to late fall/early winter. As many as 54,600 large eggs to 6 mm are laid {{in deep water}} in clusters on the sea floor, and are guarded primarily by males. Growth rate is slower for this species than for the <b>Atlantic</b> and northern <b>wolffish</b> (Barents Sea). Fish become mature at seven {{years of age or}} older and can live to 21 years. The species does not form large schools and migrations are local and limited.|$|R
50|$|The spotted {{wolffish}} {{can be distinguished}} from the northern (A. denticulatus) and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> (A. lupus) by its dark spots.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>{{wolffish}}</b> (Anarhichas lupus), {{also known}} as the seawolf, Atlantic catfish, ocean catfish, devil fish, wolf eel (the common name for its Pacific relative), woof or sea cat, is a marine fish of the wolffish family Anarhichadidae. The numbers of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> are rapidly being depleted, most likely due to overfishing and bycatch, and is currently a Species of Concern according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service.|$|E

50|$|According to data {{compiled}} by the National Marine Fisheries Service, since 1983, the landings from U.S. fishing vessels of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> as bycatch has declined 95%, landing 64.7 metric tons (mt) in 2007. In 1950, when the NMFS started collecting their data, 1,098 mt of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> were landed, worth $137,008. In 1970, 271.2 mt; the landings peaked in 1983 at 1,207 mt, bringing in $455,291; rapidly depleting again and by 1990 the landings were down to 400 mt, and by 2002, 154 mt. The last available data from the NMFS were in 2007 at 64.7 mt, worth a total of $100,341.|$|E
50|$|The {{manner of}} which <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> {{fertilize}} their eggs distinguishes them from many fish. Instead {{of the female}} depositing her eggs in the open ocean for the male fish to fertilize and then continue on his way, they are internally fertilized and the male wolffish stays with the nest and protects the eggs {{for as long as}} four months, until the brood is strong enough to gain independence. Their eggs are 5.5-6.0 mm in diameter, (among the largest fish eggs known), yellow tinted and opaque. The eggs are laid on the ocean floor, many times in shoal water, sticking together in loose clumps, surrounded by seaweed and stones. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> mature relatively late, at age six.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> has {{retained}} the bodily form and general external characteristics of small blennies (Blennioidei). The largest specimen recorded measured 1.5 m long and weighed almost 40 lb. Its body is long, subcylindrical in front, compressed in the caudal portion, smooth and slippery, the rudimentary scales being embedded and almost {{hidden in the}} skin. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> vary in color, usually seen as purplish-brown, a dull olive green, or blueish gray. An even dorsal fin extends the whole length of the back, and a similar fin from the vent to the caudal fin, as in blennies. The pectorals are large and rounded and the pelvic fins are entirely absent. Its obtuse, eel-like body type makes the fish swim slowly, undulating from side to side, like an eel.|$|E
5000|$|The American pelicanfoot has as {{potential}} predators the gastropod Colus stimpsoni Dall, 1902, the crab Cancer irrotatus Say, 1817 and the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> Anarhichas lupus Linnaeus, 1758 [...] The well-developed outer shell lips {{of the adults}} give them an adequate protection against the claws of Cancer irrotatus.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} wolffish {{can be distinguished}} from the spotted wolffish (A. minor) and the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> (A. lupus) by its more uniform body colour and its soft, jelly-like musculature. Its head is also proportionally larger to its body and its upper lip is thick and covered with papillae.|$|E
5000|$|On October 1, 2008, the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), {{along with}} Dr. Erica Fuller and Dr. Les Watling, petitioned the US NMFS for the {{protection}} of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> under the ESA. The petition called {{for the protection}} of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> and wolffish habitat throughout the US northwest Atlantic waters. It recommended a designation of critical habitat be set up to close off both commercial and recreational fishing in those areas (which would overlap closed areas for various other fishing industries for the benefit of fishermen), the development of catch and release protocols, educational programs for fishermen in the Gulf of Maine area, and possession prohibitions. [...] On January 1, 2009 the NMFS announced a positive 90-day finding that the petition was warranted, which triggered the initiation of a status review which will result in a decision on whether to list the species under the ESA. On November 6, 2009, the NMFS issued a finding that the proposed protections were not warranted.|$|E
50|$|Currently, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> is {{categorized}} as a Species of Concern under the National Marine Fisheries Service. Species of Concern are those species about which the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient {{information is available}} to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA).|$|E
50|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> {{use their}} strong jaws to eat {{hardshell}} molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms. They {{do not eat}} other fish. They are known to frequently eat large whelks (Buccinum), cockles (Polynices, Chrysodomus and Sipho), sea clams (Mactra), large hermit crabs, starfish, sea urchins and green crabs (Carcinus maenas). They are an important predator of sea urchins and green crabs, whose populations escalate rapidly and can negatively affect {{the health of a}} marine system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> are {{primarily}} stationary fish, rarely moving from their rocky homes. They are benthic dwellers, {{living on the}} hard ocean floor, frequently seen in nooks and small caves. They like cold water, at depths of 20 to(-) 500 m. They are usually found in water temperatures of 30 to(-) 52 F. Since they can live in near-freezing waters (salt water only freezes at slightly below 0 C), to keep their blood moving smoothly, they contain a natural antifreeze.|$|E
50|$|According to {{scientific}} data, the Atlantic wolffish's population has decreased drastically due to overfishing and bycatch. Bottom-trawling vessels also disrupt the wolffish's rocky underwater habitat when they drag large nets {{across the ocean}} floor, with heavy weights holding the nets to the ocean bottom. The nets are indiscriminate in what they catch and the heavy weights and nets are harmful to the benthic terrain and its inhabitants. Recreational fishing has also threatened {{the survival of the}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic wolffish's {{distinguishing}} feature, {{from which}} it gets its common name, is its extensive teeth structure. Its dentition distinguishes the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> {{from all the other}} members of the Anarhichadidae family. Both the lower and upper jaws are armed with four to six fang-like, strong, conical teeth. Behind the conical teeth in the upper jaw, there are three rows of crushing teeth. The central row has four pairs of molars and the outer rows house blunted conical teeth. The lower jaw has two rows of molars behind the primary conical teeth. The wolffish's throat is also scattered with serrated teeth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> inhabit {{both the}} west and east coasts of the Atlantic. In the west Atlantic, they are seen {{as far north as}} the Davis Strait, of the Canadian {{territory}} of Nunavut, populating the shores of Greenland and Nova Scotia, extending down as far as Cape Cod. Although they are seldom seen south of Cape Cod, there have been sightings in New Jersey. The most dense populations are in Georges Bank, the Gulf of Maine and the Great South Channel. In the eastern Atlantic, they range from Russia's White Sea and Novaya Zemlya, through the Nordic countries and British Isles, to the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to office and research space, BIO has extensive laboratories, particularly for performing research into aquatic species. Tours of BIO are offered for visitors {{during the summer}} months and a popular tour destination are some of the large aquariums and tanks used for research. There are also [...] "touch tanks" [...] in a facility called the Sea Pavilion where visitors are permitted to handle North Atlantic Lobster, Snow Crabs, Rock Crabs, Clams (also known as Pea Clams), Sea Urchins, Sea Cucumbers, and other species. Some tanks are transparent and allow visitors to view giant mackerel and sturgeon as well as other rare and interesting specimens such as a lobster that is half male and half female. The Sea Pavilion contains information concerning Leatherback Sea Turtles, Atlantic Whitefish, Northern Right Whales, sharks, Lake Whitefish, Largemouth Bass, Brook Trout, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Wolffish,</b> and Atlantic Pickerel. There are also displays featuring protected areas such as Sable Island and The Gully and special interest areas such as Halifax Harbour and the Bay of Fundy.|$|E
30|$|IAPP or amylin (the {{precursor}} to amyloid) was identified at the peripheral {{region of the}} islets for the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish,</b> co-localizing with glucagon. In contrast to these results in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish,</b> IAPP has been localized in endocrine pancreas of mammals, co-localizing with insulin within the β cells and centrally, but not peripherally in the islets of the Atlantic salmon (S. salar) (Westermark et al. 2002). Amyloid was {{not found in the}} pancreatic tissues from the ten <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish.</b>|$|E
30|$|We {{confirmed}} the species-specific {{differences in the}} hormonal tissue distribution in teleost fish and demonstrated a unique distribution of IAPP in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish.</b> The presence of this difference in the population of cells secreting IAPP deserves further investigation. Previous phylogenetic analyses have shown that pancreatic peptides are relatively well conserved among vertebrates. However, the IAPP amino acid sequence differs among teleost fish. Our study shows that the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> is devoid of amyloid in vivo and the segment 19 - 34 is non-amyloidogenic, according to the in silico secondary structure analysis. Amyloidosis of pancreatic islets would not be expected as a spontaneous disease in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish.</b> The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> thus could be a potential candidate to isolate the endocrine tissues for pancreatic xenografts. This study adds new insight in the characterization of fish pancreatic peptides whose physiological functions remain to be elucidated.|$|E

40|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank regions {{inhabit the}} {{southern}} edge of the species distribution. Analyses herein were limited to the stock component completely within United States waters, which excluded some historically important transboundary portions of Georges Bank. There is currently no fishery management plan for the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> in U. S. waters. Wolfish are associated with rough topography. Catchability of wolffish is low in NEFSC trawl surveys due to this habitat preference. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> are long-lived (22 years), late maturing, and of low fecundity. Males guard the eggs in nests in the fall. Larger wolffish are caught in the spring survey compared to the fall, perhaps due to nest guarding behavior. All fishery independent survey indices show a declining trend in abundance over the time series. The commercial catch has also declined steadily since 1983. However there is no size truncation in the catch over the time series. A wolffish growth study from the 1980 s in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank region was done by Nelson and Ross (1992). The DCAC model, AIM model, and simple exploitation ratios were examined for this assessment and presented to the Data Poor Stocks Peer Review Panel.

30|$|The {{biologic}} {{attributes of}} the endocrine pancreas and the comparative endocrinology of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) of fish are not well described in the literature. This study describes the endocrine pancreas of one teleostean fish. Ten captive <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas lupus) from the Montreal Biodome were submitted for necropsy and their pancreata were collected.|$|E
30|$|All {{fish were}} {{obtained}} from the Montreal Biodome that maintained aquariums. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> were approximately 9 to 10  years old and submitted dead on ice at the necropsy services for diagnostic purpose. Necropsy was done approximately 1  h after death, and all were well preserved. Pancreata were collected and fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin, trimmed, and embedded in paraffin.|$|E
30|$|The {{pancreatic}} islets in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> {{appear as}} a few grossly evident nodules embedded in pancreatic parenchyma, designated Brockmann bodies in other teleost species. These are the homologs of the islets of Langerhans as has been previously described in other teleostean fish (Falkmer 1961). According to the Grimelius staining, the pancreatic tissues did not contain neuroendocrine cells, which preclude the islet nodule as the occurrence of a neuroendocrine tumor.|$|E
40|$|During {{the course}} of {{assessing}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> for the Northeast Data Poor Stocks Working Group Meeting, December 8 - 12, 2008, an incorrect conversion factor {{was applied to the}} NEFSC commercial fisheries database resulting in lower than expected commercial landings. Specifically, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> landings data were extracted from the database as pounds and converted into kilograms. The landings data were then imported into a spreadsheet where it was mistakenly multiplied by 0. 45359237, the conversion factor for pounds to kilograms, reducing the overall magnitude of the landings data by approximately 45 %. Table 1 A shows the original and corrected datasets. An example using 1964 shows corrected landings as 114. 32 mt and the originally reported landings as 51. 86 mt, which is 45 % of the corrected amount. Recreational catch and commercial discard data were not affected by this miscalculation. NEFSC survey indices were also unchanged. However, total catch, which is composed primarily of commercial landings and is a key component in many analyses presented in this report, was affected. Analyses that needed to be updated included the Statistical Catch at Length model (SCALE), exploitation ratios, Depletion Corrected Average Catch model (DCAC), and An Index Method model (AIM) ...|$|E
30|$|IAPP {{has been}} {{previously}} isolated and characterized in three species of teleosts: zebrafish (D. rerio), Atlantic salmon (S. salar), and daddy sculpin (M. scorpius) (Westermark et al. 2002; Martinez-Alvarez et al. 2008). The amino acid sequences are different for the daddy sculpin, Atlantic salmon, zebrafish, and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Table  1). Compared to mammals, the teleosts herein do not present the GAILS region (segment 24 - 28), which contributes to the amyloid formation in human and cats. The Atlantic salmon IAPP was shown to be amyloidogenic in vitro (Westermark et al. 2002). Interestingly, the Atlantic salmon Agg parameter was higher than the cat IAPP segment 19 - 34, which {{is known to be}} amyloidogenic in vivo. The in silico analysis performed with the Tango algorithm revealed that the Anarhichas IAPP segment 19 - 34 was not prone to form amyloid fibrils. The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> and the zebrafish have two proline residues in contrast to the other teleost fish which have only one residue. Proline residues are known to protect against fibril formation (Westermark et al. 2011); thus, their presence possibly explains the lowest Agg parameter obtained from the Tango algorithm in the Atlantic wolfish and the zebrafish. However, {{further research is needed to}} evaluate the potential of fish full-length IAPP to form amyloid deposits.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{biologic}} {{attributes of}} the endocrine pancreas and the comparative endocrinology of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) of fish are not well described in the literature. This study describes the endocrine pancreas of one teleostean fish. Ten captive <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas lupus) from the Montreal Biodome were submitted for necropsy and their pancreata were collected. Results: Grossly, all the fish pancreata examined contained 1 - 3 nodules of variable diameter (1 - 8 mm). Microscopically, the nodules were uniform, highly cellular, and composed of polygonal to elongated cells. Immunofluorescence for pancreatic hormones was performed. The nodules were immunoreactive for insulin most prominent centrally, but with IAPP and glucagon only in {{the periphery of the}} nodules. Exocrine pancreas was positive for chromogranin A. Not previously recognized in fish, IAPP immunoreactivity occurred in α, glucagon-containing, cells and did not co-localize with insulin in β cells. The islet tissues were devoid of amyloid deposits. IAPP DNA sequencing was performed to compare the sequence among teleost fish and the potency to form amyloid fibrils. In silico analysis of the amino acid sequences 19 - 34 revealed that it was not amyloidogenic.

40|$|The {{effects of}} water {{temperature}} (5, 8, 11, and 14 °C) on the fractional rate (percent per day) of protein consumption (kr) and on white muscle and whole-body fractional rates of protein synthesis (ks), protein growth (kg), and growth efficiency (PPV, growth/consumption; kg/ks, growth/synthesis) of juvenile <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas lupus) (initial body weight 26 g) were studied. Rates of protein consumption and white muscle and whole-body protein synthesis increased in a linear fashion between 5 and 14 °C. In contrast, {{the relationships between}} temperature and white muscle and whole-body protein growth, protein growth efficiency (PPV) and protein synthesis retention efficiency (kg/ks) were parabolic. The {{results indicated that the}} optimum water temperatures for growth (Topt. G) and growth efficiency (Topt. GE) were 10 – 11 and 9 – 10 °C, respectively. The maximum white muscle and whole-body protein growth rates recorded at Topt. G were 0. 9 and 0. 7 %·day– 1, respectively. At Topt. GE, the maximum white muscle and whole-body PPV values were 28 and 34 %, respectively, and kg/ks values were 92 and 51 %, respectively. The growth performance data for juvenile <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> in comparison with published data for salmonids (rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)) at 9 – 11 °C further highlight its suitability as an alternative species for cold-water aquaculture in northern Europe and Atlantic Canada...|$|E
30|$|Antibodies against somatostatin, {{pancreatic}} polypeptide, or synaptophysin did {{not react}} with nodular islet tissue, {{perhaps because the}} specific epitope does not occur in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish.</b> Further research {{will be necessary to}} evaluate specific antibodies against teleostean proteins or clarify the affinity of current antibodies to each protein in teleostean fish. However, δ cells, which secrete somatostatin, are reported to be located near the β cells (Stefan and Falkmer 1980; Abad et al. 1986; Klein and Van 1978), and pancreatic polypeptide is found in the Brockmann bodies near the pylorus in other teleostean fish (Stefan and Falkmer 1980; Rombout and Taverne-Thiele 1982).|$|E
40|$|From {{collections}} of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> in the Northwest Atlantic (West Greenland to the Scotian Shelf) during 1950 - 67, mean vertebral counts increased gradually from the colder northern to the warmer southern areas (74. 19 off Labrador to 75. 29 {{on the southern}} Scotian Shelf). This is the reverse of the usual pattern in other fishes of the region with pelagic eggs. The pattern for mean dorsal fin-ray counts was similar, but the area coverage and sample sizes were less extensive and the differences were less significant than in the vertebral data. The overall ranges in counts were 72 - 78 for vertebrae and 71 - 77 for dorsal fin-rays. Dorsal fin-ray and vertebral numbers were moderately well correlated in {{a limited number of}} specimens...|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{describe}} the principal islets (Brockmann bodies) of a different teleost species, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas lupus), using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence techniques {{in an attempt to}} better understand the physiological regulation of glucose and the potential usefulness of this teleost fish in endocrinological studies. These endocrine pancreas bodies of fish have occasionally been mistaken for endocrine tumors by pathologists; thus, we also clarify endocrine pancreas structure and function for comparative pathologists. The comparative pancreatic endocrinology of IAPP is poorly described in fish; we therefore focused our study on the isolation of the IAPP gene from the Atlantic wolfish pancreatic tissues. The amino acid sequences of the IAPP were determined, and the in silico analysis was performed to compare the amyloidogenicity of Anarhichas IAPP to other vertebrate species.|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} distribution patterns of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas lupus) from the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank region were examined based on bottom trawl survey data from 1963 to 1989. Age composition, growth and food habits were also evaluated from 1983 to 1989. Catches of wolffish were distributed throughout the region, but highest concentrations occurred along the 100 m depth contour of the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank. Statistical analyses of the depth occurrences revealed a seasonal shift in depth distribution from shallow water ( 50 cm) wolffish migrate to these shallow waters in spring and return to deeper waters in autumn. The oldest wolffish aged was 22 years. Mean length-at-age ranged from 4. 7 cm total length for age 0 to 98. 0 cm total length for age 22 in spring. Growth was modelled best by the Gompertz function. Bivalve molluscs (primarily Placopecten magellanicus) dominated the diet, followed by echinoderms, gastropods and decapods...|$|E
