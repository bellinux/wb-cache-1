40|$|Under shock {{compression}} it {{is believed}} that crystalline materials undergo complex, rapid, micro-structural changes to relieve the large applied shear stresses. The mechanisms involved, such as dislocation flow and deformation twinning, under the generated high strain rates are not fully understood and in situ measurements of defects have proven elusive. This work presents the development of a nanosecond x-ray diffraction technique based on the white-light Laue method, and its first use in studying shock compressed copper. Observations of diffuse scattering are interpreted as stress-dependent lattice rotations due to dislocation glide. The results are compared with MD simulations of shocks in copper which are shown not to <b>agree.</b> <b>Simulations</b> of tantalum, shocked along the [001] axis, are demonstrated to undergo deformation twinning. A novel order parameter for identifying twin variants is developed and the deformation twinning mechanism under shock compression is identified.

40|$|AbstractWhile {{computational}} {{models of}} impact events {{have the potential}} to accelerate the design cycle, one's confidence in a material model should be related to the extent of validation work that has been performed for that model. Quantities of interest used for validation are often either scalar volume-averaged quantities (such as the average density, or the force applied to a boundary) or field quantities (such as the strain field obtained from digital image correlation, or density maps computed from X-ray computed tomography (XCT)). Volume averaged quantities are easy to compare quantitatively since they are either a single value or a simple time series. However, these averaged quantities do not capture differences in the failure process within a material and can be blunt instruments for validation efforts. Field quantities provide spatial information, but are difficult to reduce to a scalar that quantifies the goodness of a particular model with respect to another model. This work describes an approach to using XCT data to quantify how well a particular <b>simulation</b> <b>agrees</b> with <b>simulation</b> data while accounting for the statistical nature of failure in brittle materials...|$|R
