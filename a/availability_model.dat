It runs via Baxter and Moorooduc, almost parallel to the existing arterial Moorooduc Highway. It was opened on 18 January 2013.The project is a Public Private Partnership (PPP) managed by the Linking Melbourne Authority (formerly SEITA) and delivered by private sector partner Southern Way, with the State Government providing quarterly payments for delivery under an <b>availability</b> <b>model,</b> with no charges to motorists. The contract with Southern Way to design, construct and finance the freeway was signed in January 2010, with a total project delivery cost for the two parties being $759 million. Construction commenced in February 2010, with completion expected in early 2013, with Southern Way to operate and maintain the freeway for the next 25 years. The Victorian Parliament enacted legislation, the Road Management Amendment (Peninsula Link) Act 2012 in November 2012 to confer rights on the private operator to manage and maintain the road.|$|E

Since the release of GAM Run 12 - 023, the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) adopted the groundwater <b>availability</b> <b>model</b> of the Rustler Aquifer which covers {{a small portion of}} Jeff Davis Underground Water Conservation District. This report discusses the methods, assumptions, and results from the model run using the groundwater <b>availability</b> <b>model</b> of the Rustler Aquifer. Table 1 summarizes the groundwater <b>availability</b> <b>model</b> data required by the statute, and figure 1 shows the area of the model from which the values in the table were extracted. This model run is an addendum to GAM Run 12 - 023.

40|$|Availability is {{a system}} {{performance}} parameter which provides insight into the probability that an item or system {{will be available to}} be committed to a specified requirement. Depending on the application, availability can be defined to include reliability, maintainability and logistic support information.
