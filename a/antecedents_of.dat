5|$|Aleister Crowley {{wrote in}} The <b>Antecedents</b> <b>of</b> Thelema, (1926), an {{incomplete}} work not published in his day, that Rabelais not only set forth {{the law of}} Thelema in a way similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley's life and the holy text that {{he claimed to have}} received, The Book of the Law. Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize the Law.|$|E
5|$|The {{very first}} {{computer}} games {{began to appear}} in the 1950s, starting with Bertie the Brain, a computer-based game of tic-tac-toe built by Dr. Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. While the status of these games as video games depends on the definition used, the games developed during this time period ran on the large <b>antecedents</b> <b>of</b> mainframe computers and were primarily developed for the purposes of academic research or to showcase the technological development of the computers on which they ran. Access to these computers, located almost exclusively in universities and research institutions, was restricted to academics and researchers, preventing any development of entertainment programs. Over the course of the decade, computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches, and computers themselves spread to more locations.|$|E

However, we added e-servicescape as the <b>antecedent</b> <b>of</b> customers trust, perceived risk, and purchase intention. The respondents were 120 online shop customers. The data was processed using SmartPLS 2. 0. We found e-Servicescape to be an <b>antecedent</b> <b>of</b> both customer trust and perceived risk, and customer trust to be the <b>antecedent</b> <b>of</b> purchase intention. However, we found that the relationship between customer trust and perceived risk, as well as perceived risk and purchase intention to be insignificant.

25|$|In Western culture, {{the study}} of {{politics}} is first found in Ancient Greece. The <b>antecedents</b> <b>of</b> European politics trace their roots back even earlier than Plato and Aristotle, particularly {{in the works of}} Homer, Hesiod, Thucydides, Xenophon, and Euripides. Later, Plato analyzed political systems, abstracted their analysis from more literary- and history- oriented studies and applied an approach we would understand as closer to philosophy. Similarly, Aristotle built upon Plato's analysis to include historical empirical evidence in his analysis.|$|E

Its design is derived from NASA's 1990 HL-20 lifting body design which was itself similar to the 1970s Soviet Spiral, which in turn was considered by NASA engineers as influenced by the late 1960s HL-10, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105 military spaceplane concept, a spaceplane studied as a means to develop a Soviet counterpart to the US's X-20 Dyna-Soar.|$|E
25|$|The <b>antecedents</b> <b>of</b> musical theatre in Europe can {{be traced}} back to the theatre of ancient Greece, where music and dance were {{included}} in stage comedies and tragedies during the 5th century BCE. The music from the ancient forms is lost, however, and they had little influence on later development of musical theatre. In the 12th and 13th centuries, religious dramas taught the liturgy. Groups of actors would use outdoor Pageant wagons (stages on wheels) to tell each part of the story. Poetic forms sometimes alternated with the prose dialogues, and liturgical chants gave way to new melodies.|$|E

25|$|In the ultra-luxury segment, <b>antecedents</b> <b>of</b> {{the concept}} are the highly expensive, often custom-bodied {{sporting}} luxury cars of the 1920s and 1930s. Typically made by Alfa Romeo, Bentley, Bugatti, Delage, Delahaye, Duesenberg, Mercedes-Benz, Lincoln, Cadillac, and others, these extremely stylish prestige cars were favored by film stars, aristocrats, playboys, and gangsters for projecting dashing and extravagant images. An extreme {{example is the}} Duesenberg Model SJ, an extremely fast and expensive automobile which eschewed both pure luxury and absolute sports performance {{in favor of a}} distinctive combination of style, craftsmanship, and power: combinations like this produced cars that became status symbols.|$|E
25|$|Joule {{could not}} resist finding <b>antecedents</b> <b>of</b> his views in Francis Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton, John Locke, Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford) and Sir Humphry Davy. Though such views are justified, Joule went on to {{estimate}} a value for the mechanical equivalent of heat of 1034 foot-pound from Rumford's publications. Some modern writers have criticised this approach {{on the grounds that}} Rumford's experiments in no way represented systematic quantitative measurements. In one of his personal notes, Joule contends that Mayer's measurement was no more accurate than Rumford's, perhaps in the hope that Mayer had not anticipated his own work.|$|E
25|$|The {{action and}} {{efficiency}} of influence machines were further investigated by F. Rossetti, A. Righi, and Friedrich Kohlrausch. E. E. N. Mascart, A. Roiti, and E. Bouchotte also examined the efficiency and current producing power of influence machines. In 1871, sectorless machines were investigated by Musaeus. In 1872, Righi's electrometer was developed {{and was one of}} the first <b>antecedents</b> <b>of</b> the Van de Graaff generator. In 1873, Leyser developed the Leyser machine, a variation of the Holtz machine. In 1880, Robert Voss (a Berlin instrument maker) devised a form of machine in which he claimed that the principles of Toepler and Holtz were combined. The same structure become also known as the Toepler-Holtz machine.|$|E
