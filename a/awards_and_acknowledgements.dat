At the 1996 Grammy Awards, they announce {{that they are}} broke - because of greedy people at their record company. The film flashes back to 1995, where they complain {{to each other about}} only receiving $50,000 a year, whereas most people make more money than they do. So the girls band a group together to go storm the record label's building to speak with Clive, who {{is in the middle of}} a meeting with Sean [...] "Puffy" [...] Combs (Shaun Davis). Clive tells the girls that they will get the attorneys and the accountants in a meeting and see what the record label owes them. They are all cut small checks of $25,000, and Lisa reveals in an on-air radio interview that the group owe $200,000 that they don't have in order to pay back managers, lawyers and damages that Pebbles is suing them for. The group then file for bankruptcy and find a new manager, Bill Diggins (Donny Boaz), who gives them a worldwide headlining tour, the Budweiser Fest Tour, and an improved profit margin after they record their next album.|$|R

5000|$|The Grolier Book Shop {{was founded}} in September 1927 by Adrian Gambet and Gordon Cairnie; the {{subsequent}} owner, Louisa Solano purchased and took over its operation in 1974 after Cairnie's death. The poet-bookseller Arthur Freeman negotiated the sale. The Grolier Book Shop d/b/a became the Grolier Poetry Book Shop, Inc. in 1990. for tax reasons.The original owners being financially comfortable were able to run the business at a loss, to give, not sell, a book or two on occasion, to ignore bills as they piled up, and to {{turn a blind eye}} to theft. Much of the activity at the Grolier under Cairnie's management was of the social kind. He held court while his admirers lounged on the red couch under the window, in or on the armchair on the other side of the room, leaned against the shelves, or pushed against the display tables. The shop was rarely empty.Having first entered the shop when she was fifteen, Solano was well familiar with its ways. As she was not independently wealthy, she knew it had to become a self-sustaining business especially if she were to achieve her two goals: to expand the general public's interest in poetry and to honor the diversity of voices.Initially she supported the shop by doing appraisals and by developing a mail order business; she developed innovative ways to promote poetry in the Cambridge community. She introduced an annual undergraduate poetry reading that once incorporated poets from fifteen colleges;, numerous autograph parties that included readings; as the parties grew more crowded, the readings grew separate. The first was held in the Grolier in 1974 with Gary Miranda. In 1983, the Grolier Poetry Prize Annual was first published. Both readings and ANNUAL were now supported by the Ellen La Forge Memorial Poetry Foundation inspired by Jim Henle a friend of the shop and formed in 1983 by Mrs. Jeanne Henle in memory of her sister. It also funded the costs of six poetry festivals. There was also a a basketball and a baseball team organized by the poet Peter Payack.The Shop in its last years under Solano's management was still considered a source for rare or obscure titles or wanting the latest news. It was not unusual for international customers to make stopovers to look over the stock in case there was an unrecognized [...] "treasure". For example, the store was the first in New England to stock Language Magazine, the periodical that launched the avant-garde L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry movement. Over her 31 years in the Shop she has been the recipient of many <b>awards</b> <b>and</b> <b>acknowledgements,</b> one being a Lannan Grant.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years governments are trying to build up the so called “Information Society” (Anttiroiko 2001), a society able to manage {{information}} making wide use of the most innovative ICT. This would lead implementing the eGovernment, here defined as “a public organization that make extensive use of ICT”. Also Italy, like the other main European countries, has carried out high investments in this direction, realizing innovative technological solutions within Central and Local Public Authority (CPA and LPA). These solutions have had not only a positive return in terms of easiness, flexibility, speed and security of the operations, but also a wide international echo, as showed from <b>awards</b> <b>and</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> received in terms of “best practice”. This paper analyses the strategic path that has been followed by the Italian Public Authority implementing eGovernment; through this analysis it points out a framework to represent all the strategic elements and relationships conceived to yield the objectives of the eGovernment strategy. This framework will be also used to evaluate the Italian LPAs path towards eGovernment: the overall PA initiatives and policies will be classified according with the strategic framework. This will constitutes the basis through which the main eGovernment obstacles and solutions will be identified...|$|E
