40|$|Masticatory {{efficiency}} is always compromised in complete denture patients. The denture teeth with compromised occlusal anatomy and material further compound the inherent limitations of complete dentures. To compare the masticatory efficiency {{of patients with}} complete denture using acrylic and metal occlusal <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> Ten edentulous patients with well-formed ridges were selected. Complete dentures using acrylic and metal occlusal <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> were fabricated. The masticatory efficiency was calculated using photo colorimeter. Complete dentures with 20 ° <b>acrylic</b> resin <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> were fabricated for ten edentulous patients and masticatory efficiency was measured using raw beetroot as test food on a photocolorimeter after 10, 15, 20 strokes. The <b>acrylic</b> resin <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> were replaced with metal occlusal <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> on the same denture base. The masticatory efficiency {{was measured by the}} same method. The mean average percentage of masticatory efficiency with acrylic resin teeth and metal occlusal teeth were first calculated and statistical analysis was done using students unpaired t test. The average masticatory efficiency with acrylic teeth was 46. 46 % and metal occlusal teeth was 65. 62, ‘t’ =  5. 38. The difference between the mean average masticatory performance percentage with acrylic teeth and metal occlusal teeth was significant at 1 % i. e. P <  0. 01. Within the limitation of this study the average percentage value of masticatory efficiency improves considerably when metal occlusal teeth replace normal acrylic teeth without any alteration in position or relation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to report a case of {{restorative}} treatment of severely worn dentition. In this case report, the erosive/abrasive worn dentition have been reconstructed with metal ceramic crown on the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> and with ceramic veneers on the anterior teeth 1. 3 - 2. 3 and 3. 4 - 4. 3. A prosthetic treatment was proposed to a male patient of 58 years old having a clinically significant tooth wear. After clinical exam, impressions of maxillary and mandible arches were taken with alginate to obtain preliminary casts for diagnostic waxing to all maxillary and mandibular teeth and fabrication of all provisional crowns in <b>acrylic</b> resin for <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> and from the diagnostic wax-up were fabricated a silicone guide masks for anterior teeth. An increase in VDO should be determined on the basis of a need to accomplish satisfactory and aesthetically pleasing restorations; it was proposed to increase the incisal lenght of the maxillary anterior incisors, together with alteration of the VDO 3 mm anteriorly. The <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> 1. 6 - 1. 5 - 1. 4 - 2. 4 - 2. 6 - 3. 5 - 3. 6 - 3. 7 - 4. 4 - 4. 7, where the amount of tissue lost was greater, were recontructed with metal ceramic crowns. Two implants (Nobel replace 4. 3 x 10) was placed. The implant were located in the area 4. 5 - 4. 6. The anterior teeth were restored with veneers. The prosthetic challenge with restoring severely worn dentitions is to preserve as much of the already diminished tooth structure as possible for retention while also providing enough interocclusal space for the restorative material...|$|R
40|$|AbSTRACT There is {{disagreement}} about {{the association between}} missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> {{and the presence of}} temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Here, the purpose was to investigate whether the number of missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> their distribution, age, and gender are associated with TMD. Seven hundred and forty-one individuals, aged 21 - 60 years, with missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> 386 with and 355 without TMD, were included. Four variables—gender, age, the number of missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> and the number of dental quadrants with missing posterior teeth—were analyzed with a logistic regression model. All four variables—gender (OR = 1. 59, men = 1, women = 2), age (OR = 0. 98), the num-ber of missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> (OR = 0. 51), and the number of dental quadrants with missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> (OR = 7. 71) —were entered into the logistic model (P < 0. 01).

30|$|This {{study showed}} that <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> {{uprighting}} is usually obtained when using continues archwires and anterior vertical elastics to close anterior open bite, especially in the mandibular arch. However, uprighting of the <b>posterior</b> maxillary <b>teeth</b> is more difficult, primarily in extraction cases. Therefore, mechanical procedures such as the multiloop edgewise archwire technique [13, 14] or mesially angulating the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> accessories with continuous archwires [15 – 17, 24] are recommended to increase the possibility of actually uprighting the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> If, in fact, this mesial angulation increases treatment stability, {{this will be a}} contributing factor. Nevertheless, despite some clinical evidence that uprighting the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> will increase treatment stability, this has yet to be investigated.|$|R
30|$|In the mandibular arch, all <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> were {{significantly}} distally angulated with treatment (Table  2). This shows that even without intentionally trying to distally tip these teeth with tip-back bends in the archwires or by mesially angulating the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> accessories, {{it is possible}} to upright, at least, the mandibular <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> If uprighting the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> actually leads to more stability, as speculated [13, 14, 16, 17, 24], this may have contributed to it in an earlier study with some of these patients [6]. Therefore, the principle of uprighting the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> can be partially accomplished even without the mentioned procedures [13 – 16, 24]. This uprighting may also be seen as a necessary dentoalveolar change to compensate for the divergent palatal and mandibular planes that are usually associated with open-bite characteristics [40].|$|R
30|$|An {{alternative}} method to upright the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> instead of incorporating tip-back bends on the archwires, is to mesially angulate the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> accessories and use continuous archwires associated with anterior vertical intermaxillary elastics [14 – 17]. This procedure may simplify the orthodontic mechanics and provide more patient comfort.

40|$|Fifteen {{participants}} in this study are divided into 3 groups; group A contains 5 participants with anterior teeth drifting with unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> 5 without anterior teeth drifting with unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> the rest without anterior teeth drifting nor unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> The electromyograph biofeedback used to measure the chewing strength and we compare the score among the three groups. Introduction Anterior dental drifting of the upper jaw has became common problem after unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> and create diastema, protrusion, and teeth curve change that eventually leads to malocclusion, periodontal and esthetics problems. Contraction and relaxation of masseter muscle will increase vertical, lateral and oblique pressure force distributed to all the teeth. High chewing strength in mastication process {{is one of the main}} cause of the drifting. Untill now, there is no research show how high the chewing strength can influnce the anterior teeth drifting in case of unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> Objectives The objective of this study is to observe influence of chewing strength towards anterior teeth drifting. Methods Fifteen {{participants in}} this study are divided into 3 groups; group A contains 5 participants with anterior teeth drifting with unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> 5 without anterior teeth drifting with unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> the rest without anterior teeth drifting nor unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> The electromyograph biofeedback used to measure the chewing strength and we compare the score among the three groups.

40|$|The Mentawai {{ethnic group}} is {{accustomed}} {{to the practice of}} anterior teeth mutilation on males and females prior to reaching puberty age at Siberut Island, Mentawai Islands Regency, West Sumatra Province. Objective: of this research was to analyze the effects of anterior teeth mutilation on the teeth of the Mentawai ethnic, and prove that there is a correlation between anterior <b>teeth</b> mutilation and <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> attritions. Material & method: There were 179 respondents who contributed to this study by applying accidental sampling method, consist of 96 respondents had anterior teeth mutilations and 83 non-mutilation respondents were found. Among respondents with anterior teeth mutilation, 53. 07 % of them had <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> attritions.

50|$|The {{anterior}} <b>teeth</b> {{protect the}} <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> by providing for a plane of guidance during excursions, thus allowing the cusps of the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> to disclude rather than strike one another during lateral or protrusive movements from centric relation. In other words, the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> have much larger crowns {{and many more}} cusps than the anterior <b>teeth.</b> Because <b>posterior</b> crowns are so much wider and possess cuspal projections in various configurations, the cusps of the maxillary teeth {{and those of the}} mandibular teeth have an opportunity to bang into each other during chewing, speech or simply meeting together when one bites down. To prevent this from happening, the anterior teeth of each arch will, ideally, be situated so as to come into contact before the cusps of the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> do, thus preventing wear on the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> This requires less force because the anterior teeth are further from the joint (analogous to stopping a door further from its hinge).|$|R
30|$|Therefore, the {{objective}} {{of this study is to}} investigate whether the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> are able to be uprighted even when no tip-back bends are incorporated or the accessories of the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> are not mesially tipped, in non-extraction and extraction open-bite treatments.|$|R

50|$|This type of {{intrusion}} {{consists of}} true intrusion of incisors without any extrusion of the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> The incisors in the anterior teeth (depending on the arch) move towards {{the bone and}} no movement of <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> is seen in comparison with relative intrusion where <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> erupt out of the bone.

50|$|The <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> {{protect the}} {{anterior}} teeth {{by providing a}} stable vertical dimension of occlusion.

5000|$|Cortical bone {{is known}} to resorb slower than the {{medullary}} bone.

It is claimed that that by using cortical bone against <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> mesial movement of <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> can be prevented which helps in anchoring the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> {{in the back of}} the jaw.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Facial {{skeletal}} asymmetry {{is commonly}} found in humans and its main characteristic is menton deviation. The literature suggests that occlusal and masticatory problems arising from tooth absence {{could be related to}} the development of such asymmetries. Objective: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the prevalence of mandibular skeletal asymmetries and to investigate its association with <b>posterior</b> <b>tooth</b> absences. Methods: Tomographic images of 952 individuals aged from 18 to 75 years old were used. Asymmetry was the analyzed outcome, and it was categorized into three groups according to gnathion displacement in relation to the midsagittal plane (relative symmetry, moderate asymmetry, and severe asymmetry). Patients were sorted by the presence of all <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> unilateral <b>posterior</b> <b>tooth</b> absence, or bilateral <b>posterior</b> <b>tooth</b> absence. Chi-square test with a significance level of 5 % was used to verify the association between <b>posterior</b> <b>tooth</b> absence and asymmetry. Results: Results show relative symmetry present in 55. 3 % of the sample, as well as the prevalence of 27. 3 % for moderate mandibular asymmetry and 17. 4 % for severe asymmetry. Moderate and severe mandibular asymmetries occurred in a higher proportion in patients with unilateral <b>posterior</b> <b>tooth</b> absence. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the analyzed groups (p = 0. 691). Conclusions: In this study, mandibular asymmetries did not present any association with the absence of <b>teeth</b> on the <b>posterior</b> area of the arch...|$|R
