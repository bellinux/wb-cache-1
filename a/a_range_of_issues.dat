25|$|Udo Schnelle {{argued that}} 2 Thessalonians was {{significantly}} different in style from the undisputed epistles, characterizing it as whole and narrow, {{rather than as}} a lively and abrupt discussion on <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues.</b> Moreover, Alfred Loisy argued that it reflected knowledge of the synoptic gospels, which, according to the current scholarly consensus, had not been written when Paul wrote his epistles. Bart D. Ehrman viewed the insistence of genuineness within the letter and the strong condemnation of forgery at its start as ploys commonly used by forgers. However G. Milligan observed that a church which possessed an authentic letter of Paul would be unlikely to accept a fake addressed to them. However, Milligan's analysis assumes that 2 Thessalonians is not a late forgery and thus was received by the Thessalonian community.|$|E
