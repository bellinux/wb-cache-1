However, due to the EPB's policies of anonymity, most of the information was hampered by the use of codenames <b>and</b> <b>useless</b> for the investigation. During this time, there were internal issues between Segarra and group leaders Ojeda and Avelino González, with the first being considered inefficient by the others and general concern arising from his reputation as an unfaithful husband. On January 25, 1985, the EPB detonated a bomb in an empty United States Courthouse, later noting that it was a tribute to Juan Antonio Corretjer.|$|E
5|$|Fossorial creatures live in {{subterranean}} environments. Many fossorial mammals {{were classified}} under the, now obsolete, order Insectivora, such as shrews, hedgehogs and moles. Fossorial mammals have a fusiform body, thickest at {{the shoulders and}} tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable {{to see in the}} dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial marsupial mole the eyes are degenerated <b>and</b> <b>useless,</b> talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth.|$|E

25|$|Early theoreticians of raison d'état used Tacitus {{to defend}} an ideal of Imperial rule. Other readers used him to {{construct}} a method for living under a despotic state, avoiding both servility <b>and</b> <b>useless</b> opposition.

25|$|With the {{development}} of statistical techniques and numerical taxonomy in the 1960s, mathematical methods (including Cluster analysis, Principal components analysis, correspondence analysis and Factor analysis) {{have been used to}} build typologies. These techniques provide a qualitative way to articulate the degrees of consistency among particular attributes. Correlation coefficients created by these methods help archaeologists discern between meaningful <b>and</b> <b>useless</b> similarities between artefacts. During the 1990s archaeologists began to use phylogenetic methods borrowed from Cladistics.|$|E
25|$|When {{water flows}} {{it has the}} ability to {{transport}} particles heavier than itself downstream. This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation. Siltation can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam. Eventually, some reservoirs can become full of sediment <b>and</b> <b>useless</b> or over-top during a flood and fail.|$|E

25|$|Consequently, the filmed {{version of}} the novel altered {{the details of the}} plan. Although the {{audience}} is initially led to believe Goldfinger is going to steal the gold, the real plot is revealed to be to render the gold contained in the Depository radioactive <b>and</b> <b>useless,</b> crippling the gold standard-based economy and thereby dramatically driving up the price of the gold Goldfinger already owns. A scene in the film even uses a confrontation between Goldfinger and Bond to point out logistical flaws in the plan as set out in the original novel.|$|E
25|$|Goldfinger {{is later}} {{revealed}} to be planning to place an atomic device containing cobalt and iodine into Fort Knox, rendering the gold radioactive <b>and</b> <b>useless</b> for 58 years, increasing {{the value of his}} own gold and giving the Chinese an advantage resulting from the ensuing economic chaos. Bond, at this point held captive by Goldfinger, is able to smuggle the details of the operation out to his CIA associate Felix Leiter and, taken along on the operation by Goldfinger, ultimately thwarts the operation by defusing the atomic device.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{distinctive}} points in Cousin's philosophy. These are his method, {{the results of}} his method, and the application of the method and its results to history, especially to the history of philosophy. It is usual to speak of his philosophy as eclecticism. It is eclectic only in a secondary and subordinate sense. All eclecticism that is not self-condemned and inoperative implies a system of doctrine as its basis, in fact, a criterion of truth. Otherwise, as Cousin himself remarks, it is simply a blind <b>and</b> <b>useless</b> syncretism. And Cousin saw and proclaimed from an early period in his philosophical teaching the necessity of a system on which to base his eclecticism. This is indeed advanced as an illustration or confirmation of the truth of his system, as a proof that the facts of history correspond to his analysis of consciousness. These three points, the method, the results, and the philosophy of history, are with him intimately connected. They are developments in a natural order of sequence. They become in practice Psychology, Ontology and Eclecticism in history.|$|E

25|$|The Ayyubids {{were still}} divided between Ayyub in Egypt, Isma'il in Damascus, and Dawud in Kerak. Isma'il, Dawud, and al-Mansur Ibrahim of Homs {{went to war}} with Ayyub, who hired the Khwarazmians to fight for him. The Khwarazmians were nomadic Turks from central Asia, who had {{recently}} been displaced by the Mongols further {{to the east and}} were now residing in Mesopotamia. With Ayyub's support they sacked Jerusalem in the summer of 1244, leaving it in ruins <b>and</b> <b>useless</b> to both Christians and Muslims. In October, the Khwarazmians, along with the Egyptian army under the command of Baibars, were met by the Frankish army, led by Philip of Montfort, Walter of Brienne, and the masters of the Templars, Hospitallers, and Teutonic Knights, along with al-Mansur and Dawud. On October 17 the Egyptian-Khwarazmian army destroyed the Frankish-Syrian coalition, and Walter of Brienne was taken captive and later executed. By 1247, Ayyub had reoccupied most of the territory that had been conceded in 1239, and had also gained control of Damascus.|$|E
25|$|Parnok's {{last great}} love was the Georgian physicist, Nina Vedeneyeva. The two may have met {{as early as}} 1927, through Tsuberbiller, a {{colleague}} of Vedeneyeva. Vedeneyeva's son, Yevgeny, was living in exile {{at that time and}} Tsuberbiller, who had written a textbook used for decades in the high schools of Russia, helped her obtain books for him to maintain his studies. In January, 1932, the relationship turned to romance, despite the facts that Parnok was still living with Tsuberbiller and Yevgeny disapproved of the relationship. As had happened before, her lover became her muse, inspiring her to write two cycles of poems, Ursa Major <b>and</b> <b>Useless</b> Goods. The frantic pace of her writing foretold the exhaustion she would suffer, which hastened her death, but Parnok was aware of the consequences. The references between these last two cycles and Parnok's adolescent poetry, make it clear that she had always known what she wanted to say, but until she reached her maturity, she {{did not know how to}} express her words. Their emotional bond, which accelerated after a trip to Vedeneyeva's summer cottage in Kashin in April, was destined to remain hidden from most of Vedeneyeva's family and friends. To keep up appearance of a mere friendship, they spent their summers apart.|$|E

Coal balls are calcium-rich permineralised life forms, mostly containing calcium and magnesium carbonates, pyrite, and quartz. Other minerals, including gypsum, illite, kaolinite, and lepidocrocite also appear in coal balls, albeit in lesser quantities. Although coal balls are usually {{about the size of}} a man's fist, their sizes vary greatly, ranging from that of a walnut up to [...] in diameter. Coal balls have been found that were smaller than a thimble.|$|E
500|$|With {{the decline}} of League of Nations in the 1930s, the {{treaties}} were increasingly considered unenforceable <b>and</b> <b>useless.</b> The League Council, charged with enforcing the various minority treaties, often failed to act upon complaints from minorities.
