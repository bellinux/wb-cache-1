I only remember one reference, in all your works, to that controversy which occupies the chief of our attention--the great controversy on Creation or Evolution. Your Jane Bennet cries: 'I have no idea of there being so much Design in the world as some persons imagine.' Nor do you touch on our mighty social question, the Land Laws, save when Mrs. Bennet appears as a Land Reformer, and rails bitterly against the cruelty 'of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.' There, madam, in that cruelly unjust performance, what a text you had for a Tendenz-Roman. Nay, you can allow Kitty to report that a Private had been flogged, without introducing a chapter on Flogging in the Army. But you formally declined to stretch your matter out, here and there, 'with solemn specious nonsense about something unconnected with the story.' No 'padding' for Miss Austen! In fact, madam, as you were born before <b>Analysis</b> <b>came</b> <b>in,</b> or Passion, or Realism, or Naturalism, or Irreverence, or Religious Open-mindedness, you really cannot hope to rival your literary sisters in the minds of a perplexed generation. Your heroines are not passionate, we do not see their red wet cheeks, and tresses dishevelled in the manner of our frank young Maenads. What says your best successor, a lady who adds fresh lustre to a name that in fiction equals yours? She says of Miss Austen: 'Her heroines have a stamp of their own. They have a certain gentle self-respect and humour and hardness of heart... Love with them does not mean a passion as much as an interest, deep and silent.' I think one prefers them so, and that Englishwomen should be more like Anne Elliot than Maggie Tulliver. 'All the privilege I claim for my own sex is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone,' said Anne; perhaps she insisted on a monopoly that neither sex has all to itself. Ah, madam, what a relief it is to come back to your witty volumes, and forget the follies of to-day in those of Mr. Collins and of Mrs. Bennet! How fine, nay, how noble is your art in its delicate reserve, never insisting, never forcing the note, never pushing the sketch into the caricature! You worked without thinking of it, in the spirit of Greece, on a labour happily limited, and exquisitely organised. 'Dear books,' we say, with Miss Thackeray--'dear books, bright, sparkling with wit and animation, in which the homely heroines charm, the dull hours fly, and the very bores are enchanting.' ...|$|E

40|$|Pointer analysis, {{a process}} that statically computes the {{possible}} runtime values of a pointer in a program, enables the understanding of program behaviours. It lies {{in the heart of}} software engineering and has laid foundations for extensive applications, such as compiler optimisation, software bug detection and program verification. The long existing challenge of the analysis, however, is to improve its efficiency while maintaining high precision, especially when applied to large programs. Parallel platforms, which are prevalent nowadays, provide a great opportunity to enhance the efficiency of pointer analysis. Yet, it is challenging to parallelise this analysis, which is essentially an irregular graph algorithm. <b>In</b> general, pointer <b>analysis</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> two styles: whole-program and demand-driven. Whole-program analysis, which computes the points-to information of all variables in a program, is often formulated as a graph-rewriting problem that makes extensive modifications to data structures representing the graph. Demand-driven analysis, which only targets the variables requested by queries, is solved in terms of a graph traversal problem. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a parallel pointer analysis framework that enables efficient pointer analysis for large-scale software. This framework consists of three parts, each targeting one of today’s most popular parallel platforms, and is implemented with a combination of Java, C++ and CUDA. The first part is a parallel solution to pointer analysis driven by queries, on multi-core CPUs. It has achieved significant speedups over the sequential solution, since a large amount of unnecessary graph traversals have been eliminated by information sharing and query scheduling. The second part is an efficient GPU solution to whole-program pointer analysis. With effective load balancing and reduced redundant computation, it demonstrates considerable speedups over the state-of-the-art GPU implementation. The third part is a heterogeneous CPU-GPU solution to whole-program pointer analysis. It prioritises the distribution of different work-loads to CPU/GPU according to the processing unit’s ability for processing them, and therefore has achieved speedups over the corresponding CPU-only and GPU-only solutions. The effectiveness of each part of the framework is demonstrated via an evaluation with a set of open-source Java/C programs...|$|R

40|$|Companies are {{expected}} to be good corporate citizens and fulfil expectations of both shareholders and stakeholders. Depending on their corporate objectives, companies undertake different CSR activities using their preferred financial resources. The relationship between these two notions is interesting to investigate in the Nordic context since companies in this geographical area are the global leaders in sustainability. We formulate the following research question as: What is the relationship between financial slack and the CSR performance in Nordic countries? As such, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate the underpinnings of whether companies choose to allocate their financial slack resources towards improving performance of CSR, or so called value creation. Doing so, we investigate the relationship between financial slack resources and CSR score. In adopting a regulatory position on the development of society, we conduct our research in accordance with the functionalist research paradigm, namely through commitment to the objectivist ontic and positivist epistemic research philosophies. We answer the research question using the deductive approach. Our research design is framed with an explanatory purpose relying on archival strategy to perform a quantitative study. The theoretical underpinnings for <b>analysis</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> the form of legitimacy theory, the institutional differences hypothesis, Resource-based theory, slack resources theory, stakeholder and shareholder theory. We use multiple linear regressions to analyse cross-sectional data for the period between 2005 and 2015 collected from Thomson Reuters DataStream. Our result indicates that the relationship between financial slack and CSR performance in the following year is mixed with both positive and negative relationships being present. Our most important finding is a pattern indicating that during the year 2008 the relationship changed from being positive to negative. This implies that the more funds a company has at its discretion, the less likely it is for them to invest it in developing their CSR performance the following year. This could have severe negative implications on shareholders, stakeholders and society...|$|R

Over several decades, beginning in 1839, statutes that enabled women to control real and personal property, participate in contracts and lawsuits, inherit independently of their husbands, work for a salary, and write wills were enacted.

40|$|Without a doubt, {{there has}} been a "credibility revolution" in applied econometrics. One {{contributing}} development has been in the improvement and increased use in data analysis of "structural methods"; that is, the use of models based in economic theory. Structural modeling attempts to use data to identify the parameters of an underlying economic model, based on models of individual choice or aggregate relations derived from them. Structural estimation has a long tradition in economics, but better and larger data sets, more powerful computers, improved modeling methods, faster computational techniques, and new econometric methods such as those mentioned above have allowed researchers to make significant improvements. While Angrist and Pischke extol the successes of empirical work that estimates "treatment effects" based on actual or quasi-experiments, they are much less sanguine about structural analysis and hold industrial organization up as an example where "progress is less dramatic. " Indeed, reading their article one comes away with the impression that there is only a single way to conduct credible empirical analysis.

We are making it available in electronic form now, because there is a demand for some of the technical tools it provides, in particular a detailed presentation of analytic elliptic regularity estimates in the neighborhood of smooth boundary points. We {{hope to be able to}} finish the whole project soon and to publish all four parts, but in the meantime this first part can be used as a starting point for proofs of elliptic regularity estimates in more complicated situations. The origin of this book project is twofold. In the beginning there were two separate needs we perceived as not being satisfied by the currently available literature on corner singularities: On one hand, we saw a demand for a general introduction into the regularity results for elliptic boundary value problems on domains with corners and edges and into the main techniques for their <b>analysis.</b> This demand <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> particular from applied mathematicians, engineers and numerical analysts for whom the precise knowledge of the asymptotic behavior near singular points of the geometry can be of crucial importance...|$|R
