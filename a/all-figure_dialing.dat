50|$|After the {{introduction}} of STD, but {{before the advent of}} <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling,</b> to call a number on an exchange in a director area, the number would be dialled as follows, for example, OL1 ANF 1234. After the advent of <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling</b> the number would be 051 263 1234.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} the Director system was {{superseded}} in the UK by <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling</b> from March 1966, London had almost exhausted all possible, usable combinations of letters (it had about 240 at that stage). While this {{was far from the}} case in the provincial cities, the crossover to <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling</b> was still a sizeable operation in Manchester (48 exchange names to convert - including IRLam and MARple), Birmingham (43 exchanges) and Glasgow (42).|$|R
50|$|Other {{countries}} introduced similar transitions for eliminating exchange names. In the United Kingdom, the {{new system}} was known as <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling.</b>|$|R
50|$|When STD codes were {{initially}} assigned, Consett {{was given the}} mnemonic code CO7 (corresponding to 207 on the rotary dial). With the transition to <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling</b> which ended the practice of representing STD codes with letters in 1966, and including the trunk prefix, this became 0207.|$|R
50|$|<b>All-figure</b> <b>dialling</b> was a {{telephone}} numbering plan {{introduced in the}} United Kingdom starting in 1966 that replaced the traditional system of using initial letters of telephone exchange names as {{the first part of}} {{a telephone}} number. The change primarily affected subscriber numbers in the cities of Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester.|$|R
50|$|The {{change to}} <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling</b> was {{controversial}} and was debated in both Houses of Parliament. Among the {{criticisms of the}} new system was the perceived difficulty in remembering telephone numbers, the inability to easily recognise where a telephone number was located and the need for a change so soon after the implementation of subscriber trunk dialling.|$|R
50|$|Telephone {{exchange}} {{names were}} used in many countries, but were phased out for numeric systems by the 1960s. In the United States, the demand for telephone service outpaced the scalability of the alphanumeric system and after introduction of area codes for direct-distance dialing, all-number calling became necessary. Similar developments followed around the world, such as the British <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On [...] "PhONEday", 16 April 1995, the digit [...] "1" [...] was {{inserted}} into all UK geographic area codes, {{including those in}} the director, <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling,</b> ELNS and mixed areas. Under the new changes, for example, Inner London's 071 became 0171; Outer London's 081 became 0181. A small selection of the codes that changed are shown in the table below: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{transition}} to <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling</b> occurred between 1966 and 1970 and was {{initiated by the}} General Post Office. It {{was one of the}} first in a series of changes in the organisation of British telephone numbers. In most areas the change initially only affected the presentation of area codes, but in six multiple exchange director areas such as the London telephone area, the change required the introduction of new local exchange codes. The period of parallel operation of the old and new systems ended in 1970 with the ANN: All-figure Numbers Now advertising campaign. The changes were required for the continued good operation of the telephone service, but were considered controversial at the time. They occurred because of the increase in subscriber-dialled international calls from countries which used a different mapping of letters to numbers on the rotary dial and because the number of useful exchange mnemonics that were possible under the existing system was being exhausted. The implementation of <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling</b> and new local exchange codes in director areas allowed changes to be made to routing of calls into and out of these areas.|$|R
5000|$|Dials outside Canada, the United States, {{and large}} cities in Britain (before <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling)</b> usually did not bear {{alphabetic}} characters or {{an indication of}} the word [...] "operator" [...] in addition to numbers. Alphabetic designation of exchanges with Cyrillic letters (А, Б, В, Г, Д, Е, Ж, И, К, Л for each of the digits from 1 through 0 respectively) was also used for a short period in the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s, but by the next decade this practice was largely discontinued.|$|R
50|$|The {{continued}} {{operation of the}} system presented a number of problems. With the growth of subscriber dialled international calls from abroad and the incompatible allocation of letters to numbers on foreign dials, {{there was an increase}} in the number of dialling errors. In London the number of three letter codes that could be used to represent exchanges had been exhausted. Significant changes were planned to the way calls in and out of the London telephone area were to be handled that required exchange codes to be grouped together into sectors and it was not possible to implement these changes without a transition to <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling.</b> The General Post Office produced a pamphlet All-Figure Telephone Numbers in 1965 which summarised the problems.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1960s {{the number of}} {{possible}} exchange names were running out in London and the potential expansion of international direct dialling (where different letters were assigned to alternate numbers than those on UK phones) called {{for the creation of}} an alternative, modern system of numbering. Called <b>All-figure</b> <b>dialling,</b> the first three letters of the exchange name (e.g. CENtral) were to be permanently replaced by digits (in this example: 236). The first six places to introduce the system were the Director cities including Manchester - the process began in 1966. London was allocated the simplest primary code of ‘01’. Manchester was then given a new dialling code of ‘061’, the number 6 corresponded with the letter ‘M’ on the dial (The 2 of Birmingham’s 021 corresponded with B, Edinburgh’s 031 with E, Glasgow’s 041 the G and Liverpool's L with the 5 giving 051).|$|R
50|$|While a Director {{area had}} {{a maximum of}} 648 {{exchange}} names (8 x 9 x 9), in practice some numbers {{do not have a}} usable name equivalent; unusable ABC digits would be 688 (MUTt or MUVver?) or 555 (?). London was running out of usable names with 350 exchanges by 1965; this was one reason for the change to <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling</b> in 1966. This problem was sidestepped to some degree by using otherwise unusable codes to give access to the fringe non-Director exchanges from the Director area. For example, in London callers to South Mimms were told to dial SM6 followed by the four-digit South Mimms number; callers to Uxbridge numbers were told to dial UX followed by the five-digit Uxbridge number. In this latter case the first digit of the Uxbridge number rotated the BC switch of the director and was absorbed in specifying the translation; the last digit of the translation then regenerated the first digit of the Uxbridge number.|$|R
5000|$|When STD codes were {{initially}} assigned, Romford {{was given the}} mnemonic code RO8 (corresponding to 708 on the rotary dial), with Hornchurch {{and the rest of}} the area using the HX2 (402) code. With the transition to <b>all-figure</b> <b>dialling</b> which ended the practice of representing STD codes with letters in 1966, and including the trunk prefix, these became 0708 and 0402. The 0402 code covered seven exchanges in a linked numbering scheme, with an additional digit for each exchange, as below. Internally, the 0402 code was translated to routing digits by registers to the same string of digits as 0708 plus an additional 8, which corresponded to the 8 in the local code from Romford Group Switching Centre to the local exchange. This technique was used to keep the dialled string down to the 10 digit limit that was imposed (though Stapleford only had 3 digit local numbers and South Ockendon 4 digits and so these could be dialled as 0708 8x xxx as well as the official 0402x xxx / xxxx.) ...|$|R
