25|$|Fossils of Confuciusornis {{show that}} it had an {{exceptionally}} large humerus (upper arm bone). Near its shoulder-end this was equipped with a prominent deltopectoral crest. Characteristically this crista deltopectoralis was with Confuciusornis pierced by an oval hole which may have reduced the bone's weight or enlarged the <b>attachment</b> <b>area</b> of the flight miscles. The furcula or wishbone, like that of Archaeopteryx, was a simple curved bar lacking a pointed process at the back, a hypocleidum. The sternum (breastbone) was relatively broad and had a low keel which was raised at the back end. This bony keel {{may or may not}} have anchored a larger, cartilaginous, keel for enlarged pectoral muscles. The scapulae (shoulder blades) were fused to the strut-like coracoid bones and may have formed a solid base for the attachment of wing muscles. The orientation of the shoulder joint was sideways, instead of angled upward as in modern birds; this means that Confuciusornis was unable to lift its wings high above its back. According to a study by Phil Senter in 2006, the joint was even pointed largely downwards meaning that the humerus could not be lifted above the horizontal. This would make Confuciusornis incapable of the upstroke required for flapping flight; the same would have been true for Archaeopteryx.|$|E

Recent evidence suggests that extracellular environments can also mediate cell functions, particularly cell adhesion.

These findings indicate that cell <b>attachment</b> <b>areas</b> correlate well with the osteogenic differentiation activity of MSCs.

Comparison of the calculated results for the physiological load case with muscle forces uniformly distributed over their <b>attachment</b> <b>areas</b> showed good agreement with in vivo measurements of strain values and femoral head displacement in humans. Simplified load cases generated unrealistic displacement results and high strain magnitudes, exceeding the physiological range. It was found that when muscles with large <b>attachment</b> <b>areas</b> are included in the model and the muscle forces are simplified, stress and strain distributions will be affected not only on the external bone surface {{in the vicinity of the}} load application node, but also on the internal surface of the cortical bone. However, applying muscle forces as concentrated loads at the centroids of the <b>attachment</b> <b>areas</b> can serve as first indicators of the physiological stress and strain levels, if results from nodes and elements in the vicinity of the load application nodes are discarded.

40|$|The {{development}} of a mathematical model of the knee ligaments in the sagittal plane is presented.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into parameter sensitivity of a mathematical model of the human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The model ACL comprised a continuous array of fibres mapped between part-elliptical <b>attachment</b> <b>areas</b> on the femur and tibia. Relative motion of the two bones was controlled by a planar four-bar linkage. Parameter modifications were: (a) an alternative set of values for the coordinates of the four-bar linkage joints; (b) rotation of the <b>attachment</b> <b>areas</b> of the ligament by +/- 30 degrees; and (c) variation of some mechanical properties. The alternative four-bar linkage parameter set produced extremely large changes in ACL force values, up to 130 per cent. Rotating the tibial attachment changed forces by less than 20 per cent, whereas rotating the femoral attachment changed forces by up to 100 per cent. Altering the mechanical parameters produced the smallest differences in force, under 15 per cent. These results highlight the importance, when using a theoretical model, of establishing the values of the parameters defining the model as accurately as possible and of carrying out a parameter sensitivity study. From a clinical viewpoint, they also suggest that, when reconstructing a ruptured ACL, {{one of the most important}} considerations must be to position the femoral attachment of the graft as accurately as is feasible...|$|R

5000|$|Dr. Michael Taylor, {{one of the}} dinosaur's describers, hypothesizes {{that the}} strong thigh muscles of Brontomerus were {{probably}} used for functions other than speed.

Black dot-like pycnidia are common along {{the margins of the}} upper parts of branches and lobes and in between the margins on the prominent reticulate ridges.

Objective: To examine {{the effect of}} osteopathic manipulative (OM) techniques on diaphragm movement in asymptomatic subjects. Methods: A randomized, controlled, pre and post-test experimental design was conducted on 30 healthy individuals (15 males and 15 females; age range 20 - 45 years, (Mean ± SD) 27. 7 ± 4. 5 y. The OM technique protocol consisted of three standardized OM techniques applied to anatomical <b>attachment</b> <b>areas</b> of the diaphragm. The control group did not receive any technique, but were required to lie quietly for seven minutes, the same length of time it took to perform the OM techniques. Ultrasound and spirometry measures were taken before and after OM techniques and control procedures. Data from pre and post-test measurements of the control group was used to establish a baseline. Results: Data from 28 subjects was analyzed and showed a substantial increase in effect size in the treatment group compared to the control. Ultrasound measures in the treatment group showed a 'large' effect in breathing rate (Br/min) and a 'moderate' effect in pause (P) phase. Spirometry measures in the treatment group showed a 'large' effect in TV and a 'moderate' effect in PEF.
