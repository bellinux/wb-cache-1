5|$|Bawdsey, {{right on}} the eastern coast in a {{relatively}} secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more protected location on the opening of hostilities had been identified long before the war. During a visit to his alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students <b>and</b> <b>professors</b> had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.|$|E

His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E

The Board required that Rudder approve each female applicant; he accepted any woman who met the academic requirements. During Rudder's tenure, African-American students were also welcomed, and in 1967, James L.

While enrolled, White expressed an acute awareness of black society and psychological concepts in essays he presented. On May 24, 1855, he addressed Governor James Pollock at a special reception for the institute, touching {{on the issue of}} African American citizenship.

25|$|The 1848 {{revolution}} was welcomed by the university's students <b>and</b> <b>professors.</b> Some 11,000 {{people lived in}} Olomouc by this time, which was {{only a third of}} estimated population level back in 1600. The local garrison in 1848 nevertheless contained some 5,000 soldiers, which was a powerful anti-revolutionary force. Mostly the students <b>and</b> <b>professors</b> of law and philosophy were supportive of the Revolution, while the theologians distanced themselves from it. In March 1848 the students <b>and</b> <b>professors</b> petitioned the Emperor requesting, among other things, lectures in the Czech language and extensions to the university's freedoms and privileges. Later during the same month they established armed Academic Legion of 382 men: its first company consisted of lawyers while the second comprised philosophers and members of the medical faculty. Many of these left Olomouc in order to support the actions of revolutionary students in Vienna. Leading revolutionaries from Olomouc University included professors Ignác Jan Hanuš, Jan Helcelet and Andreas Jeitteles. These, together with students, participated in associations and started newspapers in Czech and German. The black-red-golden flag of Burschenschaft waived over the university buildings.|$|E
