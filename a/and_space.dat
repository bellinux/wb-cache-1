5|$|Between 1962 and 1972, the Test Pilot School {{expanded}} its role to include astronaut training for military test pilots. Thirty-seven TPS graduates of this era {{were selected for}} the U.S. space program, and twenty-six went on to earn astronaut's wings by flying in the X-15, Gemini, Apollo, <b>and</b> <b>Space</b> Shuttle programs. Although the school no longer trains astronauts, many TPS graduates since 1972 have been selected by the National Aeronautics <b>and</b> <b>Space</b> Administration (NASA) for duties in space. The school encourages applications from civilians, personnel from other U.S. military services, and individuals from foreign countries. An exchange program allows selected students to attend other test pilot schools including the United States Naval Test Pilot School, the United Kingdom's Empire Test Pilots' School, and France's EPNER.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{explored}} {{the effect of}} frequency (number of presentations), <b>and</b> <b>spacing</b> (period between presentations) on verb learning in children with specific language impairment (SLI). Children learn words more efficiently when presentations are frequent <b>and</b> appropriately <b>spaced,</b> <b>and</b> this study investigated whether children with SLI likewise benefit. Given that these children demonstrate greater frequency dependence and rapid forgetting of recently acquired words, an investigation of frequency <b>and</b> <b>spacing</b> in this population is especially warranted. Method: Twenty-four children with SLI (mean age 5; 6 [years;months]) and 24 language-matched control children (mean age 3; 4) were taught novel verbs during play sessions. In a repeated measures design, 4 experimental conditions combined frequency (12 or 18 presentations) <b>and</b> <b>spacing</b> (all presentations in 1 session, or spread over 4 days). Comprehension and production probes were administered after the final session and 1 week later. Results: Although the children with SLI benefited significantly from frequent <b>and</b> widely <b>spaced</b> presentations, {{there were no significant}} effect in the control group. The language-impaired children showed rapid forgetting. Conclusions: The frequency <b>and</b> <b>spacing</b> of presentations crucially affect the verb learning of children with SLI. A training regimen characterized by appropriately <b>spaced</b> intervals <b>and</b> moderate repetition will optimally benefit lexical learning. KEY WORDS: verb learning, specific language impairment, frequency effects, spacing effects C omparatively few word learning studies have investigated theeffect of frequency <b>and</b> <b>spacing</b> (i. e., the number of presentationsand the intervals between them). The dearth of studies in this area is surprising given that recent research has demonstrated that <b>spacing</b> <b>and</b> frequency crucially affect word learning performance. Moreover, one particular group of children—those with specific lan-guage impairment (SLI) —may be particularly sensitive to the effect of frequency <b>and</b> <b>spacing.</b> This study aimed to investigate the influence of these two factors on the word learning of these children...|$|R
