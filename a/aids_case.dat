25|$|The first <b>AIDS</b> <b>case</b> {{identified}} in Brazil was in 1982. Infection rates climbed exponentially throughout the 1980s, and in 1990 the World Bank famously predicted 1,200,000 cases by 2000, approximately double {{the actual number}} that was later reported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and most international organizations. South and Southeast have 75% or more this infection (Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro). Northeast have 33% of population but only 10% of AIDS.|$|E
25|$|China's first <b>AIDS</b> <b>case</b> was {{identified}} in 1985 in a dying tourist. In 1989, the first indigenous cases {{were reported as}} an outbreak in 146 infected heroin users in Yunnan province, near China's southwest border. Between 1989 and the mid-1990s, HIV spread steadily from Yunnan into neighboring areas and along the major drug trafficking routes, then from injecting drug users (IDUs) to their sexual partners and children. In the mid-1990s, the occurrence of a second major outbreak in commercial plasma donors in the east-central provinces became apparent. Plasma donors were paid to donate blood, the plasma removed, then the red blood cells reinfused to prevent anaemia. Reuse of tubing and mixing during collection and reinfusion led to thousands of new infections. At the same time, HIV was also spreading through sexual transmission. By 1998, HIV had reached all 31 provinces and was in a phase of exponential growth, which, by 2005, had culminated in an estimated 650,000 infections.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship that}} employee perceptions of rewards, training, and selection have with reported and unreported employee injuries requiring doctor’s attention, first <b>aid</b> <b>cases,</b> and near misses. Additionally, this {{study examines}} the relationship of selection and training with injury reporting beyond that of rewards, because reporting relationships have not previously been examined in either of these areas. Study results indicate that employee per-ception of training {{is associated with a}} {{decrease in the number of}} unreported injuries including doctor’s attention, first <b>aid</b> <b>cases,</b> and near misses, and employee perceptions of selection are associated with a decrease in the number of unreported first <b>aid</b> <b>cases.</b> Both training and selection were related to the number of unreported injuries above and beyond the effect of rewards for safety. Implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Brazil's first <b>AIDS</b> <b>case</b> was {{reported}} in 1982. Brazil’s AIDS response was crafted in 1985, just after the country had returned from military rule to democracy, {{at a time when}} only four AIDS cases had been reported. The Brazilian Ministry of Health laid the groundwork for a National AIDS Control Program (NACP) which was established in 1986, and placed {{under the aegis of the}} National AIDS Control Committee, a group composed of scientists and members of civil society organizations, in 1987. The program was reorganized again in 1992 with more emphasis on linkages between government and NGOs. [...] AIDS Project I garnered $90 million in domestic funds and a $160 million loan from the World Bank between 1992 and 1998. AIDS Project II also composed of both domestic funds and a World Bank loan totaled $370 million between 1998 and 2002.|$|E

50|$|Waitangi Tribunal {{claims have}} been a {{contributing}} factor to the growing cost of legal aid as Treaty claimants can apply for legal aid irrespective of their financial circumstances - {{which is not the}} case in civil or criminal cases. Since 2006, Waitangi tribunal cases have cost the taxpayer $79 million in legal aid, although as at January 2013, there were 780 claims still outstanding. Despite the large number of outstanding Treaty claims, these cases represent a fraction {{of the total number of}} legal <b>aid</b> <b>cases</b> - but are often among the most expensive. Dame Margaret Bazley's review of the legal aid process in 2009 found that of the 75 most expensive legal <b>aid</b> <b>cases</b> of 2008-09, 41% were for Treaty claims. In 2012, about 8% of the $148 million legal aid bill was spent on Treaty claims.|$|R
