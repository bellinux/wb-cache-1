[...] Specifically, the <b>analgesic</b> <b>property</b> of epibatidine is believed to take place by its binding to the α4/β2 subtype of nicotinic receptors. Epibatidine also binds to the α3/β4 subtype and to a much lesser extent α7 receptors (affinity 300-fold less than for α4/β2) The rank order of affinities is αε > αγ > αδ.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed {{to assess whether}} Moringa oleifera also have {{analgesic}} activity like NSAIDS. After animal ethics committee approval, this study was carried out. 6 male and 6 non pregnant female albino mice {{were used for the}} study. First they were given 1 % acetic acid intraperitonealy, noted for number of writhings over 20 minutes. A week later Ibuprofen was given orally and 30 minutes later acetic acid was injected and number of writhings were noted. After one week interval, same procedure was repeated with Moringa oleifera instead of Ibuprofen. The results were statistically analysed. From our study it was found that, (1). Among male and female mice, there is no significant difference in reduction number of writhings. This shows that Moringa Oleifera has equal pain lowering effect in both males and females. Both among males and female mice, Moringa has decreased number of writhings compared to controls. This shows that it has <b>analgesic</b> <b>property.</b> (2). Both among males and females, there is no difference in reduction of number of writhings between Moringa and Ibuprofen. This shows that both have equal <b>analgesic</b> <b>property.</b> (3). From this study we conclude that Moringa oleifera has got analgesic properties as that of Ibuprofen. Thus the use of Moringa oleifera extract in relieving muscle pain can be promoted in both indigenous and other local medicinal practices directed towards people of low socio economic status...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Post-operative pain is Nociceptive i. e., {{anticipated}} unavoidable physiological pain {{which is}} caused due to tissue trauma. Drugs such as NSAIDs (Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs) and Opioids are used for post-operative pain management but are associated with their own drawbacks. Karamardādi Yoga has been in use in Ayurvedic practice for analgesia. It is known to relieve pain {{and can be used}} to supplement anaesthesia and also get rid of adverse effect of modern analgesic drugs. Aims and Objective: To study the comparative effect of Karamardādi Yoga and Diclofenac sodium in post-operative pain management. Materials and Methods: Randomized clinical trial with Group A (Control Group: Tab Diclofenac sodium 50 mg as a single dose) and Group B (Trial Group: Cap Karamardādi Yoga 500 mg as a single dose). Those who had undergone haemorrhoidectomy operation under local anaesthesia were selected as per inclusion criteria. Vitals, desirable effect and undesirable effect, total surgical time, requirement of 1 st dose of analgesic, requirement of rescue analgesic and pain determined by VAS (Visual Analog Scale) were the assessment criteria and were observed and recorded. Results: Karamardādi Yoga does not show any undesirable or serious ill effects and altered values of vitals as per statistical analysis. As per VAS scale, pain felt by Trial group was earlier than control group. Conclusions: Karamardādi Yoga has <b>analgesic</b> <b>property</b> but its <b>analgesic</b> <b>property</b> and pain threshold capacity is lesser than those of Diclofenac sodium...|$|E

40|$|Parastrephia lepidophylla, family Asteraceae, has ancient use in {{traditional}} {{medicine in the}} region of Tarapacá, Chile.

30|$|Crataeva tapia bark lectin was {{evaluated}} for its antitumor activity against sarcoma 180 in Swiss albino mice. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties were investigated in models of inflammation and nociception.

The lectin presents low toxicity with a LD 50 of 2, 500 mg/kg body weight and significant antitumor activity causing inhibition of tumor growth. The lectin also promoted significant reduction (35.4 %) {{in the number}} of neutrophil migration induced by carrageenan.
