40|$|OBJECTIVE: Motivational Interviewing (MI) can {{effectively}} stimulate motivation for health behavior change, but the <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> of MI {{are not well}} known. To help clinicians further stimulate motivation, {{they need to know}} the <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> of MI. A psychometrically sound instrument is required to identify those ingredients. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe and evaluate the capability of existing instruments to reliably measure one or more potential <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> in the MI process between clients and MI-therapists. METHODS: We systematically searched MedLine, Embase, Cinahl, PsycInfo, Cochrane Central, specialised websites and reference lists of selected articles. RESULTS: We found 406 papers, 60 papers were retrieved for further evaluation, based on prespecified criteria. Seventeen instruments that were specifically designed to measure MI or aspects of MI were identified. Fifteen papers met all inclusion criteria, and reported on seven instruments that assess potential <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> of the interactive MI process. The capability of these instruments to measure potential <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> in detail and as a part of the interactive MI process varies considerably. Three of these instruments measure one or more potential <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> in a reliable and valid way. CONCLUSION: To identify the potential <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> in the interactive MI process, a combination of the SCOPE (which measures potential technical <b>active</b> <b>ingredients)</b> and the GROMIT or the global ratings of the MISC 2 (to measure potential relational ingredients) seems favourable...|$|R

5|$|The major {{turning point}} for {{salicylate}} medicines came in 1763, when a letter from English chaplain Edward Stone was read {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society, describing the dramatic power of willow bark extract to cure ague—an ill-defined constellation of symptoms, including intermittent fever, pain, and fatigue, that primarily referred to malaria. Inspired by the doctrine of signatures to search for a treatment for agues near the brackish waters that were known to cause it, Stone had tasted the bark of a willow tree in 1758 and noticed an astringency reminiscent of the standard—and expensive—ague cure of Peruvian bark. He collected, dried, and powdered a substantial amount of willow bark, and over the next five years tested it on a number of people sick with fever and agues. In his letter, Stone reported consistent success, describing willow extract's effects as identical to Peruvian bark, though a little less potent. (In fact, the <b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> of Peruvian bark was quinine, which attacked the infectious cause of malaria, while the <b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> of willow extract, salicin, relieved the symptoms of malaria but could not cure it.) Stone's letter (mistakenly attributed to Edmund rather than Edward Stone) was printed in Philosophical Transactions, and by the end of the 18th century willow was gaining popularity as an inexpensive substitute for Peruvian bark.|$|E

30|$|Terbuthylazine and hexazinone are the {{two most}} {{commonly}} used <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> for post-plant control of forestry weeds within New Zealand’s planted forests as they {{have been found to be}} most effective amongst the available <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> (Rolando et al. 2013). These two chemicals are important tools for vegetation management because they have some residual herbicidal activity unlike some other herbicides (e.g. glyphosate). This property is important for the control of weeds that may germinate from the seed bank. Both of these <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> were previously on the FSC list of highly hazardous pesticides between 2007 and 2015 and were unable to be used in FSC-certified forests without a derogation (FSC 2014). These <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> were on the FSC list due to the potential for terbuthylazine to bio-accumulate, and for the water solubility and persistence of hexazinone. These <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> are now available for use in FSC-certified forests due to a change in the criteria for rating herbicides as highly hazardous. However, there is still uncertainty surrounding the environmental fate of these <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> in the New Zealand planted forest environment particularly on soils that are vulnerable to leaching. To maintain best management practices, there is a need to understand the potential for <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> to move off-site into water bodies in the New Zealand planted forest environment. The movement down the soil profile and persistence on-site of these <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> has been tested in the field on a Pumice Soil (Garrett et al. 2015), which constitutes 25  % of New Zealand’s planted forest soils and is considered vulnerable to herbicide movement due to the low organic carbon concentration of the soil (Watt et al. 2010). However, field studies examining movement of these <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> in New Zealand planted forests have not been undertaken for other soil types.|$|R

5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (<b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the <b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E
