5|$|CENIPA {{concluded}} that the ExcelAire pilots <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the accident with, among others, their failure to recognize that their transponder was inadvertently switched off, thereby disabling the collision avoidance system on both aircraft, {{as well as their}} overall insufficient training and preparation.|$|E
5|$|Glacial meltwaters <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the {{formation}} and development {{of many of the}} caves in the limestone area. Wild animal herds roamed the area, and their remains have been found in several of the local caves.|$|E

5|$|Magnus's kingship {{has been}} downplayed in later history {{partly due to}} his short tenure, and because {{most of it was}} {{together}} with his brother. The subsequently long reign of Olaf <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> overshadow Magnus's reign, combined {{with the fact that the}} later Norwegian royal dynasties only descended (or claimed descent) from Olaf.|$|E

5|$|The era of import {{substitution}} ended in 1976, {{but at the}} same time growing government spending, large wage increases and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through the 1980s. The measures enacted during the last dictatorship <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the huge foreign debt by the late 1980s, which became equivalent to three-fourths of the GNP.|$|E

5|$|The theorem {{is named}} after one of its discoverers, Toshikazu Kawasaki. However, several others <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> its discovery, and it is {{sometimes}} called the Kawasaki–Justin theorem or Husimi's theorem after other contributors, Jacques Justin and Kôdi Husimi.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{knowledge}} about the capability of radar to create an effective centralized early warning system <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the over-reliance on the self-defense capabilities of bombers. However Hansell also argued that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run. He surmised that had radar been a factor in making doctrine, many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly, inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in World War II and essential {{to the creation of the}} United States Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Abingdon Boys School {{has contributed}} to the soundtracks of {{numerous}} anime and video game series and several tribute albums.

5|$|As {{the largest}} Canadian cities {{grew in the}} 1950s and 1960s, the volume of mail passing through the country's postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and {{tens of billions of}} items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. New technology that allowed mail to be delivered faster <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail.|$|E
5|$|Augustin Pyramus de Candolle also spelled Augustin Pyrame de Candolle (4 February 1778 – 9 September 1841) was a Swiss botanist. René Louiche Desfontaines {{launched}} de Candolle's botanical {{career by}} recommending him at an herbarium. Within {{a couple of}} years de Candolle had established a new genus, and he went on to document hundreds of plant families and create a new natural plant classification system. Although de Candolle's main focus was botany, he <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> related fields such as phytogeography, agronomy, paleontology, medical botany, and economic botany.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1940s and the 1970s, {{the city}} saw {{significant}} growth in suburban areas from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service {{in large numbers}} seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, {{a part of the}} local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{from new}} superpredators, such as macropredatory sperm whales which {{appeared}} in the Miocene, and killer whales and great white sharks in the Pliocene, may have <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the decline and extinction of megalodon. Fossil records indicate that the new whale-eating cetaceans commonly occurred at high latitudes during the Pliocene, indicating that they could cope with the increasingly prevalent cold water temperatures; but they also occurred in the tropics (e.g., Orcinus sp. in South Africa).|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{he worked}} on the Manhattan Project that {{developed}} the first atomic bombs. In 1949, he began developing his theory that, contrary to what was then believed, not all atomic nuclei are spherical. His ideas were later tested and confirmed by Aage Bohr's and Ben Mottelson's experiments. He <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the scientific understanding of X-rays and participated in the United States Atomic Energy Commission and naval research projects.|$|E
