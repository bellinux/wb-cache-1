5|$|British ornithologist David Lack {{considered}} that the Puerto Rican <b>amazon</b> had {{evolved from the}} Hispaniolan <b>amazon</b> (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed <b>amazon</b> (A. agilis) of Jamaica and the Puerto Rican <b>amazon.</b> Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within {{members of the same}} species. The research concluded that the Puerto Rican <b>amazon</b> may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis. Recent phylogenetic studies show that the Puerto Rican <b>amazon</b> is more closely related to the Hispaniolan <b>amazon</b> and the Cuban <b>amazon</b> than to the black-billed <b>amazon.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the American ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman {{supported}} {{the idea that}} the early accounts were a solid basis for the Guadeloupe amazon's existence. They also reported a tibiotarsus bone found on the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie-Galante, an island in the Guadeloupe region, which they found {{similar to that of the}} imperial <b>amazon,</b> but slightly shorter. Since Maria-Galante shares many modern bird species with Guadeloupe, they suggested that the bone belonged to the Guadeloupe <b>amazon,</b> and assigned it to A. cf. violacea (which implies the classification is uncertain). In 2004, Patricia Ottens-Wainright and colleagues pointed out that the early descriptions of the Guadeloupe <b>amazon</b> did not clearly determine whether it was a unique species or the same species as the imperial <b>amazon.</b> Ornithologists Storrs Olson and Edgar Maíz, writing in 2008, felt that the Guadeloupe <b>amazon</b> was probably the same as the imperial <b>amazon.</b> In contrast the English ornithologist Julian P. Hume wrote in 2012 that though the <b>amazon</b> species of Guadeloupe and Martinique were based on accounts rather than physical remains, he found it likely they once existed, having been mentioned by trusted observers, and on zoogeographical grounds. In 2015, the ecologists Monica Gala and Arnaud Lenoble stated that an ulna bone from Maria-Galante, which had been assigned to the extinct Lesser Antillean macaw (Ara guadeloupensis) by Williams and Steadman in 2001 and to the imperial <b>amazon</b> by Olson and Maiz in 2008, instead belonged to the Guadeloupe <b>amazon.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Amazons</b> {{is a young}} {{board game}} with simple rules and a high {{branching}} factor, {{which makes it a}} suitable test-bed for planning research. This paper considers the computational complexity of <b>Amazons</b> puzzles and restricted <b>Amazons</b> endgames. We first prove the NPcompleteness of the Hamilton circuit problem for cubic subgraphs of the integer grid. This result is then used to show that solving <b>Amazons</b> puzzles is an NP-complete task and determining the winner of simple <b>Amazons</b> endgames is NP-equivalent...|$|R

5|$|Another {{concern is}} the risk of {{clearing}} rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for sugarcane production, such as the <b>Amazon</b> rainforest, the Pantanal or the Cerrado. Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7% of sugarcane plantations are located at least 2,000km from the <b>Amazon,</b> and expansion during the last 25 years {{took place in the}} Center-South region, also far away from the <b>Amazon</b> rainforest, the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest. In São Paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands. The impact assessment commissioned by the Dutch government supported this argument.|$|E

40|$|<b>Amazons</b> is a {{board game}} which {{combines}} elements of Chess and Go. It has become popular in recent years, {{and has served}} as a useful platform for both game-theoretic study and AI games research. Buro [2] showed that simple <b>Amazons</b> endgames are NP-equivalent, leaving the complexity of the general case as an open problem. We settle this problem, by showing that deciding the outcome of an n×n <b>Amazons</b> position is PSPACE-hard. We give a reduction from one of the PSPACE-complete two-player formula games described by Schaefer [9]. Since the number of moves in an <b>Amazons</b> game is polynomially bounded (unlike Chess and Go), <b>Amazons</b> is in PSPACE. It is thus on a par with other twoplayer, bounded-move, perfect-information games such as Hex [3, 8], Othello [5], and Kayles [9]. Our construction also provides an alternate proof that simple <b>Amazons</b> endgames are NPequivalent. Our reduction uses a number of <b>amazons</b> polynomial in the input formula length; a remaining open problem is the complexity of <b>Amazons</b> when only a constant number of <b>amazons</b> is used. ...|$|R

50|$|Once {{in their}} city, Heracles {{and his men}} drugged the Amazons' wine and took them prisoner. After the theft of Hippolyta's Golden Girdle and abuse and rape of the <b>Amazons,</b> Hippolyta cried out to Athena to help them escape their bonds.

Hippolyta freed the other <b>Amazons.</b> The <b>Amazons,</b> however, were filled with hate and the desire for revenge. Breaking Hippolyta's oath to Athena, the <b>Amazons</b> began slaughtering their captors, (Heracles and his general Theseus had left).|$|R
5|$|Command of the <b>Amazon</b> {{then passed}} to Captain Samuel Sutton, who was succeeded the {{following}} year by Captain William Parker.

On one occasion in December 1804 Nelson ordered Parker to bring a consignment of live bullocks to supply the fleet off Toulon. The <b>Amazon</b> was a notably smart ship, and had just been repainted, so presumably the instruction to convert his ship into a floating farmyard was not received with much enthusiasm. Parker duly returned with a shipment, prompting Nelson to enquire with gentle humour 'Well, Parker, of course you would not dirty the <b>Amazon</b> for much for anything; have you brought a dozen and a half, or a dozen?' Parker had in fact brought sixty bullocks and thirty sheep, prompting Nelson to promise a reward for his good service.|$|E

5|$|During {{the process}} of {{catching}} the commercialized fish, the <b>Amazon</b> river dolphins {{get caught in the}} nets and exhaust themselves until they die, or the local fishermen deliberately kill the dolphins that become entangled in their nets. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish, the piracatinga (Calophysus macropterus). The use of the <b>Amazon</b> river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back from 2000. The increasing consumption demand by the local inhabitants and Colombia for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the <b>Amazon</b> river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions.|$|E

5|$|For {{her maiden}} voyage in June 1861, <b>Amazon</b> sailed to Five Islands {{to take on}} a cargo of timber for passage across the Atlantic to London.

5|$|Greenway {{suggested}} {{that both the}} French settlers and their slaves ate the Guadeloupe <b>amazon,</b> as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related imperial <b>amazon</b> survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas Guadeloupe is less mountainous and more suitable for farming, and has a larger population of humans. Because of this, {{there would have been}} a greater pressure on the Guadeloupe <b>amazon,</b> and it appears to have become extinct by the end of the 18th century. The amazons still surviving on the West Indian islands are all endangered since they are trapped for the pet-trade, overhunted for food, and because of destruction of their habitat.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to attracting predators {{such as the}} <b>Amazon</b> river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the <b>Amazon</b> river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the <b>Amazon</b> River dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the nets and lines, it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.|$|E
