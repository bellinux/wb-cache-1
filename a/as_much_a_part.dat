25|$|The slave trade/Middle Passage {{was just}} <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> {{of life in}} the Atlantic as was the {{merchant}} shipping of goods. Many European powers had ties to the slaving trade by at least the eighteenth century; countries like Portugal, Sweden, Netherlands, France, and England all had outposts on the African coast. Slavers would conduct their business with the larger African tribes who would buy weapons from the Europeans and in turn use them to collect members of other tribes to sell to slave captains. Once {{in the hands of a}} slaver, the slave represented a substantial investment as Ian Baucom suggests, by the insuring of slaves purchased. Some European cities such as Liverpool would become successful from operating in this trade system, and would drive the free markets of slavery to handle as much business as was possible.|$|E

The Devi-Mahatmya is not the earliest literary fragment attesting to the existence of devotion to a goddess figure, states Thomas B.

500|$|In 1999, Rivera was {{selected}} for the All-Star team {{for a second time}} with 23saves and a 2.29ERA {{in the first half of}} the season. That summer, the Yankee Stadium scoreboard production staff began playing the song [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] by heavy metal band Metallica as Rivera's entrance music. Staff members selected the song after witnessing in the previous year's World Series how enthusiastically San Diego fans reacted to closer Trevor Hoffman entering games accompanied by AC/DC's [...] "Hells Bells". Although Rivera was indifferent about his entrance music, [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] soon became <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of his identity as a closer as his cutter did. After recording three blown saves and a 7.84ERA in July, he allowed just one earned run over his last 30appearances. He ended the season with a 1.83ERA and 45saves in 49opportunities, his first time leading the major leagues in saves. He received his first AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, an annual award for the league's best closer based on their statistics. In the 1999 World Series against the Braves, Rivera recorded a win and two saves, the second of which clinched the Yankees' championship title, his third overall. For his performance against Atlanta, he received the World Series MVP Award. Rivera finished 1999 by pitching 43consecutive scoreless innings in the regular season and postseason combined, and he placed third in voting for the AL Cy Young Award. After the season, he revealed tentative plans to retire and become a minister after playing four more seasons, though he backed off these plans the following year.|$|E

The Sydney Morning Herald described the cover as a [...] "violence-glorifying, women-denigrating sleeve". The woman on the cover was Darlene Ortiz, Ice-T's girlfriend at the time. In 1989, the Los Angeles Daily News stated that: [...] "Darlene has become <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of Ice-T's image as gangs, guns and boom boxes." [...] Ortiz originally met Ice-T when she was 17, stating she was [...] "totally smitten and ready to settle down" [...] and that she [...] "would've done whatever he asked". Of her appearance on the album cover she explained that it was [...] "like nothing" [...] for her. To prepare for the cover, Ortiz bought five different bathing suits and went to the photo studio with Glen E. Friedman. Ortiz felt comfortable with the sawed-off shotgun, stating that she got her first gun when she was 11 years old and that she thought [...] "it would be a powerful statement to see a woman holding a gun". Ice-T chose the bathing suit and the red high heel pumps and earrings for the cover. Clothing on the cover was shared between shots. Ortiz and DJ Evil E both shared the gold bracelet for the photo shoot and Ice-T and DJ Evil E wore the same Rolex. Ortiz also appeared in music videos for the singles from Power – [...] "I'm Your Pusher" [...] and [...] "High Rollers".|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} was widely {{acclaimed}} in publications such as Publishers Weekly, MTV, Ain't it Cool News, Complex magazine, Comic Book Resources, iFanboy and ComicsAlliance; they all praised Vaughan's ability to incorporate elements of different genres, establishing the vast setting and mythology, and introducing characters that engaged the reader. Multiple reviewers likened {{the book to}} a combination of sci-fi/fantasy works such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings and classic works of literature such as Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and the New Testament. AICN singled-out the use of the newborn Hazel as a lone individual to chronicle large-scale events from a past perspective, and Alex Zalben of MTV Geek remarking that he could hear a John Williams score as he read the book. Multiple reviewers also lauded Vaughan for beginning the story with Hazel's birth rather than hurting the story's pace with copious exposition of Alana and Marko's initial meeting and courtship. Todd Allen of The Beat approved of the book's unique [...] "flavor", singling out the characters' motivations, the immersiveness of its surrealist setting, the strangeness of the story's various oddities and the timely nature of the story's political undertones. Both Alex Evans of Weekly Comic Book Review and P. S. Hayes of Geeks of Doom called the series a [...] "classic"; Hayes also praised Image Comics for publishing such an [...] "original" [...] series. Also widely praised was Fiona Staples' artwork, which was characterized as [...] "glorious", with Zalben predicting that readers would [...] "fall head over heels in love" [...] with it, and Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources positively comparing it to that of Leinil Francis Yu, specifically her use of delicate lines to frame characters with large, bold figures and Staples' mixture of the familiar and the foreign together in her character designs to create a visually cohesive universe. AICN singled out Staples' handling of grand, sweeping space shots and other genre trappings, as well as her mastery of facial expressions – which AICN felt was perfectly suited to Vaughan's subtle dialogue. Todd Allen of The Beat wrote that Staples' landscapes at times play <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in the story as the foreground.|$|E

5000|$|Many of the South Korean {{children}} adopted internationally, {{grew up in}} white, upper or middle-class homes. In {{the beginning}} adoptive families were often told by agencies and social workers to assimilate their children and make them <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the new culture, thinking that this would override concerns about ethnic identity and origin. Many Korean adoptees grew up not knowing about other children like themselves. This has changed in recent years with social services now encouraging parents and using home studies to encourage prospective adoptive parents {{to learn about the}} cultural influences of the country. With such works as [...] "Beyond Culture Camp" [...] which encourage the teaching of culture, there has been a large shift. Though, these materials may be given, not everyone may take advantage of them. Also, adoption agencies started to allow the adoption of South Koreans by people of color in the late 1990s to early 2000, and not just white people, including Korean-Americans. Such an example of this is the rapper GOWE, who is a Korean adopted into a Chinese family.|$|R

Just in front an old four-rail fence wandered across the deserted pasture, struggling against the blackberry vines, which grew profusely about it and seemed to be tugging at the lower rail to pull the old fence down to ruin. On either side it disappeared into thickets of birch and oak and pitch pine, planted, as were the blackberry vines, by birds that stopped to rest a moment on the old fence or to satisfy their curiosity. Stout young trees had crowded it aside and broken it. Here and there a leaning post was overgrown with woodbine. The rails were gray and moss-grown. Nature was trying hard to make it a bit of the landscape; it could not much longer retain its individuality. The wild things of the woods had long accepted it as theirs, though not quite as they accepted the vines and trees.|$|R

40|$|Energy {{supplies}} {{are central to}} human ecology and key to the sustainability of human communities, but the decline of fossil fuel resources is largely ignored in global environmental politics. Most political analysis of energy focuses on state-centered "energy security" while largely overlooking discourses of environmental or ecological security.
