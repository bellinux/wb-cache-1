In eliminating this costly procedure by masking the view to a slightly smaller area (98%) while also downspecifying the frame rate to 3 frames per second, the DSLR-A850 offers a camera with most of the benefits of the DSLR-A900 at a significant saving to the photographer.|$|E

SOMAP, a Screen Oriented Multiple <b>Alignment</b> <b>Procedure</b> {{was developed in the}} late 1980s on the VMS computer operating system, used a monochrome text-based VT100 video terminal, and featured context-sensitive help and pulldown menus some time before these were standard operating system features.|$|E
50|$|A trimmer is a {{miniature}} adjustable electrical component. It {{is meant to}} be set correctly when installed in some device, and never seen or adjusted by the device's user. Trimmers can be variable resistors (potentiometers), variable capacitors, or trimmable inductors. They are common in precision circuitry like A/V components, and may need to be adjusted when the equipment is serviced. Trimpots are often used to initially calibrate equipment after manufacturing. Unlike many other variable controls, trimmers are mounted directly on circuit boards, turned with a small screwdriver and rated for many fewer adjustments over their lifetime. Trimmers like trimmable inductors and trimmable capacitors are usually found in superhet radio and television receivers, in the intermediate frequency (IF), oscillator and radio frequency (RF) circuits. They are adjusted into the right position during the <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> of the receiver.|$|E

30|$|Part of {{our present}} {{knowledge}} about electron beam damage on plastic sections derives from studies relying on tracking fiducial markers [8]. It therefore {{comes as no surprise}} that the same information is inherently contained in any EMT process whose <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> shares the same principles. In fact, the overall quality of a reconstruction technique depends on how well the <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> compensates for sample deformation, among other issues.|$|E

40|$|The {{positions}} of the silicon modules of the CMS tracker will be known to O(100 μm) from survey measurements, mounting precision and the hardware alignment system. However, in order to fully exploit {{the capabilities of the}} tracker, these positions need to be known to a precision of a few μm. Only a track-based <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> can reach this required precision. Such an <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> is a major challenge given that about 50. 000 geometry constants need to be measured. Making use of the novel χ^ 2 minimization program Millepede II an alignment strategy has been developed in which all detector components are aligned simultaneously and all correlations between their position parameters taken into account. Tracks from different sources such as Z^ 0 decays and cosmic ray muons, plus information about the mechanical structure of the tracker, and initial position uncertainties have been used as input for the <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure.</b> A proof of concept of this alignment strategy is demonstrated using simulated data...|$|E

40|$|National audienceQuantitative {{measurements}} of restoration quality in blind deconvolution are {{complicated by the}} necessity to compensate for opposite shifts of reconstructed image and point-spread function. <b>Alignment</b> <b>procedures</b> mentioned for this purpose in the literature are sometimes not exactly enough specified; alignment-free approaches sometimes do {{not take into account}} the full variability of possible shifts. We investigate by experiments on a simple test case the errors induced by interpolation-based <b>alignment</b> <b>procedures.</b> We propose a new method for MSE/PSNR measurement of image pairs involving non-integer displacements that is based on a superresolution approach. We introduce an innocence assumption in order to keep deviations that can be explained by shifted sampling grids out of the error measurement. In our test case, the new measurement procedure reduces the variations in MSE/PSNR measurements substantially, creating the hope that it can be used for valid comparisons of blind deconvolution methods...|$|R
40|$|Confocal {{fluorescence}} microscopy has been seldom applied to air-liquid interfaces due to technical difficulties. Satellite lines of an excitation laser beam {{can be used}} as an inherent reference for a confocal microscope to align and calibrate the setup. This strategy is especially useful and important to a liquid surface, and makes it possible to observe very weak fluorescence without time-consuming <b>alignment</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

40|$|The plasma-beam <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> earlier {{developed}} for the alignment of nematic liquid crystals is successfully extended to ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLC). The highly uniform alignment of the “chevron” structure (before electrical treatment of FLC cells) and “quasi bookshelf” structure (after the electrical treatment) are realized. The contrast of bistable switching larger than 350 : 1 is achieved. This makes the non-contact plasma-beam <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> especially attractive for high-contrast bistable LCDs on an LCOS base, particularly used in PDA and e-books. Fast switching and realization of gray scale in the plasma-beam aligned FLC cellsmakes this technique also promising for full-color displays including color LCD TV...|$|E
30|$|For the {{structure}} space, an existing tree edit distance is used that is obtained through a sequence <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> and the minimization {{of the cost}} for transforming one tree into the other, allowing deletions, insertions and relabeling of nodes as edit operations [54]. Similarly, the distance measure for the transition states starts with an <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure.</b> This can either {{be done on the}} graph representation or a unique string form of the transition state [65]. Edit operations include substitution of atoms, rearrangement of electron re-ordering, substitution of bonds and increase/decrease of transition state size. The cost of the edit operations rises in this order, atom substitution thus being the cheapest operation. The total cost for transforming one transition state to the other is then minimized.|$|E

40|$|We {{show how}} a basic {{pairwise}} <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> {{can be improved}} to more accurately align conserved structural regions, by using variable, position-dependent gap penalties that depend on secondary structure and by taking the consensus {{of a number of}} suboptimal alignments. These improvements, which are novel for structural alignment, are direct analogs of what is possible with normal sequence alignment. They are feasible for us since our basic structural <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure,</b> unlike others, is so similar to normal sequence alignment. We further present preliminary results that show how our procedure can be generalized to produce a multiple alignment of a family of structures. Our approach is based on finding a "median " structure from doing all possible pairwise alignments and then aligning everything to it...|$|E
