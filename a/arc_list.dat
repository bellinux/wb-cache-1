40|$|This paper {{describes}} how directed graphs (digraphs) {{have been used}} for evaluating the total efficiency of a complex Plant that has been designed for the combined production of food, heat, cooling, and electrical energy. This task required three basic activities. Firstly, the overall plant scheme was studied in detail in order to identify the elementary blocks, each one having its own efficiency value. Each block corresponded to a single node of the digraph. Secondly, the system had to be considered as a whole. The development of the global scheme required the identification of all the directed arcs that were corresponding to the energy flows. Finally, a new algorithm for the evaluation of the overall efficiency was applied to the resultant digraph. This method allowed us to obtain the solution in algebraic symbolic form, automatically, provided that the digraph <b>arc</b> <b>list</b> was supplied to the developed PC code, together with the flow repartitions. The algorithm is quite robust and could also be used in systems with flow recirculation...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the application of}} therapeutic jurisprudence principles {{in the context of}} the recent innovation of mental health courts, which are designed to enhance the “wellbeing” of mentally impaired offenders. It is argued that mental health courts have the potential to address the criminalisation of mentally impaired offenders by facilitating positive therapeutic outcomes and diverting mentally impaired offenders into treatment. In particular, mental health courts can facilitate successful treatment outcomes by minimising the use of coercion and ensuring that mentally impaired offenders are accorded a “voice” and treated with dignity and respect. Accordingly, the mental health court seeks to advance more integrative and holistic approaches to treatment which ideally should be informed by evidence-based practice. Ultimately, however, the success of any therapeutic intervention is contingent on mental health courts “brokering” relationships with community service providers in order to facilitate accessibility to treatment. The recent introduction of the Victorian Assessment and Referral Court (<b>ARC)</b> <b>List,</b> which aims to consolidate the management of mentally impaired offenders into a single court, is also briefly examined as a timely and promising initiative in curbing the “revolving door” phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|Analogical {{reasoning}} is frequently used in acquisition of mathematical concepts. Concrete representation {{used to teach}} mathematics are essentially analogs of mathematical concepts, and {{it is argued that}} analogies enter into mathematical concept acquisition in numerous other ways as well. According to Gentner's theory, analogies entail a structure-preserving mapping from a base or source to the ta:get. Although concrete aids can provide valuable assistance to concept acquisition, their oft-noted failure to provide the anticipated benefits {{has been a source of}} some puzzlement. It is suggested that the reason for the failure may be the processing loads imposed by structure mapping. Some representative mathematical concepts are examined, together with typical concrete representations, and the nature of the processing loads analyzed. These loads can be reduced by recoding concepts into more abstract form, but it is argued that structure mapping also plays a role in abstraction.

Network design {{problems}} usually {{include the}} selection of nodes and <b>arcs</b> from <b>lists</b> of potential sets to accomplish certain desirable properties. Foremost is often the capability to accommodate the flow demands at a reasonable cost. In many applications it is also imperative to have built-in reliability or survivability of the network. Delays of traffic are undesirable since it affects Quality of Service (QoS) to clients of the network. It is seldom possible to start a design for a new network and {{have the luxury of}} designing topology as well as the optimal flow(routing). In this dissertation we consider the construction of a network optimization system. This system may be used in the planning of network mesh topologies and link capacities to avoid costly designs and congestion or to give advice on congestion relief in existing networks. This is done by selecting parts of a network that may be prone to congestion and model this part by using mixed integer programming techniques. These models are then solved by using a software product called CPLEX and various facilities are built into the decision support system to allow the decision maker to experiment with some topological and flow requirement changes.

In previous studies, arc fault signatures have been compared to string noise and frequency-dependant attenuation through PV modules has been quantified. In this paper, a frequency response analyzer {{was used to measure}} radio frequency (RF) propagation through arrays of varying irradiance and size. Irradiance did not affect module frequency response, but the length of unshielded wiring significantly affected the frequency response of the system above 100 kHz due to RF effects.

Currently there is little experimental or empirical research into {{the behavior of the}} arcing frequencies through PV components despite the potential for modules and other PV components to filter or attenuate arcing signatures that could render the arc detector ineffective. To model AC arcing signal propagation along PV strings, the well-studied DC diode models were found to inadequately capture the behavior of high frequency arcing signals. Instead dynamic equivalent circuit models of PV modules were required to describe the impedance for alternating currents in modules. The nonlinearities present in PV cells resulting from irradiance, temperature, frequency, and bias voltage variations make modeling these systems challenging. Linearized dynamic equivalent circuits were created for multiple PV module manufacturers and module technologies. The equivalent resistances and capacitances for the modules were determined using impedance spectroscopy with no bias voltage and no irradiance. The equivalent circuit model was employed to evaluate modules having irradiance conditions that could not be measured directly with the instrumentation. Although there was a wide range of circuit component values, the complex impedance model does not predict filtering of arc fault frequencies in PV strings for any irradiance level. Experimental results with no irradiance agree with the model and show nearly no attenuation for 1 Hz to 100 kHz input frequencies...|$|R
