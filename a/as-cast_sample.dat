40|$|Influence of heat {{treatments}} on the hardness property of inoculated {{grey cast iron}} was investigated in this study. To this end, some inoculated grey cast iron specimens with 0. 2 % ferrosilicon was produced from an automobile (<b>as-cast)</b> <b>sample</b> by casting, and the chemical compositions of both the automobile and inoculated specimen were determined. Thereafter, the specimens were subjected to annealing, normalising and tempering heat treatment processes. Microstructural characteristics and hardness property were investigated using standard procedures and equipment. Results of the findings revealed that the grain sizes and phases of the inoculated and non-inoculated specimens were influence by all the heat treatment processes considered. In addition, the average Rockwell hardness (HRA) values of the annealed, normalised and tempered specimens in inoculated and non inoculated conditions are in the respective order of 41. 9 and 52. 8; 43. 1 and 54. 6; 40. 7 and 50. 9, and {{when compared with the}} corresponding values of 45. 9 and 58. 9 for the <b>as-cast</b> <b>sample,</b> the hardness property of the inoculated and non- inoculated heat treated specimens are relatively lower...|$|E

The as-cast ingot was homogenized, and then hot-rolled with total thickness reduction of 70 %. Further annealing treatment {{was carried out}} on the hot-rolled sample.

An extensive study is made to analyze the impact of pure lanthanum on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC) alloys at high temperatures. Different compositions are tested; the temperature applied for the isothermal aging is 150 C, and aging times of 10 h, 25 h, 50 h, 100 h, and 200 h are studied. Optical microscopy with cross-polarized light is used to follow the grain size, which is refined from 8 mm to 1 mm for <b>as-cast</b> <b>samples</b> and is maintained during thermal aging. Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) present inside the bulk Sn matrix affect the mechanical properties of the SAC alloys. Due to high-temperature exposure, these IMCs grow and hence their impact on mechanical properties becomes more significant. This growth is followed by scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy is used for elemental mapping of each phase. A significant refinement in the average size of IMCs of up to 40 % is identified for the <b>as-cast</b> <b>samples,</b> and the coarsening rate of these IMCs is slowed by up to 70 % with no change in the interparticle spacing. Yield stress and tensile strength are determined through tensile testing at 20 C for <b>as-cast</b> <b>samples</b> and after thermal aging at 150 C for 100 h and 200 h.

The arc melted alloy was divided into three samples, two of which were separately quartz-sealed under vacuum and heated to 1000 °C for 1 h; one of these samples was quenched and the other furnace-cooled to ambient temperature. The crystal structures of the samples were studied via X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy. Hydrogenation/dehydrogenation characteristics were investigated using a Sievert apparatus.

The samples were ribbons about 20 thick and their fully amorphous state was verified by X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis. The surface morphology, precise composition {{and the distribution of}} components were studied with a Scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attachment. The properties selected were the melting temperature (T_m), the low temperature specific heat (LTSH), the magnetic susceptibility χ_exp and the Young^,s modulus (E). Whereas LTSH and χ_exp were measured for the <b>as-cast</b> <b>samples,</b> E was measured both for <b>as-cast</b> <b>samples</b> and relaxed samples (after a short anneal close to the glass transition temperature). The LTSH showed that the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N_ 0 (E_F), decreases with increasing x, whereas the Debye temperature (θ_D) increases with x. This is similar to what is observed in binary and ternary amorphous alloys of early transition metals (TE) with late transition metals (TL) and indicates that N_ 0 (E_F) is dominated by the d-electrons of the TE. The LTSH also showed the absence of superconductivity down to 1. 8 K and indicated the emergence of the Boson peak above 4 K in all alloys. The free-electron like paramagnetic contribution to χ_exp also decreases with x, whereas E, like θ_D, increases with x, indicating enhanced interatomic bonding on addition of Ni.

A two sample t-test failed to prove a significant difference in the microhardness values of the two separate treatments. With no conclusions being able to be drawn from the hardness data, metallographic samples of each treatment were produced to examine the microstructure of the material. Both samples showed that the B 4 C particles were not homogeneously distributed; there were highly concentrated regions of B 4 C particulates. In addition, both were highly porous.

In our study of the Hall effect we determine a metallic carrier density for all samples and a temperature dependence of the Hall constant which is inconsistent with the Skew scattering prediction. The magnetoresistive response is very small and characteristic for spin disorder scattering, suggesting that overall the resistivity is controlled mostly by nonmagnetic scattering processes. We discuss possible sources for the temperature and field dependence of the transport properties, in particular with respect to quantum criticality and electronic localization effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{spheroidal}} graphite (SG) cast iron fractomechanical response {{varies with the}} test temperature and with the microstructure parameters. In the present paper, we analyze this variation performing fractomechanical tests in a temperature range from - 40 °C to + 20 °C, doing also Charpy and tensile tests for material characterization. The tests were carried out on <b>as-cast</b> <b>samples</b> and heat treated samples to obtain an ADI grade 1. In both cases, we studied samples taken from two well differentiated "Y" block sizes. The results obtained show that, for the chemical composition analyzed, both castings have a fractomechanical response decrease as the temperature diminishes. Besides, the block size enlargement produce a deterioration of the mechanical properties (the fracture toughness, mainly), for both castings...|$|R
