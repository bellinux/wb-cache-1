5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles. Choosing an orientation for a forest produces {{a special kind}} of directed <b>acyclic</b> graph called a polytree. However there are many other kinds of directed <b>acyclic</b> graph that are not formed by orienting the edges of an undirected <b>acyclic</b> graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an <b>acyclic</b> orientation, an assignment of a direction for its edges that makes it into a directed <b>acyclic</b> graph. To emphasize that DAGs are {{not the same thing as}} directed versions of undirected <b>acyclic</b> graphs, some authors call them <b>acyclic</b> directed graphs or <b>acyclic</b> digraphs.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, every {{directed}} <b>acyclic</b> graph has a topological ordering. Therefore, {{this property}} {{can be used}} as an alternative definition of the directed <b>acyclic</b> graphs: they are exactly the graphs that have topological orderings.|$|E
5|$|Directed <b>acyclic</b> graphs {{representations}} of partial orderings have many applications in scheduling for systems of tasks with ordering constraints.|$|E
5|$|For <b>acyclic</b> {{substrates}} {{the reaction}} yields the thermodynamic E-olefin product exclusively.|$|E
5|$|In compilers, {{straight}} line code (that is, sequences of statements without loops or conditional branches) may {{be represented by}} a DAG describing the inputs and outputs {{of each of the}} arithmetic operations performed within the code. This representation allows the compiler to perform common subexpression elimination efficiently. At a higher level of code organization, the <b>acyclic</b> dependencies principle states that the dependencies between modules or components of a large software system should form a directed <b>acyclic</b> graph.|$|E
5|$|In {{directed}} planar graphs, simple directed cycles are dual to directed cuts (partitions of the vertices {{into two}} subsets such that all edges go in one direction, from one subset to the other). Strongly oriented planar graphs (graphs whose underlying undirected graph is connected, {{and in which}} every edge belongs to a cycle) are dual to directed <b>acyclic</b> graphs in which no edge belongs to a cycle. To put this another way, the strong orientations of a connected planar graph (assignments of directions {{to the edges of}} the graph that result in a strongly connected graph) are dual to <b>acyclic</b> orientations (assignments of directions that produce a directed <b>acyclic</b> graph).|$|E
5|$|The first <b>acyclic</b> {{persistent}} carbene {{was reported}} in 1996, thus showing that a cyclic backbone was not necessary for their stability. Unlike the cyclic derivatives, the <b>acyclic</b> carbenes are flexible with respect to rotation of the bonds to the carbenic atom. By measuring the barrier to rotation of these bonds, {{the extent of their}} double bond character could be measured, and the ylidic nature of this carbene could be determined. Like the cyclic diaminocarbenes, unhindered variants tend to dimerise.|$|E
5|$|A {{directed}} <b>acyclic</b> graph {{may be used}} {{to represent}} a network of processing elements. In this representation, data enters a processing element through its incoming edges and leaves the element through its outgoing edges.|$|E
5|$|A graph {{that has}} a topological {{ordering}} cannot have any cycles, because the edge into the earliest vertex of a cycle {{would have to be}} oriented the wrong way. Therefore, every graph with a topological ordering is <b>acyclic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diaminocarbenes have {{diagnostic}} 13C NMR {{chemical shift}} values between 230–270 ppm for the carbenic atom. The X-ray structure of dihydroimidazole-2-ylidene shows a N-C-N bond angle of ca. 106°, whilst {{the angle of}} the <b>acyclic</b> carbene is 121°, both greater than those seen for imidazol-2-ylidenes.|$|E
5|$|Directed <b>acyclic</b> graphs {{may also}} be used as a compact {{representation}} of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed <b>acyclic</b> word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed <b>acyclic</b> graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie. A directed <b>acyclic</b> word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex.|$|E
5|$|Imidazol-2-ylidenes and dihydroimidazol-2-ylidenes, e.g. IMes, {{have been}} {{prepared}} by the deprotonation of the respective imidazolium and dihydroimidazolium salts. The <b>acyclic</b> carbenes and the tetrahydropyrimidinyl based carbenes were prepared by deprotonation using strong homogeneous bases.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{transitive}} closure, the transitive {{reduction is}} uniquely defined for DAGs. In contrast, for a directed graph {{that is not}} <b>acyclic,</b> there can {{be more than one}} minimal subgraph with the same reachability relation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{aromatic}} imidazol-2-ylidenes or triazol-5-ylidenes, these carbenes appear {{not to be}} thermodynamically stable, {{as shown}} by the dimerisation of some unhindered cyclic and <b>acyclic</b> examples. Studies suggest that these carbenes dimerise via acid catalysed dimerisation (as in the Wanzlick equilibrium).|$|E
5|$|A path in a {{directed}} graph {{can be described}} by a sequence of edges having the property that the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence {{is the same as}} the starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence; a path forms a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge. A directed <b>acyclic</b> graph is a {{directed graph}} that has no cycles.|$|E
5|$|For {{the same}} reason, the version {{history of a}} {{distributed}} revision control system generally has {{the structure of a}} directed <b>acyclic</b> graph, {{in which there is a}} vertex for each revision and an edge connecting pairs of revisions that were directly derived from each other. These are not trees in general due to merges.|$|E
5|$|Since {{oxygen and}} sulfur are divalent, steric {{protection}} of the carbenic centre is limited especially when the N-C-X unit {{is part of a}} ring. These <b>acyclic</b> carbenes have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 250–300 ppm for the carbenic carbon, further downfield than any other types of stable carbene. X-ray structures have shown N-C-X bond angles of ca. 104 ° and 109 ° respectively.|$|E
5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it <b>acyclic</b> with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E
5|$|Any {{directed}} graph {{may be made}} into a DAG by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set, a set of vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles. However, the smallest such set is NP-hard to find. An arbitrary {{directed graph}} may also be transformed into a DAG, called its condensation, by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single supervertex. When the graph is already <b>acyclic,</b> its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is the graph itself.|$|E
5|$|The closure problem {{takes as}} input a {{directed}} <b>acyclic</b> graph with weights on its vertices and seeks the minimum (or maximum) {{weight of a}} closure, a set of vertices with no outgoing edges. (The problem may be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity, but with no greater generality, because {{in this case it}} is equivalent to the same problem on the condensation of the graph.) It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Saegusa–Ito oxidation involves coordination of palladium to the enol olefin followed by loss of the silyl group and formation of an oxoallyl-palladium complex. β-hydride elimination yields the palladium hydride enone complex which upon reductive elimination yields the product along with acetic acid and Pd0. The reversibility of the elimination step allows equilibration, leading to the thermodynamic E-selectivity in <b>acyclic</b> substrates. It {{has been shown that}} the product can form a stable Pd0-olefin complex, which may be responsible for the difficulty with re-oxidation seen in catalytic variants of the reaction.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids are organic {{compounds}} containing amine (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, {{along with a}} side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements {{are found in the}} side chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways. They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side chain group type (aliphatic, <b>acyclic,</b> aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, amino acid residues form the second-largest component (water is the largest) of human muscles and other tissues. Beyond their role as residues in proteins, amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{same idea}} of using a DAG to {{represent}} a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram, a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions. In a binary decision diagram, each non-sink vertex is labeled {{by the name of}} a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1. The function value for any truth assignment to the variables is the value at the sink found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex, that at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex's variable. Just as directed <b>acyclic</b> word graphs {{can be viewed as a}} compressed form of tries, binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms of decision trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acyclic</b> analogs {{have also}} been reported. These analogs contain a 1,2-diaryl motif which {{corresponds}} to the 1,5-diaryl substituents of rimonabant. An example of an <b>acyclic</b> analog is taranabant (MK-0364) developed by Merck.|$|E
25|$|An <b>acyclic</b> well-handled WF-net {{is sound}} (G-sound).|$|E
25|$|<b>Acyclic</b> alkanes {{occur in}} nature in various ways.|$|E
25|$|An upward {{planar graph}} is a {{directed}} <b>acyclic</b> graph {{that can be}} drawn in the plane with its edges as non-crossing curves that are consistently oriented in an upward direction. Not every planar directed <b>acyclic</b> graph is upward planar, and it is NP-complete to test whether a given graph is upward planar.|$|E
25|$|A chain {{complex is}} called <b>acyclic</b> or an exact {{sequence}} if all its homology groups are zero.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} set of parents is a subset of {{the set of}} non-descendants because the graph is <b>acyclic.</b>|$|E
25|$|A Bayesian network, Bayes network, belief network, Bayes(ian) {{model or}} {{probabilistic}} directed <b>acyclic</b> graphical {{model is a}} probabilistic graphical model (a type of statistical model) that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed <b>acyclic</b> graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network {{can be used to}} compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases.|$|E
25|$|Layered graph drawing methods (often called Sugiyama-style drawing) {{are best}} suited for {{directed}} <b>acyclic</b> graphs or graphs that are nearly <b>acyclic,</b> such as the graphs of dependencies between modules or functions in a software system. In these methods, the nodes of the graph are arranged into horizontal layers using methods such as the Coffman–Graham algorithm, {{in such a way}} that most edges go downwards from one layer to the next; after this step, the nodes within each layer are arranged in order to minimize crossings.|$|E
25|$|The {{visualization}} of orders with Hasse diagrams has a straightforward generalization: instead of displaying lesser elements below greater ones, {{the direction of}} the order can also be depicted by giving directions to the edges of a graph. In this way, each order is seen to be equivalent to a directed <b>acyclic</b> graph, where the nodes are the elements of the poset and there is a directed path from a to b if and only if a ≤ b. Dropping the requirement of being <b>acyclic,</b> one can also obtain all preorders.|$|E
25|$|Some authors {{consider}} a spanning forest to be a maximal <b>acyclic</b> subgraph of the given graph, or equivalently a graph {{consisting of a}} spanning tree in each connected component of the graph.|$|E
25|$|T is <b>acyclic.</b> This can be {{expressed}} logically as the statement that there does not exist a nonempty subset C of T for which each vertex is incident to either zero or two edges of C.|$|E
25|$|Various cyclic amine {{groups can}} act as the basic moiety and potency stays {{relatively}} unchanged for example aryl piperazine, piperidine and morpholine. An <b>acyclic</b> tertiary amine is tolerated as the basic moiety but larger steric groups are less tolerated.|$|E
25|$|A phylogenetic {{network is}} not {{strictly}} speaking a tree, {{but rather a}} more general graph, or a directed <b>acyclic</b> graph {{in the case of}} rooted networks. They are used to overcome some of the limitations inherent to trees.|$|E
