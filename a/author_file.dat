40|$|Language {{provides}} an interesting lens {{to look at}} state-building processes because of its cross-cutting nature. For example, {{in addition to its}} symbolic value and appeal, a national language has other roles in the process, including: (a) becoming the primary medium of communication which permits the nation to function efficiently in its political and economic life, (b) promoting social cohesion, allowing the nation to develop a common culture, and (c) forming a primordial basis for self-determination. Moreover, because of its cross-cutting nature, language interventions are rarely isolated activities. Languages are adopted by speakers, taking root in and spreading between communities because they are legitimated by legislation, and then reproduced through institutions like the education and military systems. Pádraig Ó’ Riagáin (1997) makes a case for this observing that “Language policy is formulated, implemented, and accomplishes its results within a complex interrelated set of economic, social, and political processes which include, inter alia, the operation of other non-language state policies” (p. 45). In the Turkish case, its foundational role {{in the formation of the}} Turkish nation-state but its linkages to human rights issues raises interesting issues about how socio-cultural practices become reproduced through institutional infrastructure formation. This dissertation is a country-level case study looking at Turkey’s nation-state building process through the lens of its language and education policy development processes with a focus on the early years of the Republic between 1927 and 1970. This project examines how different groups self-identified or were self-identified (as the case may be) in official Turkish statistical publications (e. g., the Turkish annual statistical yearbooks and the population censuses) during that time period when language and ethnicity data was made publicly available. The overarching questions this dissertation explores include: 1. What were the geo-political conditions surrounding the development and influencing the Turkish government’s language and education policies? 2. Are there any observable patterns in the geo-spatial distribution of language, literacy, and education participation rates over time? In what ways, are these traditionally linked variables (language, literacy, education participation) problematic? 3. What do changes in population identifiers, e. g., language and ethnicity, suggest about the government’s approach towards nation-state building through the construction of a civic Turkish identity and institution building? Archival secondary source data was digitized, aggregated by categories relevant to this project at national and provincial levels and over the course of time (primarily between 1927 and 2000). The data was then re-aggregated into values that could be longitudinally compared and then layered on aspatial administrative maps. This dissertation contributes to existing body of social policy literature by taking an interdisciplinary approach in looking at the larger socio-economic contexts in which language and education policies are produced.

Therefore, we propose in this paper a new method for retrieving 3 D virtual worlds based on the semantics and the content.

To achieve the semantic method, we construct an ontology that describes virtual worlds in various aspects including their contents (3 D objects building a virtual world) and information about their contents (<b>authors,</b> <b>file</b> format, etc). This ontology is presented by OWL, the W 3 C recommended language. So as to extract desired 3 D scenes from the proposed database we use the SPARQL query language. We propose finally a shape based method for searching desired virtual worlds by content in this database. This method {{is based on a}} new distance (metric) that define the similarity between virtual worlds. This method is evaluated using the recall vs. precision curves...|$|R

Relatively unknown is the fact that cervical fractures or fracture-dislocations to restrained front seat occupants occur where no head contact was evidenced by both medical records and car inspection.

A review of the National Accident Severity Study (NASS) 80 - 88 file was also conducted, revealing more examples. Case capsule descriptions from the authors' files are also detailed along with examples of such injuries in infants and children in child restraints.
