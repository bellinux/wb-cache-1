5|$|Bradley's {{political}} career began in 1870, {{when he was}} elected prosecuting attorney of Garrard County. A Republican in the heavily Democratic Eighth District, Bradley was defeated by Milton J. Durham for <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. House of Representatives in 1872. In 1875, his party honored him with a nomination to serve in the U.S. Senate, even though he was too young to legally qualify for the office. Nevertheless, he received the vote of every Republican in the state legislature. The following year, he again lost to Durham for <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives, but received 3,000 more votes than any Republican candidate had ever received in that district. He refused his party's nomination for the Senate in 1878 and 1882, and declined a nomination for state attorney general in 1879 because of ill health.|$|E

5|$|Kiep {{became a}} member of the CDU in the fall of 1961, gaining <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> county council of Obertaunus in 1963. Following the 1965 federal election, he {{became a member}} of the Bundestag, winning a mandate in the Obertaunus constituency. He {{retained}} his seat in 1969 and 1972, this time as part of his party's electoral list in Hessen. In 1972, Kiep was one of only a few CDU parliamentarians who voted yes to the Basic Treaty (Grundlagenvertrag) between West and East Germany. Other supporters of Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik were Richard von Weizsäcker, Karl Carstens and Olaf von Wrangel. During the 1972 federal elections, Kiep was named as prospective Federal Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development in the shadow cabinet of Rainer Barzel. He left parliament on 24 February 1976 to join the state government in Lower Saxony. During his tenure as minister, he also held <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Landtag of Lower Saxony from 1978 to 1980. He regained <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bundestag following the 1980 election, entering through a place on the electoral list for Lower Saxony. In order to concentrate on his role as leading candidate in his home state of Hamburg, he once again left parliament on 26 April 1982.|$|E
5|$|A Democrat in a Whig district, Powell's {{political}} career {{began with an}} 1836 bid for <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky House of Representatives. He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his party affiliation to carry the election. This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured the surprise victory. Holloway apparently learned from his mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority. Six year later, Powell was chosen as a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket, supporting James K. Polk.|$|E

5|$|A Republican in a {{predominantly}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats in his canvasses for public office. His 1879 loss in an election for <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky Senate marked {{the first in a}} string of political defeats. He failed in bids to represent Kentucky's Fifth District in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1884, 1886, 1888, and 1892. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1884, 1888, 1892, 1904, 1908, and 1916. In 1897, {{he was a member of}} the executive committee at the national monetary conference in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he advocated a sound money position.|$|E
5|$|A Republican in a {{primarily}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats {{for public}} office, but was elected governor of Kentucky {{on his second}} attempt. Due to {{his handling of the}} Black Patch Tobacco Wars and his pardoning of several individuals involved in the assassination of Democratic governor William Goebel, Willson drew the ire of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. As a result, few of his proposed reforms were considered by the legislature. His term ended in 1911, and in 1914, he made an unsuccessful bid for <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Senate. Following this defeat, Willson retired to Louisville, where he died in 1931.|$|E

5|$|After being urged into {{politics}} by his uncle, Judge Roscoe Tartar, Cooper ran unopposed for <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky House of Representatives as a Republican in 1927. As {{a member of}} the House, he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson's unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a single vote. Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing injunctions to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.|$|E

5|$|As {{almost all}} of the ACT's {{population}} lives in Canberra, political trends for both areas are closely aligned. The ACT was given its first federal parliamentary representation in 1949, when it gained <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives, the Division of Australian Capital Territory. The ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory. In 1974, the ACT was allocated two Senate seats. In 1974, the House of Representatives seat was divided into two. A third was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 because of changes to the regional demographic distribution.|$|E
