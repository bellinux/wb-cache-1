One major criticism raised by rights holder representatives is concerns about its potential to reduce royalties paid by Australian schools. Under the current model, a statutory licence is negotiated, resulting in a payment administered by Copyright Agency Ltd (CAL) that [...] "equates to about $17 per school student per year or about $30 per tertiary student". Without this payment to authors CAL argues that [...] "there would be less Australian content on our screens, on our bookshelves and in our schools and universities." [...] On the other hand, the National Copyright Unit representing schools and TAFEs contend that {{a large portion of}} this payment relates either to material the author of which cannot be identified, or for materials for which royalty payments are not intended or appropriate. For example, in 2011 they noted that [...] "openly available webpages made up 81.4% of the total web and non web digital materials that were paid for," [...] (including Google Maps and dictionary.com) which resulted in the payment of millions of dollars for activities that would in other countries be considered as not <b>appropriate</b> for <b>remuneration.</b> In May 2017 Wikipedia displayed banners to Australian readers in support of the Productivity Commission's recommendation.|$|R

30|$|Crowd {{compensation}} {{depends on}} the incentives offered, which can be monetary or non-monetary. As {{the identity of the}} crowd is not stable over time, incentivising is challenging [16]. Compensation schemes based on the ‘cost-to-serve’ of a customer may be most appropriate [11]. Other value propositions could be added such as health benefits when soft modes, bikes for instance, are encouraged or because of improved local air quality. In the pilot project in Finland, novelty proved to be an important factor [7]. Furthermore, Mladenow et al. [2] state that many crowdsourcing projects are successful without any monetary compensation at all. All interviewed practitioners agreed on <b>appropriate</b> monetary <b>remuneration</b> of the crowd depending on the service executed. Some interviewees suggested additional non-monetary incentives, such as events to strengthen the crowd’s community feeling. This is in line with the suggestion by Mckinnon [46] to offer the crowd non-pecuniary factors to build critical mass. Although the crowd consists of external and uncontracted individuals, the learning curve argument was mentioned. This indicates the contradiction that logistics practitioners experience between a flexible database of crowd workers that can be employed depending on the exact need and a regular workforce that masters a specific logistics task or delivery route by repeating it. Both ways of task allocation can lead to cost-efficiency but they are difficult to combine.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Research {{suggests}} that personal motivation {{is a critical}} internal driving force that, if harnessed, can significantly improve an operator's productivity rate when working mobile plant and machinery. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the impact of personal motivation upon plant operator productivity (and examine those variables that stimulate personal motivational forces). Design/methodology/approach – To achieve this, an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed. The ANN's topology comprised a multilayer perceptron, with one hidden layer and three output classifications of “good”, “average”, and “poor” (productivity performance). During development of this model, a non-linear dynamic mapping function and metric were used to improve its classification accuracy. The model initially utilised 32 independent (input) variables identified from the literature such as: pay bonuses; relationships between work colleagues; promotion prospects; and job satisfaction. Findings – Subsequent analyses condensed these variables down to the five most significant (i. e. best motivational classifiers of operative productivity), these being: (v 2) receipt of payment for overtime, (v 11) job promotion potential, (v 22) a safe working environment, (v 24) variety of work activities, and (v 31) availability of flexible work patterns. Model accuracy when employing these most significant predictors was high at 87. 67 per cent. By testing on a hold out sample of original data, the developed model was validated as being reliable and robust. Originality/value – The main conclusion of the work is that operators' personal motivation can best be encouraged by paying attention to “personal satisfiers” and “security” aspects, with particular emphasis being given to work flexibility and variety, a safe work environment, and <b>appropriate</b> operator <b>remuneration.</b> By delivering and exploiting these variables, employers can improve plant productivity rates and, as a consequence, company profitability. ...|$|R

Participants: Fifteen GPs in urban, rural and remote practice. Main outcome measures: Self-reported roles {{in the management of}} CRC patients and factors influencing these roles. Results: All GPs, regardless of location of practice, played a role in diagnosis, referral, postoperative care, psychosocial counselling, follow up and palliative care.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of financial incentives is considered {{in relation to}} findings on response bias. Three general patterns of response bias are discussed: effects of elapsed time between the event and the inter-view, the importance or salience of the event for the person, and social desirability effects. The major interpretation is that the biases are associated with patterns of respondent motivation. A model of response problems and three types of respondent motivation are discussed. Incentives, especially monetary rewards, are described iii this framework. It is concluded that payment to respondents can be effective but only if used properly and an <b>appropriate</b> amount chosen. <b>Remuneration</b> presents more complex issues than are usually anticipated by the researcher. Rather than discuss specific effects of financial incentives on survey responses, we propose to consider the issue of incentives in somewhat broader terms. We start by summarizing research findings on response bias and discuss some of the concepts of motivation relevant to these findings.

40|$|Background: Evolution in Australian {{community}} pharmacy and general practice environments {{has seen the}} emergence of a new opportunity for pharmacist practice, distinct from the conventional community and hospital settings, in which the pharmacist is integrated into the general practice setting to provide professional services. Aim: To characterise pharmacists practising in the Australian general practice setting. Method: An electronic questionnaire. Results: Twenty-six practice pharmacists completed the questionnaire. Practice pharmacists were more likely to be female, aged between 30 and 49 years, have postgraduate qualifications and also work in other pharmacy sectors. The general practice settings more frequently had multiple general practitioners and also housed multiple allied health professionals. The most commonly conducted services provided by the practice pharmacists were Home Medicine Reviews, responding to clinical enquiries from general practitioners and responding to enquiries from other health professionals. Most practice pharmacists worked as independent contractors for services provided. The practice pharmacists provided some services in the absence of remuneration. The majority of practice pharmacists agreed or strongly agreed that a set of competencies should be developed and a credentialing process required with experience of the pharmacist being regarded highly.

Ethnographic techniquess were used for this study, with data collected through interviews, observation and questionnaires. Interviews were conducted with four PNs and four GPs in practices that employed nurses in an increased role similar to that described in the Nursing in General Practice Fact Sheets (Royal College of Nursing Australia, 2002). Two practices were observed to identify work practices and the nurses' interaction within the practice. The main finding {{of the study was}} the importance placed on the general practice team. Both GPs and PNs believed that working as a team was vital. They indicated that working together provided holistic care and enabled the practice to provide quality care. The role of the PN in this study was consistent with other studies in Australia. However, the nurses in this study appeared to have more autonomy in regard to care of people with chronic illness and the aged. Continuing education was considered important for the further development of the PN role. However, participants believed that the PN also needed to have considerable and varied experience together with good people skills.

This article, however, focuses on the aspect of defining the proper reference, which would determinate the premium part of the management salaries. With the <b>appropriate</b> legislative regulations, <b>remunerations</b> of managers were well highlighted and so, that topic was exhibited to the wide debate. A major role was played here by the standards imposed by the Financial Supervision Commission and the Stock Exchange itself. Similarly, on the central level, legislation regulates this issue.

For the host countries migration provides experienced cheap workforce capable of high performance. But the current economic crisis drastically reduced immigrant inflows thanks to high unemployment rates and less available work permits for migrant destination countries. Despite expectations, the return migration stayed at low levels because usually the origin country economic downturn was even worse; and the fall in remittances was also smaller than the statistics said.

In order to allocate power between message and jamming signals, we formulate and solve the optimization problem for maximizing the secrecy rates under malicious attempts from EDs. We then analyse the cooperation between the primary and secondary nodes from a game-theoretic perspective where we model their interaction as a Stackelberg game with a theoretically proved and computed Stackelberg equilibrium.

Finding <b>appropriate</b> <b>remuneration</b> forms to compensate entrepreneurs for performed road measures during winter is not an easy task in order to minimise or eliminate disputes and satisfy both client organisations and contractors. On the other hand improper reimbursement models lead either to the client’s annual budget imbalance due to unnecessary cost overruns or affect contractor’s cash-flow. Such cases in turn affect just-in-time winter road maintenance and then traffic safety. To solve such problems, a number of countries in cold regions like Sweden have developed different remuneration models based more on weather data called Weather Index. Therefore the objective of this paper is to investigate and evaluate the payment models applied in Sweden. The study uses a number of approaches namely; domestic questionnaire survey, analysis of a number of contract documents, a series of meetings with the project managers and an international benchmarking.

Results: A response rate of 83 % was achieved. There was an attrition rate of 14 %, with most ANNPs remaining in their original seconding unit. Factors considered to be important for role satisfaction included a well defined role, working within a team of ANNPs, <b>appropriate</b> <b>remuneration,</b> and evidence of unit support for both role definition and continuing professional development. Conclusions: Although ANNPs are expensive to both train and employ, this evidence {{suggests that there is}} a good return on the investment in terms of retention to the unit and the specialty. Their role incorporates many features of advanced nursing practice as well as providing "value added" neonatal care by merging traditional medical and nursing roles and crossing professional boundaries. In 2004 the manpower challenges for neonatal units will be even more acute; these data confirm that there are effective options available but they require long term strategic planning and investment...|$|E

BACKGROUND: The Enhanced Primary Care (EPC) {{program is designed}} to promote better management of and improved health outcomes for people with chronic illness. Specific Medicare item numbers provide government funding to encourage general practitioners to take up health assessments, care plans and case conferences. AIM: We investigated elements of the EPC program from a rural general practice perspective. METHOD: Questionnaires summarising experience of EPC for patients and health care providers, undertaken over four weeks at three rural general practices, and observation. RESULTS: The EPC program assisted the management and coordination of care for patients with multidisciplinary care needs. General practitioners were generally positive about the EPC program. The main barrier was the extra time required. The main concern of allied health workers was the lack of <b>appropriate</b> <b>remuneration</b> for their participation. Patients were positive in their responses, but many appeared to lack the motivation and self management skills {{to take full advantage of}} the program. DISCUSSION: Strategies seeking to increase the uptake of EPC items need to address efficiency and accessibility, and funding for participating health professionals.
