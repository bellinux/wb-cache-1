50|$|A {{no-fly zone}} or no-flight zone (NFZ), or <b>air</b> <b>exclusion</b> zone, is a {{territory}} or an area over which aircraft {{are not permitted}} to fly. Such zones are usually set up in a military context, somewhat like a demilitarized zone in the sky, and usually prohibit military aircraft of a belligerent power from operating in the region. Aircraft that break the no-fly zone may be shot down, depending on the terms of the NFZ. <b>Air</b> <b>exclusion</b> zones and anti-aircraft defences are sometimes set up in a civilian context, for example to protect sensitive locations, or events such as the 2012 London Olympic Games, against terrorist air attack.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a synthesis of}} results from different studies on effects of air pollution on crops in two regions of northern (Po Plain) and central (Tuscany) Italy. The methodologies used were: (1) biological monitoring of ozone with indicator plants; (2) ambient <b>air</b> pollution <b>exclusion</b> experiments with open-top chambers; (3) controlled fumigation with sulphur dioxide in greenhouse chambers. The results so far obtained indicate that: (1) photochemical air pollution is widespread at a regional level in northern and central Italy at levels above the thresholds for phytotoxicity; (2) ambient oxidant pollution is probably causing significant biological effects and yield losses to various crop species in the Po Plain (these effects are in some cases coupled to the typical injury symptoms caused by ozone-brown stipples or foliar flecks). In contrast, sulphur dioxide fumigation only affects plant growth and physiology at levels above those usually experienced at rural sites. It can be concluded that O 3 {{seems to be the}} most important phytotoxic gas at a regional level in northern and central Italy, and that the impact of this pollutant on crops is worthy of further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{dichloromethane}} extracts (1 mg/ml) of Artemisia pacifica Nutt and Guardiola platyphylla Gray (fam. Asteraceae) separately {{demonstrated in}} vitro growth inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus (UA 9 - 29), Bacillus subtilis (UA 2 - 27), Klebsiella pneumoniae (UA 3 - 9) and Candida albicans (UA 97). Each of these extracts {{were subjected to}} bioassay-directed solvent extraction and partition {{in order to obtain}} concentrated active fractions. Subsequently, the active compounds were isolated and identified from these fractions. Artemisia pacifica Nutt. The active compound was the major component isolated from A. pacifica. By comparing the physical and chemical data with previously reported data, this compound was identified as dehydrofalcarindiol. Dehydrofalcarindiol demonstrated growth inhibition against S. aureus (50 μg/ml), B. subtilis (25 μg/ml), K. pneumoniae (100 μg/ml) and C. albicans (25 μg/ml). Its diacetyl derivative was devoid of activity at 100 μg/ml. Guardiola platyphylla Gray. The active fraction obtained from G. platyphylla contained unstable compounds that decomposed in the presence of <b>air.</b> Size <b>exclusion</b> chromatography (Sephadex LH- 20) was used to fractionate the active fraction. Two new sesquiterpenes, the o-catechol derivatives (1 S, 4 S) and (1 S, 4 R) - 7, 8 -dihydroxy- 11, 12 -dehydrocalamenene, were eluted from the column as a mixture. The mixture of their diacetyl derivatives was oxidized with CrO₃ in AcOH. The major oxidation product was identified as (1 S) - 7, 8 -diacetyl- 4 -oxodeisopropylcalamenene, thereby verifying the sole difference to be the configuration at C- 4. This sesquiterpene mixture completely inhibited the growth of S. aureus (100 μg/ml), B. subtilis (50 μg/ml), K. pneumoniae (100 μg/ml) and C. albicans (100 μg/ml). After removal of the sesquiterpenes from the active fraction, the remaining compounds displayed the same level of activity. Another six compounds were also isolated from this mixture as acetylated derivatives due to their instability. Their dimeric structures were identified by 2 D-NMR techniques (COSY, HETCOR and NOESY). These dimers may be artifacts since they were formed from their o-quinone monomers when kept at room temperature for a week or when heated at 60 °C for 4 hours...|$|R

This liquefaction should reduce the friction between grains of sand and in turn, friction between the ship and sand. Whether this would have been effective in this case is unknown as Pasha Bulker was lying on rock as well as sand and the ship would have had to be pulled up and over the rocks.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPhenol is an {{important}} chemical which {{is used in the}} manufacture of many products such as dyes, synthetic resins, pesticides, tanning materials, perfumes and medicinal products, lubricants, essential oils, solvents, etc. It is very toxic even present as traces in industrial wastewater effluents. It may constitute a potential pollution source of ground waters and hence it has to be eliminated. In the work the elimination of phenol from synthesized aqueous solutions was carried out by adsorption onto non activated carbon obtained from calcinations up to 600 °C in <b>exclusion</b> <b>air</b> of a local cereal by-product. A kinetic study was also included where equilibrium was reached at the end of 120 minutes. A parametric study was also performed by investigating the effect of key parameters such as the pH and initial concentration. The adsorption isotherm was also examined where the results showed that at low concentrations, it is of type IV according to the BET classification whereas at high values of concentration the process seemed to be of a multi-layer type. The results showed that a high retention of the phenol exceeding 70 % was achieved for an initial concentration of 20 mg/l, at 20 °C, a mean size diameter of 0. 1 mm, a mixing velocity of 600 rpm, an adsorbent concentration of 10 g /l, a pH= 3 and contact time of two hour...|$|R
60|$|Such {{of us as}} {{were staying}} the winter, of course held aloof from the hurried passers-through, or looked with kindly {{tolerance}} on their struggles to {{get more out of}} Rome in a given moment than she perhaps yielded with perfect acquiescence. We fancied that she kept something back; she is very subtle, and has her reserves even with people who pass a whole winter within her gates. The fact is, there are a great many of her, though we knew her afar as one mighty personality. There is the antique Rome, the mediaeval Rome, the modern Rome; but that is only the beginning. There is the Rome of the State and the Rome of the Church, which divide between them the Rome of politics and the Rome of fashion; but here is a field so vast that Ave may not enter it without danger of being promptly lost in it. There is the Rome of the visiting nationalities, severally and collectively; there is especially the Anglo-American Rome, which if not so populous as the German, for instance, is more important to the Anglo-Saxons. It sees a great deal of itself socially, but not to the exclusion of the sympathetic Southern temperaments which seem to have a strange but not unnatural affinity with it. So far as we might guess, it was a little more Clerical than Liberal in its local politics; if you were very Liberal, it was well to be careful, for Conversion lurked under many exteriors which gave no outward sign of it; if the White of the monarchy and the Black of the papacy divide the best Roman families, of course foreigners are more intensely one or the other than the natives. But Anglo-Saxon life was easy for one not self-obliged to be of either opinion or party; and it was pleasant in most of its conditions. In Rome our internationalities seemed to have certain quarters largely to themselves. In spite of our abhorrence of the destruction and construction which have made modern Rome so wholesome and delightful, most of us had our habitations in the new quarters; but certain pleasanter of the older streets, like the Via Sistina, Via del Babuino, Via Capo le Case, Via Gregoriana, were our sojourn or our resort. Especially in the two first our language filled the outer <b>air</b> to the <b>exclusion</b> of other conversation, and within doors the shopmen spoke it at least as well as the English think the Americans speak it. It was pleasant to meet the honest English faces, to recognize the English fashions, to note the English walk; and if these were oftener present than their American counterparts, it was not from our habitual minority, but from our occasional sparsity through the panic that had frightened us into a homekeeping foreign to our natures.|$|R
40|$|To {{confirm the}} effects of the high wilting and the <b>air</b> <b>exclusion</b> from silo, Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum) {{containing}} 55 percent moisture was ensiled in the two miniature experimental silos. The one was kept in vacuo at almost 0 cm Hg after ensiling, for 189 days, the normal pressure being restored after 27 days, while the other was kept under the normal condition for 205 days as a control. The results obtained are summarized as follows: l) The <b>air</b> <b>exclusion</b> from the silo gave the silage a good effect without any surface spoilage. The analyses of this vacuum-sealed silage were: dry matter 46. 9, crude protein 4. 9, lactic acid 1. 85, acetic acid 0. 28 and butyric acid 0 percent. 2) A good silage was made certainly only with the high wilted grass, though a considerable surface spoilage was observed. The high wilting had the effective control over undesirable fermentation. The control silage contained dry matter 46. 3, crude protein 4. 2, lactic acid 2. 32, acetic acid 0. 35 and butyric acid 0 percent. 3) The conservation of pro-vitamin A was improved by means of the <b>air</b> <b>exclusion</b> from the silo; 80. 6 and 52. 7 ％ pro-vitamin A remained in the vacuum sealed and the control silage, respectively. 4) Furthermore, two normal HCl or 10 ％ sodium propionate solution was sprayed at the rate of 2. 5 ％, since the development of mold on resulted silage after opening was undesirable. The retardation of apparent mold development was 1 day in the HCl-and 4 days in the Na-propionate-lot respectively. It was confirmed that both wilting or lowering moisture content of grass and the <b>air</b> <b>exclusion</b> from tile silo were practically significant for the good silage making...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} air stress during storage, {{exposure}} to air at feed-out, and treatment with silage additives to enhance aerobic stability on methane production from maize silage were investigated at laboratory scale. Up to 17 % of the methane potential of maize without additive was lost during seven days exposure to air on feed-out. Air stress during storage reduced aerobic stability and further increased methane losses. A chemical additive containing salts of benzoate and propionate, and inoculants containing heterofermentative {{lactic acid bacteria}} were effective to increase aerobic stability and resulted in up to 29 % higher methane yields after exposure to <b>air.</b> <b>Exclusion</b> of air to the best possible extent and high aerobic stabilities should be primary objectives when ensiling biogas feedstocks...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} hormones, enzymes, {{antitumor}} agents, antibiotics and neurotransmitters are peptides. Nowadays, peptides {{are used as}} therapeutic agents against diverse disease areas such as neurological, endocrinological and hematological disorders. Therapeutic peptides pose a number of challenges for pharmaceutical scientists regarding their formulation and delivery. The sensitivity of many peptides to enzymatic breakdown and their poor ability to pass absorbing membranes typically results in a poor bioavailability following non-parenteral administration. Therefore, parenteral administration is {{the most commonly used}} route for systemic delivery of peptide drugs. However, therapeutic peptides are often unstable in aqueous solution limiting their shelf life. The lack of physical and chemical stability may lead to significant degradation during processing and storage of the (aqueous) formulations. Although a dry powder for reconstitution may overcome the lack of physical and chemical stability, from an economic point of view aqueous liquid formulations are preferred. In this presentation the main peptide stability problems in solution will be introduced following known strategies to inhibit peptide degradation, including recent research on improving peptide stability in liquid formulations. In conclusion, the most useful stabilization approaches are optimizing the pH and the type of buffer. Co-solvency, <b>air</b> <b>exclusion,</b> and viscosity enhancement can also be useful to reduce the degradation rate...|$|E

However, studies focused on the combination of DNA and metal nanoparticles for catalyst design are scanty. We have prepared a catalyst composed of palladium nanoparticles supported on DNA which has been characterised by TEM, SEM, EDX, UV, FTIR and XPS. The catalyst, mainly composed of Pd(II) and Pd(IV) species {{in the form of}} oxides, has been effectual in the copper- and ligand-free Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling of aryl iodides with terminal aromatic and aliphatic alkynes. The products are obtained in 54 – 86 % isolated yields using low catalyst loading (0. 5 mol%) under mild conditions (65 °C) in methanol without <b>air</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Moreover, the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused in five cycles and shows better performance than an array of commercial palladium catalysts.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess the effects of daytime cutting management (p. m. vs. a. m. cut), ensiling duration and adding microbial inoculants on chemical composition of alfalfa silage. For this, Second growth Alfalfa harvested at the early bud stage of development after a sunny day at sundown (about 1900 h; PM alfalfa), whereas the second half was cut next day at sunup (about 0800 h; AM alfalfa). After cutting, alfalfa Forage was chopped by using a chopper to a length of 8 to 10 cm, and then ensiled without or with microbial additive as factorial experiment (2 × 2) with repeated measurement design. Silages were provided in laboratory silos (6 repeats in every treatment) lined with two layers of plastic, after <b>air</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Silos were opened at 3, 10 and 30 day for determination of pH and other chemical analysis. The numerically lower pH of PM vs. AM silages indicates that the former forage was more extensively fermented possibly because of its increased total non structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentration. Shifting alfalfa harvesting from sun up to sundown significantly decreased NDF% and ADF%, because of the dilution effect associated with increased concentrations of TNC in the former forage. The NPN content and N-NH 3 concentration of the silages treated in the afternoon was lower compared with AM group. CP content decreased, but NDF, ADF, NPN and N-NH 3 concentration increased during ensiling time. Silage pH decreased by using of microbial additive and ensiling time. Dry matter and nitrogen losses were lower in silages treated by microbial inoculants, and, increased with increasing fermentation time. It can be concluded that microbial additives and time of cutting {{can be used as}} proper way to improve fermentation situation and silage quality...|$|E
