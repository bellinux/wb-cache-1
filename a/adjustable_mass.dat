50|$|The Gyromax is {{the trade}} name for an <b>{{adjustable}}</b> <b>mass</b> (or adjustable inertia) balance wheel used in Patek Philippe wristwatches. Instead of weight adjustment screws {{on the outside}} of the rim, as in traditional balances, the Gyromax has turnable weights recessed into the top of the rim. The advantages claimed for this design are that, without projecting weight screws, the diameter of the balance can be increased, giving it a larger moment of inertia, and that it has less air resistance.|$|E
50|$|The first SLIM were {{fabricated}} using {{printed circuit}} board technology (PCB), and used to demonstrate a range of simple ion manipulations in gases at low pressures (a few torr). This SLIM technology has conceptual similarities with integrated electronic circuits, but instead of moving electrons we use electric fields to create pathways, switches, etc. to manipulate ions in the gas phase. SLIM devices can enable complex sequences of ion separations, transfers and trapping {{to occur in the}} space between two surfaces positioned (e.g., ~4 mm apart) and each patterned with conductive electrodes. The SLIM devices use the inhomogeneous electric fields created by arrays of closely spaced electrodes to which readily generated peak-to-peak RF voltages (e.g., Vp-p ~ 100 V; ~ 1 MHz) are applied with opposite polarity on adjacent electrodes to create effective potential fields that prevent ions from approaching the surfaces. The confinement functions over a range of pressures(<0.1 torr to ~50 torr), and over a useful, broad, and <b>adjustable</b> <b>mass</b> to charge ratio (m/z) range (e.g., m/z 200 to >2000). This effective potential works in conjunction with DC potentials applied to side electrodes to prevent ion losses, and allows creating ion traps and/or conduits in the gap between the two surfaces for the effectively lossless storage and/or movement of ions as a result of any gradient in the applied DC fields. The operating pressure for SLIM devices has initially been reported to be in the 1-10 torr range, and a range well suited for applications of ion mobility separations.|$|E

The initial phase of investigation {{suggested that they}} are i) entirely feasible technically, ii) influence {{the design of the}} BNR system and WWTP design greatly, and iii) offer several advantages over BNR systems using secondary settling tanks such as improved effluent quality, which is independent of sludge flocculation or settling characteristics, reduced WWTP footprint and <b>adjustable</b> sludge <b>mass</b> fractions with recycle flows. However, years of application on full scale internationally have been limited to aerobic systems and little is known of the influence of membranes on BNR systems.

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [11222221]An ultra-accurate isogeometric dynamic {{analysis}} is presented. The key ingredient {{of the proposed}} methodology {{is the development of}} isogeometric higher order mass matrix. A new one-step method is proposed for the construction of higher order mass matrix. In this approach, an <b>adjustable</b> <b>mass</b> matrix is formulated through introducing a set of mass parameters into the consistent mass matrix under the element mass conservation condition. Then the semi-discrete frequency derived from the free vibration equation with the <b>adjustable</b> <b>mass</b> matrix is served as a measure to optimize the mass parameters. In 1 D analysis, {{it turns out that the}} present one-step method can perfectly recover the existing reduced bandwidth mass matrix and the higher order mass matrix by choosing different mass parameters. However, the employment of the proposed one-step method to the 2 D membrane problem yields a remarkable gain of solution accuracy compared with the higher order mass matrix generated by the original two-step method. Subsequently a full-discrete isogeometric transient analysis algorithm is presented by using the Newmark time integration scheme and the higher order mass matrix. The full-discrete frequency is derived to assess the accuracy of space-time discretization. Finally a set of numerical examples are presented to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method, which show that very favorable solution accuracy is achieved by the present dynamic isogeometric analysis with higher order mass formulation compared with that obtained from the standard consistent mass approach...|$|E

These theories restrict in particular limits to the ``generalized supersymmetric'' sine-Gordon models, {{as well as to}} the flavor anisotropic chiral Gross Neveu models (studied recently by N.

The scattering theory involves scalar particles that are no bound states, and bears an intriguing resemblance wih the results of a sharp cut-off analysis of the Thirring model carried out by Korepin in (1980). Various physical applications are discussed. In particular, we demonstrate that our theories are the appropriate continuum limit of integrable quantum spin chains with mixtures of spins.

40|$|Temperature-dependent {{radiative}} recombination of free excitons involving {{one or two}} LO phonons in GaN is investigated in detail. It is found that both phonon sidebands possess asymmetric lineshape and their energy spacings from the zero phonon line strongly deviate from the characteristic energy of LO phonons as the temperature increases. Furthermore, the deviation rates of one and two phonon sidebands are significantly different. Segall-Mahan theory, taking the exciton-photon and exciton-phonon interactions into account, is employed to calculate the sidebands {{of one or two}} LO phonons for free excitons in a wide temperature range. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment is achieved by using only one <b>adjustable</b> parameter (effective <b>mass</b> of free excitons). The obtained effective mass indicates that the free excitons in GaN are likely much lighter than estimated by available theoretical studies. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} non-Abelian lattice gauge fields can be {{simulated}} {{with a single}} component ultra-cold atomic gas in an optical lattice potential. An optical lattice {{can be viewed as}} a Bravais lattice with a N-point basis. An atom located at different points of the basis can be considered as a particle in different internal states. The appropriate engineering of tunneling amplitudes of atoms in an optical lattice allows one to realize U(N) gauge potentials and control a mass of particles that experience such non-Abelian gauge fields. We provide and analyze a concrete example of an optical lattice configuration that allows for simulation of a static U(2) gauge model with a constant Wilson loop and an <b>adjustable</b> <b>mass</b> of particles. In particular, we observe that the non-zero mass creates large conductive gaps in the energy spectrum, which could be important in the experimental detection of the transverse Hall conductivity.

40|$|International audienceA {{new concept}} of airship without thrust, {{elevator}} or rudder is considered in this paper. It is actuated by a moving mass and an internal air bladder with <b>adjustable</b> <b>mass.</b> This results into {{the motion of}} the center of gravity and the change of the net lift. The development of this concept of airship is motivated by energy saving. The moving mass and the airshipʼs rigid body are viewed independently, which renders the modelling easy and displays clearly the interconnection of the two subsystems. An eight degrees-of-freedom (DOF) complete nonlinear mathematical model of this airship is derived through the Newton-Euler approach. The dynamics in the vertical plane are analyzed and controlled, using maximal feedback linearization. The modelling, analysis, and control are solved for special cases of the airship which become gradually complex. The most constrained case reduces to a two-DOF system. It is shown that the basic properties of this two-DOF mechanical system remain instrumental for the analysis and synthesis of advanced airships. These properties are far from being obvious when the most complex model is considered...|$|E

We discuss a consecutive series of 25 reconstructions with the pedicled anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap including muscle {{part of the}} vastus lateralis (VL) in 23 patients from October 1999 to September 2012. Only surface defects larger than 100 cm and reconstructions by composite ALT + VL were included in this retrospective analysis. Of the 23 patients, 19 underwent oncologic resection, whereas 4 cases presented Fournier gangrene. Three patients did not reach 6 months of follow-up and were excluded from further data analysis. Among the remaining 20 patients (22 reconstructions), average follow-up period was 14 months (range, 10 - 18 months). Patient's average age was 60 years. Average size of the defect was 182 cm. Postoperative complications included 1 (4. 5 %) flap necrosis out of 22 raised flaps, 1 partial flap necrosis after venous congestion, and 2 cases where a complementary reconstructive procedure was performed due to remaining defect or partial flap failure. In 6 cases, peripheral wound dehiscence (27 %) was treated by debridement followed by split-thickness skin graft or advancement local flaps. Defect size {{was significantly related to}} postoperative complications and increased hospital stay, especially in those patients who underwent preoperative radiotherapy.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the low temperature waste heat exploitation during enhanced crude oil development providing a 600 - 900 kW continuous {{electric power supply}} under deteriorating and oscillating thermal boundary conditions. The aim of this project was to optimize the heat-to-power conversion process by maximizing the net power output employing a transcritical Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) with R 134 a as working fluid. Volatile supercritical thermo-physical fluid properties demand a review of heat transfer and expansion procedures. In order to design a comprehensive and dynamic unit configuration, a flexible cycle layout with an <b>adjustable</b> working fluid <b>mass</b> flow is required. The optimization developed a positive heat exchange/pressure correlation for the net power output with reasonable cycle efficiencies of around 10 % employing moderate device sizes. Changing ambient temperatures from a winter night with 10 °C to a summer day with 28 °C ambient temperature, on the US West Coast, leads to net power differences of up to 200 kW for an identical cycle configuration. Positive and negative effects result from these temperature oscillations while the heat sink temperature decreases, as does the bottom pressure. Extended available temperature and pressure differences lead to higher power outputs and cycle efficiencies. Considering higher ambient temperatures, the efficiency and power increase per heat transfer performance increase is higher than at low ambient temperatures. For this reason a "large" heat exchanger is more beneficial under warm ambient conditions than under cold ones. In addition, "large" configurations do not easily {{run the risk of}} subcritical cycle operation unlike small configurations. It is therefore important to examine the ORC machine performance over a full range of ambients. Considering a likelihood of heat source temperature degradation, an aggressive cycle design does not pay off. The selection of larger heat transfer devices almost equalizes the net power output compared to smaller ones after a heat source temperature deterioration of ∼ 6 K. Sensitivity analyses in the way presented here are an indispensable tool for achieving optimal cycle layout and operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{drive power}} in motor vehicles requires an improved performance of friction linings and counterpart material in clutches. The most important criteria are {{the coefficient of}} friction, the wear rate, the specific weight, the judder and noise inclination. The frictional heat developing during the engagement process leads to a high temperature load of the lining surface. So far organic friction linings are used preferentially because of their good comfort behaviour and low price. Their properties were improved continually over the last years. However their performance is limited especially by the transferable specific friction energy. Thus the evaluation of alternative friction materials is an important goal of the clutch manufacturers. For the investigations pin-on-disc tests with inertia simulation on different material couples were accomplished. The <b>adjustable</b> <b>mass</b> inertia of the system ensures a defined friction energy per clutch procedure. This permits {{the evaluation of the}} friction value as a function of running speed and cycle number as well as the determination of the wear rate related to the performed friction energy.

40|$|NANOGAP-ENABLED STUDY OF ELECTRODE REACTIONS BY SCANNING ELECTROCHEMICAL MICROSCOPY Nikoloz Nioradze, PhD University of Pittsburgh, 2014 The nanogap quasi-steady-state voltammetry, {{developed}} in my work, presents {{the way to}} monitor and study rapid electron transfer reactions on macroscopic substrates of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). It combines the cyclic voltammetry and SECM and monitors substrate reaction as a tip current. The resulting plot of iT versus ES features the retraceable sigmoidal shape of a quasi-steady state voltammogram although a transient peak-shape voltammogram is obtained simultaneously at the macroscopic substrate. This simplifies measurement and analysis of a quasi-steady-state voltammogram and gives information about thermodynamic as well as kinetic parameters of the reaction taking place at the interface. No charging current at the amperometric tip, high and <b>adjustable</b> <b>mass</b> transport under the tip and high spatial resolution are all advantages of quasi-steady-state voltammetry. I also introduced generalized theory for nanoscale iT-ES voltammetry of substrate reactions with arbitrary reversibility and mechanism under comprehensive experimental conditions including any substrate potential and both SECM modes (feedback and substrate generation tip collection, SG/TC). I nanofabricated submicrometer size highly reliable Pt SECM tips and found the way of protection of these tiny electrodes from the damage caused either by electrostatic discharge or electrochemical etching. Subsequent application of quasi-steady-state voltammetry and reliable nanofabricated SECM probes enabled sensitive detection of adsorption of organic impurities from air and ultrapure water to the HOPG surface as evidenced by redox reaction of ferrocenylmethyl) trimethyl ammonium (FcTMA+). Study revealed that hydrophobic contaminant layer slows down the access of hydrophilic aqueous redox species to the underlying HOPG surface, thereby yielding a lower standard rate constant, k 0. Moreover, this barrier effects stronger to a more charged form (FcTMA 2 +) of a redox couple so that the electron-transfer reaction of the more hydrophilic form is slower to yield a lower k 0 value. ...|$|E
40|$|The Attitude Control System (ACS) is {{developed}} for a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout mission using a solar sail. The NEA-Scout spacecraft is a 6 U cubesat with an 86 square-meter solar sail. NEA Scout will launch on Space Launch System (SLS) Exploration Mission 1 (EM- 1), currently scheduled to launch in 2018. The spacecraft will rendezvous with a target asteroid after a two year journey, and will conduct science imagery. The solar sail spacecraft ACS {{consists of three}} major actuating subsystems: a Reaction Wheel (RW) control system, a Reaction Control System (RCS), and an <b>Adjustable</b> <b>Mass</b> Translator (AMT) system. The three subsystems allow {{for a wide range}} of spacecraft attitude control capabilities, needed for the different phases of the NEA-Scout mission. Because the sail is a flexible structure, care must be taken in designing a control system to avoid exciting the structural modes of the sail. This is especially true for the RCS, which uses pulse actuated, cold-gas jets to control the spacecraft's attitude. While the reaction wheels can be commanded smoothly, the RCS jets are simple on-off actuators. Long duration firing of the RCS jets - firings greater than one second - can be thought of as step inputs to the spacecraft's torque. On the other hand, short duration firings - pulses on the order of 0. 1 seconds - can be thought of as impulses in the spacecraft's torque. These types of inputs will excite the structural modes of the spacecraft, causing the sail to oscillate. Sail oscillations are undesirable for many reasons. Mainly, these oscillations will feed into the spacecraft attitude sensors and pointing accuracy, and long term oscillations may be undesirable over the lifetime of the solar sail. In order to limit the sail oscillations, an RCS control scheme is being developed to minimize sail excitations. Specifically, an input shaping scheme similar to the method described in Reference 1 will be employed. A detailed description of the RCS control scheme will be provided with particular emphasis on flexible body excitation. The RCS performance will be provided to show that sail and boom excitation is minimized...|$|E
