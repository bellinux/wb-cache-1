5|$|After the war ended, Creutz {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} come to the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he became the head of its Physics Department and its Nuclear Research Center in 1948. In 1955 he returned to Los Alamos to evaluate its thermonuclear fusion program for the Atomic Energy Commission. While there he {{accepted an}} offer to become Vice President for Research and Development <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> its John Jay Hopkins Laboratory for Pure and Applied Science at General Atomics. Under his leadership, General Atomics developed TRIGA, a nuclear reactor for universities and laboratories.|$|E
5|$|An Advisory Committee on Uranium {{was formed}} under Lyman J. Briggs, a {{scientist}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> the National Bureau of Standards. Its first meeting on October 21, 1939, {{was attended by}} Szilard, Teller, and Wigner, who persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments—in particular, more graphite. A 1940 Army intelligence report on Fermi and Szilard, prepared when the United States had not yet entered World War II, expressed reservations about both. While it contained some errors of fact about Szilard, it correctly noted his dire prediction that Germany would win the war.|$|E

The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.|$|E
5|$|After Team Plasma's defeat, Looker {{arrives in}} Unova and tasks the player with finding the {{remaining}} Sages of Team Plasma, {{so they can}} be brought to justice. The player can also challenge the Elite Four once again, and challenge Alder, ultimately becoming the Unova region's new Pokémon Champion. The player also gains access to the eastern portion of Unova, which contains Pokémon from the previous games in the series, as well as access to an area unique to each game version: the ultra-metropolitan Black City, home to powerful Pokémon trainers; and the White Forest, home to humans and Pokémon living in harmony. Cynthia, a former Champion of the Sinnoh region, is also found in this area of the game and can be challenged. A non-player character named after Shigeki Morimoto, a Game Freak programmer, creature designer, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> the HeartGold and SoulSilver games, can also be found and battled in the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1966 an {{exhibition}} at Leeds College of Art of paintings by the Cyprus-born British artist Stass Paraskos, entitled Lovers and Romances, was prosecuted by the City of Leeds police <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> Public Prosecutions under the Vagrancy Acts of 1828 and 1837, and the Obscene Publications Act 1959. When the exhibition opened it was allegedly visited {{by a local}} school group, the leader of which objected to an image depicting a woman masturbating a man. The exhibition was raided {{by the police and}} closed down. Despite luminaries of the art world speaking in Paraskos's defence, including Herbert Read and Norbert Lynton, and a message of support from Britain's Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, Paraskos lost the trial and was fined twenty-five pounds. The case was later cited in the report of a working party convened in 1968, under the chairmanship of John Montgomerie, by the Arts Council of Great Britain, to review the obscenity laws in England and Wales. In this report it was suggested the artist should not have been prosecuted in this case, even if the works of art were deemed obscene, as he was not the publisher as defined by the Obscene Publications Act.|$|E

5|$|Szilard {{drafted a}} {{confidential}} {{letter to the}} President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning of a German nuclear weapon project, explaining the possibility of nuclear weapons, and encouraging {{the development of a}} program that could result in their creation. With the help of Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller, he approached his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein in August 1939, and convinced him to sign the letter, lending his prestige to the proposal. The Einstein–Szilard letter resulted in the establishment of research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government. An Advisory Committee on Uranium was formed under Lyman J. Briggs, a scientist <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> the National Bureau of Standards. Its first meeting on 21 October 1939, was attended by Szilard, Teller and Wigner.

5|$|The trailer was {{produced}} and {{made by the}} Glasgow-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for Killzone 2 and Mass Effect 2. According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> the trailer, Deep Silver gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing them {{to create their own}} characters instead of using the in-game protagonists. Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel non-linear and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room. Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.|$|E
5|$|Australia having {{declared}} war on 3September 1939, the RAAF Air Board met in November to discuss Mary Bell's letter, but postponed taking any further action. Bell continued to lobby, as did various women's groups seeking to support the war effort and free male staff for overseas postings. In July 1940, the new Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, invited her to produce {{a proposal for a}} women's auxiliary, supervised by her husband John, who had rejoined the Air Force at the war's outbreak and was now a wing commander in the Directorate of Organisation at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. Mary recommended forming the new service under the Air Force Act to permit women to enlist {{for the duration of the}} war under conditions similar to RAAF members, rather than enrolling on a short-term contractual basis, a radical idea at the time which would not be put in place until 1943. She also suggested a volunteer reserve or 'citizen' force to augment the enlisted women, effectively the existing WATC, though this was seen as placing too much emphasis on her personal command. Various senior Air Force officers, including the recently promoted Air Marshal Williams, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> Personnel Services, Group Captain Joe Hewitt, opposed a women's service. Burnett, an RAF member who appreciated how the WAAF proved its worth during the Battle of Britain, championed its establishment as the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF).|$|E

5|$|Lack of {{understanding}} of wildfire management by the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies. Some news agencies gave the impression {{that most of the}} park was being destroyed. On August 30, an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott, apparently a tourist, incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service (William Mott). In another story, The New York Times stated that the Park Service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out, whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires—a mischaracterization of the policies of both agencies. The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies. Sources quoted by The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts. On the same day, The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang, Vietnam, giving the impression of catastrophe. The fires had been very active in late July. In early August, fire managers reached a conclusion that the fires would not likely expand much further, {{due to a lack of}} fuel, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> the National Park Service declared on August 11 that the fires were contained. When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20, and the fire that threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September, the media were again highly critical of the park service and their policies.|$|E
5|$|The varsity {{athletics}} {{fields are}} located {{south of the}} College Hill residential neighborhood. Fourteenth Street divides College Hill to the north, with the athletic fields to the south. Charles Boulevard borders the fields {{to the west and}} Greenville Boulevard borders it to the south. A residential neighborhood and Elmhurst Elementary School are the eastern borders. The northern portion of the area sits Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium, Minges Coliseum, and Minges Natatorium, along with parking. The Murphy Center, which is the primary strength and conditioning, and banquet building, is located between Dowdy-Ficklen and Minges Coliseum. The Tennis Complex, Ward Sports Medicine Building, Scales Field House, and the Pirate Club Building also surround Dowdy-Ficklen. The Ward Sports Medicine Building houses offices for football and basketball, Pirate Club, media relations, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> athletics. The Scales Field House provides locker rooms, offices and equipment storage. The Pirate Club Building houses a ticket office, other offices, and an area for Pirate Club members. South of those facilities is the Cliff Moore Practice Facility which has a pair of natural grass fields and one FieldTurf field designed exclusively for the football team. On the southern border of the practice facility is Clark-LeClair Stadium, which is the men's baseball stadium. It opened in 2005 and seats 3,000 in permanent seating with another 2,000 located in the outfield. At {{the southern end of the}} fields is the Olympic Sports Complex, which include women's soccer stadium, softball stadium, track and field facility, and Olympic Sports Team building. The Olympic Sports Complex was completed in 2011 with a price of $23.4 million. The Smith-Williams Center is a $17 million basketball development and practice facility, opened in 2013. The football stadium is planning for a $40 million upgrade. The upgrades will include a new press, club, and suite areas, and upper deck, all located on the south side. This addition will increase the capacity from 50,000 to 60,000.|$|E
