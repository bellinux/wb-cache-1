5|$|<b>A</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Horsham, {{now part}} of the Arun Valley Line, was opened on 14 February 1848. A station was {{provided}} next to Crawley High Street from that date. A new station was constructed slightly to the east, in conjunction with the Overline House commercial development, and replaced the original station which closed on 28 July 1968. The ticket office and Up (London-bound) platform waiting areas form the ground floor of the office building.|$|E

5|$|A wooden {{bridge was}} {{built over the}} Kennet at Newbury in 1726, {{replaced}} in stone between 1769 and 1772 by James Clarke, and {{now known as the}} Town Bridge or Water Bridge.

5|$|Industry {{developed}} {{rapidly in}} the 19th century. The first horse-drawn railway in the Kingdom of Hungary, from Pressburg to Szentgyörgy Svätý Jur, was built in 1840. A new line to Vienna using steam locomotives was opened in 1848, and <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Pest in 1850. Many new industrial, financial and other institutions were founded; for example, the first bank in present-day Slovakia was founded in 1842.

In June 1846 Parliament authorised {{the completion of the}} line to Stoke-on-Trent. By June 1849 the section between Congleton and Macclesfield was completed and the line was finished.|$|E

The Rifle Brigade encircled and, through the achievement of its 4th Battalion in scaling the ramparts that surrounded the town, pushed into Le Quesnoy by the close of the day while the 1st Brigade had established <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the east.

5|$|On 15June1839 the {{entrepreneur}} and former Member of Parliament for Buckingham, Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet, opened the Aylesbury Railway. Built {{under the direction}} of Robert Stephenson, it connected the London and Birmingham Railway's Cheddington railway station on the West Coast Main Line to Aylesbury High Street railway station in eastern Aylesbury. On 1October1863 the Wycombe Railway also built <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Aylesbury, from Princes Risborough railway station to a station on the western side of Aylesbury (the present-day Aylesbury railway station). The arrival of the railway had a powerful impact on the duck industry, and up to a ton of ducks in a night were being shipped from Aylesbury to Smithfield Market in London by 1850.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the goals}} of Mayor John Hylan's Independent Subway System (IND), {{proposed}} in the 1920s was <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Coney Island, reached by a recapture of the BMT Culver Line. To connect this line to the Eighth Avenue Line–the main trunk of the IND–a subway line was to run from Brooklyn Borough Hall south under Jay Street, Smith Street, Ninth Street, and several other streets to Cortelyou Road (later Church Avenue) and McDonald Avenue, just north of the Ditmas Avenue elevated station. A ramp would then lead onto the elevated BMT Culver Line. This line was variously known as the Culver Line Extension, Culver−Smith Street Line, Smith Street Line, Smith Street–Prospect Park Line, Smith–Ninth Street Line, Jay–Smith–Ninth Street Line, Church Avenue Line, Prospect Park–Church Avenue Line, Prospect Park–Coney Island Line, Brooklyn Line, or South Brooklyn Line, though it was often simply referred to as the Brooklyn portion of the IND. As originally designed, service to and from Manhattan would have been exclusively provided by Culver express trains, while all local service would have fed into the IND Crosstown Line.|$|E
5|$|Should a new tunnel be built, {{it would}} not {{necessarily}} run next to the Oslo Tunnel. One proposal from the National Rail Administration calls for a separate commuter train station to be built underground, {{at the location of}} Oslo Bus Terminal, within walking distance of OsloS. This proposal involves the line connecting to the existing route before reaching Nationaltheatret. The lobby organisation Norsk Bane have called for <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> run further north, and serve Majorstuen, where there is a major metro and tramway hub. Norsk Bane also call for the tunnel to be built for higher speeds, and state {{that it is necessary to}} build high-speed rail to Bergen and Stavanger. Combined with a new line from Drammen to the tunnel, it would allow travel time from Drammen and Oslo to be reduced to 18 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Subway {{service would}} be {{extended}} eastward along Hillside Avenue to Little Neck Parkway.

5|$|Towing two scows at {{the time}} of the collision, Stella Maris responded {{immediately}} to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6. The tug's captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized they were not equipped to fight the fire with their one small hose and quickly backed off from the burning Mont Blanc. They were approached by a whaler from HMS Highflyer and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS Niobe. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of Niobe agreed to secure <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the French ship's stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire. The five-inch (127-millimetre) hawser initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten-inch (254-millimetre) hawser came down. It was at this point that the blast occurred.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the plans}} were revised, with new plans such as <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Staten Island and a revised {{line to the}} Rockaways. In the late 1940s and 1950s, a Queens Bypass line via the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line was first {{proposed}} as {{a branch of the}} still-planned Second Avenue Subway. In addition, capacity on existing lines would have been improved through the construction of strategic connections such as the Culver Ramp, the 60th Street Tunnel Connection, and the Chrystie Street Connection, and through the rebuilding of DeKalb Avenue Junction. These improvements were the only things to come out of these plans. Eventually, these plans were modified to what became the Program for Action, which was put forth by the New York City Transit Authority in 1968. This was the last plan for a major expansion of the subway system. The plan included the construction of the Second Avenue Subway, a Queens Bypass line, a line replacing the Third Avenue El in the Bronx, and other extensions in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. While ambitious, very little of the plan was completed, mostly because of the financial crisis during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} rapid transit along the Bloor–Danforth line's route {{was made in}} a 1910 report that was prepared by an American firm of transit consultants. This study had been commissioned by a special commission, which included City Controller Horatio Clarence Hocken and Mayor of Toronto Joseph Oliver. In their final report, the consultants suggested that the Prince Edward Viaduct, which spans the Don River Valley, should include a lower deck for a future subway. The lower deck was built, but the first plan for <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> use it was not made until June 15, 1933, when the TTC published a report which suggested construction of a subway and an expressway broadly following Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue. The estimated cost {{of the project was}} $120 million, but the plan was not implemented. Plans for a somewhat longer route, running east to west from Victoria Park Avenue to the Humber River, were proposed by the Toronto Planning Board in December 1943, although the report did not include costings. During the fall of 1911, the City of Toronto put out a tender for the construction of concrete tubes to carry a subway. However, when the cost of the subway was put to a referendum, the construction of the subway tunnels was rejected.|$|E

5|$|While Nelson {{was engaged}} in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean, the main Mediterranean Fleet under Earl St Vincent had ensured that the Spanish Navy was unable to intervene. On 24 May St Vincent was joined at the Tagus by a {{reinforcement}} of eight ships under Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, and the admiral ordered his ships to establish blockades off the southern Spanish ports, especially Cadiz, where the main Spanish fleet lay at anchor. There regular correspondence passed between St Vincent and Admiral Don Joseph Massaredo, the Spanish commander. The Spanish fleet made no major deployments during the year, except for a single convoy of the ship of the line Monarca, two frigates and several merchant vessels that sailed in April. Although privateers and minor warships fought several small engagements along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, the only significant Spanish deployment of {{the remainder of the}} year was by a frigate squadron based at Cartagena, which was intercepted by the British ship of the line Lion. At the ensuing Action of 15 July 1798, the Spanish ships formed <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> meet the attack of Captain Dixon's ship but the damaged frigate Santa Dorotea fell behind the leading three frigates.
