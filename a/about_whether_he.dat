5|$|Kaspersky's prior {{work for}} the Russian {{military}} and his education at a KGB-sponsored technical college has led to controversy <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> uses his position to advance Russian government interests and intelligence efforts. According to Kaspersky, allegations of dubious connections with Russian agencies began after {{he got his first}} clients in America. He spends much of his working life trying to get governments and organizations to trust him and his software in spite of the allegations.|$|E

He wished to see Fulkerson, and ask him something <b>about</b> Beaton: <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had been <b>about</b> lately, and <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had dropped any hint {{of what had happened}} concerning Christine; Dryfoos believed that Fulkerson was in the fellow's confidence.|$|R

5|$|Spain's first {{match of}} UEFA Euro 2012 {{qualifying}} was against Liechtenstein on 3 September 2010, Villa scored the second {{goal of the}} match which eventually ended 4–0. It was believed that this goal meant that he had equalled Raúl's record 44-goal tally, however after many debates <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> or Dariusz Dudka scored the first goal in Spain's 6–0 win over Poland, FIFA eventually decided that the goal was indeed an own goal by Dudka, meaning Villa's goal tally would remain at 43. On 12 October 2010, he finally equalled Raúl's record, scoring a penalty against Scotland and helping Spain see off the Scots in a 3–2 victory at Hampden Park.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{went through}} knee surgery during the offseason, {{but there was}} still concern <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had a future in the NFL. That was set aside when he was {{considered}} to be progressing well in his recovery as of early July 1977. During the Buccaneers' offseason, the quarterbacks on the roster changed entirely, with Dickinson being the only holdover; Gary Huff was now the starter, and Dickinson was fighting for a backup role alongside Mike Boryla and Randy Hedberg. After the Buccaneers lost Boryla and Huff to injuries, the former for the season, Dickinson ended up being the starting quarterback for the team's final preseason game against the Bills. In the game, Dickinson completed 2 of 12 passes for -2yards and was sacked three times in a 176 loss. A week after the game against the Bills, Dickinson was released by the Buccaneers along with four other players. The Buccaneers re-signed him after Huff got injured in late October, but Dickinson was again released a couple weeks later.|$|E

We also see Nick, Adalind, and Kelly settling into their home as a family. Nick seems genuine about wanting to give this baby a good life, and he isn't adding to his laundry list of crap to deal with—the death of Juliette, not knowing where Trubel is, the 'raging war' that's coming, and his baby momma moving in — by thinking <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he's</b> a Grimm, a Hexenbeist, or what Adalind calls a 'Grimmerbeist/Hexengrimm.'" ...|$|R

5|$|The inquest {{was opened}} and adjourned in April 2009. The City of London coroner, Paul Matthews, {{expressed}} concern <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had appropriate expertise, and Peter Thornton QC, {{who specializes in}} protest law, took over. The inquest opened on 28 March 2011 before a jury. The court heard from Kevin Channer, a cardiologist at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, who analysed electrocardiogram (ECG) data from the defibrillator paramedics had used on Tomlinson. He said the readings were inconsistent with an arrhythmic heart attack, but consistent with death from internal bleeding. Pathologist Nat Carey concurred regarding the cause of death. Graeme Alexander, a hepatologist, said that in his opinion Tomlinson had died of internal bleeding {{as a result of}} trauma to the liver after the fall. He told the court that Tomlinson had been suffering from serious liver disease, which would have made him susceptible to collapse from internal bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Ernest was {{the subject}} of more {{allegations}} in 1832, when two young women accused him of trying to ride them down as they walked near Hammersmith. The Duke had not left his grounds at Kew on the day in question, and was able to ascertain that the rider was one of his equerries, who professed not to have seen the women. Nevertheless, newspapers continued to print references to the incident, suggesting that Ernest had done what the women stated, and was cravenly trying to push blame on another. The same year, the Duke sued for libel after a book appeared accusing him of having his valet Neale kill Sellis, and the jury found against the author. Also in 1832, the Cumberlands suffered tragedy, as young Prince George went blind. The Prince had been blind in one eye from infancy; an accident at age thirteen took the sight of the other. Ernest had hoped his son might marry Princess Victoria and keep the British and Hanoverian Thrones united, but the handicap made it unlikely George could win Princess Victoria's hand, and raised questions <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> should succeed in Hanover.|$|E

25|$|As {{the chief}} {{executive}} of the most populous state in the union, Roosevelt was widely considered a potential future presidential candidate, and supporters such as William Allen White encouraged him to run for president. Roosevelt had no interest in challenging McKinley for the Republican nomination in 1900, and was denied his preferred post of Secretary of War. As his term progressed, Roosevelt pondered a 1904 presidential run, but was uncertain <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> should seek re-election as governor in 1900.|$|E

25|$|After the Brooklyn Bridge was {{completed}} on May 31, 1883, there was speculation about {{who would be}} the first to successfully leap from it. In May 1886, swimming instructor Robert Emmet Odlum died in an attempt to prove the harmlessness of falling long distances through the air. A month later, Steve Brodie was said to have successfully dropped from the bottom of the bridge and survived with injuries, but doubts <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> actually made the jump surfaced years later and the matter remains unsettled.|$|E
25|$|After the World Cup, in {{the same}} year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record {{partnership}} for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> should bat. Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over. India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs {{for the first time in}} an ODI.|$|E
25|$|As Davies's first attack {{ground to}} a halt and the attack of Irvin Gregg's brigade failed to {{dislodge}} the Confederates, David Gregg sent for reinforcements from Sheridan, who released two brigades from Torbert's division. Torbert's reserve brigade under Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt extended Gregg's line to the right, thwarting a flanking maneuver attempted by Hampton with Chambliss's newly arrived brigade. There was plenty of infantry nearby that could have been called for reinforcements, with Hancock's II Corps dug in about one mile to the north, and there are disagreements between Sheridan's memoirs and historians <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> asked for such reinforcements.|$|E
