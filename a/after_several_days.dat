5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down {{for an hour or}} two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, <b>after</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E

By May25, a large area of low pressure formed several hundred miles south of Acapulco, Mexico.

Another notice in November 1933 noted her impending return to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled to take on a load of borax and scrap brass.

5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate <b>after</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E
5|$|Activated in 1949, the {{regiment}} trained {{for more than}} a year before the outbreak of the war on June 25, 1950. On that day, half of {{the regiment}} led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back <b>after</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army.

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> as a {{powerful}} typhoon, Fengshen began a weakening trend due to decreased outflow and dry air.

At 1145UTC on July25, Fengshen made landfall on Yakushima in Japan's Ōsumi Islands, while a severe tropical storm. The next day, the storm passed a short distance southwest of Jeju Island offshore South Korea. After entering the Yellow Sea, Fengshen weakened into a tropical depression, and on July27 the JTWC discontinued advisories, after much of the convection had dissipated. The JMA continued tracking the system, and Fengshen made landfall on China's Shandong Peninsula late on July27. The next day, the depression dissipated over the Bohai Sea.|$|E
