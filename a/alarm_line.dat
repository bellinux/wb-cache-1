5000|$|Meanwhile, Edward G. Watkins {{founded the}} Simplex Time Recorder Company in 1894. Watkins invented and {{patented}} {{one of the}} first practical time clocks, along with the synchronized clock systems seen in schools up until recent times. The company, located in Gardner, Massachusetts, purchased the IBM Time Equipment Division in 1958. This purchase included IBM's fire protection division. Originally, Simplex's fire <b>alarm</b> <b>line</b> simply consisted of relabeled IBM devices and control panels (including the 4217 and possibly the 4201 series), but they began to introduce redesigned IBM products starting in the early 1960s, including the 4245, 4246, and 4247 series control panels. In the mid-1960s, Simplex attempted to introduce low-voltage DC systems with the 4210 and 4212; these panels were not a success. Most of Simplex's audible notification appliances prior to the 1990s were relabeled Benjamin Electric, Federal Signal, Faraday, and Autocall devices, such as the 2901-9806 (Federal Signal 450) 2901-9833 (Faraday 6020), and the 4050 (Faraday 5410). Simplex's time division began to lose market share, but their newly founded fire alarm division significantly prospered. In 1970, Simplex introduced the 4208-series conventional control panels. The 4050-80 light plate series with added AC powered 4050 (Faraday 5410) horn or DC powered 4051 (Faraday 5640) horn were introduced as the signals for the 4208. Around this time, Simplex also introduced the iconic [...] "T-bar" [...] style pull station, which is still manufactured today. In 1975, Simplex introduced the 4207, a system similar in design to the 4208, but with updated features such as card-based modularity, DC battery trickle charging, compatibility with custom COP and read-back systems for pre-multiplex building control, and voice evacuation for large buildings. In 1977, Simplex introduced the Simplex 2903 series. This includes the 2903 light plates and the 2904 series remote lights. They also introduced their 2901-9833 and 2901-9806 horns that year. Two years later, in 1979, the Simplex 2903 strobe plate versions were introduced.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in monitoring the quality of cardiac surgical performance. The aim {{of the present study was}} to apply control charts (CUSUM curves) to monitor the performance of minimally invasive mitral valve proce-dures to enhance quality control for that operation. METHODS: A total of 936 minimally invasive mitral valve procedures were performed from September 2003 to March 2011 by seven surgeons (range 26 – 401 procedures) at a single institution. Institutional and individual surgeons ’ performances were monitored using descriptive statistics and control charts, with a predetermined acceptable failure rate of 10 % and calculated 80 % alert and 95 % alarm lines. Perioperative death or one or more of seven adverse events constituted failure. RESULTS: The incidence of in-hospital mortality was 1. 8 % (17 / 936) and compared favourably with the predicted mortality (logistic EuroSCORE 7. 3 %). Institutional CUSUM analysis revealed an initial learning curve and then the surgical process remained in control for all the study period. There were differences between surgeons with regard to the learning curves and perioperative complications (7. 3 – 11. 3 %, P = 0. 9). Five surgeons crossed the 95 % reassurance boundary between operations 23 and 48. One surgeon crossed the 95 % re-assurance boundary after 116 operations. No surgeon crossed the 95 % <b>alarm</b> <b>line,</b> which indicates unacceptably high failure rates. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive mitral surgery can be safely performed with low morbidity and mortality. CUSUM curve analysis is a simple statistical method to implement continuous individual and departmental performance monitoring...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{evaluated}} five {{static analysis}} tools [...] Polyspace C Verifier, ARCHER, BOON, Splint, and UNO [...] using 14 code examples that illustrated actual buffer overflow vulnerabilities found in various versions of Sendmail, BIND, and WU-FTPD. Each code example included a "BAD" case {{with one or}} more buffer overflow vulnerabilities and a "PATCHED" case without buffer overflows. The buffer overflows varied and included stack, heap, bss and data buffers; access above and below buffer bounds; access using pointers, indices, and functions; and scope differences between buffer creation and use. Detection rates for the "BAD" examples were low except for Splint and PolySpace C Verifier, which had average detection rates of 57 % and 87 % respectively. However, average false alarm rates, as measured using the "PATCHED" programs, were high for these two systems. The frequency of false <b>alarms</b> per <b>lines</b> of code was high for both of these tools; Splint gave on average one false <b>alarm</b> per 50 <b>lines</b> of code, and PolySpace gave on average one false <b>alarm</b> per 10 <b>lines</b> of code. This result shows that current approaches can detect buffer overflows, but that false alarm rates need to be lowered substantially. by Misha Zitser. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the importance of experience and the learning curve with endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed of all elective endovascular AAA repairs attempted by an individual surgeon and radiologist over a 4 -year period. The primary outcome variable was achievement and 30 -day maintenance of initial clinical success as defined by the Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association of Vascular Surgery reporting standards. Following standard statistical analysis, the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method was used to analyze the learning curve, with a predetermined acceptable failure rate of 10 % and calculated 80 % alert and 95 % <b>alarm</b> <b>lines.</b> ResultsNinety-six elective endovascular AAA repairs were attempted by this team between 1998 and 2002 (mean age 74 ± 0. 8 years; mean aneurysm diameter 5. 98 ± 0. 8 cm). Initial clinical success was achieved and maintained in 85 of 96 patients (88. 5 %). Although results were acceptable throughout the study period, improved results with respect to the target failure rate (10 %) were not achieved until 60 patients were treated. The learning or CUSUM curves did not differ for different device manufacturers, with improved results being achieved following 20 implantations of each device. The results did differ when comparing aortouniiliac grafts (n = 27) and bifurcated grafts (n = 64). Results with bifurcated grafts remained consistent throughout the study period, whereas with aortouniiliac grafts, results improved after only a few procedures in comparison with the target failure rate. ConclusionSuccess rates with endovascular aneurysm repair will improve with an individual's experience. The CUSUM method is a valuable tool in the evaluation of this learning curve, which has credentialing and training implications. Although acceptable results were obtained throughout the study period, this analysis indicates that 60 endovascular aneurysm repairs, or 20 with an individual device, are necessary before optimal rates of initial clinical success can be achieved. These results can be achieved more readily with aortouniiliac grafts than with bifurcated grafts...|$|R

40|$|Computer vision based {{surveillance}} {{systems have}} become increasingly important to society. This thesis presents a new approach for computer vision based alarm making systems which detect abnormal events in fixed camera circumstances. The approach contains four functions: namely (1) detecting, (2) tracking, (3) recognizing and (4) <b>alarming.</b> In <b>line</b> with these functions, {{based on the results}} of detecting, tracking and recognition, the system will be able to generate alarms automatically. Through the experiments, the related methods and algorithms applied to the proposed approach provide better performance for the purpose of alarm making, thus it could be helpful in reducing the manual labor of security staff. The contributions of this thesis are: Firstly, the shortcomings and deficiencies of the traditional surveillance and alarm systems have been studied. Secondly, computer vision techniques have been utilized to allow the system to work with different environments. Thirdly, dual artificial neural networks have been innovatively deployed for abnormal events detection and to improve the accuracy of alarming to reduce false alarms. The overall result for the false alarm rate of the system developed in this project is 13. 8 % which is lower that the mainstream 15. 27 % and also helpful for the management of traffic environments. In future, the improvement of the system will be the working direction for the researcher such as using more training datasets to make the abnormal events alarming system more efficient in terms of abnormal event detection and reduction of the false alarm rate...|$|R

It is only the backward glance, the gaze up the long vista of the past, that reveals anything <b>alarming.</b> Here the <b>lines</b> converge as they recede into the geological ages, and point to conclusions which, upon the theory, are inevitable, but hardly welcome. The very first step backward makes the negro and the Hottentot our blood-relations--not that reason or Scripture objects to that, though pride may. The next suggests a closer association of our ancestors of the olden time with [...] "our poor relations" [...] of the quadrumanous family than we like to acknowledge. Fortunately, however--even if we must account for him scientifically --man with his two feet stands upon a foundation of his own. Intermediate links between the Bimana and the Quadrumana are lacking altogether; so that, put the genealogy of the brutes upon what footing you will, the four-handed races will not serve for our forerunners--at least, not until some monkey, live or fossil, is producible with great-toes, instead of thumbs, upon his nether extremities; or until some lucky geologist turns up the bones of his ancestor and prototype in France or England, who was so busy [...] "napping the chuckie-stanes" [...] and chipping out flint knives and arrow-heads {{in the time of}} the drift, very many ages ago--before the British Channel existed, says Lyell [III-1]--and until these men of the olden time are shown to have worn their great-toes in the divergent and thumblike fashion.

5000|$|In the North Atlantic off {{the coast}} of Greenland, a highly {{advanced}} deep sea oil rig has been recently constructed by the company Nexecon Petroleum, and named [...] "Colossus" [...] for its immense size. This [...] "new" [...] type of oil rig can dig deeper and extract more oil than any other in the world. The fact that this huge rig has been built on fault <b>lines</b> <b>alarms</b> geologists, who are concerned that the delicate ocean floor fault lines in that region might be disturbed through deep drilling, with catastrophic consequences. A reporter, Christen Giddings, has been invited by the CEO of Nexecon, Peter Brazier, to the oil rig in an attempt to address the concerns of the geologists. Christen is accompanied by a trusted cameraman Jake Thompson, who will record their findings. The oil rig's crew seem to be convinced that nothing bad will happen, and are skeptical of the geologists. Brazier hopes that a documented report on [...] "Colossus" [...] will reveal that his rig has all the necessary safety arrangements and that the region is stable enough for a drilling operation. As the drilling commences, a rich oil deposit is discovered. However, further drilling is not stopped and an [...] "ocean floor fault line" [...] gets ruptured, which opens a portal to a [...] "mirror" [...] ocean, hidden under the normal ocean for millions of years and containing prehistoric life. An explosion occurs and the drilling system collapses. A team of engineers descend through a glass elevator to assess the situation. A giant animal is spotted approaching, which {{turns out to be the}} most powerful and fearsome oceanic predator that ever lived, Carcharodon megalodon.

The ordeal is not over yet as another Megalodon ventures into open waters, passing below a boat with Christen Giddings on board. However she is unaware of its presence.|$|R
