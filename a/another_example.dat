5000|$|Transitions {{affect how}} one video clips flows into <b>another.</b> <b>Examples</b> include fade and dissolve, but many more {{spectacular}} transitions are available.|$|R
30|$|It {{is clear}} that f(t)=e^t {{does not belong to}} Ψ, but f(t)=e^t∈Θ. <b>Another</b> <b>examples</b> are f(t)= t and f(t)= 1 +(1 +t) for all t> 0.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{transmission}} {{system is the}} medium through which data is transmitted from one point to <b>another.</b> <b>Examples</b> of common {{transmission system}}s people use everyday are: the internet, mobile network, cordless cables, etc.|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> {{application}} involves {{both the}} CcdB toxin and CcdA antitoxin. CcdB {{is found in}} recombinant bacterial genomes and an inactivated version of CcdA is inserted into a linearised plasmid vector. A short extra sequence {{is added to the}} gene of interest that activates the antitoxin when the insertion occurs. This method ensures orientation-specific gene insertion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> is {{the city}} of Berkeley, California. The tree {{protection}} ordinance prohibits the removal of coast live oak trees and any excessive pruning that can cause harm to the tree is also prohibited. The only exception is if the tree is poses a danger to life or limb and danger to the property.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> {{occurs in}} the French Defense after 1.e4 e6 2.e5, a move once {{advocated}} by Wilhelm Steinitz. If Black responds with 2...d5, White can capture the pawn enpassant with 3.exd6. Likewise, White can answer 2...f5 with 3.exf6e.p.|$|E
5000|$|Epiphylly: {{flowers and}} fruit develop [...] "on a leaf". A stem and a leaf are merged with one <b>another.</b> <b>Examples</b> include Monophyllaea in family Gesneriaceae and Helwingia in Helwingiaceae. Epiphylly also occurs in Bryophytes.|$|R
50|$|Hosoya {{index and}} Wiener index are global (integral) indices to {{describe}} entire molecule, Bonchev and Polansky introduced local (differential) index for every atom in a molecule. <b>Another</b> <b>examples</b> of local indices are modifications of Hosoya index.|$|R
50|$|Other {{compounds}} act on molecules {{important for}} the transmission of an action potential from one neuron to <b>another.</b> <b>Examples</b> of these include interfering with receptors for neurotransmitters or the enzymes that remove neurotransmitters not bound to receptors.|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> of a {{divergent}} electron {{transport chain}} is the alternative oxidase, which {{is found in}} plants, {{as well as some}} fungi, protists, and possibly some animals. This enzyme transfers electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> of {{an embargo}} is the United States embargo against Cuba. This {{is still an}} ongoing embargo, and, due to the declining {{situation}} and health of Cuba's people, the embargo has been subject to much protest.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> of {{differentiation}} of snake scales is a transparent scale called the brille or spectacle which covers {{the eye of}} the snake. The brille {{is often referred to as}} a fused eyelid. It is shed as part of the old skin during moulting.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are actually}} assemblies of multiple polypeptide chains. The quaternary structure {{refers to the}} number and arrangement of the protein subunits with respect to one <b>another.</b> <b>Examples</b> of proteins with quaternary structure include hemoglobin, DNA polymerase, and ion channels.|$|R
50|$|Here is <b>another</b> Interspel <b>example.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>examples</b> are the air {{transport}} systems of a country or a country's own {{air transport}} company. It is particularly important, because {{the quality of the}} airports and national airlines are also the measures of the state of development of the country.|$|R
5|$|Lee {{highlighted}} {{the failure of}} EMPG, the holding company for US publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and the potential impact on the Irish taxpayers of the loans given by Anglo Irish Bank to the investors in EMPG on 13 January 2010. Lee saw this as <b>another</b> <b>example</b> for the urgent need of {{an investigation into the}} Irish banking crisis.|$|E
5|$|Qualitative {{models are}} {{occasionally}} used. One example is qualitative scenario planning in which possible future events are played out. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> is non-numerical decision tree analysis. Qualitative models often suffer {{from lack of}} precision.|$|E
5|$|The Hassi R'Mel {{power station}} in Algeria, {{is an example}} of {{combining}} CSP with a gas turbine, where a 25-megawatt CSP-parabolic trough array supplements a much larger 130MW combined cycle gas turbine plant. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> is the Yazd power station in Iran.|$|E
5000|$|The {{expression}} and regulation of nif genes, while sharing common features in {{all or most}} of the nitrogen-fixing organisms in nature, have distinct characters and qualities that differ from one diazotroph to <b>another.</b> <b>Examples</b> of nif gene structure and regulation in different diazotrophs include: ...|$|R
60|$|The gentlemen drank again, one {{following}} <b>another's</b> <b>example.</b> Mr. Kernan {{seemed to}} be weighing something in his mind. He was impressed. He had a high opinion of Mr. Cunningham as a judge of character and as a reader of faces. He asked for particulars.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} is <b>another</b> constructive <b>example</b> of b-metric.|$|R
5|$|The Trinity Hall of Xuan Miao Temple (玄妙观), {{situated}} {{in the heart of}} Suzhou city, is <b>another</b> <b>example</b> of Song architecture. In 1982, it was established as a National Heritage Site by the Chinese government.|$|E
5|$|The {{classic example}} of a Type IIb {{supernova}} is Supernova 1993J, while <b>another</b> <b>example</b> is Cassiopeia A. The IIb class was first introduced (as a theoretical concept) by Woosley et al. in 1987, and the class was soon applied to SN 1987K and SN 1993J.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} of definition are considerable in some cases. For example, Haswell-Smith (2004) treats Lunga {{as a single}} island, although during high tides it becomes one inhabited island and numerous uninhabited tidal islets. <b>Another</b> <b>example</b> is the smaller island of Eilean Mòr in Loch Dunvegan, which joins with nearby Eilean Dubh and Garay Island at low tides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> notable <b>example</b> of anti-Markovnikov {{addition}} is hydroboration.|$|R
5000|$|Ecological {{facilitation}} {{describes how}} an organism {{profits from the}} presence of <b>another.</b> <b>Examples</b> are nurse plants, which provide shade for new seedlings or saplings (e.g. using an orange tree to provide shade for a newly planted coffee plant), or plants providing shelter from wind chill in arctic environments.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes a {{narrative}} portrays a team sport in which several or {{all members of}} the team are contenders, and their success (or otherwise) is based, at least in part, on whether or not those team members provide sufficient guidance and support for one <b>another.</b> <b>Examples</b> of team contenders include: ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> is the Asociación Acueducto de Río Negro de Popayán, {{which was}} formed 10years ago {{integrating}} 10 supply systems, supplying 7,000 residential connections. The association is preparing its own {{water treatment plant}} and preparing to install meters {{with the aid of}} the Colombian organization Asociados en Desarrollo Rural (ADR) or Associates in Rural Development and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>example</b> is the Great Vowel Shift in English, {{which is}} the reason that the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Asda's latest {{attempt to}} draw {{attention}} to themselves involves trying to leap on the Harry Potter bandwagon. This is just <b>another</b> <b>example</b> of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and {{have nothing to do with}} Bloomsbury Publishing or Harry Potter and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.|$|E
