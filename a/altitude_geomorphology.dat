40|$|AbstractThe Dulce Creek Basin (1000 km 2) is {{situated}} in the Buenos Aires's Sate and flows into the Mar Chiquita lagoon, (MAB Biosphere Reserve – UNESCO). While land cover on the upper basin is dominated by field crops, the low basin is mostly occupied by livestock grazing systems. The increased use of inputs (agricultural intensification), and {{a high degree of}} riverside vegetation's degradation in the grazing zone, represent an increasing pollution risk for surface water bodies and groundwater. The aim of this work was to find suitable driving factors for a dynamic land cover simulation model (Dyna-CLUE) since 1997 to 2005 using logit regression models. Land cover change (Crop, Pasture, Grassland, and Others) was simulated using eleven driving factors accounting for geographic, climatic and soil and infrastructure features. We assessed multicolinearity from the Pearson correlation matrix, and only uncorrelated variables were applied in the logistic regression. Waterlogging, <b>altitude,</b> <b>geomorphology</b> and soil productivity were the main driving factors for the predictions of land cover dynamics, as selected from logistic models. The land-cover simulation model was run according to the actual trends of agricultural expansion. The accuracy of predictive models was tested using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the good fit showed by the Dyna-CLUE model to data, support its suitability for simulation of land cover dynamics of the Dulce Creek Basin. The expected trajectory of land cover according to current trends warns about a progressive decrease of grasslands cover, and the associated loss of their ecosystem services. Further simulations upon alternative scenarios can help land use planning for production and conservation objectives...|$|E
40|$|Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) is an oilseed with {{potential}} {{for use as}} a raw material in second-generation biofuels. Camelina has a seed yield of up to 2380 kg·ha− 1 and contains around 45 % fatty acids. Selection of a suitable site is critical for production optimization. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine Chilean agro-climatic suitability for establishing camelina as a productive alternative. Climate and soil requirements and geographical restraints were evaluated for the species, considering the climatological characteristics of its regions of origin, as well as regions where camelina is successfully grown in the rest of the world. The variables considered included factors (maximum temperatures of the warmest month, water deficits, and degree days) and limitations (<b>altitude,</b> <b>geomorphology,</b> and current land use), which permitted the evaluation of the national territory for a certain level of suitability. It was determined that 1. 3 % of the national territory (960, 664 ha) has some degree of suitability for camelina adoption. Between the Biobío and Los Lagos regions, 49. 0 % of the land (471, 203 ha) is in the category of no thermic restrictions, with mild water restrictions, and mild soil restrictions or without information, which can be used for camelina production. The Los Ríos region has 21. 4 % surface area (321, 176 ha) with some level of suitability for camelina, the most suitable region to establish this crop in Chile. This research has provided valuable information applicable to new species and geographic areas which facilitate the adaptation of agricultural and forestry production to global changes...|$|E

50|$|While {{the great}} inlet of the Bay of Kotor winds {{deep into the}} High-Karst zone of Mt. Orjen, Mediterranean climate penetrates far inland. Profound {{mixtures}} of species {{from more than one}} climatic zone and in addition endemic and stenoendemic species and special vegetation types with marked transitional vegetation units restricted exclusively to ecotons of humid (Csa) subtropical and hyper humid oceanic- (Cfs) climates are especially notable. Mediterranean cyclones and sirocco storms are accountable for the heavy precipitation (up to 5000 mm/m2 at Crkvice, 940 m AMSL) that feeds the luxuriant and hyper-humid type of eastern Mediterranean vegetation comparable to colchidia-hyrcanian formations of the Caucasus and Asia Minor in the exceptionally damp and mild climate of the Montenegrin coast. While humidity generally increases with altitude, the vegetational structure of transects on Orjen varies through a combination of ranges of warmth and humidity where <b>altitude,</b> exposition, <b>geomorphology</b> and pedology correlate with specific alliances in the vegetation. At coast level at Risan with up to 3500 mm/m² precipitation per year the perhumid eumediterranean climate variant is established (Cs’’a climate; s’’= double winter rain season. According to the Köppen climate classification). Rain augments in the supra- to oromediterranean life zone (Crkvice at 940 m) to 4926 mm/m²a (Cfsb climate; fs= without summer dryness), while the higher summits of the alti- and kryomediterranean life zone receive more than 6000 mm/m² per year and are constituents of mediterranean snowclimates (Dfsc) heavily influenced by bora and sirocco storm winds.|$|R
30|$|Previous studies rarely {{discussed}} probabilistic {{analyses of}} pluvial floods. Natural parameters {{are the most}} effective contributing factors associated with pluvial flood probability; these factors include land use (LU) types, magnitude of intensity precipitation, <b>geomorphology,</b> <b>altitude,</b> surface slope, and hydrological characteristics {{and should not be}} overlooked [3]. Though understanding PFF risk in urban is highly on demand, to date, a few studies struggled to model the potential area of PFFs in urban infrastructures. This difficulty may be due to lack of sufficient observations and precise data, struggle in systematic PFF modeling dynamics, and complexity of quantifying inundation model by spatial heterogeneity caused by rainfalls [19]. Basically, flood modeling mostly relies on water-level gauging and meteorological station historical data, which feature some drawbacks. Stations are not well distributed among study areas and are placed on river sites which cannot record the amount of surface water outside rivers; lack of sufficient number of stations used as historical inventory data also limits PFF probability and surface runoff simulation studies [20]. Intensity–duration–frequency curves are one of the gauging station-based traditional approaches for quantifying probability of rainfall events. However, stochastic, probabilistic, and spatial rainfall simulators were also established to accurately define possible precipitation spatial coverage and intensity and probability of pluvial occurrence instead of traditional approaches [21, 22, 23].|$|R
40|$|The need to map {{vegetation}} communities {{over large}} areas for nature conservation and {{to predict the}} impact of environmental change on vegetation distributions, has stimulated the development of techniques for predictive vegetation mapping. Predictive vegetation studies start {{with the development of}} a model relating vegetation units and mapped physical data, followed by the application of that model to a geographic database and over a wide range of spatial scales. This field is particularly important for identifying sites for rare and endangered species and locations of high biodiversity such as many areas of the Mediterranean Basin. The potential of the approach is illustrated with a mapping exercise in the alti-meditterranean zone of Lefka Ori in Crete. The study established {{the nature of the relationship}} between vegetation communities and physical data including <b>altitude,</b> slope and <b>geomorphology.</b> In this way the knowledge of community distribution was improved enabling a GIS-based model capable of predicting community distribution to be constructed. The paper describes the development of the spatial model and the methodological problems of predictive mapping for monitoring Mediterranean ecosystems. The paper concludes with a discussion of the role of predictive vegetation mapping and other spatial techniques, such as fuzzy mapping and geostatistics, for improving our understanding of the dynamics of Mediterranean ecosystems and for practical management in a region that is under increasing pressure from human impact...|$|R
40|$|The Appellations of Origin “Jerez-Xérès-Sherry ” and “Manzanilla-Sanlúcar de Barrameda ” occupy one of {{the oldest}} and most world renowned viticultural areas in the peninsula, but it is not exempt from the serious {{problems}} that are to be found throughout the sector. In order to try to adapt to the present situation, zoning plans are being promoted whereby priority is given to the quality of the product, sustainable development and the economic interests. This work undertakes an approach to the viticultural zoning. The nutritional state of the grapevines is studied by means of foliage analysis at veraison. The quality of production was measured by means of the berry weight and the analysis of the most usual variables of the must at the time of harvest (°Baumé, pH and titratable acidity) over five seasons, in the 21 plots where the soil profiles were opened for analysis. As a result of applying statistical analysis, the plots are grouped into five classes, two of which are subdivided. The most significant differences were established between the plots of class CL 1, on Miocene limestone, and those of class CL 5, on Pliocene-Quaternary sands and clays. Class CL 1 presented the highest content of ash (mean ± sd CL 1; CL 5) (15. 36 ± 1. 73; 12. 36 ± 1. 77) and calcium (3. 42 ± 0. 90; 2. 65 ± 0. 72), the lowest berry weight (2. 10 ± 0. 30; 2. 47 ± 0. 50) and a greater Baumé degree (10. 55 ± 0. 86; 9. 63 ± 0. 98) than the CL 5. This new approach takes other essential factors for the quality of the production into account such as the climate and the <b>geomorphology</b> (<b>altitude,</b> slope, and physiography).

40|$|The {{northern}} Antarctic Peninsula {{has recently}} exhibited ice-shelf disintegration, glacier recession and acceleration. However, the dynamic response of land-terminating, ice-shelf tributary and tidewater glaciers {{has not yet}} been quantified or assessed for variability, and there are sparse data for glacier classification, morphology, area, length or altitude. This paper firstly classifies the area, length, <b>altitude,</b> slope, aspect, <b>geomorphology,</b> type and hypsometry of 194 glaciers on Trinity Peninsula, Vega Island and James Ross Island in 2009 AD. Secondly, this paper documents glacier change 1988 – 2009. In 2009, the glacierised area was 8140 &plusmn; 262 km 2 . From 1988 – 2001, 90 % of glaciers receded, and from 2001 – 2009, 79 % receded. This equates to an area change of − 4. 4 % for Trinity Peninsula eastern coast glaciers, − 0. 6 % for western coast glaciers, and − 35. 0 % for ice-shelf tributary glaciers from 1988 – 2001. Tidewater glaciers on the drier, cooler eastern Trinity Peninsula experienced fastest shrinkage from 1988 – 2001, with limited frontal change after 2001. Glaciers on the western Trinity Peninsula shrank less than those on the east. Land-terminating glaciers on James Ross Island shrank fastest in the period 1988 – 2001. This east-west difference is largely a result of orographic temperature and precipitation gradients across the Antarctic Peninsula, with warming temperatures affecting the precipitation-starved glaciers on the eastern coast more than on the western coast. Reduced shrinkage on the western Peninsula may be a result of higher snowfall, perhaps in conjunction with the fact that these glaciers are mostly grounded. Rates of area loss on the eastern side of Trinity Peninsula are slowing, which we attribute to the floating ice tongues receding into the fjords and reaching a new dynamic equilibrium. The rapid shrinkage of tidewater glaciers on James Ross Island is likely to continue because of their low elevations and flat profiles. In contrast, the higher and steeper tidewater glaciers on the eastern Antarctic Peninsula will attain more stable frontal positions after low-lying ablation areas are removed, reaching equilibrium more quickly...|$|R

In this work, a phytosociological view of sandy environments of the Peruvian coastal desert is presented. According to the Braun-Blanquet method, we have made up 32 phytosociological inventories and added 138 ones from others authors. In each inventory, we have analyzed its floristic composition and ecological parameters, as <b>altitude,</b> soil and <b>geomorphology.</b> All releves were synthesized in a table to deduce the different associations, higher phytosociological units, and the distribution of its flora along the Peruvian coast and the Andean Cordillera. Using the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, the diversity of this flora is discussed making a comparison with historical data about the use of the territory with livestock during pre-Inca and Inca cultures, and Spanish invasion. As a result, two associations from Southern Peru -Nolanetum scaposo-spathulatae and Palauetum camanensis-weberbaueri-, two alliances -Nolanion humifusae from central Peru, and Nolanion spathulatae from the Southern Peru- and a new order -Tetragonio crystallinae- Plantaginetalia limensis- are described. In Nolanetum scaposo-spathulatae, Dictyophragnus englerianus, Leptoglossis lomana, Nolana scaposa, N. spathulata, Palaua velutina and Tetragonia vestita are the main characteristics, while in Palauetum camanensis-weberbaueri association N. scaposa and P. velutina are replaced by Palaua camanensis and P. weberbaueri. Nolanion humifusae alliance integrates species as Geranium limae, Hymenocallis amancaes, Nolana humifusa, N. latipes, Palaua rhombifolia or Villanova oppositifolia.

De acuerdo con el método de Braun-Blanquet, hemos levantado 32 inventarios fitosociológicos a los que hemos añadido 138 procedentes de la bibliografía. En cada inventario, hemos analizado la composición florística y distintos parámetros ecológicos, como la altitud, el suelo y la geomorfología. Todos los inventarios fueron sintetizados en una tabla para deducir las asociaciones, las unidades fitosociológicas superiores y el origen de su flora. Como resultado, describimos dos nuevas asociaciones del sur del Perú -Nolanetum scaposo-spathulatae y Palauetum camanensis- weberbaueri, dos alianzas -Nolanion humifusae, del centro del Perú, y Nolanion spathulatae del sur del Perú-, y un nuevo orden -Tetragonio crystallinae-Plantaginetalia limensis-. También se presenta la vegetación de las quebradas en el contexto de las comunidades de riberas de la costa y su alteración por las dunas. Después de la aplicación del índice de Shannon-Wiener sobre las columnas de la tabla sintética, podemos deducir que el aumento de especies ruderales andinas y europeas en la costa central del Perú se ha visto favorecido por una actividad ganadera intensiva. La trashumancia entre los Andes y la costa, desde tiempos preincaicos hasta la actualidad, ha producido la dispersión zoócora de plantas altoandinas hacia la costa; la presencia de plantas europeas tuvo su origen en la colonización española de la costa del Perú.
