5|$|Ant Island is <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> <b>of</b> ants {{led by the}} Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, {{they are}} forced to give food to a gang of marauding {{grasshoppers}} led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to remove him and send him off.|$|E
5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> <b>of</b> emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also {{known as the}} turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E

5|$|Aventicum (Avenches) {{was likely}} {{the capital of}} the Helvetii since its {{founding}} {{at the beginning of the}} 1st century. In the 40s, it benefited from the traffic brought over the St Bernard pass over a street expanded by Claudius, and in 71 it acquired the status of a Roman colony and of an allied city. This is believed to have been a favor of Vespasian for the city in which he had lived for a time, or a measure to better control the Helvetii after the events of 69 by implanting <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> <b>of</b> veterans in their midst.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{was one of}} the {{original}} Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on January 9, 1788.

It maintained its Western Reserve until 1800, at which time it was reassigned to the Northwest Territory.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to drown out the noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> <b>of</b> red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E

5|$|During the Civil War {{the largest}} {{substantial}} {{conflict in the}} area was the Battle of Naseby in 1645, although a minor skirmish in the town resulted {{in the killing of}} a parliamentarian officer Captain John Sawyer. Severe reprisals followed which included the carrying off to Northampton of the parish priest, Thomas Jones, and 40 prisoners by a group of Roundheads. However, after the Civil War Wellingborough was home to <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> <b>of</b> Diggers. Little is known about this period.|$|E
5|$|Every spring {{over two}} million {{waterfowl}} pass Matsalu, including 10,000—20,000 Bewick's swans, 10,000 greater scaups, common goldeneyes, tufted ducks, goosanders and many others. <b>A</b> <b>colony</b> <b>of</b> up to 20,000 barnacle geese, over 10,000 greylag geese {{and thousands of}} waders stop on the coastal pastures in spring. The most numerous birds of passage (around 1.6 million) are long-tailed ducks. Approximately 35,000—40,000 ducks feed in the reedbeds in spring. In autumn, about 300,000 migratory waterfowl pass Matsalu. The wetland is the biggest autumn stopping ground of common cranes in Europe. The highest recorded number of cranes at the park has been 23,000.|$|E
5|$|Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Company {{was accused}} of mismanagement, and Bombay reverted to the British Crown. On 2 August 1858, the British Parliament began {{abolition}} of the Company and asserted full, direct Crown authority over India. The execution was slow. The Company for purposes of liquidation maintained its formal existence until 1874. India was thereafter directly ruled by the Crown as <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> <b>of</b> the United Kingdom, and officially known as the Empire of India after 1876. India consisted of some regions referred to as British India that were directly administered by the British and other regions called the Princely States that were ruled by Indian rulers.|$|E

5|$|In 1843, {{the manor}} house was {{destroyed}} by fire, news of which was carried in The Illustrated London News. The estate passed into the Court of Chancery and was purchased by Daniel Higford Davall Burr. In 1848, Burr commissioned {{the building of a}} neoclassical mansion to the south west of the original building. Burr saved the 17th-century manor's wooden staircase, though all that remains of the building is a staircase to the cellar (which is now home to <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> <b>of</b> bats). By 1851 the new building was complete, costing £20,000 and having a Tudor-like appearance. Burr held the estate until his death 50 years later, when was inherited by his son, who sold it in 1893.|$|E
5|$|Many wars were fought {{during the}} 17th century between the slave trading {{companies}} for {{areas that were}} economically dependent on slaves. The West India Company gained many slaves through these wars (specifically with Portugal) by captains who had captured enemy ships; between 1623 and 1637, 2,336 were captured and sold in the New World by the West India Company. The selling of slaves to the New World opened up trading posts in North America; the Dutch opened their first on Manhattan Island in 1613. The West India Company had also opened a trading post in the Caribbean and the company was also carrying slaves to <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> <b>of</b> New Netherland.|$|E
5|$|Princess Elsa of Arendelle {{possesses}} cryokinetic magic, often {{using it}} to play with her younger sister, Anna. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, rush both siblings to <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> <b>of</b> trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsa’s magic, warning Elsa that she must learn to control her powers. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts out Anna, causing a rift between them. Elsa suppresses her magic rather than mastering it, causing her to become more insecure. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.|$|E
