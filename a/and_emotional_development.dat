5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>development.</b> A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E

25|$|In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Tom {{is only a}} minor {{character}} and {{is used as a}} foil for Huck, particularly in the later chapters of the novel after Huck makes his way to Uncle Phelps's plantation. Tom's immaturity, imagination, and obsession with stories put Huck's planned rescue of the runaway slave Jim in great jeopardy — and ultimately make it unnecessary, since he knows Jim's owner has died and freed him in her will. Throughout the novel, Huck's intellectual <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>development</b> is a central theme, and by re-introducing a character from the beginning (Tom), Twain is able to highlight this evolution in Huck's character.|$|E
25|$|C-PTSD is also {{characterized}} by attachment disorder, particularly the pervasive insecure, or disorganized-type attachment. DSM-IV (1994) dissociative disorders and PTSD {{do not include}} insecure attachment in their criteria. As a consequence of this aspect of C-PTSD, when some adults with C-PTSD become parents and confront their own children's attachment needs, they may have particular difficulty in responding sensitively especially to their infants' and young children's routine distress—such as during routine separations, despite these parents' best intentions and efforts. Although {{the great majority of}} survivors do not abuse others, this difficulty in parenting may have adverse repercussions for their children's social <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>development</b> if parents with this condition and their children do not receive appropriate treatment.|$|E

For students with limited writing confidence and proficiency, the opportunity to express ideas and thoughts with teacher elaboration and modeling, and without correction, {{has been shown to}} increase their time on task, writing length, and writing quality. Using a single-subject baseline and intervention design, Anderson, Nelson, Richardson, Webb, and Young explored the value of dialogue journals in developing a more supportive student-teacher relationship with emotionally and behaviorally challenged middle school students.|$|E

25|$|By rationally {{seeking the}} truth, {{thinking}} freely, holding free discussions and testing teachings and authorities, freethinkers strive towards the full {{development of the}} human personality, {{with the emphasis on}} moral and rational conscience. This includes amongst other things an atheistic worldview, the choice for solidarity with fellow human beings, and the realisation that life is finite and a one-off occurrence. Also, physical <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>development</b> is considered important for a healthy and happy life. Precisely because life is finite, it is unique and valuable, and should be experienced to the fullest. Emotionally, one needs to cope with doubt, because the critical examination of one's own dearly held beliefs, and letting go of them if they turn out to be false, is necessary to seek the truth.|$|E

25|$|Masturbation among {{adolescents}} contributes to them developing {{a sense of}} mastery over sexual impulses, {{and it has a}} role in the physical <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>development</b> of prepubescents and pubescents. Babies and toddlers will play with their genitals {{in much the same way}} as they play with their ears or toes. If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or yeast infection, or the child may be overstimulated and in need of soothing, or indeed understimulated and bored. Alongside many other factors, such as medical evidence, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexualized play or aggression, and precocious or seductive behavior, excessive masturbation may alternatively be an indicator of sexual abuse.|$|E
