25|$|A common {{technique}} involves engineering {{a sequence}} of 6 to 8 histidines into the N- or C-terminal of the protein. The polyhistidine binds strongly to divalent metal ions such as nickel and cobalt. The protein can be passed through a column containing immobilized nickel ions, which binds the polyhistidine tag. All untagged proteins pass through the column. The protein can be eluted with imidazole, which competes with the polyhistidine tag for binding to the column, or by a decrease in pH (typically to 4.5), which decreases the affinity of the tag for the resin. While this procedure is generally used for the purification of recombinant proteins with an engineered <b>affinity</b> <b>tag</b> (such as a 6xHis tag or Clontech's HAT tag), {{it can also be}} used for natural proteins with an inherent affinity for divalent cations.|$|E
50|$|A gene {{construct}} is created containing the protein of interest fused to a TEV protease recognition site, {{followed by an}} <b>affinity</b> <b>tag,</b> such as a Polyhistidine-tag. Following affinity chromatography, the purified protein is then treated with TEV protease. TEV protease cleaves at its recognition site, removing the <b>affinity</b> <b>tag.</b> This allows for affinity purification of proteins that are not well-behaved when fused to protein tags.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{advances}} in bioorthogonal ligation methods have provided {{new opportunities for}} proteomic analysis of newly synthesized proteins, posttranslational modifications, and specific enzyme families using azide/alkyne-functionalized chemical reporters and activity-based probes. Efficient enrichment and elution of azide/alkyne-labeled proteins with selectively cleavable <b>affinity</b> <b>tags</b> are essential for protein identification and quantification applications. Here, we report the synthesis and comparative analysis of Na 2 S 2 O 4 -cleavable azobenzene-based <b>affinity</b> <b>tags</b> for bioorthogonal chemical proteomics. We demonstrated that ortho-hydroxyl substituent is required for efficient azobenzene-bond cleavage and show that these cleavable <b>affinity</b> <b>tags</b> {{can be used to}} identify newly synthesized proteins in bacteria targeted by amino acid chemical reporters as well as their sites of modification on endogenously expressed proteins. The azobenzene-based <b>affinity</b> <b>tags</b> are compatible with in-gel, in-solution, and on-bead enrichment strategies and should afford useful tools for diverse bioorthogonal proteomic applications...|$|R

50|$|Metal-coded <b>affinity</b> <b>tag</b> is {{a method}} used for {{quantitative}} proteomics by mass spectrometry that uses a metal chelate complex 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetate (DOTA) coupled to different lanthanide ions. The metal complexes attach to the cysteine residues of proteins in a sample.|$|E
5000|$|The probe protein {{can then}} be visualized through the usual methods - [...] it may be radiolabelled; it may bear a {{specific}} <b>affinity</b> <b>tag</b> like His or FLAG for which antibodies exist; or {{there may be a}} protein specific antibody (to the probe protein).|$|E
50|$|Affinity tags {{have been}} widely used to purify {{recombinant}} proteins, as they allow the accumulation of recombinant protein with little impurities. However, the <b>affinity</b> <b>tag</b> must be removed by proteases in the final purification step. The extra proteolysis step raises the problems of protease specificity in removing affinity tags from recombinant protein, and the removal of the digestion product. This problem can be avoided by fusing an <b>affinity</b> <b>tag</b> to self-cleavable inteins in a controlled environment. The first generation of expression vectors of this kind used modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae VMA (Sce VMA) intein. Chong et al. used a chitin binding domain (CBD) from Bacillus circulans as an <b>affinity</b> <b>tag,</b> and fused this tag with a modified Sce VMA intein. The modified intein undergoes a self-cleavage reaction at its N-terminal peptide linkage with 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), or cystine at low temperatures over a broad pH range. After expressing the recombinant protein, the cell homogenate is passed through the column containing chitin. This allows the CBD of the chimeric protein to bind to the column. Furthermore, when the temperature is lowered and the molecules described above pass through the column, the chimeric protein undergoes self-splicing and only the target protein is eluted. This novel technique eliminates the need for a proteolysis step, and modified Sce VMA stays in column attached to chitin through CBD.|$|E

50|$|<b>Affinity</b> <b>tags</b> are {{appended}} to proteins so {{that they}} can be purified from their crude biological source using an affinity technique. These include chitin binding protein (CBP), maltose binding protein (MBP), Strep-tag and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The poly(His) tag is a widely used protein tag; it binds to metal matrices.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{the small}} noncoding RNA (sRNA) {{expression}} levels and regulatory properties will {{be influenced by}} MS2 tag. Also, by using MS2 as an <b>affinity</b> <b>tag</b> to purify a protein in E. coli bacteria, scientists expressed MS2-MBP, which is an MS2 coat protein carrying mutations fused with maltose-binding proteins. The mutations prevented oligomerization.|$|E
50|$|For {{quantitative}} MS, {{a commonly}} applied approach is isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT), which uses two reagents with heavy and light isotopes, respectively, and a biotin <b>affinity</b> <b>tag</b> to modify cysteine containing peptides. This {{technology has been}} used to label whole Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, and, in conjunction with mass spectrometry, helped lay the foundation of quantitative proteomics.|$|E
50|$|Enteropeptidase's {{specificity}} {{makes it}} an ideal tool in biochemical applications; a fusion protein containing a C-terminal <b>affinity</b> <b>tag</b> (such as poly-His) linked by this sequence can be cleaved by enteropeptidase to obtain the target protein following protein purification. On the converse, the N-terminal pro-sequence of proteases that must be cleaved prior to activation can be mutated to enable activation with enteropeptidase.|$|E

30|$|Self-cleaving tags are {{a special}} group of fusion tags {{that are based}} on protein modules (e.g., intein, SrtA, the FrpC module, and the Cys {{protease}} domain) and possess inducible proteolytic activities. Fusion proteins containing them can be site-specifically self-cleaved by the trigger of a low molecular weight compound or a change in its conformation. Combined with appropriate <b>affinity</b> <b>tags,</b> self-cleaving tags enable fusion protein purification, cleavage and target protein separation to be achieved in a single step [332].|$|R
50|$|An Isotope-coded <b>affinity</b> <b>tag</b> (ICAT) is an isotopic {{labeling}} {{method used}} for quantitative proteomics by mass spectrometry that uses chemical labeling reagents. These chemical probes consist of three elements: a reactive group for labeling an amino acid side chain (e.g., iodoacetamide to modify cysteine residues), an isotopically coded linker, and a tag (e.g., biotin) for the affinity isolation of labeled proteins/peptides.|$|E
5000|$|Fluorous {{chemistry}} {{involves the}} use of perfluorinated compounds or perfluorinated substituents to facilitate recovery of a catalyst or reaction product. Perfluorinated groups impart unique physical properties including high solubility in perfluorinated solvents. This property can be useful in organic synthesis and separation methods such as solid phase extraction. [...] In practice, a perfluorinated alkyl group is incorporated into an otherwise conventional organic reagent as an <b>affinity</b> <b>tag.</b> These reagents can then be separated from organic solvents by extraction with fluorinated solvents such as perfluorohexane.|$|E
50|$|The second {{quantitative}} approach uses stable isotope tags to differentially label proteins {{from two different}} complex mixtures. Here, the proteins within a complex mixture are labeled first isotopically, and then digested to yield labeled peptides. The labeled mixtures are then combined, the peptides separated by multidimensional liquid chromatography and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Isotope coded <b>affinity</b> <b>tag</b> (ICAT) reagents are the widely used isotope tags. In this method, the cysteine residues of proteins get covalently attached to the ICAT reagent, thereby reducing {{the complexity of the}} mixtures omitting the non-cysteine residues.|$|E
50|$|Solubilization tags are used, {{especially}} for recombinant proteins expressed in chaperone-deficient {{species such as}} E. coli, {{to assist in the}} proper folding in proteins and keep them from precipitating.

50|$|MBP {{is used to}} {{increase}} the solubility of recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. In these systems, the protein of interest is often expressed as a MBP-fusion protein, preventing aggregation of the protein of interest. The mechanism by which MBP increases solubility is not well understood. In addition, MBP can itself {{be used as an}} <b>affinity</b> <b>tag</b> for purification of recombinant proteins. The fusion protein binds to amylose columns while all other proteins flow through. The MBP-protein fusion can be purified by eluting the column with maltose. Once the fusion protein is obtained in purified form, the protein of interest (X) is often cleaved from MBP with a specific protease. Protein X can then be separated from MBP by affinity chromatography.|$|E

40|$|Polystyrene surface-binding {{peptides}} (PSBPs) {{are useful}} as <b>affinity</b> <b>tags</b> {{to build a}} highly effective ELISA system. However, they are also a quite common type of target-unrelated peptides (TUPs) in the panning of phage-displayed random peptide library. As TUP, PSBP will mislead the analysis of panning results if not identified. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} find a way to quickly and easily foretell if a peptide is likely to be a PSBP or not. In this paper, we describe PSBinder, a predictor based on SVM. To our knowledge, it is the first web server for predicting PSBP. The SVM model was built with the feature of optimized dipeptide composition and 87. 02 % (MCC = 0. 74; AUC = 0. 91) of peptides were correctly classified by fivefold cross-validation. PSBinder can be used to exclude highly possible PSBP from biopanning results or to find novel candidates for polystyrene <b>affinity</b> <b>tags.</b> Either way, it is valuable for biotechnology community...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the main}} uses of this protein is for {{removing}} <b>affinity</b> <b>tags</b> from purified recombinant fusion proteins. The reason {{for the use of}} TEV protease as a biochemical tool is its high sequence specificity. This specificity allows for the controlled cleavage of proteins when the preference sequence is inserted into flexible loops. It also makes it relatively non-toxic in vivo as the recognized sequence scarcely occurs in proteins.|$|R

50|$|Chemical {{synthesis}} of affinity tags has been {{crucial to the}} maturation of quantitative proteomics. iTRAQ, Tandem mass tags (TMT) and Isotope-coded <b>affinity</b> <b>tag</b> (ICAT) are protein mass-tags that consist of a covalently attaching group, a mass (isobaric or isotopic) encoded linker and a handle for isolation. Varying mass-tags bind to different proteins {{as a sort of}} footprint such that when analyzing cells of differing perturbations, the levels of each protein can be compared relatively after enrichment by the introduced handle. Other methods include SILAC and heavy isotope labeling. These methods have been adapted to identify complexing proteins by labeling a bait protein, pulling it down and analyzing the proteins it has complexed. Another method creates an internal tag by introducing novel amino acids that are genetically encoded in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. These modifications create a new level of control and can facilitate photocrosslinking to probe protein-protein interactions. In addition, keto, acetylene, azide, thioester, boronate, and dehydroalanine- containing amino acids can be used to selectively introduce tags, and novel chemical functional groups into proteins.|$|E
50|$|The HaloTag is a {{modified}} bacterial enzyme designed to covalently bind to a synthetic ligand {{of choice and}} fuse to a protein of interest. The synthetic ligand is chosen {{from a number of}} available ligands in accordance with the type of experiments to be performed. This bacterial enzyme is a haloalkane dehalogenase, which acts as a hydrolase and is designed to facilitate visualization of the subcellular localization of a protein of interest, immobilization of a protein of interest, or capture of the binding partners of a protein of interest within its biochemical environment. The HaloTag is composed of two covalently bound segments including a haloalkane dehalogenase and a synthetic ligand of choice. These synthetic ligands consist of a reactive chloroalkane linker bound to a functional group. Functional groups can either be biotin (can be used as an <b>affinity</b> <b>tag)</b> or can be chosen from five available fluorescent dyes including Coumarin, Oregon Green, Alexa Fluor 488, diAcFAM, and TMR. These fluorescent dyes can be used in the visualization of either living or chemically fixed cells.|$|E
40|$|Fructosyltransferases, {{like the}} Lactobacillus reteri levansucrase, are {{important}} {{for the production of}} new fructosyloligosaccharides. Various His 6 - and Strep-tagged variants of this enzyme were recombinantly produced and exported into the growth medium using the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium. Nutrient-rich growth medium significantly enhanced levansucrase production and export. The B. megaterium signal peptide of the extracellular esterase LipA mediated better levansucrase export compared to the one of the penicillin amidase Pac. The combination of protein export via the LipA signal peptide with the coexpression of the signal peptidase gene sipM further increased the levansucrase secretion. Fused <b>affinity</b> <b>tags</b> allowed the efficient one-step purification of the recombinant proteins from the growth medium. However, fused peptide tags led to slightly decreased secretion of tested fusion proteins. After upscaling 2 to 3 mg <b>affinity</b> <b>tagged</b> levansucrase per liter culture medium was produced and exported. Up to 1 mg of His 6 -tagged and 0. 7 mg of Strep-tagged levansucrase per liter were recovered by affinity chromatography. Finally, the purified levansucrase was shown to synthesize new fructosyloligosaccharides from the novel donor substrates D-Gal-Fru, D-Xyl-Fru, D-Man-Fru, and D-Fuc-Fru. ...|$|R
40|$|Metal <b>affinity</b> <b>tags</b> {{have been}} fused to {{proteins}} and demonstrated {{to function as}} tools in protein purification, protein stabilisation, quantitative metal analysis and metal tolerance of bacteria and plants. In biotechnological applications proteins frequently have to function in nonnatural environments with harsh conditions which impose requirements for high stability on the proteins. Metal <b>affinity</b> <b>tags</b> fused to the N-terminal of lactate dehydrogenase increased {{the stability of the}} enzyme under thermal and urea denaturing conditions in the presence of metal ions. Metal <b>affinity</b> <b>tags</b> have frequently been used in purification of proteins with immobilised metal affinity chromatography. The most commonly used tag contains six consecutive histidines. Other tags comprising less histidines may offer less impact on protein activity, stability and expression level. Moreover, a higher degree of selectivity and thus purity may be obtained. A tag folding into an a-helix with surface exposed histidines (His-X 3 -His-X 3 -His), where X is any amino acid, was fused to the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and expressed in tobacco. The amount of lactate dehydrogenase produced in transgenic tobacco was increased as compared to a His 6 tagged enzyme. Plants can be used as bioreactors for the production of technical and industrially interesting enzymes. The applicability of producing enzymes in plants is partly determined by the availability of a good purification method. His tagged lactate dehydrogenase was produced in transgenic tobacco and the enzymes could be purified from a crude extract with metal affinity chromatography and metal <b>affinity</b> precipitation. His <b>tagged</b> glucose isomerase was expressed in transgenic potato tubers and the fructose levels were increased in the tubers. Pollution of heavy metals is an increasing environmental problem. The use of micro-organisms and plants for bioremediation has been proposed as an alternative to conventional methods. By expressing metal binding proteins and peptides in bacteria and plants the metal tolerance or accumulation of the organism can be increased. A cadmium binding hexapeptide, His-Ser-Gln-Lys-Val-Phe, was selected from a phage display peptide library. Expression of this peptide on the surface or intracellularly increased the metal tolerance of Escherichia coli. The cadmium binding peptide fused to the N-terminal of green fluorescent protein also endowed tobacco plants with an increased cadmium tolerance. Metal <b>affinity</b> <b>tags</b> fused to green fluorescent protein was demonstrated to function in quantification of transition metal (nickel, copper and zinc) and cadmium ions. The cadmium binding peptide and a His 6 tag were fused to the N-terminal of green fluorescent protein and the amount of metal ions could be determined as the relative decrease in fluorescence intensity of green fluorescent protein...|$|R
