5|$|Both {{factions in}} Day of Defeat: Source {{have access to}} six classes. Each class is {{designed}} with specific combat circumstances in mind, so that teams must use teamwork to succeed. The weapons and equipment carried by the classes {{are based on the}} weapons used by both the US Army and Wehrmacht during World War II. Some of classes <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with pistols—the American M1911 or the German Walther P38—while others are equipped with trench knives or entrenching tools for melee combat. Grenades are carried by a number of classes, depending on their role in the game—riflemen are equipped with rifle grenades, the assault classes <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with a single fragmentation grenade and a smoke grenade for providing concealment, while support classes have access to two standard fragmentation grenades. Riflemen <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with the M1 Garand or the Karabiner 98 kurz and are designed for medium to long range combat, while the assault classes carries the M1 Thompson or the MP40 which are only effective in close quarters. The support classes are designed for medium range combat, equipped with either the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle or the StG44. Snipers are used for attacking enemy targets from long range, and are consequently armed with the Springfield M1903 or the Karabiner 98k both equipped with long range scopes. Machine gunners carries the M1919 Browning or the MG42 to defend key locations on a level or to provide a base of fire for their team's advance. Machine gunners are required to deploy their weapons on bipods before firing in order to compensate for the machine gun's extreme recoil. The final class is armed with a Bazooka or a Panzerschreck, used in the game to displace enemy machine gun or sniper positions. This class is armed with either an M1 carbine or Mauser M712 to defend themselves with when moving.|$|E
5|$|When invading another's house, {{the player}} can attempt to deter these {{defenses}} in such ways as smashing windows, dismantling walls, short-circuiting machines, and even drugging guard dogs with tainted meat, {{in addition to}} killing any residents that <b>are</b> <b>armed.</b> Reaching a vault is always possible with enough skill; the game forces players to escape their own traps before other players can access them. Being caught in one's own traps has the same consequence as any other trap in the game: permadeath.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{sea anemone}} {{is a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near {{the surface of the}} water. The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
50|$|The tower itself <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with a 24-pounder gun and two 24-pounder short guns. In {{front of}} the tower there was a paved redoubt that <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with three 24-pounder guns.|$|R
50|$|The upper {{platform}} <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> {{with five}} iron guns, two 6-inch mortars and a carronade. The lower platform <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with two guns, while another gun was {{located near the}} battery's entrance.|$|R
2500|$|The ships <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> {{with one}} QF [...] Mk IV gun mounted forward on a raised platform. The minesweepers <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with two 20 mm Oerlikon {{anti-aircraft}} cannon. They were later equipped with 25 depth charges.|$|R
5|$|At {{the tip of}} {{the abdomen}} is a pair of long cerci (paired {{appendages}} on rearmost segment), and in females, the ovipositor is cylindrical, long and narrow, smooth and shiny. The femora (third segments) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.|$|E
5|$|Preceding the Vietnam War {{the high}} speeds {{aircraft}} were attaining {{led to a}} move to remove the cannon due to the mistaken belief {{that they would be}} useless in a dogfight, but combat experience during the Vietnam War showed conclusively that despite advances in missiles, there was still a need for them. Nearly all modern fighter aircraft <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with an autocannon and they are also commonly found on ground-attack aircraft. One of the most powerful examples is the 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling-type rotary cannon, mounted exclusively on the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. The Lockheed AC-130 gunship (a converted transport) can carry a 105mm howitzer as well as a variety of autocannons ranging up to 40mm. Both are used in the close air support role.|$|E
5|$|The gastrovascular cavity {{itself is}} divided {{into a number of}} {{chambers}} by mesenteries radiating inwards from the body wall. Some of the mesenteries form complete partitions with a free edge {{at the base of the}} pharynx, where they connect, but others reach only partway across. The mesenteries are usually found in multiples of twelve, and are symmetrically arranged around the central lumen. They have stomach lining on both sides, separated by a thin layer of mesoglea, and include filaments of tissue specialised for secreting digestive enzymes. In some species, these filaments extend below the lower margin of the mesentery, hanging free in the gastrovascular cavity as thread-like acontial filaments. These acontia <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with nematocysts and can be extruded through cinclides, blister-like holes in the wall of the column, for use in defence.|$|E
50|$|EKO Cobra <b>is</b> <b>armed</b> {{mainly with}} Austrian weaponry, but {{sometimes}} foreign-produced <b>arms</b> <b>are</b> used too.|$|R
2500|$|Ranger <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> {{with six}} 40mm quadruple mounts and forty-six 20mm mounts. She also <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with eight /25 caliber guns, which were removed in June 1944. The carrier {{was one of}} the first U.S. Navy ships mounted with light {{automatic}} weapons to defend against dive-bombing attacks, and <b>was</b> initially <b>armed</b> with forty [...]50 cal machine guns.|$|R
50|$|Initially, Russia used {{aviation}} {{only for}} reconnaissance and coordination of artillery fire. Later, several aeroplanes <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with steel flechettes to attack ground targets (columns of enemy infantry and cavalry, campsites, etc.). Later, aeroplanes <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with air-dropped bombs.|$|R
5|$|The {{shape and}} {{appearance}} of each coral colony depends {{not only on}} the species, but also on its location, depth, the amount of water movement and other factors. Many shallow-water corals contain symbiont unicellular organisms known as zooxanthellae within their tissues. These give their colour to the coral which thus may vary in hue depending on what species of symbiont it contains. Stony corals are closely related to sea anemones, and like them <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with stinging cells known as cnidocytes. Corals reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most species release gametes into the sea where fertilisation takes place, and the planula larvae drift as part of the plankton, but a few species brood their eggs. Asexual reproduction is mostly by fragmentation, when part of a colony becomes detached and reattaches elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The textual {{description}} of Matrikas is generally awesome, frightening and ferocious. In the Mahabharata, all the seven mothers {{are described as}} fatal or serve as threats to foetuses or infants. They are described as living in trees, crossroads, caves and funeral grounds and they are terrible as well as beautiful. But, in the sculptural portrayal, they are depicted quite differently as protectors and benevolent mothers. They <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with the same weapons, wear the same ornaments, and ride the same vahanas and carry the same banners as their corresponding male deities.|$|E
5|$|When Archie and {{his friends}} take a spring break trip to Los Perdidos Resort, an alien, trophy-hunting Predator touches down in a nearby jungle. Betty discovers an ancient Colombian shrine and attracts the {{attention}} of the Predator, who follows her home to Riverdale. Targeting Veronica, the Predator attacks and kills several people who <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with weapons. Kevin Keller, an acquaintance with military experience, organizes and protects Archie {{and his friends}}. The creature's picture is taken by Betty, who shows it to Kevin's father, a US Military General. He identifies it as a teenager from a race of nearly unstoppable alien hunters. Jughead Jones is used as bait to lure the Predator, but the trap fails and the Predator kills the majority of the youths present.|$|E
2500|$|As built, they <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> {{with one}} [...] 68-pounder (87cwt) muzzle-loading smoothbore gun and two 24-pounder howitzers. By 1863 the three {{surviving}} vessels {{of the class}} <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with one 110-pounder Armstrong breech-loading gun and one 40-pounder Armstrong breech-loading gun.|$|R
5000|$|Against aerial threats the cruisers <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> {{with four}} 57mm L/80 DP guns {{situated}} in two twin mountings. They also had four 30mm AK-630 CIWS mountings. They <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with two twin launchers for the 48 SA-N-3 surface-to-air missiles they carried.|$|R
50|$|The 45-ton Scourge <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> {{with four}} 6-pounder and four 4-pounder deck guns, while the 76-ton Hamilton <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with eight 18-pounder carronades and one 12-pounder long gun on a pivot mount. The ships guns remain in {{position}} on deck.|$|R
5|$|Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action {{game with}} {{strategy}} and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad {{of up to}} four soldiers. These soldiers <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must use secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates – destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion – at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at {{a greater risk of}} depleting ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The game's single-player {{campaign}} {{consists of}} around 30 linear levels, divided up into eight distinct missions. Missions have different objectives, from retrieving a particular item and accessing computer systems, escorting a friendly character through hostile territory, or destroying vital ship and station components. Enemies come in multiple {{forms in the}} game, often as Star Trek species such as the Borg and the Klingons. Each group of enemies uses a different means of attacking: most humanoid enemies <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with weapons similar to the player, and will use cover and squad tactics to attempt to kill the player character. The Borg differ from this in that, instead of using squad tactics, they eventually adapt their personal energy shields {{to most of the}} player's weapons, slowly rendering the player's attacks useless as they advance. Other enemies may attempt to swarm the player and eliminate them with melee attacks.|$|E
25|$|Colombian Kfirs <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with Python 3 IR-homing AAMs.|$|E
50|$|The PV-1 armed the Polikarpov I-3 and Tupolev I-4 {{fighters and}} the Tupolev TB-1 bomber. The Polikarpov I-5 fighter <b>was</b> first <b>armed</b> {{with a pair}} of PV-1 machine guns with 1,200 rounds total. Subsequent {{modifications}} increased the armament to four PV-1 guns with 4,000 rounds total. The Polikarpov I-15 <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with four PV-1 guns with 3,000 rounds total. The reconnaissance Polikarpov R-5 <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with one propeller-synchronized PV-1 and one in a rear turret mount. The ground attack R-5Sh variant <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with four PV-1 guns in the wings, in addition to the propeller-synchronized one.|$|R
5000|$|Ranger <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> {{with six}} 40 mm quadruple mounts and forty-six 20 mm mounts. She also <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with eight 5 in/25 caliber guns, which were removed in June 1944. The carrier {{was one of}} the first U.S. Navy ships mounted with light {{automatic}} weapons to defend against dive-bombing attacks, and <b>was</b> initially <b>armed</b> with forty [...]50 cal machine guns.|$|R
25|$|The three Spanish vessels {{were the}} Generalissimo, Huron, and Pastora. Generalissimo and Huron <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with two 32-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder guns, and Pastora <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with two 18-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder guns. All three had 70-man crews, {{augmented}} with volunteers.|$|R
25|$|Spearers, on {{the other}} hand, <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with spiny {{appendages}} topped with barbed tips, used to stab and snag prey.|$|E
25|$|As a {{non-lethal}} option, Special Agents, Special Officers, and Uniformed Division Officers <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> {{with the}} ASP baton, and Uniformed Division officers carry pepper spray.|$|E
25|$|Police {{officers}} in the various divisions <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> when conducting regular uniformed patrols and plainclothes duties. Officers from different units are issued with different weapons.|$|E
5000|$|Against aerial threats the cruisers <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> {{with four}} 57 mm L/80 DP guns {{situated}} in two twin mountings. They also had four 30mm AK-630 CIWS mountings. They <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with two twin launchers for the 48 SA-N-3 surface-to-air missiles they carried.|$|R
50|$|From the air, Soviet naval {{aviation}} had ASuW capabilities. The Tupolev Tu-16 Badger G <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with anti-ship missiles, {{followed by}} the Tupolev Tu-22M Backfire supersonic maritime strike bomber. Even the prop-driven Tu-142, primarily designed for ASW warfare, could and <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with antiship missiles.|$|R
50|$|The Type 093 <b>is</b> <b>armed</b> {{with six}} torpedo tubes; reports {{conflict}} on whether these are 553 mm or 650 mm tubes. The Type 093 {{has been said}} to <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> with the YJ-12 or YJ-82 anti-ship missiles. Anti-ship cruise missiles may also be future options.|$|R
25|$|MDP {{officers}} are attested as constables under the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987. All MDP {{officers are}} trained to use firearms and 90% of those on duty <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> at any given time.|$|E
25|$|Many nations forbid {{ships to}} enter their {{territorial}} waters or ports if {{the crew of}} the ships <b>are</b> <b>armed,</b> in an effort to restrict possible piracy. Shipping companies sometimes hire private armed security guards.|$|E
25|$|The ships <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with a 16-cell VLS {{carrying}} the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile surface-to-air missile, and Phalanx close in weapon system for self-defense.
