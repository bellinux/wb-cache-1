40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{management accounting}} technique, specifically <b>activity-based</b> cost <b>management,</b> as a modelling process. Particularly in Anglo-Saxon capitalism, various institutional pressures {{have worked to}} dissociate management from expertise in the managed process. Management of this character can only engage with concrete processes by modelling them in terms which it can comprehend and with which it can engage. The result is a market in management and accounting techniques for producing these simplified representations. Those discussed in this paper consist essentially of a reporting framework which is imposed on the expert practitioner, so that the process is re-described in modelled form. Precisely because the resulting models are simplified, however, the consequences of managing through them are dysfunctional in various ways.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Management Accounting)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. In {{the era of}} {{competitive}} global environment and technology-based organisations, managers are pressured {{to find ways to}} maintain their competitive advantage. Management has the responsibility to maintain their competitive advantage whilst maintaining the profitability of the organisation. This responsibility includes decisions regarding the retention of profitable customers, and the minimisation of costs to improve profitability of services. The analysis of cost and profitability of individual services and customers represents a critical issue with which Strategic Logistical Alliance (SLA) should be concerned SLA {{has proved to be a}} market leader within the logistics services market whilst maintaining profitability in most of its core business functions, with the exception of the warehousing and distribution function. The reasons for a lack of profitability in the warehousing and distribution function are inadequate planning, controlling and decision-making within these functions. The main reasons for these problems are incorrect cost allocations, the non-reflection of the true cost of activities, unprofitable pricing and the lack of effective performance management. 'The primary objective of this study is to analyse the existing cost allocation system, the cost management system and the performance management system of SLA, focusing on the warehousing and distribution functions. The study addresses the shortcomings of the existing system and recommends <b>activity-based</b> performance <b>management</b> as a possible solution. To achieve this primary objective, a number of secondary objectives were relevant. The research was conducted at SLA in Gauteng. The research comprised a literature study and an empirical survey using structured interviews to obtain information from relevant staff and managers. 'The empirical study was further extended by obtaining permission from top management to gather information by observation of activities and processes carried out by staff in the warehouse and distribution function. For management of SLA to achieve their goal of becoming a profitable leading third-party logistical service provider, a combination of tools should be used, which include <b>activity-based</b> costing, cost <b>management</b> and performance <b>management.</b> <b>Activity-based</b> performance <b>management</b> will enable management to gain useful information for decision-making to achieve their goal.

40|$|This study {{sets out}} to prove that <b>Activity-Based</b> <b>Management</b> is still a {{relevant}} instrument to facilitate effective management decision-making and organisational improvement. In the light of all the latest techniques and methodologies that currently exist to measure and rectify organisational performance, the obvious question might be “but why Activity-Based Management?”. Whilst certain techniques and methodologies concentrate on either inputs, outputs and / or on the entire process, <b>Activity-Based</b> <b>Management</b> was selected because it specifically analyses the activities (transformation component) of a business, plus {{the fact that this}} methodology has been refined and tested with great success in large organisations such as Eskom. Given the selection of management tools available, an instrument such as <b>Activity-Based</b> <b>Management</b> is usually not implemented alone, but may be supported by one or more other approaches. For this reason, <b>Activity-Based</b> <b>Management</b> is contrasted with several other popular instruments in the literature review. If properly applied, <b>Activity-Based</b> <b>Management</b> can provide management with a sound decision-making platform for correctly aligning resources and work activities. It produces cost information by linking human resource costs to activities and then tracks these human resource costs (inputs) by activity (transformation) and traces them to the point where products and / or services (outputs) reach their destination / customers (result). It also serves as a useful base to improve strategic and operational decisions and for reviewing and updating the organisation structure of a business. This study reworks and researches previous data related to a project carried out by Eskom (exploratory research) with the purpose of testing the primary research objective. Based on a predetermined dictionary of activities and an associated data collection form, a census was used to collect the data. The resulting reports highlight the main obstructions to effective performance and they mainly relate to an imbalance of time expenditure amongst the various activities performed, an outdated organisation structure and a misalignment of effort with the new vision and strategies formulated. The study is concluded with a number of recommendations for improvement and for further study. Briefly, these recommendations address:  shifting the focus from support to core activities and placing a higher emphasis on activities that support the new vision and strategies of the business;  eliminating unnecessary activities and reducing the amount of time wasted; and  eliminating fragmented work, dealing with surplus manpower numbers and revising the organisation structure.

The Government of the Republic of Indonesia has launched Diagnosis - Related Group in order to improve national health care system. On top of that, the government also put effort in improving hospital management system in general. Hospital system {{plays an important role in}} the creation of healthy society. Though hospital is a non-profit organization in its nature, it has to be professionally managed. In so doing, adequate managerial accounting information system is a vital support. Manager’s knowledge on managerial accounting has significant impact on his/her style in using management accounting information system. Interactive manager’s style in using management accounting information will direct the development of adequate management accounting information system. Hospital is an organization with highly diversified products. For that reason, <b>activity-based</b> <b>management</b> deemed fit for hospital. This research surveyed 68 hospitals in Jogjakarta Special Region and Central Java to investigate the significant impact of manager’s management accounting knowledge on managers’ style in using management accounting information.

40|$|Background: In {{the eighties}} the debate {{concerning}} the declining {{relevance of the}} traditional calculation started. The reason was that the method of calculating not had been changed despite that the costs and manufacturing had changed in many companies. This {{led to the development}} of activity-based costing. Management by means of activity information is called <b>activity-based</b> <b>management,</b> but there is no general accepted definition of what the term com- prises. Neither are there any studies which describe within which areas activity information is used as a base for decisions. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to describe in which situations activity information is used as a base for different decisions, and to define the term <b>activity-based</b> <b>management.</b> Method: The approach taken is qualitative. A total of 13 telephone interviews with four different companies, three producers and one wholesale firm, have been carried out. Results: Activity information is used as a base for decisions principally in situations that concerns changes in the operational work through management of processes, price and product changes and costumer profitability. Changes within these areas may concern increases in efficiency and effectiveness, and changes in price, assortment and focus on different costumers. In a long perspective these changes may lead to an increase in the profitability. From the studied empirical applications we formulated the following definition of the ABM- term: “The use of activity information as a support for decisions, which concerns securing the companies profitability and to make activities and processes visible and in that way make improvements possible. ...|$|E
