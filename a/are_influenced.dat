5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities.

Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E

5|$|According to Jains, the {{consequences}} of karma are inevitable. The consequences may {{take some time to}} take effect but the karma is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E

This inclines them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E

5|$|Many modern revival fonts {{based on}} French renaissance {{printing}} <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> {{by the work}} of Robert Granjon (c. 1513-90), particularly in italic.

His career also took in stops in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and finally for the last twelve years of his life Rome, where he ended his career {{in the service of the}} Vatican.|$|E

In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world. Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.|$|E

Hypatia Sans, designed by Thomas Phinney and released by Adobe, was intended to be a more characterful humanist sans design.

It does not migrate in a specific direction, but rather in the direction that will be the most beneficial at the time.|$|E
5|$|Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are {{obtained}} from air using {{the methods of}} liquefaction of gases, to convert elements to a liquid state, and fractional distillation, to separate mixtures into component parts. Helium is typically produced by separating it from natural gas, and radon is isolated from the radioactive decay of radium compounds. The prices of the noble gases <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> by their natural abundance, with argon being the cheapest and xenon the most expensive. As an example, the adjacent table lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas.|$|E
5|$|Temperatures are {{relatively}} cold for its latitude {{due to the}} cold Malvinas Current and the high altitude. For example, in Tierra del Fuego temperatures are colder than at equal latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since they <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> by the cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current. A characteristic of the temperature pattern is the NW–SE distribution of isotherms due {{to the presence of}} the Andes.|$|E
