50|$|A {{simple method}} of {{modulating}} the optical beam travelling through the <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>device</b> {{is done by}} switching the acoustic field on and off. When off the light beam is undiverted, the intensity of light directed at the Bragg diffraction angle is zero. When switched on and Bragg diffraction occurs, the intensity at the Bragg angle increases. So the <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>device</b> is modulating the output along the Bragg diffraction angle, switching it on and off. The device is operated as a modulator by keeping the acoustic wavelength (frequency) fixed and varying the drive power to vary the amount {{of light in the}} deflected beam.|$|E
5000|$|Here, the Q-switch is an {{externally}} {{controlled variable}} attenuator. This {{may be a}} mechanical device such as a shutter, chopper wheel, or spinning mirror/prism placed inside the cavity, or (more commonly) it may be some form of modulator such as an <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>device,</b> a magneto-optic effect device or an electro-optic device — a Pockels cell or Kerr cell. The reduction of losses (increase of Q) is triggered by an external event, typically an electrical signal. The pulse repetition rate can therefore be externally controlled.Modulators generally allow a faster transition from low to high Q, and provide better control. An additional advantage of modulators is that the rejected light may be coupled out of the cavity {{and can be used}} for something else. Alternatively, when the modulator is in its low-Q state, an externally generated beam can be coupled into the cavity through the modulator. This can be used to [...] "seed" [...] the cavity with a beam that has desired characteristics (such as transverse mode or wavelength). When the Q is raised, lasing builds up from the initial seed, producing a Q-switched pulse that has characteristics inherited from the seed.|$|E

40|$|We propose {{and analyze}} {{theoretically}} a resonant acousto-optic Stark effect for microcavity (MC) polaritons parametrically {{driven by a}} surface acoustic wave. For GaAs-based microcavities our scheme "acoustic pumping - optical probing" deals with surface acoustic waves of frequency ν_ SAW≃ 0. 5 - 3 GHz and intensity I_ SAW≃ 0. 1 - 10 mW/mm. The acoustically-induced stop gaps in the MC polariton spectrum drastically change the optical response of MC polaritons. Because an acoustically pumped intrinsic semiconductor microcavity remains in its ground electronic state, no many-body effects screen and weaken the resonant acousto-optic Stark effect. In the meantime, this allows us to work out an exactly-solvable model for resonant acousto-optics of MC polaritons which deals with giant acousto-optical nonlinearities. Finally, we discuss possible applications of the proposed resonant acoustic Stark effect for optical modulation and switching and describe an <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>device</b> based on a (GaAs) microcavity driven by a surface acoustic wave.

30|$|In {{the field}} of optical manipulation, a lot of {{resources}} have been dedicated to realization of adjustable optical potential landscapes, which could be used to manipulate multiple particles simultaneously [100]. The generation of arrays of optical traps with the use of microlens arrays and diffraction optics has been demonstrated in multiple studies [101]. The major limitation of using static elements is the inability of independent control of each trap or a region of traps. The whole pattern is adjusted simultaneously. A popular method for generating dynamic optical traps is to use an <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>device,</b> which reflects and modulates a laser beam [102, 103].

While these transducers work well with many applications, it is possible to make acoustic transducers by a very different method, using electrically induced domain inversion in ferroelectrics. In these "acoustic superlattice transducers", the resonant frequency is no longer controlled by the overall physical dimensions of the transducer but by the period of the domain inverted regions. These are in turn defined by a photolithographic technique.

The change in Brillouin shift omega and the slope d omega/dT are the order parameter for all kinds of phase transitions. Since we do not see hysteresis on acoustic phonon mode behavior in the reverse temperature experiments, these second order phase transitions are no related to structural phase change and could be related to acoustic phonon coupled electronic transitions.
