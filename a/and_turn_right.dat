25|$|Most of Jackson's {{men were}} unaware of the small action {{at the rear of}} their column. As they marched north on Brock Road, Jackson was {{prepared}} to turn right on the Orange Plank Road, from which his men would attack the Union lines at around Wilderness Church. However, it became apparent that this direction would lead to essentially a frontal assault against Howard's line. Fitzhugh Lee met Jackson and they ascended a hill with a sweeping view of the Union position and Jackson was delighted to see that Howard's men were resting, unaware of the impending Confederate threat. Although by now it was 3 p.m., Jackson decided to march his men two miles farther <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> on the Turnpike instead, allowing him to strike the unprotected flank directly. The attack formation consisted of two lines—the divisions of Brig. Gens. Robert E. Rodes and Raleigh E. Colston—stretching almost a mile {{on either side of the}} turnpike, separated by 200 yards, followed by a partial line with the arriving division of A.P. Hill.|$|E

2500|$|ChuChu Rocket! is {{an action}} puzzle video game. The basic {{rules of the}} game require the player to guide mice, dubbed [...] "ChuChus", into a rocket while evading them from {{dangerous}} cats, dubbed [...] "KapuKapus". A brief premise is provided in the instruction manual, explaining that ChuChus are living on a space port that is invaded by KapuKapus one day. In their frantic state, the ChuChus begin running around in chaos, and so the player must guide them to their rockets to save them. Both ChuChus and KapuKapus run in a straight line, <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> when they hit walls. A player can place up, down, left, and right arrows on the field of play, redirecting characters if they walk on it. Up to three arrows can be placed by a player at any time; placing a fourth arrow will make the player's oldest arrow vanish, and all arrows fade away over time. If a KapuKapu hits an arrow twice, the arrow disappears.|$|E

2500|$|On roads with {{multiple}} lanes, turning traffic is generally expected {{to move to}} the lane closest to the direction they wish to turn. For example, traffic intending to turn right will usually move to the rightmost lane before the intersection. Likewise, left-turning traffic will move to the leftmost lane. Exceptions to this rule may exist where for example the traffic authority decides that the two rightmost lanes will be for turning right, in which case drivers may take whichever of them to turn. In certain parts of the world traffic will adapt to informal patterns that rise naturally rather than by force of authority; for example, [...] it is common for drivers to observe (and trust) the turn signals used by other drivers in order to make turns from other lanes. For example, if several vehicles on the right lane are all turning right, a vehicle may come from the next-to-right lane <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> as well, doing so in parallel with the other right-turning vehicles.|$|E
