The most common complication associated with the AV graft is venous outflow obstruction with graft thrombosis, which accounts for 85 to 90  % of problems with haemodialysis.

40|$|Introduction: Among {{cardiovascular}} diseases, <b>arterials</b> <b>stenosis</b> {{is recognized}} more commonly than the others. Hemodynamic characteristics of blood {{play a key}} role in the incidence of stenosis. This paper numerically investigates the pulsatile blood flow in a coronary bifurcation with a non-planar branch. To create a more realistic analysis, the wall is assumed to be compliant. Furthermore, the flow is considered to be threedimensional, incompressible, and laminar. Methods: The effects of non-Newtonian blood, compliant walls and different angles of bifurcation on hemodynamic characteristics of flow were evaluated. Shear thinning of blood was simulated with the Carreau-Yasuda model. The current research was mainly focused on the flow characteristics in bifurcations since atherosclerosis occurs mostly in bifurcations. Moreover, as the areas with low shear stresses are prone to stenosis, these areas were identified. Results: Our findings indicated that the compliant model of the wall, bifurcation’s angle, and other physical properties of flow have an impact on hemodynamics of blood flow. Lower wall shear stress was observed in the compliant wall than that in the rigid wall. The outer wall of bifurcation in all models had lower wall shear stress. In bifurcations with larger angles, wall shear stress was higher in outer walls, and lower in inner walls. Conclusion: The non-Newtonian blood vessels and different angles of bifurcation on hemodynamic characteristics of flow evaluation confirmed a lower wall shear stress in the compliant wall than that in the rigid wall, while the wall shear stress was higher in outer walls but lower in inner walls in the bifurcation regions with larger angles...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFibulin- 4 is {{a member}} of the fibulin family, a group of {{extracellular}} matrix proteins prominently expressed in medial layers of large veins and arteries. Involvement of the FBLN 4 gene in cardiovascular pathology was shown in a murine model and in three patients affected with cutis laxa in association with systemic involvement. In order to elucidate the contribution of FBLN 4 in human disease, we investigated two cohorts of patients. Direct sequencing of 17 patients with cutis laxa revealed no FBLN 4 mutations. In a second group of 22 patients presenting with <b>arterial</b> tortuosity, <b>stenosis</b> and aneurysms, FBLN 4 mutations were identified in three patients, two homozygous missense mutations (p. Glu 126 Lys and p. Ala 397 Thr) and compound heterozygosity for missense mutation p. Glu 126 Val and frameshift mutation c. 577 delC. Immunoblotting analysis showed a decreased amount of fibulin- 4 protein in the fibroblast culture media of two patients, a finding sustained by diminished fibulin- 4 in the extracellular matrix of the aortic wall on immunohistochemistry. pSmad 2 and CTGF immunostaining of aortic and lung tissue revealed an increase in TGFbeta signaling. This was confirmed by pSmad 2 immunoblotting of fibroblast cultures. In conclusion, patients with recessive FBLN 4 mutations are predominantly characterized by aortic aneurysms, <b>arterial</b> tortuosity and <b>stenosis.</b> This confirms the important role of fibulin- 4 in vascular elastic fiber assembly. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence for the involvement of altered TGFbeta signaling in the pathogenesis of FBLN 4 mutations in humans...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} examine the effects of high volume {{external}} beam radiation (EBR) after stent implantation on neointimal hyperplasia, smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, presence of inflammatory cells and expression of extracellular matrix (ECM). BACKGROUNDEndovascular irradiation has been shown to reduce restenosis rates after angioplasty in preliminary trials, but conflicting results have been reported for the effects of external beam irradiation. METHODSForty-three Palmaz-Schatz stents were implanted into iliac arteries of New Zealand White rabbits. The arteries were externally irradiated after stent implantation with a single dose of 8 Gy (at day 3) or 16 Gy in two fractions (8 Gy at days 3 and 4) by means of a linear accelerator. In the control rabbits, no radiation was applied after stent implantation. Smooth muscle cells, macrophages and ECM were studied by immunohistochemistry at one and 12 weeks after stent implantation. Collagen type I and biglycan messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels were assessed by Northern blot analysis at one week. Neointimal cell densities and <b>arterial</b> lumen <b>stenosis</b> were measured by histomorphometry at 12 weeks. RESULTSAt 1 week, SMC proliferation at the site of stent implantation was increased after EBR with 8 and 16 Gy (26 ± 5 %, 32 ± 3 % vs. 17 ± 8 %; p < 0. 01, 16 Gy vs. control). External beam radiation with 8 and 16 Gy augmented SMC proliferation proximal and distal to the angioplasty site (11 ± 3 %, 14 ± 3 vs. 6 ± 1 %; p < 0. 01, 16 Gy vs. control). Collagen type I and biglycan mRNA levels were elevated in stented arteries after EBR with 16 Gy. At 12 weeks, a marked decrease in neointimal cell density (248 ± 97 vs. 498 ± 117 SMCs/ 0. 1 mm 2 neointima; p < 0. 005 vs. control) was noted after EBR with 16 Gy. Irradiation with 8 and 16 Gy increased <b>arterial</b> lumen <b>stenosis</b> compared with nonirradiated control rabbits (45 ± 7 %, 55 ± 9 % vs. 33 ± 7 %; p < 0. 05, 8 Gy and p < 0. 001, 16 Gy vs. control). CONCLUSIONSHigh volume external beam radiation at doses of 8 or 16 Gy causes restenosis by augmenting proliferative activity at and adjacent to the site of stent implantation, and by dose-dependent up-regulation of extracellular matrix expression. The study suggests that excessive matrix accumulation is an important determinant of failure of radiation therapy to prevent restenosis...|$|R
