5|$|In modern times, among European royalty at least, marriages between royal dynasties {{have become}} much rarer than they once were. Members of Europe's dynasties {{increasingly}} married {{members of the}} titled nobility, including George VI of the United Kingdom, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood, Prince Michael of Kent, Charles, Prince of Wales, Baudouin of Belgium, Albert II of Belgium, Prince Amedeo of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este, Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein, Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein, Prince Constantin of Liechtenstein, Princess Nora of Liechtenstein, Princess Désirée, Baroness Silfverschiöld, Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz, Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo and Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg or untitled nobility as Philippe of Belgium and Beatrix of the Netherlands, <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>often</b> commoners, as Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, Harald V of Norway, Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway, Henri of Luxembourg, Felipe VI of Spain, Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Albert II of Monaco have done.|$|E
5|$|After a varying {{amount of}} {{training}} (at {{least a few}} months), apprentices are eventually made warriors. Another naming ceremony is held, this time to mark the cat as being a full member of the Clan. Warriors are given their own unique suffix that often marks their personality or appearance; for example, ‘Graystripe’ would be named after the grey stripe running down his back, ‘Brokentail’ after the kink in his tail, and ‘Sandstorm’ after her fiery personality. It is extremely rare for warriors to meet another cat with the exact same name, but often a warrior will meet another cat with the same first part of their name, <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>often</b> will a warrior meet another cat with the same last part of their name (such as fur, tail, or heart). Once named, warriors hold a vigil at night to protect the clan, {{while the rest of}} the clan is sleeping. After the vigil, warriors are free to move into the warrior’s den, where the majority of the Clan sleeps. The duty of a warrior is to protect and uphold their Clan at all costs. They are able to hunt by themselves, and are generally skilled at defending themselves in battle. Warriors can take a mate, and females can give birth to new kits; if this occurs, the expecting mother, known as a 'queen', will avoid warrior duties for six months before returning to them once her kits are made apprentices. The vast majority of warriors are also chosen to later be mentors to new apprentices. Warriors will remain in this position for the remainder of their life, or until they are old enough to retire.|$|E

25|$|Canton: {{smaller than}} the quarter, {{formally}} said to occupy one-ninth of the shield, though sometimes drawn smaller. The canton is often {{said to be the}} quarter's diminutive, but perhaps it should be treated as a subordinary in its own right as it fulfils heraldic functions not fulfilled by the quarter, and behaves according to its own special rules—as for example {{in the case of the}} canton on which baronets in the UK may display the badges of their 'rank', which is very rarely shown occupying such a large area as the upper left third of the field, and is usually much less <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>often</b> shown not as square but as a rectangle with its longer side vertical.

25|$|The Magi most {{frequently}} appear in European {{art in the}} Adoration of the Magi; less often in the Journey of the Magi has been a popular subject in art, and topos, and other scenes such as the Magi before Herod and the Dream of the Magi also appear in the Middle Ages. In Byzantine art they are depicted as Persians, wearing trousers and phrygian caps. Crowns appear from the 10th century. Despite being saints, they are very often shown without halos, perhaps to avoid distracting attention from either their crowns or the halos of the Holy Family. Sometimes only the lead king, kneeling to Christ, has a halo the two others lack, probably indicating that the two behind had not yet performed the act of worship that would ensure their status as saints. Medieval artists also allegorised the theme to represent the three ages of man. Beginning in the 12th century, <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>often</b> by the 15th, the Kings also represent the three parts of the known (pre-Columbian) world in Western art, especially in Northern Europe. Balthasar is thus represented as a young African or Moor and Caspar may be depicted with distinctly Oriental features.|$|E

Javed uses shayari, a type of poetry, to flirt. [...] "Shayaris are his pickup lines <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>often</b> he does succeed to getting the girls," [...] said Kapoor. [...] "He is not a sophisticated shayar and {{that is part of}} his charm." [...] He also called Javed [...] "the funniest and naughtiest character of 1910 I have ever seen." [...] Despite the role being his favourite, Kapoor faced problems with the era-appropriate costume, which required him to wear traditional mojari shoes and clip-on stud earrings; he suffered from both shoe bites and red ears during filming.|$|E

500|$|Pitchfork Media {{rated the}} album with 9.3 points out of 10, and wrote: [...] "Thirty years ago, Willie Nelson took a {{typically}} left turn and followed up {{a string of}} successful albums with a cover album of songs made famous by decidedly non-country musicians like Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong [...] What makes the record so thrilling <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>often</b> beautiful—and what separates him from today's ham-handed vocalists—is Nelson's facility as an interpreter [...] With his tender, textured voice and intuitively around-the-beat phrasing, Nelson gives these songs fresh readings, with just the touch of sentimentality and nostalgia they demand. The cliché 'makes them his own' certainly applies here: He sings them as they've never been sung before or since, which is quite a feat considering their age and popularity. Hardened from endless touring into a tough, tight roadhouse revue, Nelson's band gives a surprisingly supple performance on each song, which reinforces the album's sweetly ruminative mood. Producer Booker T. Jones, of Stax fame, facilitates {{every aspect of the}} band's sound, showcasing the performers' range while ensuring the arrangements play to the lyrics and vocals without overwhelming them [...] Stardust set both the template for Nelson's career and the standard. Few artists have treat the American Songbook so affectionately and so cavalierly." ...|$|E
