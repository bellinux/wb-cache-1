5|$|T-26 mod. 1933 in the El Goloso Baracks Museum in Madrid (Spain): {{the tank}} (Spanish {{tactical}} number 135) with Nationalist Spanish markings with pressed gun mask is {{armed with a}} Hotchkiss machine gun instead of a DT tank machine gun. Produced in 1936. The <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> and the hand-rail radio antenna are late dummies.|$|E
5|$|T-26 model 1933: single turret version {{armed with}} 45mm 20K tank gun and DT tank machine gun. This version {{had a new}} {{cylindrical}} turret with a large rear niche. Some tanks were equipped with a 71-TK-1 radio station with a hand-rail antenna around the turret (so-called radio tanks). They were upgraded in 1935 with a welded hull and turret, and again in 1936 with a rear DT tank machine gun in the turret. In 1937, some tanks were equipped with an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> and a searchlight. The model 1933 was the most numerous variant.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine gun {{in the rear of the}} turret and an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> on top of it, as well as the {{addition}} of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E

5|$|In November 1942, Koppelman {{was drafted}} into the United States Army and in 1943 he married painter Dorothy Myers. He worked as a radio {{weatherman}} during World War II, guiding ships through the rough waters of the English Channel, which was {{a critical part of}} the Invasion of Normandy. He manned an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> in the D-Day landing on Omaha Beach, and later, as staff sergeant, was awarded a Bronze Star. Before the invasion, {{he had been able to}} study at the Art College of Western England in Bristol, and later at the École des Beaux-Arts in Reims. While on leave, he visited Picasso's studio in Paris, and it was Picasso and Louis Aragon who told Koppelman that the war in Europe was over. Letters describing his wartime experience are in the Chaim and Dorothy Koppelman papers at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} at Junkers works was quite slow, {{because of poor}} organization. Only 227 J.Is were manufactured before production ceased in January 1919. At least one was lost to ground fire, shot down by a French <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> that was firing armour-piercing rounds, although this was apparently an isolated event as some sources claim none were lost in combat. Some were lost in landing accidents and other mishaps.|$|E
25|$|Air Defense Divisions {{were first}} created in 1932 {{as part of}} the Soviet Air Defense Forces. Before 1941, they {{included}} two regiments of heavy-caliber anti-aircraft guns, a battalion of light-caliber guns, a searchlight regiment, an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> and searchlight regiment, a VNOS (Air Warning, Observation, and Communications) regiment, a barrage balloon battalion, and support units. In total, the divisions included between 12,000 and 15,000 men, 120 76mm or 85mm heavy guns, twelve 37mm light-caliber guns, 141 anti-aircraft machine guns, 144 searchlights, and 81 barrage balloons.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{weaknesses}} of the Draug-class ships was their lack of effective anti-aircraft armament, Draug herself being equipped with a single 12.7mm Colt <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> She also carried a Madsen machine gun that was rendered inoperable {{by the absence of}} a vital part. Draugs anti-submarine weapons were equally primitive, with four depth charges located on the stern. The depth charges had no throwing mechanism and had to be dropped overboard manually. The ship also had no radar or asdic to help in locating targets.|$|E
5000|$|Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships were civilian-manned {{cargo ships}} {{carrying}} {{a small number}} of military personnel to operate an anti-submarine <b>gun</b> and <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> during the world wars of the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{anti-aircraft}} defence of {{the capital}} was divided into active and passive parts. The former was composed mostly of units of the Pursuit Brigade (Brygada Pościgowa) under Colonel Stefan Pawlikowski, and anti-aircraft artillery and <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> detachments under Colonel Kazimierz Baran. The Pursuit Brigade was equipped with 54 fighter aircraft, mostly the obsolete PZL P.7 and PZL P.11 types. The AA artillery had 86 pieces of anti-aircraft artillery, {{as well as an}} unknown number of other <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns.</b> The latter was composed mostly of fire-fighter brigades and volunteers and was supervised by Colonel Tadeusz Bogdanowicz and Julian Kulski, the deputy president of Warsaw.|$|R
5000|$|Proekta 1124: their {{standard}} armament was initially two turrets from T-28 or T-34 tanks, each mounting a 76.2 mm gun and Degtyaryov tank <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> (DT), {{as well as}} two <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> - in some cases the rear turret was replaced with a Katyusha rocket-launcher ...|$|R
25|$|Wartime {{temporarily}} interrupted {{production of}} civilian specification propellants, as major quantities of new specifications were manufactured. Number 4831 {{was used to}} load navy <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> ammunition, and number 4895 was used to load United States service rifle ammunition. As these propellants became military surplus after the war, large quantities of different batches were blended together to make products with uniform average performance for sale to civilians. Manufacture of these specifications for civilian use resumed after military surplus had been exhausted; but reaction characteristics were slightly different from the products distributed from military surplus supplies.|$|E
25|$|T-55AGM - Ukrainian T-54/T-55 modernization. It {{brings up}} the T-54/T-55 tanks to T-80 standard. It can also be applied to Chinese made Type 59 and Soviet T-62. It is fitted with 5TDFM, {{two-stroke}} liquid-cooled multi-fuel supercharged diesel engine with boxing pistons which develops 850hp (634kW), improved running gear, automated movement control system with a steering handlebar control, additional passive protection, built-in explosive reactive armour, countermeasures system, new fire suppression system with over-ride facilities at the commander's station, automatic loader which holds 18 rounds and <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> that can be aimed and fired from within the turret under a complete armour protection. The <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> is installed on the commander's cupola and {{is intended to be}} fired at air and ground targets. The buyer can choose between two main armament options: 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun or 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun. Both of them with use of enhanced performance conventional ammunition and barrel-launched ATGM can defeat modern tanks form distance of 2000–3000 m and up to 5,000 m using the ATGM. The tank can carry at least 30 rounds. The 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun weighs 2,5 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (48 calibers) and can fire APFSDS, HEAT and HE-FRAG rounds while 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun weighs 2,63 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (50 calibers) and can fire all types of ammunition that meet the requirements of NATO standards and Ukrainian-made ATGM. Both guns have normal recoil length of 26–30cm and maximum recoil length of 31cm. The tank can be armed with either the KT-7.62 or the PKT-7.62 coaxial machine gun and can carry 3,000 rounds for it. The tank can also be armed with either KT-12.7 or NSVT-12.7 heavy machine gun for AA protection and can carry 450 rounds for it. The approximate successful range is 2km during day and 800 m during night. The AA HMG can be elevated between -5 to +70 degrees. The remote control for <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> is stabilized in the vertical axis during automatic mode (by using the TKN-5 sight) and is using the PZU-7 sight for semi-automatic mode.|$|E
25|$|Already in the 1930s it {{was found}} that the 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT had some shortcomings. The recoil of the guns tended to cause muzzle climb during shooting, {{resulting}} in poor accuracy. During Winter War further problems were found: the mount was heavy and cumbersome, and calibre of the weapon was not powerful enough. This last problem was exacerbated by the fact that the design of a domestic heavy 13.2mm <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> had not proceeded beoynd prototype stage; further development of this weapon was stopped soon after. The calibre problem could not be helped, but some of the other problems could be solved and testing of different improvements began already in summer 1939.|$|E
50|$|Iraq's {{tanks were}} more {{effective}} against Iranian helicopter gunships. The Soviet 12.5mm <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> on the Iraqi tanks were of adequate range and lethality to hold Iranian helicopters {{out of the}} range of their most lethal anti-tank guided missiles.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> {{have long}} been mounted on trucks, and these were quite common during World War I. A {{predecessor}} of the WWII German [...] "88" [...] anti-aircraft gun, the WWI German 77 mm anti-aircraft gun, was truck-mounted and used to great effect against British tanks.|$|R
50|$|The {{security}} features include a detachment consisting of approx platoon strength, armed with rifles and <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> who patrol the prison complex. An air exclusion zone operates {{over the entire}} complex. The perimeter consists of high walls, cameras, sensors and acres of tank traps (Czech hedgehog).|$|R
25|$|The first {{unit of the}} 39th Division {{arrived in}} France on 12 August 1918, and the last unit arrived on 12 September 1918. It was then sent to the St. Florent area, {{southwest}} of Bourges, where it was designated as a replacement division. In November 1918, it moved to St. Aignan. There several of the units were transferred to combat divisions. The 141st Machine Gun Battalion was deployed to near Chaumont, Department of Haute-Marne, France. Soon after reaching its billets an order was received from G. H. Q. designating this unit as the 141st <b>Anti-aircraft</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun</b> Battalion and ordering it to proceed to Langres, France for training. The organization finished the war at Noigent waiting for transportation. Letters from soldier of the 3rd Arkansas were received in Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|Both guns {{have their}} own handles which are a mix between a pistol grip and a more usual shovel-handle type used in Maxim machine guns. Each handle has a trigger {{operated}} with a forefinger. Support bars protruded {{from the rear of}} the weapon that the gunner leaned on to bear the weapon on target. The weapon was used on a 135cm high cone mount M/31 which, while it worked, was heavy and cumbersome to move. The sight was typical ring sight of the era, with an oval-shaped front sight with two consentric rings while the rear sight was a small peg surrounded by a protective ring. In action the <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> had an intended crew of six: commander, gunner, two loaders and two ammunition handlers. Equipment included a transport case for the weapon, spare barrels, locks and springs, toolkit and a wooden transport case for ten spare belt boxes.|$|E
25|$|Technically 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT is a Maxim {{machine gun}} {{that has been}} {{modified}} for {{a higher rate of}} fire with an accelerator and the use of 250-round disintegrating metallic belts (instead of canvas belts). With these modifications the weapon has a rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute for each gun. The weapon is also air-cooled instead of water-cooled, and has a barrel jacket closely resembling the one in Lahti-Saloranta M/26 light machine gun. At barrel ends are conical flash suppressors. In the twin <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> configuration two guns are connected side by side with belt boxes {{on both sides of the}} pair and square boxes under both guns for empty shells and belt links. Both guns have cocking handles on the right side and recoil springs on the left; the left hand gun has a modified feed system to allow the belt run from left.|$|E
5000|$|Later, the M1919 [...]30 Machinegun (commonly {{known as}} the 30-cal) and the M2HB [...]50 <b>Machine</b> <b>gun</b> entered service with British Infantry and as <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> on British tanks and notably with the SAS on their heavily armed Jeeps. The Browning had been {{standard}} fitment on British aircraft since the late 1930s, with the heavy-barrel M2HB Browning [...]50-cal <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> still in use by the British military in the 21st century.|$|R
50|$|During February 1948 {{the militias}} {{obtained}} 10,000 rifles and 2,000 submachine guns from the armament factory Zbrojovka Brno. The equipment was continually modernized with sniper rifles, <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> mortars, <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> and transport vehicles. The ammunition {{was kept in}} army stores. During the 1970s recoilless guns and RPG-7 were added among the armament. After dissolution of the militias their equipment was {{handed over to the}} army.|$|R
25|$|The {{armament}} of the Sendai class {{consisted of}} seven 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns, {{in which the}} operating teams were protected by shields, two open 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval guns and two Type 93 13.2mm <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns.</b> The torpedo armament consisted of eight Type 93 torpedoes in four twin launch tubes.|$|R
25|$|Batra {{decided to}} {{approach}} the hill from the rear, aiming to surprise the enemy, and to cut off their withdrawal route. Batra fired three rockets towards the bunkers {{on the east side}} of the feature, before attacking them. He and his men ascended the sheer rock-cliff, but as the group neared the top, the enemy pinned them on the face of the bare cliff with machine gun fire. Batra, along with five of his men, climbed up regardless and after reaching the top, hurled two grenades at the machine gun post. Batra then killed three enemy soldiers single-handedly in close combat. He was seriously injured in the process, but insisted on regrouping his men to continue with the mission. He continued to lead his troops, and then charged at the next enemy position, capturing Point 5140. In all its actions, his company killed at least eight Pakistani intruders and recovered a heavy <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> The remaining enemy soldiers fled.|$|E
25|$|SU-122-54 (Ob'yekt 600) (Samokhodnaya Ustanovka) - Self-propelled 122mm gun, {{based on}} the T-54A and {{sometimes}} known as IT-122. Between 1955 and 1957, 77 vehicles were built with minor differences between production lots (different commander's cupola etc.). The SU-122-54 had a modified chassis, with small spaces between the first, second and fourth pair of wheels and a large gap between the third, similar to the T-62's and a superstructure, built into the hull, housing the 122mm D-49 L/48.4 gun for which the vehicle carries 35 rounds. The secondary armament consisted of two KPVT heavy machine guns, one mounted as an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> near the commander's hatch and the other mounted coaxially with the main gun. The vehicle carried 600 rounds for the machine guns. The main gun has a fume extractor positioned right behind the muzzle brake, some vehicles {{did not have the}} fume extractor. Other variations included a different commander's cupola.|$|E
500|$|Between 1989 and 1993, 150 AMX-30Es were modernised to {{what would}} {{become known as the}} AMX-30EM2. [...] The {{modernisation}} entailed the introduction of a new armour piercing discarding sabot round, the modification of the turret hatch to allow the installation of a larger <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun,</b> and a brand new fire control system. Besides these modernisations of the tank's firepower, the mobility of the tank was improved through the exchange of the old engine and transmission for the more reliable MTU 833 Ka-501 diesel engine, producing , coupled with the [...] German ZF LSG-3000. A new smoke machine, linked to the tank's new engine, was also installed. [...] The other 149 AMX-30Es went through a less expensive and extensive modification, known as the AMX-30EM1. These received the American Allison CD-850-6A three speed transmission (two forward and one reverse); however, the new transmission caused extensive overheating in the engine compartment. [...] These 149 AMX-30EM1s would eventually be replaced by US surplus M60A3 Patton tanks, purchased from the United States, in the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|The 96th {{division}} {{was assigned to}} 17th area army 10 February 1945. Although it was planned initially to raise a brigade, the plans were suddenly changed to division during the formation. Due to equipment shortage, the {{division was}} severely understrength and a numerous substitutions were made. In particular, mortar battalion was actually equipped with the <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|R
500|$|The ship mounted two quick-firing (QF) guns 4-inch Mk V guns {{in single}} mounts, one each {{fore and aft}} of the superstructure. These guns had a maximum {{elevation}} of +30 degrees. She also carried a single QF 3.7-inch howitzer. For anti-aircraft defence, Grasshopper had eight single mounts for [...] <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns.</b> She had a crew of 74 officers and enlisted men.|$|R
50|$|Michel Joseph Callixte Marie Coiffard (16 July 1892 - 29 October 1918) {{was one of}} {{the leading}} French flying aces of World War I. He was notable for his success as a balloon buster {{shooting}} down enemy observation balloons, which were usually heavily defended by <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> and artillery and by fighter planes. He scored 34 victories in his career.|$|R
