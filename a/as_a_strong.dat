5|$|Also in the off-season, Luongo {{resigned}} {{his team}} captaincy. As Canucks management {{waited until the}} beginning of the 2010–11 season to announce his replacement, Kesler was seen by media and fans <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> candidate, alongside Henrik Sedin. Henrik was eventually named captain prior to the season-opener and Kesler retained his alternate captaincy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not seen}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> medal contender, one former {{champion}} {{participating in the}} race was 49-year-old Jeannie Longo from France, who won the road race in 1996 and had competed in the inaugural event in 1984, making this her seventh appearance.|$|E

The island of Martinique reported sustained winds of 39miles per hour (63km/h) with gusts to 56miles per hour (91km/h). On August16, lightning from the system killed two brothers in southern Trinidad. Also on the island, heavy rainfall caused flooding and road washouts.|$|E

5|$|As expected, Chapman {{was named}} as captain for the Australian tour. The MCC touring team was {{regarded}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> one by commentators; the only controversy was {{the omission of}} Frank Woolley which was not fully explained. Rumours in later years said that Chapman was responsible for leaving Woolley out as he was jealous of his county team-mate, but Lemmon regards this as unlikely.|$|E
5|$|August 27, 1998– Hurricane Bonnie moves ashore near Wilmington <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Category 2 {{hurricane}} with {{a moderate}} storm surge and heavy rainfall from its slow movement across the state. A girl in Currituck County {{was killed when}} a large tree fell onto her home. The winds and rainfall cause heavy crop damage, and monetary damage in the state is estimated at about $480million (1998USD, $610million 2007USD).|$|E

5|$|Glacial {{acetic acid}} {{is used in}} {{analytical}} chemistry for the estimation of weakly alkaline substances such as organic amides. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water, so the amide behaves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> base in this medium.

5|$|October 9, 1804 – The Storm of October 1804 strikes near Atlantic City <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Category 2 or weak Category 3 hurricane, sinking or {{beaching}} many {{ships in}} the Mid–Atlantic. The hurricane later produces a snow storm in New England.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Delta was a late-forming {{tropical}} storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season which struck the Canary Islands <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> extra{{tropical storm}}, causing significant damage and then crossed over Morocco before dissipating.

5|$|Warren is {{a leading}} figure in the Democratic Party and is popular among American progressives. Although she {{repeatedly}} stated {{that she was not}} running for the presidency, Warren was frequently mentioned by political pundits <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> potential candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Warren remained neutral during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, endorsing presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton only after all fifty states had voted.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{tropical}} cyclones {{that become}} extratropical quickly dissipate or are absorbed by another weather system, {{they can still}} retain winds of hurricane or gale force. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel became extratropical over North Carolina <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Category 3 storm. The Columbus Day Storm of 1962, which evolved from the remains of Typhoon Freda, caused heavy damage in Oregon and Washington, with widespread damage equivalent to at least a Category 3. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma began to lose tropical characteristics while still sporting Category 3-force winds (and became fully extratropical as a Category 1 storm).|$|E

He improved his outside shooting from early in his career, and became a threat from three-point range. He has also been considered difficult to defend at times because {{of his ability to}} get to the free-throw line. An admitted risk taker, he has been criticized for his tendency to commit turnovers, as well as his perceived lack of effectiveness on defense.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been made. When chloride salts such as NaCl are added to aqueous HCl, they have practically no effect on pH, indicating that Cl− is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity (a unit of concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|E
5|$|As {{the system}} {{continued}} to move west on October 9, it strengthened into a hurricane, {{and while it}} began to curve toward the west-northwest, further strengthening occurred, as it intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. The hurricane made landfall in Nicaragua on October 10 as a Category 3 hurricane. The system quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it traveled west-northwestward on October 11, later passing over the Gulf of Honduras. It later struck Belize on October 13 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Category 1 hurricane on October 13, tracking north-northwestward.|$|E
5|$|August 30, 1999– Hurricane Dennis {{parallels}} the state offshore, and {{five days later}} it executes a loop and makes landfall along Cape Lookout National Seashore <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> tropical storm. The hurricane drops heavy rainfall peaking at 19.9inches (506mm) in Ocracoke, while its extended duration offshore causes localized severe beach erosion. The rainfall causes flooding along several rivers, which {{is compounded by the}} effects of Hurricane Floyd just weeks later. Damage in the state amounts to over $50million.|$|E
