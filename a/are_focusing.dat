25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{ineffectiveness}} of prisons at preventing crime, the high costs of maintaining them, and the detrimental socio-economic effects of mass incarceration, many nations (e.g. Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands) have been working towards policies of large-scale decarceration, addressing crime and violence with alternative strategies such as fines, community service, and restorative justice processes. In addition to moving towards a more wholistic style of punishment, Nordic Countries in particular <b>are</b> <b>focusing</b> their efforts on prevention. In Sweden local police now work with county government to target at-risk youths. Swedish children from dysfunctional homes are provided more education and after-school activities to try and keep them out of trouble. In addition, police in Nordic countries are less likely to arrest youth for minor violations of the law. If a teenager steals food from a grocery store, they are often given community service time.|$|E

Even at the highest observed concentrations found in wheat gluten, the melamine exposure is much smaller than the rat and mouse doses for which effects were seen. Instead, the FDA has suggested a second contaminant may be responsible for the ill effects and melamine, as the most easily identifiable contaminant, may serve as a biomarker, or indicator, for contaminated wheat gluten.|$|E
