500|$|The musical King Kong, {{sponsored}} by the Union of South <b>African</b> <b>Artists,</b> is described as the ultimate achievement and final flowering of Sophiatown multi-racial cultural exploits in the 1950s. King Kong was a Sophiatown legend who gained popularity as a famous boxer, notorious extrovert, a bum and a brawler. The King Kong musical depicted the street life, the illicit shebeens, the violence, and something approximating {{the music of the}} township: jazz, penny whistles and the work songs of the black miners. When King Kong premiered in Johannesburg, [...] Miriam Makeba the vocalist of the [...] Manhattan Brothers, played in the female lead role. The musical later went to London's West End for two years.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Paul Simon caused {{controversy}} when {{he chose to}} record his album Graceland in South Africa, along {{with a number of}} Black African musicians. He received sharp criticism for breaking the cultural boycott. In 1987 he claimed to have received clearance from the ANC: however, he was contradicted by Dali Tambo, the son of ANC president Oliver Tambo, and the founder of Artists United Against Apartheid. As {{a way out of the}} fracas, Hugh Masekela, who had known Simon for many years, proposed a joint musical tour, which would include songs from [...] "Graceland" [...] as well as from black South <b>African</b> <b>artists.</b> Miriam Makeba was among the musicians featured on the Graceland Tour. Masekela justified the tour saying that the cultural boycott had led to a [...] "lack of growth" [...] in South African music. However, when the group played in the UK at the Royal Albert Hall, there were protests outside, in which Dammers participated, along with Billy Bragg and Paul Weller. Songs performed on the tour included [...] "Soweto Blues", sung by Makeba, along with many other anti-apartheid songs.|$|E

2500|$|According to Lise Waxer, [...] "African salsa points {{not so much}} to {{a return}} of salsa to African soil (Steward 1999: 157) but to a complex process of {{cultural}} appropriation between two regions of the so-called Third World." [...] Since the mid-1990s <b>African</b> <b>artists</b> have also been very active through the super-group Africando, where African and New York musicians mix with leading African singers such as Bambino Diabate, Ricardo Lemvo, Ismael Lo and Salif Keita. It is still common today for an African artist to record a salsa tune, and add their own particular regional touch to it.|$|E

2500|$|Although the [...] in Cape Town can {{be tracked}} {{back to the}} early 1980s, {{cultural}} exchange between the United States, the West Indies, and South Africa was widespread since the 19th century. South <b>African</b> <b>artists</b> were influenced by minstrelsy and swing to bebop and beyond, which was partly in response to British imperialism. The political history of Africa plays a predominant role in South African music. In the late 19th century gold was discovered in Johannesburg, and people from different tribes began to migrate to the Johannesburg area. As a result of the rich diversity of various South African tribes, traditional music of South Africa mixed with European music {{led to the development of}} a different sound.|$|E
