40|$|Conjunctival graft {{has been}} {{frequently}} {{used in the}} field of ophthalmology. The frequently used methods to attach a conjunctival graft are suture technique and the use of fibrin glue. This study was to investigate <b>albumin</b> <b>glue</b> as an alternative to suture technique in attaching conjunctival grafts in rabbits. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the conjunctival wound healing between <b>albumin</b> <b>glue</b> and suture technique in rabbit eye as a model. This was an experimental animal study that included 32 eyes (16 rabbits) conducted at PT. Bio Farma (Persero) and the Histology Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran from March 2014 to July 2104. The subjects in this study were divided into <b>albumin</b> <b>glue</b> group and suture technique group. The examinations were comparison of conjunctival graft attachment and histologic microscopic examination to assess the wound gap. Data analysis was performed statistically using Mann-Whitney test for small sample. The statistical analysis results showed that the graft attachment was significantly better when using <b>albumin</b> <b>glue</b> (grade 4) compared to suture (grade 2 – 3) on day- 1 after surgery (p= 0. 000). The wound gap was smaller using <b>albumin</b> <b>glue</b> (0 - 0, 33 µm versus 5, 33 - 14 µm; p 0. 0005) 10 minutes after surgery and 0 µm versus 0. 33 – 4 µm, p 0, 0005, on day- 7 after surgery. In conclusion, graft attachment using albumi n glue is better and the wound gap is smaller when using <b>albumin</b> <b>glue</b> compared to the suture technique. [MKB. 2016; 48 (4) : 241 – 8...|$|E

The glued joints were exposed to normal and extreme conditions (high humidity and low temperature). After then were compared the strength of glued joints in skid in tension.

40|$|Chemical {{treatment}} of wood albumin {{in the technology}} of pellets is considered {{from the point of}} view of the possible directions of chemical reactions in the interactiontion of its reactivity with components of wood – lignin and polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose). It has b een shown that at high temperature and pressure parameters for the compression step – primary to obtain pellets technology, car-bonyl, carboxyl, amine and amide functional groups of albumin may enter into an esterification reaction involving the hydroxyl groups of the reactive lignin and also a reaction of formation of new hydrogen bonds between two electronegative atoms which, together as oxygen and nitrogen acts.

40|$|ObjectivesIn this study, we {{determined}} whether fibrin glue improves cell transplant retention and survival, reduces infarct expansion, and induces neovasculature formation. BackgroundCurrent efforts in restoring the myocardium after myocardial infarction (MI) include {{the delivery of}} viable cells to replace necrotic cardiomyocytes. Cellular transplantation techniques are, however, limited by transplanted cell retention and survival within the ischemic tissue. MethodsThe left coronary artery of rats was occluded for 17 min followed by reperfusion. One week later, bovine serum <b>albumin</b> (BSA), fibrin <b>glue,</b> skeletal myoblasts in BSA, or skeletal myoblasts in fibrin glue were injected into the infarcted area of the left ventricle. The animals were euthanized five weeks after injection, and their hearts were excised, fresh frozen, and sectioned for histology and immunohistochemistry. ResultsAfter five weeks, the mean area covered by skeletal myoblasts in fibrin glue was significantly greater than the area covered by myoblasts injected in BSA. Myoblasts within the infarct were often concentrated around arterioles. The infarct scar size and myoblasts in the fibrin group were significantly smaller {{than those in the}} control and BSA groups. Fibrin glue also significantly increased the arteriole density in the infarct scar as compared with the control group. ConclusionsThis study indicates that fibrin glue increases cell transplant survival, decreases infarct size, and increases blood flow to ischemic myocardium. Therefore, fibrin glue may have potential as a biomaterial scaffold to improve cellular cardiomyoplasty treat and MIs...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Laparoscopic partial {{nephrectomy}} (LPN) is a technically challenging {{procedure for}} the management of renal tumours. Major complications of LPN include bleeding and urine leakage. Haemostatic agents (HAs) and/or glues may reduce haemorrhage and urine leakage. We sought to examine the current practice patterns for urologists performing LPN with regard to HA use and its relationship with bleeding and urine leakage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was sent via e-mail to urologists currently performing LPN in centres in the United States and Europe. We queried the indications for HA/glue usage, type of HAs/glues used, and whether concomitant suturing/bolstering was performed. In addition, the total number of LPNs performed, laparoscopic tools used to resect the tumour, tumour size, and tumour position were queried. RESULTS: Surveys suitable for analysis were received from 18 centres (n= 1347 cases). HAs and/or glues were used in 1042 (77. 4 %) cases. Mean tumour size was 2. 8 cm, with 79 % of the tumours being defined as exophytic and 21 % deep. The HAs and glues used included gelatin matrix thrombin (FloSeal), fibrin gel (Tisseel), bovine serum <b>albumin</b> (BioGlue), cyanoacrylate <b>glue</b> (Glubran), oxidized regenerated cellulose (Surgicel), or combinations of these. Sixteen centres performed concomitant suturing/bolstering. The overall postoperative bleeding requiring transfusion and urine leakage rates were 2. 7 % and 1. 9 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of HAs and/or glues is routine in most centres performing LPN. The overall haemorrhage and urine leakage rates are low following LPN. More studies are needed to assess the potential role of HAs and/or glues in LP...|$|R
