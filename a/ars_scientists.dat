50|$|In {{a recent}} study {{released}} by the Agricultural Research Service (<b>ARS)</b> <b>scientists</b> examined how rye seeding rates and planting patterns affected cover crop production. http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100125.htm The results show that planting more pounds per acre of rye increased the cover crop's production as well as decreased the amount of weeds. The same was true when scientists tested seeding rates on legumes and oats; a higher density of seeds planted per acre decreased the amount of weeds and increased the yield of legume and oat production. The planting patterns, which consisted of either traditional rows or grid patterns, {{did not seem to}} make {{a significant impact on the}} cover crop's production or on the weed production in either cover crop. The <b>ARS</b> <b>scientists</b> concluded that increased seeding rates could be an effective method of weed control.|$|E

5000|$|Scientists {{affiliated}} with the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the USDA found that conserving water by forcing drought (or deficit irrigation) on peanut plants early in the growing season has shown to cause early maturation of the plant yet still maintain sufficient yield of the crop. http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100114.htm Inducing drought through deficit irrigation {{earlier in the season}} caused the peanut plants to physiologically [...] "learn" [...] how to adapt to a stressful drought environment, making the plants better able to cope with drought that commonly occurs later in the growing season. Deficit irrigation is beneficial for the farmers because it reduces the cost of water and prevents a loss of crop yield (for certain crops) later on in the growing season due to drought. In addition to these findings, <b>ARS</b> <b>scientists</b> suggest that deficit irrigation accompanied with conservation tillage would greatly reduce the peanut crop water requirement.|$|E

40|$|A team of {{two tiny}} moths might help {{stop the spread}} of Old World {{climbing}} fern, an aggressive vine that’s on the march in central and south Florida. With further research, a third moth, a hungry mite, a small beetle, and perhaps other hardworking organisms as well may qualify to join the coterie of pint-sized weedeaters. Known to botanists as Lygodium microphyllum, Old World climbing fern makes its way up stems and trunks of other plants, forming blankets of lightgreen vegetation. On the ground, climbing fern creates tough, spongy mats that can easily smother grasses, low-growing shrubs, and small trees. Today, it infests more than 100, 000 acres in Florida and shows no sign of slowing its advance. <b>ARS</b> <b>scientists</b> based at research laboratories in Florida and Australia are scrutinizing natural enemies of the fern. They’re searching the globe for promising organisms, then subjecting them to rigorous tests in their laboratories. Some of the studies are host-specificity experiments. They are designed to determine whether the moths will munch on climbing fern alone and not harm native ferns or other vegetation...|$|E
40|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} been to a picnic knows insects are drawn to food. That’s why {{developing}} new methods to keep insects out of food in packages, warehouses, and processing plants is critical for food manufacturers. New and innovative methods are needed because the industry is challenged to reduce pesticide use while ensuring that food products are insect-free. To meet these challenges, a team of <b>ARS</b> <b>scientists</b> at the Grain Marketing and Production Research Center in Manhattan, Kansas, is working closely with industry. Keep Out, Bug! Keeping food in containers {{is one of the}} oldest ways to protect food from insects. Ancient historical documents describe the use of crude containers, such as gourds, leaves, shells, animal skins, and even human skulls. In the 1800 s, people turned to paperboard boxes, paper bags, and tin cans to preserve perishables. In the 1900 s, the most popular materials for preserving food were aluminum foil, cellophane bags, and plastic. Today, restrictions on pesticide use and having fewer sanitation personnel at various points along the distribution chain have made insect-resistant packaging even more important to consumers and to food or feed manufacturers...|$|E
40|$|The European Space Agency’s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission {{includes}} the latest advance in using Earth-orbiting satellites for estimating soil moisture across the globe. The SMOS satellite {{was launched in}} 2009 and was designed to estimate soil moisture levels to within 4 percent, which is like measuring a teaspoon of water {{in a handful of}} dry soil. To capture this data, SMOS uses a new sensor technology that is the first passive L-band system—measuring microwave radiation emitted around the frequency of 1. 4 gigahertz—in routine operation. But the accuracy of the information collected by this new technology still needs to be verified with actual soil moisture measurements, a task perfectly suited for a team of Agricultural Research Service scientists. In 2002, <b>ARS</b> <b>scientists</b> established soil moisture monitoring networks in four of the agency’s long-term experimental watersheds to verify the accuracy of soil moisture data collected by other Earth-orbiting satellites. The researchers have been monitoring soil moisture levels in these networks—located in ARS watersheds at Walnut Gulch, Arizona; Little Washita, Oklahoma; Little River, Georgia; and Reynolds Creek, Idaho—hourly since 2002. So they had a vast amount of data from a range of environments they could use to validate SMOS soil moisture measurements...|$|E
40|$|That oatmeal you ate {{for breakfast}} {{this morning is}} loaded with healthful {{compounds}} known as antioxidants. They help to protect your body from damage caused by molecules known as free radicals. Oats, for instance, are rich in the antioxidants alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocotrienol. But what if tomorrow’s oats could provide even more of these health-imparting compounds? That’s a goal of ARS oat researchers at laboratories in several states. Aiding this research is an invaluable tool of modern biotechnology. Known as biomolecular markers, gene markers, or DNA markers, these pieces of genetic material are signposts or clues. They are telltale indicators that, for example, the specific oat plant under scrutiny indeed contains the gene or genes for producing impressively high levels of antioxidants or other prized traits. <b>ARS</b> <b>scientists</b> at Aberdeen, Idaho, and Madison, Wisconsin, are narrowing down the search for DNA markers linked to genes that unerringly indicate {{a high level of}} antioxidants in oats. Their studies suggest that superior oats for the future could have significantly more antioxidants than most conventional varieties. Similarly, they plan to use marker-assisted technology to greatly increase the amount of protein that oats can add to your breakfast. This work by scientists at the Aberdeen and Madison laboratories, done in collaboration with nutrition researchers, should greatly enhance the health benefits of tomorrow’s cereal quite a bit...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{diseases}} must {{be managed}} to successfully and reliably produce crops to meet humanity’s growing food, fiber, feed, and fuel needs. Plant disease management relies on {{many different types}} of tools—from disease-resistant plant varieties and pesticides to cultural and biological strategies. Agricultural Research Service scientists are seeking new methods of managing plant diseases, more efficient means of using older methods, and combinations of these methods. Two of the oldest ways of reducing plant diseases are crop rotation and organic amendments to soil. In Orono, Maine, for example, <b>ARS</b> <b>scientists</b> are evaluating a holistic approach to suppressing soilborne pathogens of potato, including 2 - and 3 -year rotations with barley, ryegrass, canola, and rapeseed. In one study, the regimen reduced the incidence of Rhizoctonia by as much as 50 percent. They also examined the effectiveness of biological soil amendments, such as compost tea (compost steeped in water) and cover crops of winter rye, against various types of scab, black scurf, and other potato diseases. (See story in the next issue.) Historically, heat has been used to rid plants of some pathogens—at temperatures and durations that won’t damage the plants in the process. Indeed, in Fort Pierce, Florida, ARS researchers are evaluating such a method to rid citrus seedlings of the bacterial agent that causes Huanglongbing (HLB), also known as “citrus greening. ” The citrus disease has caused serious economic losses in the “Sunshine State” and in other citrus-growing regions of the world for decades. The disease weakens, and can eventually kill, afflicted trees as well as render their fruit unmarketable...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural Research Service {{scientists}} in New York and California have developed very different technologies that {{share a common}} thread. They offer scientists new, innovative ways to probe {{what happens when a}} crop is threatened by drought or disease. Michelle Cilia and Stewart Gray, <b>ARS</b> <b>scientists</b> at the Robert W. Holley Center for Agriculture and Health in Ithaca, New York, and their colleagues at the University of Washington {{have found a way to}} map the structure of an elusive protein that gives certain plant viruses the ability to travel from plants to insects, through the insects, and back into plants. Andrew McElrone, a plant physiologist in the Crops Pathology and Genetics Research Unit in Davis, California, has adapted computed tomography (CT) scan technology to vastly improve on the tools available for studying how water and pathogens move through vascular plant tissue called “xylem. ” The work has opened a window into how grapevines respond to drought stress and is shedding light on vascular networks in a number of other crops. Luteovirus Proteins: It’s the Shape That Counts To move from plant to plant, luteoviruses, such as potato leafroll virus and soybean dwarf virus, need to stay in the infected plant’s phloem tissues, which carry sugars and other substances in the plant, so they can be ingested by a feeding aphid. Once inside the aphid, the virus must pass through the insect’s gut and salivary tissues before it can be passed into another plant by the aphid. To accomplish that remarkable journey, viruses need to PEGGY GREB (D 2825 - 1) MICHELLE CILIA, JAMES BRUCE (D 2833 - 1) assemble proteins into larger packages known as “virions. ” Each luteovirus species is very particular and can only be transmitted by a few species of aphids. Cilia, Gray, and their partners James Bruce and Juan Chavez of the University of Washington think that the outside shape, or topology, of the virion plays a major role in that specificity, determining whether a virus will be able to move through the aphid and infect a plant...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} the {{screwworm}} eradication program - these pests have been eliminated from the North American continent to Panama - has been facilitated by insightful research. The recent research on screwworms by <b>ARS</b> <b>scientists</b> at Lincoln, NE has concentrated on 1) discovering molecular markers useful in population genetics and population identification; 2) genetic research useful in developing a genetic sexing strain (males-only) in screwworms. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) have been studied in screwworms; this technique shows the potential for use in population identification and population genetics. AFLP 2 ̆ 7 s will be further explored to determine their utility: a grant proposal submitted this past year {{to address this question}} as well as others, with most the Western Hemisphere 2 ̆ 7 s participants in this CRP as collaborators, was not funded but could be resubmitted. Transgenic techniques have been successfully applied to screwworms. In collaboration with Dr. Alfred Handler (ARS, Gainesville, Florida and participant in this CRP), screwworms now express genes for Green Fluorescent Protein that were inserted using the piggyback transposable element construct provided by Dr. Handler. Eight unique strains have been isolated, PCR and Southern Blot analyses have been completed to verify the events, and fitness of the transgenic strains {{has been shown to be}} similar to non-transgenic, 2 ̆ 7 normal 2 ̆ 7 strains. Crosses have been completed, using the seven mutant phenotype strains and one 2 ̆ 7 normal 2 ̆ 7 strain, to examine genetic linkage and/or interactions. Several of the crosses resulted in F 2 generations that deviated from expected ratios; this indicates either genetic linkage, gene interaction or both. Further crossing studies are needed. We also have designed a study whereby crosses will be done to examine phenotypic ratios and progeny will be saved so that AFLP can be used to begin developing a genetic linkage map based on molecular markers...|$|E
40|$|Like {{many other}} {{public and private}} organizations, the Agricultural Research Service is very {{concerned}} about how much food goes to waste between farm and fork—both nationally and internationally. By reducing losses in our food systems, U. S. growers, processors, and others can enhance America’s ability to feed itself and the world. By the same token, slashing waste may provide new opportunities to reduce costs along the entire supply chain and make better use of increasingly limited natural resources. The U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service (ERS) estimated— in 2008 —that {{the amount of food}} lost annually at just the retail and consumer levels alone averaged 275 pounds per person, representing a total yearly national impact of $ 165 billion. Cutting our food losses by just 15 percent would provide enough extra food to feed more than 25 million Americans every year from existing crop, pasture, and rangelands. Another ERS assessment found that most of the food loss in developed countries happens postharvest, that is, after food has left the farm gate, while in less developed countries, the bulk of the loss occurs before harvest. In the United States, nonprofit organizations concerned with a stable and accessible food supply—and wise use of the resources that are needed to produce and deliver that food—have called on the federal government to conduct a comprehensive study of losses in our food systems and to set national goals for reducing this waste. Meanwhile, <b>ARS</b> <b>scientists</b> at laboratories throughout the country have, for some time, been conducting a range of studies to create new technologies or to newly apply existing ones to curb food waste. Our ongoing work encompasses a wide variety of foods, from grains to grapes, meats to potatoes, and more. For example, we have developed an ozone-based treatment that growers of organic grapes can use—after harvest—to inhibit Botrytis cinerea, the microbe that causes gray mold. The research provides an alternative to sulfur dioxide, which organic growers cannot use. We are investigating the combined use of refrigeration, improved packaging, and a natural compound that delays ripening to help perishables such as strawberries, blueberries, and tomatoes stay fresh longer during shipping and storage. We are developing powdered fruit- and vegetable-based coatings to inhibit spoilage of fresh-cut produce. We are experimenting with the use of cold plasma technology to ionize the atmosphere inside packages of raw chicken breasts to quickly, safely, and effectively extend the shelf life of this popular product. We are inventing robots for in-orchard culling of apples, a high-tech approach that could help reduce the postharvest spread of insects or crop diseases from one apple to the next...|$|E
40|$|With {{the climate}} {{changing}} and the world’s population {{expected to rise}} in the coming decades, supplying a hungry planet with food and fiber will {{become more of a}} challenge. By some estimates, food production will have to increase by up to 70 percent to feed the world over the next 40 years. Perhaps no resource is more critical to meeting that challenge than water. How essential is water to agriculture? An estimated 17 percent of all harvested U. S. cropland is irrigated, accounting for about 56. 6 million acres. Worldwide, more than 40 percent of the world’s food is grown on irrigated land, including the majority of high-market-value crops, such as fruits, nuts, and vegetables. There is no doubt that drought is a continuing threat. At the peak of last summer’s record drought, more than 2, 255 counties in 39 states were declared disaster areas, prompting U. S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to make $ 30 million in emergency funds available to struggling crop and livestock producers. By some estimates, the drought affected more than three-quarters of the nation’s corn and soybean crops. Economic losses are shared by livestock producers, who are forced to pay more for feed made with corn and other grains. At the Agricultural Research Service, our drought-related research is {{based on the belief that}} if we understand the effects of drought on crops and habitats, we will be better equipped to address them. This issue highlights some of that research. On page 4, there is an article about research at the ARS Water Reuse and Remediation Research Unit in Riverside, California, to help growers tap into irrigation water that drains off crop fields in California’s San Joaquin Valley and reuse it to grow forage for livestock. On page 6, you can read about work at the ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory in Bushland, Texas, to develop irrigation-scheduling tools for the Texas High Plains, where water levels in the Ogallala Aquifer are rapidly declining. Researchers at the ARS Hydrology and Remote Sensing Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, have developed new tools that use satellites to assess soil water levels over large geographic areas. They’ve found that microwave and thermal radiative signatures of agricultural landscapes, detected by satellites, allow them to identify droughts earlier and collect more detailed information about their extent and severity. They shared the technology with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other federal agencies, and it is being used to assist in quantifying drought conditions in the Horn of Africa. <b>ARS</b> <b>scientists</b> are also using molecular tools at more than a dozen locations to identify genes in cotton, soybeans, wheat, and other crops that play key roles in determining drought tolerance. Their approaches range from using high-throughput phenotyping under drought conditions to DNA marker-assisted breeding techniques. Using molecular tools, researchers at the ARS Coastal Plains Soil, Water, and Plant Research Center in Florence, South Carolina, have discovered a family of genes in cotton that code for aquaporin proteins that function in plants as water-transport systems. Along with others discovered by the group, these genes are good candidates for improving cotton water-use efficiency. ARS researchers in Ithaca, New York; College Station, Texas; and other locations are scanning the genomes of corn, wheat, and other crops, searching for genes that will prove useful in developing varieties with deeper roots and other traits that will help them grow with less water and under higher temperatures. At the ARS Soybean and Nitrogen Fixation Research Laboratory in Raleigh, North Carolina, scientists have developed and released the first-ever drought-tolerant soybean, which carries a gene that allows it to wilt more slowly than a normal soybean. Under drought conditions, slow-wilting types yield about 4 to 8 bushels per acre more than normal varieties and also show good yield potential when rain falls. After many years of exploiting existing diversity within the genus Phaseolus (beans), ARS researchers in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, have been able to combine genes for resistance to heat, drought, and disease and have released two highyielding, stress-tolerant black bean varieties; two heat-tolerant kidney bean lines; and rust-resistant, heat-tolerant common bean lines...|$|E
