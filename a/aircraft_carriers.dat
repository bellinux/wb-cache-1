5|$|The Lexington-class <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> were {{a pair of}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> {{built for}} the United States Navy (USN) during the 1920s. The ships were built on hulls {{originally}} laid down as battlecruisers after World War I, but under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, all U.S. battleship and battlecruiser construction was cancelled. The Treaty, however, allowed two of the unfinished ships to be converted to carriers. They were the first operational <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> in the USN and were used to develop carrier aviation tactics and procedures before World War II {{in a series of}} annual exercises.|$|E
5|$|The Nimitz-class <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> {{were ordered}} to {{supplement}} the <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> of the Kitty Hawk class and Enterprise class, maintaining the strength and capability of the U.S. Navy after the older carriers were decommissioned. The ships were designed to be improvements on previous U.S. <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers,</b> in particular the Enterprise and Forrestal-class supercarriers, although {{the arrangement of the}} ships is relatively {{similar to that of the}} Kitty Hawk class. Among other design improvements, the two reactors on Nimitz-class carriers take up less space than the eight reactors used on Enterprise. Along with a more generally improved design, this means that Nimitz-class carriers can carry 90% more aviation fuel and 50% more ordnance when compared to the Forrestal class.|$|E
5|$|Half a {{dozen of}} the {{surviving}} battlecruisers (including three under construction) were converted into <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> during the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|Wakamiya was {{modified}} {{as a regular}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> with a launch platform on the foredeck in April 1920 (when she was renamed Wakamiya-kan 若宮艦). She accomplished in June 1920 the first Japanese take-off from an <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier.</b> It is thought she had a pioneering role in developing <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> techniques for the Japanese <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> Hosho, the first purpose-built <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> in the world.|$|R
50|$|The Type 001A <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> or CV-17 <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> is a Chinese <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> {{that was}} {{launched}} on 26 April 2017 for the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) of China.

5|$|In 1943 the Royal Navy {{commissioned}} six light <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> in {{an effort}} to counter the German and Japanese navies. The 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier, commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was the result. Serving with eight navies between 1944 and 2001, these ships were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards as an intermediate step between the full-sized fleet <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> and the less expensive but limited-capability escort carriers.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November 2015, the {{government}} published its 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review which confirmed {{its plans to}} bring into service both Queen Elizabeth-class <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers,</b> with one to be available at all times. The review also confirmed {{that one of the}} carriers would have enhanced amphibious capabilities. The government also reaffirmed its commitment to ordering 138 F-35 Lightning IIs, although the specific variant(s) was not mentioned. The review stated that 24 of these aircraft would be available to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> by 2023.|$|E

5|$|Seydlitz was a {{heavy cruiser}} of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, fourth in the , but was never completed. The ship was laid down in December 1936 and {{launched}} in January 1939, but the outbreak of World War II slowed her construction and fitting-out work was finally stopped {{in the summer of}} 1940 when she was approximately 95percent complete. The unfinished ship remained pier-side in the shipyard until March 1942, when the Kriegsmarine decided to pursue <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> over surface combatants. Seydlitz was among the vessels chosen for conversion into auxiliary <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} {{designed}} to escort the US fleet of fast attack <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers,</b> the Iowa-class battleships were all intended to carry a fearsome array of anti-aircraft guns to protect US <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> from Japanese fighters and dive bombers. This array included up to 20 quad 40mm mounts and 49 single 20mm mounts. In the 1968 USS New Jersey re-activation for service off Vietnam, the 20mm and 40mm batteries were removed. In the 1980s re-activation, all the ships with 20mm and 40mm batteries had them removed, and four Phalanx CIWS mounts were added to all.|$|E
5|$|The German {{aircraft}} carrier I was a planned {{conversion of the}} transport ship Europa during World War II. The loss of the battleship Bismarck and near torpedoing of her sistership Tirpitz in May 1941 and March 1942, respectively, spurred the Kriegsmarine to acquire <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b> Europa {{was one of several}} vessels selected for conversion into auxiliary <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b> As designed, the ship would have had an air complement of 24 Bf 109T fighters and 18 Ju 87C Stuka dive-bombers.|$|E

5|$|All three {{ships were}} laid {{up after the}} war, but were rebuilt as <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> during the 1920s. Glorious and Courageous were sunk early in the Second World War and Furious was sold for scrap in 1948.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, Allied {{submarine}} attacks effectively cut off {{the supply}} of oil from Southeast Asia to Japan and greatly reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By {{this stage of the}} war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S.Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers,</b> two heavy and seven light cruisers. In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all convoy routes from the south would eventually be cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil brought in by tankers by loading drums of oil on freighters. Several IJN <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> were also used to transport drums of oil from Singapore to Japan.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{construction}} of the Iowa class, the US Navy was not building a fast battleship class solely for the purpose of escorting Pacific-based <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers,</b> and thus the Montana class would not be designed principally for escorting the fast carrier task forces; nonetheless they would have been equipped with a wide array of anti-aircraft guns to protect themselves and other ships (principally the US <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers)</b> from Japanese fighters and dive bombers. If commissioned, the ships were expected to mount a considerable array of Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft weapons.|$|E
50|$|Brabner {{served as}} {{an officer of the}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the Second World War as a Fleet Air Arm pilot.

5|$|Two years later, Settsu was {{converted}} into a target ship and she played a minor role {{at the beginning of}} the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. At the beginning of the Pacific War in 1941, the ship was used in an attempt to deceive the Allies as to the locations and activities of the Japanese <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers.</b> Settsu reverted to her normal role as a target ship for the rest of the war; she was badly damaged when Allied <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> struck the naval base at Kure Naval District in July 1945. The ship was refloated after the war and scrapped in 1946–47.|$|E

5|$|When the {{requirement}} for the Apache had been formalised in the early 1990s, military doctrine assumed that a large conventional armoured assault from the Eastern Bloc was Britain's main threat. Following the collapse and break-up of the Soviet Union, the concepts of flexibility and rapid response took precedence. The UK's Strategic Defence Review called for Apaches to undertake amphibious attack missions, operating from the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, the Invincible class <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> and their successors, the Queen Elizabeth class <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers,</b> and possibly the amphibious assault vessels HMS Bulwark and Albion. Each squadron equipped with the Apache should have eight operational aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A {{tenth of}} the city's {{workforce}} is employed at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard, which is directly linked to the city's biggest industry, defence, with the headquarters of BAE Systems Surface Ships located in the city. BAE's Portsmouth shipyard has been awarded {{a share of the}} construction work on the two new Queen Elizabeth class <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers,</b> with both <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> set to enter Portsmouth Harbour upon completion. A £100 million contract was signed to develop the facilities at Portsmouth that will be necessary to support the vessels. There is also a major ferry port that handles both passengers and cargo, and the city has a dedicated fishing fleet consisting of 20 to 30 boats that operate out of the camber docks in Camber Quay, Old Portsmouth. They land fresh fish and shellfish daily, most of which is sold at the quayside fish market.|$|E
5|$|Advances {{were made}} in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with <b>aircraft</b> <b>carriers</b> and submarines. Although {{aeronautical}} warfare had relatively little success {{at the start of}} the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.|$|E
