25|$|According to Andrew Beveridge, <b>a</b> <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sociology</b> at Queens College, between 2000 and 2005, {{young women}} in their twenties earned more than their male {{counterparts}} in some large urban centers, including Dallas (120%), New York (117%), Chicago, Boston, and Minneapolis. A major {{reason for this is that}} women have been graduating from college in larger numbers than men, and that many of those women seem to be gravitating toward major urban areas. In 2005, 53% of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates, compared with only 38% of men of that age. Nationwide, the wages of that group of women averaged 89% of the average full-time pay for men between 2000 and 2005.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} grown in popularity. Murray Burnett called it [...] "true yesterday, true today, true tomorrow". By 1955, the film had brought in $6.8 million, making it the third most {{successful}} of Warners' wartime movies (behind Shine On, Harvest Moon and This Is the Army). On April 21, 1957, the Brattle Theater of Cambridge, Massachusetts, showed the film {{as part of a}} season of old movies. It was so popular that it began a tradition of screening Casablanca during the week of final exams at Harvard University, which continues to the present day. Other colleges have adopted the tradition. Todd Gitlin, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>sociology</b> who had attended one of these screenings, has said that the experience was [...] "the acting out of my own personal rite of passage". The tradition helped the movie remain popular while other films famous in the 1940s have faded from popular memory. By 1977, Casablanca was the most frequently broadcast film on American television.|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 1998, Houston Police Department {{officers}} {{acting on}} a tip regarding drug related activities entered a Gulfton apartment complex and shot and killed Pedro Oregon Navarro. The circumstances of the event were disputed. By October 19 of that year a Harris County grand jury cleared the officers of charges related to the incident. Nestor Rodriguez, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>sociology</b> at the University of Houston, described Gulfton as [...] "a place where people are just struggling to get by." [...] Consequently, there were fewer [...] "displays of outrage" [...] than would have been expected if the incident had occurred {{in one of the}} [...] "older, well-established Latino communities." [...] Oregon's killing was controversial because illicit drugs were not found on the property. Oregon's family sued the City of Houston arguing that the raid was inappropriate. The city countered that its officers acted in an appropriate manner. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in 2000.|$|E
500|$|The {{city-state}} of Hamburg set up {{a full-time}} office dedicated to opposing Scientology, the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority, {{under the leadership of}} Ursula Caberta. In 2005, in a case brought by a Scientologist, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany ordered the city of Hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community, finding that the practice infringed religious freedom. In June 2008, the Hamburg Administrative Court fined the city of Hamburg 5,000 Euros ($7,000) for not complying with court instructions banning the use of [...] "sect filters." [...] Internet links to sample filters to be used by businesses had continued to remain available. Eileen Barker, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>sociology</b> at the London School of Economics, has noted that [...] "Germany has gone further than any other Western European country in restricting the civil rights of Scientologists." [...] The Hamburg task force was closed down in August 2010 as a result of budget cuts; Caberta moved to a position within the Hamburg interior authority, where she continues her work on Scientology.|$|E
