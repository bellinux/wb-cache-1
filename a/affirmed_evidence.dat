40|$|Abstract Background The {{time period}} from {{diagnosis}} {{to the end}} of treatment is challenging for newly diagnosed cancer patients. Patients have a substantial need for information, decision aids, and psychosocial support. Recordings of initial oncology consultations improve information recall, reduce anxiety, enhance patient satisfaction with communication, and increase patients' perceptions that the essential aspects of their disease and treatment have been addressed during the consultation. Despite the research evidence supporting the provision of consultation recordings, uptake of this intervention into oncology practice has been slow. The primary aim of this project is to conduct an implementation study to explicate the contextual factors, including use of evidence, that facilitate and impede the transfer and uptake of consultation-recording use in a sample of patients newly diagnosed with breast or prostate cancer. Methods Sixteen oncologists from cancer centres in three Canadian cities will participate in this three-phase study. The preimplementation phase will be used to identify and address those factors that are fundamental to facilitating the smooth adoption and delivery of the intervention during the implementation phase. During the implementation phase, breast and prostate cancer patients will receive a recording of their initial oncology consultation to take home. Patient interviews will be conducted in the days following the consultation to gather feedback on the benefits of the intervention. Patients will complete the Digital Recording Use Semi-Structured Interview (DRUSSI) and be invited to participate in focus groups in which their experiences with the consultation recording will be explored. Oncologists will receive a summary letter detailing the benefits voiced by their patients. The postimplementation phase includes a conceptual framework development meeting and a seven-point dissemination strategy. Discussion Consultation recording has been used in oncology, family medicine, and other medicine specialties, and despite <b>affirming</b> <b>evidence</b> and probable applications to a large number of diseases and a variety of clinical contexts, clinical adoption of this intervention has been slow. The proposed study findings will advance our conceptual knowledge of the ways to enhance uptake of consultation recordings in oncology. </p...|$|R

50|$|By the 15th-century, Songhay Empire rulers to the {{immediate}} north of Fon people, in the Niger River valley, were already using thousands of captured slaves for agriculture. The demand for slave labor to produce sugarcane, cotton, palm oil, tobacco and other goods in the plantations of European colonies around the globe had sharply grown between 1650 to 1850. The Bight of Benin was already shipping slaves in late 17th-century, before the Fon people expanded their kingdom {{to gain control of}} the coast line. The Fon rulers and merchants whose powers were established on the Atlantic coast between 1700 to 1740, entered this market. The Fon people were divided on how to respond to the slave demand. Some scholars suggest that Fon people and Dahomey rulers expressed intentions to curtail or end slave trading, states Elizabeth Heath, but historical <b>evidence</b> <b>affirms</b> that the Benin coastline including the ports of the Dahomey rulers and the Fon people became one of the largest exporter of slaves.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interaction between}} constitutional design and practice through {{a case study of}} Canadian federalism. Focusing on the federal architecture of the Canadian Constitution, the paper examines how subnational units in Canada actually compete with the central government, emphasizing the concrete strategies and tactics they most commonly employ to get their way in confrontations with central authority. The <b>evidence</b> <b>affirms</b> that constitutional design and structure make an important difference in the tactics and tools available to subnational units in a federal system, but that design is not fully constraining: there is considerable evidence of extraconstitutional innovation and improvisation by governments. Furthermore, changes in practice initiated by Canadian subnational actors have produced changes in the allocation of national and subnational authority that are plausibly characterized as constitutional in magnitude. The paper concludes that the design of the Canadian federal system may inadvertently undermine its capacity to stabilize itself at any particular point of constitutional evolution, making it “permanently provisional. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Previous {{systematic}} reviews {{have indicated}} that pesticide exposure is possibly associated with Parkinson disease (PD). However, considerable heterogeneity has been observed in study results. OBJECTIVE We aimed at providing an update of the literature published on PD and exposure to pesticides by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. In addition, we investigated whether methodological differences between studies could explain the heterogeneity in study results. METHODS We identified studies through a systematic literature search. We calculated summary risk ratios (sRRs) for pesticide exposure and subcategories using random effects meta-analyses and investigated sources of heterogeneity by meta-regression and stratified analyses. RESULTS Thirty-nine case-control studies, four cohort studies, and three cross-sectional studies were identified. An sRR of 1. 62 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 40, 1. 88] for pesticide exposure (ever vs. never) was found. Summary estimates for subclasses of pesticides indicated a positive association with herbicides and insecticides, but not with fungicides. Heterogeneity in individual study results {{was not related to}} study design, source of control population, adjustment of results for potential confounders, or geographical area. However, results were suggestive for heterogeneity related to differences in the exposure assessment. Job title-based exposure assignment resulted in a higher sRR (2. 5; 95 % CI: 1. 5, 4. 1) than did assignment based on self-reported exposure (e. g., for self-reported ever/never exposure, sRR = 1. 5; 95 % CI: 1. 3, 1. 8). CONCLUSIONS This review <b>affirms</b> the <b>evidence</b> that exposure to herbicides and insecticides increase the risk of PD. Future studies should focus on more objective and improved methods of pesticide exposure assessment...|$|R
40|$|As forums, School Governing Bodies {{have the}} makings of a great and unique South African {{democratic}} tradition as they reflect local deliberations, participative decision-making by stakeholders in education. The main contention of this article is that the SGB election processes at many public schools in South Africa are deficient. Legal analysis reveals the extent of non-uniformity of SGB election regulations among the nine provinces, as well as unlawful regulatory provisions, the unfair and undemocratic administration of the election process and misconceptions about democracy are causal factors that result deficiencies in SGB elections. The qualitative <b>evidence</b> <b>affirms</b> that parents are concerned about the insufficient information about candidates before and during elections, thus preventing voters from making informed decisions. Undemocratic features in the election process results in the election of unsuitable or incompetent candidates which has a detrimental effect on the governance of public schools. It is therefore recommended that a new set of nationally uniform SGB election regulations, which allows for transparent deliberation between candidates and voters should be promulgated before the next SGB election in order to address these shortcomings...|$|R
40|$|Expanding {{behavioral}} and neurobiological <b>evidence</b> <b>affirms</b> benefits of shared (especially parent-child) reading on cognitive development during early childhood. However, {{the majority of}} this evidence involves factors under caregiver control, the influence of those intrinsic to the child, such as interest or engagement in reading, largely indirect or unclear. The cerebellum is increasingly recognized as playing a "smoothing" role in higher-level cognitive processing and learning, via feedback loops with language, limbic and association cortices. We utilized functional MRI to explore the relationship between child engagement during a mother-child reading observation and neural activation and connectivity during a story listening task, {{in a sample of}} 4 -year old girls. Children exhibiting greater interest and engagement in the narrative showed increased activation in right-sided cerebellar association areas during the task, and greater functional connectivity between this activation cluster and language and executive function areas. Our findings suggest a potential cerebellar "boost" mechanism responsive to child engagement level that may contribute to emergent literacy development during early childhood, and synergy between caregiver and child factors during story sharing...|$|R

30|$|Research {{involving}} {{undergraduate students}} indicate that laptop multitasking can hinder class learning for both users and nearby peers (Fried, 2008; Sana, Weston, & Cepeda, 2013). Fried (2008) administered surveys {{to a university}} course, assessing various aspects of class such as class attendance, classroom experiences, and laptop use, finding that students frequently cited personal and external laptop use as major sources of classroom distractions and hindrances of learning. Experimental <b>evidence</b> <b>affirms</b> this: Sana et al. (2013) simulated a classroom with 40 undergraduate students in which students viewed a 45 -min PowerPoint lecture in a multitasking or non-multitasking condition and completed a multiple-choice comprehension test. Participants who multitasked on a laptop during lecture scored lower on the test than non-multitaskers. Moreover, participants in direct view of a multitasking peer scored 17 % lower {{than those who were}} not. Distractions due to movement of images and laptop screen lighting, as well as multitasking activities, may cause involuntary shifts of attention among students in close proximity to laptop users. Thus, proximity to a multitasker—and not solely active multitasking—can be detrimental to academic performance. Understanding the effects of multitasking on others is an area of research deserving replication and further investigation.|$|R

40|$|The {{genre of}} fairy tales lacks a {{concrete}} confinement, allowing its stories to span across age, asserting {{a variety of}} themes and captivating {{a wide range of}} audience members. The familiarity of such traditional stories, however, sets a precedent for the genre - an ability to assert a lesson and an element of escaped reality. Fairy tales exist even in modern times and reappear in existing and novel ways. Both traditional and modern fairy tales possess an extremely important role in societal expectations, disturbances in human desire, and the ideals/behaviors of individuals, regardless of age. With the use of both traditional and modern day texts, it becomes evident that fairy tales have an overwhelming impact on readers. Their themes, settings, characters, and plots promote relevant expectations and ideals society expects individuals to maintain throughout their life. More importantly, it reveals the innate attraction that readers have toward these works and what that says about humanity. Details from selected works demonstrate these prominent fairy-tale characteristics across mediums (text, film, and life-size attractions) and provide <b>evidence</b> <b>affirming</b> the assertion that fairy tales have an impactful power on the actions and thoughts of individuals and the important themes of society...|$|R
5000|$|Chapman {{was born}} at Hitchin in Hertfordshire. There is {{conjecture}} that he studied at Oxford but did not take a degree, though no reliable <b>evidence</b> <b>affirms</b> this. Very {{little is known about}} Chapman's early life, but Mark Eccles uncovered records that reveal much about Chapman's difficulties and expectations. In 1585 Chapman was approached in a friendly fashion by John Wolfall, Sr., who offered to supply a bond of surety for a loan to furnish Chapman money [...] "for his proper use in Attendance upon the then Right Honorable Sir Rafe Sadler Knight." [...] Chapman's courtly ambitions led him into a trap. He apparently never received any money, but he would be plagued for many years by the papers he had signed. Wolfall had the poet arrested for debt in 1600, and when in 1608 Wolfall's son, having inherited his father's papers, sued yet again, Chapman's only resort was to petition the Court of Chancery for equity. As Sadler died in 1587, this gives Chapman little time to have trained under him. It seems more likely that he was in Sadler's household from 1577-83, as he dedicates all his Homerical translations to him.|$|R
