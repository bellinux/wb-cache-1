However, lack of a centralized authority, prompts many security-related challenges. Providing efficient security services in these systems is an active research topic which is receiving much attention in the security research community. In this paper, we explore the use of threshold cryptography in peer-to-peer settings (both Internet- and MANETbased) to provide, in a robust and fault tolerant fashion, security services such as <b>authentication,</b> <b>certificate</b> issuance and access control. Threshold cryptography provides high availability by distributing trust throughout the group and is, therefore, an attractive solution for secure peer-groups. At least, so it seems [...] . Our work investigates the applicability of threshold cryptography for membership control in peer-to-peer systems. In the process, we discover that one interesting recently proposed scheme contains an unfortunate (yet serious) flaw. We then present an alternative solution and its performance measurements. More importantly, our preliminary work casts {{a certain degree of}} skepticism on the practicality and even viability of using (seemingly attractive) threshold cryptography in certain peer-to-peer settings. ...|$|E

40|$|With the {{remarkable}} development of wireless Internet, there are rapidly growing mobile telecommunication services for its terminal. In particular, wireless e-commerce market offering information service {{as well as}} on-line or off-line sales and has been growing at a rapid pace, requiring wireless payment system for the success for it. The existing methods for the payment system are divided into hardware one and software one. However, the shortcoming of the former one is that user is required to attach smart card to mobile terminal and it cannot prevent the misuse of the third party. On the other hand, software one is to link real-time approval and payment system through mobile telecommunication wireless network. In this paper, {{we would like to}} suggest MobileC-based wireless payment system to execute on GVM (General Virtual Machine) based application program download solution. The wireless payment system is composed of initialization process and transaction process. Initialization process is to download program of payment system, formal <b>authentication</b> <b>certificate</b> and personal credit information to mobile device, to save them into non-volatile memory, while another one is executed every time of transaction through mutual exchange between connection server and mobile device.

The task is complicated by the contribution of multiple providers to an encounter and the entry of data at multiple points in time Dividing encounters into an episode of care and redesigning the data model of the EMR will facilitate full signature capabilities. Generation of digital signatures is best accomplished using microprocessors on smart cards that control visibility of the private keys and assist in user authentication. The Java Programming Language including cryptography extensions and a smart card API is a useful tool for adding digital signature to an EMR. Inter-operability of signatures and continuity of signature will require attention to standards and preservation of cryptography and <b>authentication</b> <b>certificate</b> archives. Digital signatures will need to accommodate changes in data storage formats when information is transported between EMR systems using XML or other transaction standards because the original signatures will not validate if the data storage format changes. The costs of adding digital signature to EMR mandates serious examination of the business case for digital signature within an EMR as compared with transactions such as electronic prescriptions. At present, there is no regulatory requirement for digital signature of an EMR...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a network where users can issue certificates that identify the public keys of other {{users in the}} network. The issued certificates in a network constitute a set of certificate chains between users. A user u can obtain the public key of another user v from a certificate chain from u to v in the network. For the certificate chain from u to v, u is called {{the source of the}} chain and v is called the destination of the chain. Certificates in each chain are dispersed between the source and destination of the chain such that the following condition holds. If any user u needs to securely send messages to any other user v in the network, then u can use the certificates stored in u and v to obtain the public key of v (then u can use the public key of v to set up a shared key with v to securely send messages to v). The cost of dispersing certificates in a set of chains among the source and destination users in a network is measured {{by the total number of}} certificates that need to be stored in all users. A dispersal of a set of certificate chains in a network is optimal if no other dispersal of the same chain set has a strictly lower cost. In this paper, we show that the problem of computing optimal dispersal of a given chain set is NP-complete. Thus, minimizing the total number of certificates stored in all users is NP-complete. We identify three special classes of chain sets that are of practical interests and devise three polynomial-time algorithms that compute optimal dispersals for each class. We also present two polynomial-time extensions of these algorithms for more general classes of chain sets.

While the gateway service is non-intrusive, the plug-in has technical advantages, e. g. by allowing data to remain on the grid while being passed betweenworkflow elements...|$|R
