500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} the {{inspiration}} for the film, saying: [...] "I have always loved cars. In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis." ...|$|E

There Shuster {{attended}} Glenville High School and befriended his later collaborator, writer Jerry Siegel, with whom he began publishing a science fiction fanzine called Science Fiction. Siegel described his friendship with the similarly shy and bespectacled Shuster: [...] "When Joe <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> met, it was like the right chemicals coming together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Siegel {{attended}} Glenville High School in Cleveland, Ohio {{and worked}} for its weekly student newspaper, The Torch. He was a shy, not particularly popular student, but became known among his peers for his Tarzan parody, [...] "Goober the Mighty." [...] At about age 16, while at Glenville, he befriended his later collaborator, Joe Shuster. Siegel described his friendship with the similarly shy and bespectacled Shuster: [...] "When Joe <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> met, {{it was like the}} right chemicals coming together." ...|$|E

Steve Aoki <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> talked on Twitter, {{and then we were}} emailing, and then we started throwing music back and forth." [...] In an interview on August 30, 2013, with Shinoda and Aoki, Shinoda said that they began working on the song [...] "no less than a half a year ago". He said they did not constantly work on it, but [...] "the ideas would flow whenever...something new came up".|$|E
2500|$|Westbrook was {{contracted}} {{for three}} months, {{and although it}} was extended slightly, she departed from the show {{at the end of}} her storyline in the episode broadcast on 11 January 2010. In an interview given with Digital Spy, Diederick Santer said: [...] "When Danniella <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> sat down to talk about her return, we discussed a particular storyline with a specific length of contract. These plans haven't changed. Danniella has done brilliantly and I hope that she will be back with us at some point in the future." [...] Westbrook filmed her final scenes at the end of October 2009.|$|E
2500|$|A {{boost to}} McCain's {{campaign}} came on March 25, when former First Lady Nancy Reagan endorsed the Senator {{at her home}} in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California. Reagan released a statement, reading, [...] "John McCain has been a good friend for over thirty years. My husband <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> came to know him as a returning Vietnam War POW, and were impressed by the courage he had shown through his terrible ordeal. I believe John's record and experience have prepared him well to be our next president." [...] Standing with Reagan, McCain said, [...] "This is an important, most important kind of expression of confidence in my ability to lead the party that I could have." [...] McCain's friendship with Nancy Reagan had survived a period of coldness following his divorce from his first wife Carol, whom the Reagans were quite fond of.|$|E

2500|$|Jordan quickly {{produced}} some initial script drafts, which Featherstone {{took to the}} BBC; Gareth Neame, Head of Drama Commissioning, rapidly approved a six-part series. Featherstone assembled a production team that had considerable overlap with the Spooks crew, including Simon Crawford Collins as producer and Matthew Graham as co-writer. In creating the first episodes, Jordan drew inspiration from the long tradition of confidence tricks and heists in Hollywood and television, including The A-Team, The Sting and The Grifters (and in a similar vein, the films and TV series of Mission Impossible). Featherstone remarked that [...] "Ocean's Eleven was on around the time Bharat <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> spoke, and I think it helped to inspire us, but really we took our inspiration from a whole catalogue of movies and books... {{we wanted to make}} something that had the energy, verve, style and pure entertainment value of those sorts of films" [...] At the same time, the writers attempted to draw on the success of recent blockbusters such as Ocean's Eleven and speaking in an interview in December 2003, Crawford explained that [...] " [...] worked because of the interaction within the group – the plotlines were almost irrelevant".|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, {{where the first}} five years of The X-Files had been filmed and produced before the series had moved to Los Angeles, was an early idea; one that seemed right to both Chris Carter and David Duchovny. According to Duchovny, [...] "It all makes sense. You know, when Chris <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> talked about doing this movie, we kind of unconsciously both said, 'You know, I guess it should be in Vancouver, it really should be,' and it just felt like you know, almost superstitiously like the right thing to do." [...] Filming in Vancouver also facilitated the return of many former crew members who had previously worked on The X-Files, as well as individuals who had worked on the other series that Ten Thirteen Productions had created. Frank Spotnitz said that [...] "In terms of making of the movie, we've brought together as many people as we can, not just from The X-Files but from all the shows that we did here in Vancouver – Harsh Realm, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen – and our crew is populated with all these faces that we'd worked with, over the past fifteen years. And there's even some people from the L.A. crew." ...|$|E
