25|$|To obtain <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> {{assignments}} <b>as</b> possible it is a {{great advantage}} to have access to carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 NOESY experiments, since they help to resolve overlap in the proton dimension. This leads to faster and more reliable assignments, and in turn to better structures.|$|R

5000|$|Data {{integrity}} is maximised and data redundancy is minimised, {{as the single}} storing place of all the data also implies that a given set of data only has one primary record.

5|$|As screenwriter, Fellowes {{sought to}} make the film as {{historically}} <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> possible. With this in mind, Academy Award-winning costume designer Sandy Powell and historical consultant Alastair Bruce were hired, and filming for The Young Victoria took place at various historical landmarks in England to further the film's authenticity. Despite this, {{various aspects of the}} film have been criticised for their historical inaccuracies.|$|E

5|$|Bramantyo {{attempted}} to make his film as historically <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> possible. However, as no documentation of Dahlan's life {{before he went to}} Mecca exists, the scenes showing Dahlan's youth were fictionalized. The script underwent 12 revisions before the film was completed. Much of the film's budget of Rp. 12 billion (US$ 1.3 million) was spent on costumes and sets to ensure accuracy. The crew restored several old buildings for their shots and custom-ordered 19th-century style traditional garments for their scenes.|$|E

5|$|Joaquim José Inácio {{was born}} in Lisbon, Kingdom of Portugal.

Regardless, some biographers, including Joaquim Manuel de Macedo and Carlos Guilherme Haring, have persisted in citing the date mistakenly entered on the birth certificate.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the tracks}} in Wipeout 64 feature {{mirrored}} layouts of circuits from select tracks in Wipeout and Wipeout 2097, set in different locations.

5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the twelfth}} century, the Spanish Muslim {{astronomer}} al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius) sought to explain the complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds from east to west. This model was much less <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> a predictive astronomical model, but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.|$|E
