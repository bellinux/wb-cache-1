5|$|The French Indian Ocean {{territories of}} Île de France and Île Bonaparte were heavily {{fortified}} island bases from which French frigates {{were able to}} launch raids against British trade routes across the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars. In late 1808, a squadron of four frigates departed France for the region under Commodore Jacques Hamelin with orders to prey on the convoys of East Indiamen that regularly crossed the Indian Ocean. During the late spring of 1809, these frigates dispersed into the Bay of Bengal, attacking British shipping and coastal harbours <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the Eastern Indian Ocean. The Royal Navy was also preparing an operation in the region, a staggered campaign intended to blockade, isolate and subsequently capture both Île deFrance and Île Bonaparte, eliminating the final French territories and bases east of Africa.|$|E
5|$|Throne of Fire is {{an action}} {{strategy}} game. Set in the Burning Citadel, located <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of a volcano, the player assumes {{the role of}} one of the three princes of the recently deceased King Atherik: Alorn the Lion Prince, Cordrin the Sun Prince, and Karag the Wolf Prince. As one of the princes, the player can play against two computer players or a second player and a computer player, who play the role of the other two princes. Each prince and their men-at-arms must fight the other princes and their army to the death. The player must also fight against the King's Guard, the protectors of the Throne of Fire. Weapons with their own strengths and weaknesses can be found around the castle, along with magical objects that can increase or decrease a character's strength.|$|E

50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} {{is in the}} wheels. Traction engines were generally built with large fabricated spoked steel wheels with wide rims. Those intended for road use would have continuous solid rubber tyres bolted <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims,</b> to improve traction on tarmac. Engines intended for agricultural use would {{have a series of}} strakes bolted diagonally across <b>the</b> <b>rims,</b> like <b>the</b> tread on a modern pneumatic tractor tyre, and the wheels were typically wider to spread the load more evenly.|$|R

25|$|In the west, {{around the}} end of the 19th century, the game was played by boys up to about twelve years of age. Hoops would at times have pairs of tin squares nailed {{to the inside of the}} circle, to jingle as the hoop was rolled. Up to a dozen such pairs of rattles might be placed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the hoop. Some {{preferred}} the ashen hoops, round on the outside and flat on the inside, to the ones made of iron, as the latter could break windows and hurt the legs of the passers by and horses.|$|E
30|$|To quantitatively compare {{experimental}} and simulated scattering images in Fig. 4, our first {{task is to}} extract the angular scattering distributions from the images by analyzing the scattering intensity in a small annulus <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> of <b>the</b> images.

Many effects related to kinematics of the crossed beam geometry affect the image (see section “Effects in the images”), severely complicating the analysis.|$|R

25|$|Divac had {{an unusual}} style {{compared}} to most other centers of his generation: despite his height, he possessed good mobility, had good {{control of the}} ball, and was a decent shooter. On occasion, he would also act as a play maker. His trademark moves included a mid-range shot {{at the top of}} the key and flip shots <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> while facing the complete opposite direction. His quirky moves complemented how he liked playing gags on the court: in the 1989 EuroBasket, he lifted teammate Zoran Radović for a slam dunk. In just four professional seasons in Europe, he became the most sought-after big man on the continent, after Arvydas Sabonis.|$|E
25|$|In the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, the {{cauldron}} {{resembled the}} end of a scroll that lifted out from the stadium rim and spiralled upwards. It was lit by Li Ning, a Chinese gymnast who was raised to the rim of the stadium by wires. He ran <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the stadium while suspended and as he ran, an unrolling scroll was projected showing film clips of the flame's journey around the world. As he approached the cauldron, he lit an enormous wick, which then transferred the flame to the cauldron. The flame then spiralled up the structure of the cauldron before lighting it at the top.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooking chamber}} {{is similar to}} a Faraday cage to prevent the waves from coming out of the oven. Even though there is no {{continuous}} metal-to-metal contact <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the door, choke connections on the door edges act like metal-to-metal contact, at the frequency of the microwaves, to prevent leakage. The oven door usually has a window for easy viewing, with a layer of conductive mesh some distance from the outer panel to maintain the shielding. Because the size of the perforations in the mesh is much less than the microwaves' wavelength (12.2 cm for the usual 2.45 GHz), microwave radiation cannot pass through the door, while visible light (with its much shorter wavelength) can.|$|E

25|$|Autzen Stadium, {{the home}} of Oregon's {{football}} team since 1967, was {{named in honor of}} Thomas J. Autzen, a Portland businessman and, ironically, a graduate of rival Oregon State University. After his death, the Autzen Foundation, managed by son and Oregon alum Thomas E. Autzen, gave the university $250,000 towards construction of the facility, completed in 1967. The 59,000 seat stadium is known as a very intimidating and loud environment. Standing room <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the stadium allows the capacity to swell to more than 60,000. On October 27, 2007 in a game against USC, the crowd of 59,277 was able to reach a noise level of 127.2 decibels, the 4th loudest ever recorded at a college football game.|$|E
25|$|After the Vorticists' only U.K. {{exhibition}} in 1915, the movement broke up, {{largely as a}} result of World War I, though Lewis's patron, John Quinn, organised a Vorticist exhibition at the Penguin Club in New York in 1917. Lewis was posted to the western front, and served as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. Much of his time was spent in Forward Observation Posts looking down at apparently deserted German lines, registering targets and calling down fire from batteries massed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the Ypres Salient. It was dangerous work and he made vivid accounts of narrow misses and deadly artillery duels. After the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917, he was appointed as an official war artist for both the Canadian and British governments, beginning work in December 1917.|$|E
25|$|About 6,000 Confederate {{men were}} {{stationed}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the harbor, {{ready to take}} on the 60 men in Fort Sumter. At 4:30a.m. on April 12, after two days of fruitless negotiations, and with Union ships just outside the harbor, the Confederates opened fire on orders from President Jefferson Davis. Edmund Ruffin had the honor firing the first shot. Thirty-four hours later, Anderson's men raised the white flag and were allowed to leave the fort with colors flying and drums beating, saluting the U.S. flag with a 50-gun salute before taking it down. During this salute, one of the guns exploded, killing a young soldier—the only casualty of the bombardment and the first casualty of the war. In a mass frenzy, North and South men rushed to enlist, as Lincoln called up troops to recapture the fort.|$|E

This gives a large number of variations, which, when played consecutively, gives a total expected runtime of 1000 years, that is 10 centuries. It uses Tibetan singing bowls and gongs, which are able to create a range of sounds by either striking or rolling pieces of wood <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims.</b> This source music was recorded in December 1999.
