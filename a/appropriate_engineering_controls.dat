The primary pulmonary illness attributable to silica exposure is silicosis, which is observed in three forms: classic, accelerated and acute. A case of silicosis {{is presented in}} this article who has been working in a stone-cutting plant. He had suffered from symptoms of silicosis one year after employment in this plant (acute form), but his radiologic findings were compatible with accelerated or chronic silicosis. One of the important occupational diseases is silicosis, which is not treatable but is preventable.

40|$|Advancement of the {{nanotechnology}} {{industry in}} Australia has seen numerous researchers beginning to handle nanomaterials, {{as well as}} the establishment of industrial facilities that are producing nanomaterials for incorporation into consumer products. Traditionally, the risk assessment of chemicals relies heavily on their composition, whereas the key determinants in the adverse effects caused by nanomaterials are their physical parameters (such as size, surface area and surface chemistry). The unique properties of nanomaterials (which make them attractive materials for use in various products) may result in distinctive toxicological properties not seen in their bulk states. Workers handling nanomaterials may be exposed to them via inhalation, dermal exposure and ingestion - although workplace levels have not been adequately characterised. At the present time, workplace exposure stand ards are not available, and appropriate methods that accurately characterise nanomaterial exposure have not been established. Due to the poorly characterised toxicity of nanomaterials, measures taken to reduce the exposure of workers should apply the "as low as reasonably practicable" approach through risk management programs that broadly encompass all of the hierarchy of controls used for ultrafine particulates (including <b>appropriate</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>controls,</b> administrative controls and personal protective equipment...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} human disease prevalences are {{supported}} by host-parasite-environment interactions. One such disease is schistosomiasis. Schistosoma parasites are transmitted between the snail intermediate hosts and mammalian definitive hosts in an aquatic environment. This host-environment link determines the parasite transmission dynamics and is a route through which control of transmission can be achieved. Transmission control methods based on manipulating the host-environment link were reviewed, the limitations of each method were highlighted and conditions in which they {{may be used in}} small-scale control programmes in sub-Saharan Africa were suggested. Chemical control may be ideal in poor rural communities, where health education strategies have little impact and where fishing is not an important livelihood strategy, because human contact with contaminated water is necessary for parasite survival. In aquaculture and other water development project areas, biocontrol may yield positive results due to reduced predation on snail predators and competitors as a result of restricted access.

A total of 3324 chest radiographs (1985 - 7) of long term United States seamen were reviewed. One third (34. 8 %) had parenchymal or pleural abnormalities, or both (ILO classification); pleural changes were predominant.

40|$|Saufley Field Landfill {{is located}} in the Bellview {{community}} of Escambia County in Florida and was issued a permit for operation in 1990 as a construction and demolition landfill (C&D) by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). [1] The original five acre landfill has operated continuously since 1990 and has grown to its present size of 23 acres due to large volumes of construction and demolition debris generated by the 2004 and 2005 Panhandle area hurricanes, including Ivan, Dennis, and Katrina. As a result, the landfill accepted enormous amounts of waste that included large quantities of drywall/sheetrock.

40|$|An {{ergonomic}} {{assessment was}} recently performed at a frozen foods manufacturing facility {{located in the}} southeastern United States. Complaints from employees at the facility ranged from disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome to other ailments of components of the upper extremities (e. g., fingers, wrist, arm, elbow, etc.). Nearly all of the complaints originated from employees in three key areas of the plant. The temperatures ranged from 65 degrees F to below 32 degrees F in those areas, with the manufacturing processes being very labor-intensive. The most effective solution for reducing complex multiple risk factors is by carefully analyzing what is currently being done and then developing the best solution to ultimately benefit both the worker and the employer. The method used to achieve this solution included: 1) an initial walkthrough of the facility and interview of the safety staff, 2) research of the literature done on comparable ergonomic studies, 3) interviews with affected employees, 4) the development and completion of qualitative ergonomic worksheets, 5) the videotaping of appropriate jobs, 6) the measurement of temperature and humidity conditions, and finally 7) the evaluation of personal protective clothing. In summary, {{it was concluded that}} the premature development of occupational disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome were manifesting due to the synergistic effects associated with cold-stressed, repetitive production environments.

40|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the supply chain management definition of resilience. To aid in evaluating the dynamic behaviour of such systems we need to establish clearly elucidated performance criteria that encapsulate the attributes of resilience. A literature review establishes the latter as readiness, responsiveness and recovery. We also identify robustness as a necessary condition that would complement resilience. We find that the Integral of the Time Absolute Error (ITAE) is an <b>appropriate</b> <b>control</b> <b>engineering</b> measure of resilience when it is applied to inventory levels and shipment rates. We use the ITAE to evaluate an often used benchmark model of make-to-stock supply chains consisting of three decision parameters. We use both linear and nonlinear forms of the model in our evaluation. Our findings suggest that optimum solutions for resilience do not yield {{a system that is}} robust to uncertainties in lead-time. Hence supply chains will experience drastic changes in their resilience performance when lead-time changes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

This investigation resulted {{in the development of}} a software development kit, the WSLogA Framework, which is inspired by the vision of Cruz et al. (2003, 2004). The WSLogA Framework provides distributed Enterprise systems with a platform for comprehensive information capture and environment management. Five component groups are intended for employment to enable integrated workflows addressing monitoring and response activities, but these components may also be used individually to facilitate the phased integration of the WSLogA Framework into existing environments. The WSLogA Framework 2 ̆ 7 s design is portable across technology platforms (e. g., Java and. NET) and a variety of technologies may be substituted for the provided implementations to address unique system architectures. The WSLogA Framework supersedes existing logging and monitoring solutions in terms of both capability and intent. Applications based on the WSLogA Framework have an internal, real-time view of their operation and may adjust their environment based on the information provided by events related to their or system activities. The WSLogA Framework is intended as a software development kit around which system functionality may be organized and implemented, which makes the WSLogA Framework an architectural peer or complement to traditional application frameworks such as Spring 2 ̆ 7 s Web module.

40|$|Control banding (CB) {{strategies}} offer simplified {{solutions for}} controlling worker exposures to constituents {{that are found}} in the workplace in the absence of firm toxicological and exposure data. These strategies may be particularly useful in nanotechnology applications, considering the overwhelming level of uncertainty over what nanomaterials and nanotechnologies present as potential work-related health risks, what about these materials might lead to adverse toxi-cological activity, how risk related to these might be assessed and how to manage these issues in the absence of this information. This study introduces a pilot CB tool or ‘CB Nanotool ’ that was developed specifically for characterizing the health aspects of working with engineered nanoparticles and determining the level of risk and associated controls for five ongoing nanotechnology-related operations being conducted at two Department of Energy research lab-oratories. Based on the application of the CB Nanotool, four of the five operations evaluated in this study were found to have implemented controls consistent with what was recommended by the CB Nanotool, with one operation even exceeding the required controls for that activity. The one remaining operation was determined to require an upgrade in controls. By developing this dynamic CB Nanotool within the realm of the scientific information available, this application of CB appears to be a useful approach for assessing the risk of nanomaterial operations, providing recommendations for <b>appropriate</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> and facilitating the allocation of resources to the activities that most need them...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the data and a summary of {{findings}} regarding the potential human health hazards of 1, 3 -A {{review of the}} data and a summary of findings regarding the potential human health hazards of 1, 3 -butadiene (106990) were presented. Background data included physical properties, chemical properties, production, use, and potential for occupational exposure. Data compiled from the NIOSH National Occupational Hazard Survey indicated that about 65, 000 workers were potentially exposed to 1, 3 -butadiene; of these, almost 45, 000 were in the chemical and allied products industry. The OSHA 8 hour time weighted average concentration was 1, 000 parts per million (ppm). The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists had indicated that it intended to change the threshold limit value for 1, 3 -butadiene based on carcinogenic potential. Experimental studies had indicated that 1, 3 -butadiene induced a carcinogenic response in rats and mice at multiple sites. Rats exposed at 1, 000 to 8, 000 ppm developed mammary, uterine, Leydig cell, thyroid follicular cell, pancreatic exocrine and Zymbal gland tumors, while mice exposed to 625 or 1, 250 ppm showed an increased incidence of malignant lymphomas, hemangiosarcomas, and other tumors. Testicular and ovarian atrophy was also seen in mice. Exposure of pregnant rats to 1, 3 -butadiene at 8, 000 ppm produced major skeletal defects in offspring; exposure to 200 to 8, 000 ppm produced fetal toxicity. Results of epidemiological studies {{indicated that there was}} a nonstatistically significant excess mortality for lymphatic and hematopoietic neoplasms, and leukemia.

40|$|Novel {{applications}} of gamma ray spectroscopy for D&D process development, inventory reduction, safety analysis and facility management {{are discussed in}} this paper. These {{applications of}} gamma spectroscopy were developed and implemented during the Risk Reduction Program (RPP) to successfully downgrade the Heavy Element Facility (B 251) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) from a Category II Nuclear Facility to a Radiological Facility. Non-destructive assay in general, gamma spectroscopy in particular, {{were found to be}} important tools in project management, work planning, and work control (''Expect the unexpected and confirm the expected''), minimizing worker dose, and resulted in significant safety improvements and operational efficiencies. Inventory reduction activities utilized gamma spectroscopy to identify and confirm isotopics of legacy inventory, ingrowth of daughter products and the presence of process impurities; quantify inventory; prioritize work activities for project management; and to supply information to satisfy shipper/receiver documentation requirements. D&D activities utilize in-situ gamma spectroscopy to identify and confirm isotopics of legacy contamination; quantify contamination levels and monitor the progress of decontamination efforts; and determine the point of diminishing returns in decontaminating enclosures and glove boxes containing high specific activity isotopes such as {sup 244 }Cm and {sup 238 }Pu. In-situ gamma spectroscopy provided quantitative comparisons of several decontamination techniques (e. g. TLC-free Stripcoat{trademark}, Radiac{trademark} wash, acid wash, scrubbing) and was used as a part of an iterative process to determine the appropriate level of decontamination and optimal cost to benefit ratio. Facility management followed a formal, rigorous process utilizing an independent, state certified, peer-reviewed gamma spectroscopy program, in conjunction with other characterization techniques, process knowledge, and historical records, to provide information for work planning, work prioritization, work control, and safety analyses (e. g. development of hold points, stop work points); and resulted in B 251 successfully achieving Radiological status on schedule.

40|$|Globally, {{silicosis}} {{is responsible}} for thousands of deaths each year and is a major public health concern in industries like mining. Silicosis is caused by exposure to respirable crystalline silica, and while incidence of silicosis has declined in recent decades, its continued occurrence in young workers indicates that high crystalline silica exposures in the contemporary workforce persist despite monitoring efforts and regulatory enforcement. Crystalline silica exposure is monitored in the mining industry via collection of respirable dust samples, from which both dust and crystalline silica concentrations are determined. Accurate quantification of crystalline silica is vital to assessing workers’ exposure, and to limiting exposure through selection of <b>appropriate</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> and personal protective equipment. To quantify crystalline silica in a sample, one of two analytic methods is used: X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. Previously, confounding effects of mineral composition and size distribution of dust were assumed to have only minor impact on the accuracy of both methods; however, as mining technologies evolve, so do {{the characteristics of the}} dust generated in mines, and such effects may no longer be negligible. Evaluating the characteristics of mine dust with respect to particle size and crystalline silica content is imperative to understanding how crystalline silica analysis may be affected by these characteristics. To date, few studies have investigated particle size-related crystalline silica content in occupational dusts, and while some efforts have been made to characterize coal mine dusts, there has been no such effort to characterize metal/non-metal mine dusts. This study undertakes detailed characterization of dusts from three gold mine operations, via analysis of size distribution using particle sizers and a cascade impactor; crystalline silica content by infrared and X-ray diffraction methods; and single-particle composition via scanning electron microscopy. Results indicate that the size distribution of crystalline silica within a particular dust is not equivalent to the dust’s size distribution; the abundance of crystalline silica in a dust varies with particle size; the two methods of quantifying crystalline silica yield variable results depending on particle size; and, like crystalline silica, particle types of different elemental composition vary in abundance with respect to particle size. ...|$|E
