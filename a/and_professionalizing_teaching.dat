40|$|The STEM Teacher Corps is a bold {{initiative}} to advance STEM {{teaching and learning}} across the United States by recognizing the nation's top K- 12 STEM teachers. In order {{to attract and retain}} the best STEM teachers, we must significantly reward excellence in STEM teaching, elevate the status of the profession, and create paths within the profession to which all STEM teachers can aspire. We also have an opportunity to create a cadre of the nation's most accomplished teachers who will broadly advance education and education policy. The need for such a Corps was outlined in a September 2010 report to President Obama from his Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). The President announced his Administration's plans to launch a Teacher Corps in July 2012. A national STEM Teacher Corps would recognize a larger percentage of teachers than any existing recognition program, create an interactive professional community of teachers empowered to make broad improvements to STEM education, and provide significant stipends to reward teachers and their schools. It would also provide a growth trajectory for teachers to develop within the profession and avenues for them to engage in improving STEM teaching and learning beyond their classrooms. The Corps is a coherent cadre of teachers with national visibility, and with linked national, regional, state, and local networks of teachers who help improve each other's practice <b>and</b> <b>professionalize</b> STEM <b>teaching...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to a demand by government authorities to significantly improve educational practices in the UAE, and to simultaneously Emiratize <b>and</b> <b>professionalize</b> the <b>teaching</b> profession (Mograby, 1999; UAE Ministry of Education and Youth, 2000; Clarke & Otaky, 2006), Vision 2030 was developed. This plan was created to reform education in the UAE by encouraging effective teaching methods. Within this recognition {{of the need for}} reform in UAE schools and classrooms, one issue of concern to educators and teacher educators is the need to develop a culture of reading for pleasure. However, the fostering of a reading culture among Arab students as a pleasurable activity is a challenge in both the UAE and the Arab world. This obstacle exists partly because of the belief that Arabs share an oral rather than a written culture (Shannon 2003). Within this situation, those entering the education profession in the UAE often face considerable obstacles in the government’s primary school system, particularly in the teaching of English reading. Despite the enormous wealth of the UAE, many public schools are ill-equipped, lacking basic facilities such as proper libraries. Furthermore, public libraries are not common. For example, the city of Abu Dhabi, with a population of more than 1, 000, 000 people, currently has only one library. A consequence of this situation is that many Emirati parents are unable to fully support their children’s learning. Moreover, schools are commonly staffed with poorly trained and poorly paid Egyptian, Lebanese, Syrian, and Tunisian teachers, who operate within a traditional behaviorist model of transmission based on rote memorization. Ironically, these same teachers supervise Emirati student teachers who have attended extremely well-funded colleges and universities, and have been exposed to radically different Western ideas of the processes of teaching and learning reading. Within the context outlined above, this research provides insights into the teaching of reading in UAE primary government schools. This study specifically demonstrates, through innovative examples, how Emirati student teachers aspire {{to make a difference in}} increasing the quality of the teaching of reading to young learners.

Despite the intentions of founding legislators aiming to prepare teachers for the common schools; despite criticisms that the curriculum was too limited, or, conversely, too taxing; despite claims that “normalites” lacked “scholarship,” even “knowledge and interest in human life”[i], countless graduates left with a passion to do good, do it well and do it with a sense of adventure. Their journals that they had read widely, thought critically, and accepted social responsibility in critical times. Using primary sources[ii], we will trace the ways in which gender, purpose and politics informed normalites and sent them geographically and philosophically beyond the expectations set for them. In particular, we will share stories of graduates who went South to the sea islands during the Civil War with radical reconstruction in mind to provide freed people with tools for independence, self-reliance and citizenship.
