Good passers can pass {{the ball with}} great accuracy <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball.

500|$|In January 2015, {{following}} {{the closure of}} the 12 Bar Club and clearance of Enterprise Studios on Denmark Place, a group of musicians and supporters squatted in the club's premises and staged a demonstration in the street, protesting against redevelopment. Former Oasis manager and head of Creation Records, Alan McGee supported the protestors, saying [...] "you really couldn’t say a bad word against any of them. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> the law, so they can't just be thrown out of there." [...] However, a report in The Independent judged the protest to be misguided, as most shops along the street were still trading.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Sam Foote, {{who retired}} after 24 {{years of service}} with the Phoenix VA system, went public with {{allegations}} against the VHA in comments to CNN in April 2014.

Foote said, [...] "The scheme was deliberately put in place to avoid the VA's own internal rules". He said that workers at the Phoenix VA were intimidated into complying with the deception. [...] "They have families, they have mortgages and if they speak out or say anything to anybody about it, they will be fired <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> that." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by popular reality television shows, most notably Survivor. The [...] "Can I trust Jim..." [...] line was a direct reference to the show and was a [...] "last-second addition" [...] according to Daniels. In addition, Randall Einhorn, the camera man for the episode, was a camera man for Survivor. When the episode was being written, many of {{the cast and crew}} feared that it would bear too many stylistic resemblances to Curb Your Enthusiasm. Daniels later defended the show, saying that the show was different because of [...] "the fact that they are on TV <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> they are being filmed. [...] on camera." [...] During the writing of the episode, Daniels made the writers spend actual time on the set, most notably in Michael's office. Mindy Kaling later noted that she [...] "hated it." ...|$|E

The band initially dismissed a number of songs, since the material wasn't [...] "taking us anyplace new.

According to Mascherino, the group [...] "didn’t spend as much time playing together in order to do exactly what we wanted to because some of us were new." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 24, 2015, Frusciante {{announced}} that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008-2013 on his own official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t read my press, but I heard about this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] Obviously I have a public audience. I am aware of them, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> who they are." [...] He continues, [...] "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, at this point, I have no particular audience in mind while I am making music." ...|$|E
500|$|The acting of {{the main}} cast was conflictingly received. Lloyd Miller of the St. Petersburg Times said the {{characters}} [...] "return to their original roles with a vigor and wit unseen in earlier episodes of the film series". Rob Salem of The Toronto Star quipped that though the actors looked silly on occasion, this was a benefit; [...] "as their capacity for action has diminished, their comedic talents have blossomed [...] they have all become masters of self-deprecating self-parody." [...] The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert called the actors' performances [...] "photocopies" [...] of previous films: [...] "Shatner and Nimoy are respectable, but lack energy. There's {{nowhere else to go}} with their roles, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> it. DeForest Kelley is oddly out of it." [...] Plummer and Warner's portrayals of their Klingon characters were well-received; Maslin commented that [...] "whenever a skilled actor [...] manages to emerge from behind all this [...] with his personality intact, it's a notable accomplishment." [...] The other supporting characters received similar praise; H.J. Kirchhoff, writing for The Globe and Mail, said that the guest stars joined the [...] "family fun" [...] of the film as [...] "zesty, exotic and colorful good guys and bad guys". A Cinefantastique retrospective review considered the film to have the finest guest stars ever assembled for a Star Trek film.|$|E

500|$|In 1995 Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly rated Never Say Never Again as {{the ninth}} best Bond film to that point, after 17 films had been released. Sauter thought the film [...] "is {{successful}} {{only as a}} portrait of an over-the-hill superhero." [...] He did admit, however, that [...] "even past his prime, Connery proves that nobody does it better". James Berardinelli, in his review of [...] Never Say Never Again, thinks the re-writing of the Thunderball story {{has led to a}} film which has [...] "a hokey, jokey feel, [...] is possibly the worst-written Bond script of all". Berardinelli concludes that [...] "it's a major disappointment that, having lured back the original 007, the film makers couldn't offer him something better than this drawn-out, hackneyed story." [...] Critic Danny Peary wrote that [...] "it was great to see Sean Connery return as James Bond after a dozen years". He also thought the supporting cast was good, saying that Klaus Maria Brandauer's Largo was [...] "neurotic, vulnerable... one of the most complex of Bond's foes" [...] and that Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger [...] "make lasting impressions." [...] Peary also wrote that the [...] "film is exotic, well acted, and stylishly directed... It {{would be one of the}} best Bond films if the finale weren't disappointing. When will filmmakers realize that underwater fight scenes don't work because viewers usually can't tell the hero and villain apart <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> doubles are being used?" ...|$|E
