5|$|Chambers and {{his second}} in command, Captain Charles Spragg, {{immediately}} set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully {{and out of sight}} to the defenders, so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, <b>and</b> <b>crept</b> up {{to the edge of the}} New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.|$|E
25|$|On 20 July 656, {{finding the}} gate of Uthman's house {{strongly}} guarded by his supporters, the Egyptian rebels climbed the back wall <b>and</b> <b>crept</b> inside, leaving the guards on the gate unaware {{of what was going}} on inside. The rebels entered his room and struck blows at his head. Naila, the wife of Uthman, threw herself on his body to protect him and raised her hand to deflect a sword. She had her fingers chopped off and was pushed aside. The next blow killed Uthman. Some of Uthman's slaves counter-attacked, one of whom killed the assassin and was in turn killed by the rebels.|$|E
500|$|During the Battle of Tulkarm the 60th Division, (XXI Corps) {{advanced}} {{to cut the}} front line Ottoman trenches. They were supported as they moved forward by artillery fire, which lifted <b>and</b> <b>crept</b> forward while the infantry {{advanced to}} capture the Nahr el Faliq. Their advance forced the Ottoman Eighth Army to withdraw, and the continuing attack resulted in the capture of Tulkarm, and the [...] Eighth Army headquarters. The tactic of the infantry attack covered by creeping artillery fire, was so successful that the front line was quickly cut and the way cleared for the British Empire cavalry divisions of Desert Mounted Corps to advance northwards up the Plain of Sharon. The cavalry aimed to capture the Ottoman lines of communication {{in the rear of}} the two German and Ottoman armies being attacked in the Judean Hills. By 20 September these cavalry divisions reached the rear, completely outflanked and almost encircled the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies during the Battle of Nazareth, Capture of Afulah and Beisan, Capture of Jenin and Battle of Samakh. Meanwhile, British Empire infantry divisions on the right of the 60th Division advanced to successfully attack the German and Ottoman trench lines along their front line at the Battles of Tabsor and Arara. The Ottoman Seventh Army headquarters at Nablus was subsequently attacked and captured during the Battle of Nablus.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{negative}} publicity, the band pressed on regardless {{with a set}} of live shows in the summer of that year, including T in the Park, Glastonbury and the V Festival. The focus during the latter part of 1997 moved to the US where both [...] "Tattva" [...] and [...] "Hey Dude" [...] received airplay exposure. [...] "Tattva" [...] became a minor No.10 hit in the Modern Rock Tracks chart and [...] "Hey Dude" [...] peaked at No.25. K itself peaked at No.11 in the Heatseekers chart <b>and</b> <b>crept</b> to No.200 in the Billboard charts. An EP, Summer Sun, was released in the U.S. for the band's fans there. The six tracks on the EP were all B-sides to earlier UK singles.|$|E
2500|$|From 28 August to 17 September, {{the fire}} {{continued}} to creep and smolder inside the fire line. [...] As of 29 August, 465 firefighters continued to support mop up operations. [...] This included both Forest Service and Oregon Department of Forestry units. [...] Crews worked on repairing fences, culverts, and other infrastructure damaged by fire suppression activities. [...] Ground crews also burned out interior areas with heavy brush that were within [...] of the perimeter lines. [...] These operations continued {{for several more}} weeks as the fire smoldered <b>and</b> <b>crept</b> through unburned islands inside the fire line. [...] By 7 September, there were only 33 firefighters left on scene. [...] The final fire report for the Barry Point Fire was issued on 17 September, highlighting the fact the last crew had left the fire scene.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was soon}} {{discovered}} that the Germans had put barbed wire [...] {{in front of the}} front line, rather than just in front and special bombardments were fired to cut the wire, after which patrols went forward to check the results, despite German counter-bombardments. On the 43rd Division front, it was discovered that field artillery was only shifting the barbed wire around and not damaging [...] but modern [...] were used in time to create several gaps in the wire. Visibility early on 16 June was poor and the French heavy artillery began with a slow bombardment until [...] when a creeping barrage began to move from the French front line in [...] bounds and a second barrage began at maximum range <b>and</b> <b>crept</b> backwards in [...] bounds, until both barrages coincided on Vimy Ridge and became a standing barrage until the French infantry arrived. The IX Corps divisions found that the German defences were intact, when the attack began and the 17th Division was swept by artillery and machine-gun fire, forcing it back to its jumping-off trenches; the 18th Division managed to capture the German first position and a second attack was ordered for the afternoon.|$|E

2500|$|Alas, {{with what}} sadness his friends {{came to know}} {{that while he was}} doing so much to warn and restore others from the effects of this fearful habit, he himself was still under its bondage. Again and again he seemed to have broken it. Only those most {{intimate}} with him knew how he suffered at such periods... I recall a night he passed with me some months after the publication of [...] He was in an excited state, and we took a long walk together, during which he spoke freely of his varied trials, and he finally went to my house to sleep. I went directly to bed, but he was a long time making his preparations, and I at length suspected he was indulging his old craving. For the first and only time in my life I spoke harshly to him, and characterized his abuse of himself and of the confidence of his friends as shameful. He replied depreciatingly, and turning down the gas-light came around <b>and</b> <b>crept</b> into bed beside me. We both lay a moment in silence, and feeling reproved for my harshness, I said: “Think, Fitz, of your warnings on the subject, and of your effort, in behalf of other victims.” In a tone and with a pathos I can never forget, he answered — “He saved others, himself he could not save.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Tunisia {{players and}} {{supporters}} {{claim that the}} Paraguayan referee Carlos Amarilla failed to award Tunisia a penalty kick {{in the second half}} and then mistakenly awarded one to Ukraine, which when converted by Andriy Shevchenko resulted in the 1–0 win and qualification by Ukraine to the second round. [...] At the time Tunisia was playing with 10 men since Ziad Jaziri was sent off for his second yellow card in the last minute of the first half. The German magazine Spiegel Online described the turn of events this way: [...] "Tunisia went close on 65 minutes after Namouchi was hacked {{down on the edge of}} the box. Ayari's left footed free kick deflected off Voronin in the Ukrainian wall <b>and</b> <b>crept</b> just over the bar. Replays suggested the ball hit Voronin's elbow and Tunisia could feel aggrieved not to have been awarded a penalty. Then almost immediately the action switched to the other end when Shevchenko stumbled into the penalty area only to be brought down by Haggui. This time replays suggested Shevchenko fell over his own feet but Amarilla pointed to the spot and Shevchenko made no mistake with the penalty kick. It was tough luck for the Tunisians with two dodgy decisions costing the team badly and with only ten men left on the field the game looked beyond them." ...|$|E
