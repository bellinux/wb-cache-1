5|$|Bronze {{and iron}} casting were {{introduced}} to Japan from the mainland in the Yayoi period, initially bringing to Japan from Korea and China iron knives and axes, and later bronze swords, spears <b>and</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Eventually all {{of these and other}} metal objects were produced locally.|$|E
5|$|The flight deck, {{unlike those}} on Royal Navy carriers, was {{superimposed}} on the ship's hull rather than constructed as a strength deck supporting the carrier's hull structure. A system of lights <b>and</b> <b>mirrors</b> along {{the flight deck}} assisted pilots in landing on the carrier.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner <b>and</b> <b>mirrors</b> were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E
5|$|The Great Raid of 1840 was {{the largest}} Indian raid on white cities {{in the history of}} what is now the United States—though {{technically}} when it occurred it was in the Republic of Texas and not in the United States. The war party literally burned one city to the ground. They took over 3,000 horses and mules, {{and hundreds of thousands of}} dollars of other plunder, ranging from silver to cloth <b>and</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Unfortunately for the war party, the sheer volume of loot slowed them down, and made them vulnerable to attack from a militia that otherwise would never have caught them. Equally, the militia missed an opportunity to destroy the bulk of the raiding party when they concentrated on recovering and dividing the recovered bullion and other plunder.|$|E
5|$|A long-distance {{communication}} system that used smoke <b>and</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{existed in the}} region, and direct lines of sight have been established between Pueblo Alto, Huérfano Mountain in northern New Mexico, and Chimney Rock Pueblo in southern Colorado. Messages could have been relayed between these three points within minutes. On the mesa behind Chaco Canyon is an ancient road that runs north from Chetro Ketl, then northward along {{the east side of}} Pueblo Alto before joining with the Great North Road. The Pueblo Alto road network functioned between 1050 and 1140. It facilitated access to watering holes, terraced farming areas, and enabled interaction between Pueblo Alto and great houses like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. It also led to a community along Escavada Wash. It may have served an important function in the transport of household goods, construction timber, and people throughout the San Juan Basin. Several road segments appear to be related to a row of Chetro Ketl's exterior rooms, which are thought to have been community storage space.|$|E
50|$|Mirror matter {{could have}} been diluted to unobservably low densities during the {{inflation}} epoch. Sheldon Glashow has shown that if at some high energy scale particles exist which interact strongly with both ordinary <b>and</b> <b>mirror</b> particles, radiative corrections {{will lead to a}} mixing between photons <b>and</b> <b>mirror</b> photons. This mixing has the effect of giving mirror electric charges a very small ordinary electric charge. Another effect of photon-mirror photon mixing is that it induces oscillations between positronium <b>and</b> <b>mirror</b> positronium. Positronium could then turn into <b>mirror</b> positronium <b>and</b> then decay into mirror photons.|$|R

5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply drive through the gap in the fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers and mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits <b>and</b> <b>mirrors</b> allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants really were dead. Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their travel plans and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|E

25|$|After the Great Harem Fire of 1666, {{the hall}} was renovated in the rococo style {{during the reign of}} Sultan Osman III.

25|$|This is not {{the first}} time that the theme of a {{relationship}} between Beowulf and Grendel's mother was explored. In Gaiman's 1998 collection of short stories, Smoke <b>and</b> <b>Mirrors,</b> the poem Bay Wolf is a retelling of Beowulf in a modern-day setting. In this story, Beowulf as the narrator is ambiguous about what happened between Grendel's mother and himself.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} part of the channel's presentation since launch has been {{the top of the hour}} countdown sequence, since there is no presentation system with continuity announcers so the countdown provides a link to the beginning of the next hour.

25|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{interior}} uncluttered, a number of convenience functions were integrated into multifunction controls.

The displacement of these gauges {{to the middle of the}} dash was intended to offer an unimpeded view of the hood and the road ahead.|$|E
