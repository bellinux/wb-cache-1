If all of the pigs are {{eliminated}} after the last bird is launched, the level is completed and the next level is unlocked. If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not killed, the level is incomplete and must be repeated. Points are scored for each pig killed {{as well as for}} damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds. Upon completing each level, players receive one, two, or three stars depending on the score received.

In June 1985, the new Videopolis Station, consisting of a covered platform with no station building, was built in the Fantasyland section for the DRR. That same year, the DRR's track on the northern edge of its route was expanded outwards in order {{to make room for the}} new Videopolis stage.

5|$|Mathematical {{notation}} was decimal, {{and based}} on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively. Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth. Standard tables of values facilitated this. Some common fractions, however, were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.|$|E

5|$|For the season, Killebrew set career highs in RBIs, runs, {{walks and}} on-base percentage, tied his career high with 49 home runs, and even {{registered}} eight of his 19 career stolen bases, {{en route to}} winning his only Most Valuable Player Award. He led the AL in home runs, RBIs, on-base percentage, walks, and intentional walks and knocked in the winning run 20 times while playing in all 162 games. As of 2011, Killebrew's home run, RBI, and walk totals from 1969 remain team records, and his 145 walks are tied for the 20th highest single season total in MLB history and 7th highest for a right-handed batter. In the 1969 American League Championship Series, the Baltimore Orioles used their pitching staff, {{the best in the}} league, to defeat Minnesota and win the series three games to none. Baltimore avoided Killebrew by walking him six times in the three games to avoid pitching to him, which was <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> they walked the rest of the Twins team.|$|E
5|$|Players {{control a}} monocle- and pith helmet–wearing Velociraptor driving a jeep. The {{aim of the}} game is to attain a high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging the jeep during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which run around the area. The vehicle is equipped with a spiked ball and chain which can be deployed from the tailgate <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> the player wishes. Deploying the spiked ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle. The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming them with the jeep or crushing them with the spiked ball which is dragged behind the vehicle. Slain dinosaurs can be dragged to exporters by the spiked ball and chain to gain extra points. Exporters are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink ribbons and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of ink ribbons, so players cannot save their progress <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> they want. The story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending.

5|$|Kanye West {{began working}} on Graduation {{immediately}} after releasing his second studio album Late Registration. By late September 2005, West had already completed three songs for the album, which he intended to contain a total of twelve tracks. Around {{the time of the}} recording of the third studio album, West would often listen to songs written by folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his word play and storytelling abilities. The former musician had been recommended to West by multiple of his friends, including English disc jockey Samantha Ronson, all of whom claimed his music and the way he dealt with the press reminded them of Dylan. Kanye also listened to his most favorite alternative rock bands, including The Killers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and Keane, in order to gain new ideas on how to make his hip-hop production style more stadium-friendly. Additionally, West would often test his new songs on his iPod, in his office, in dance clubs and just about anywhere people might listen to his music. He would then make adjustments to the tracks based on feedback he received, repeating the process <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> necessary.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{techniques}} to compute the wave propagation and power diffusion in a network. We propose {{a new approach to}} obtain the expression of the wave on any port of the network made of junctions. If this approach can appear a little heavy compared to the classical ones that use S parameters, it gives a powerful method to resolve the computation whatever is the complexity of the network. Based on a definition of the topology of the network with junctions and ports, we create a S matrix for the whole network and a propagation matrix G which manage the exchange of waves between the ports. Each time a product with G is applied, the waves are transmitted between the junctions through their input output ports. Once on a input port of a junction, the application of a product with the S matrix implies the transmission of the wave from this input port to an output port of the same junction. The product GS is applied <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> it is necessary to reproduce the wave propagation in the whole network...|$|R

This paper proposed the MAC protocol for SANETs, EASO-TDMA, which overcomes {{the weaknesses of}} the previous approach, ASO-TDMA, and thus enhances the performance of SANETs. The virtue of EASO-TDMA is that it eases the bottleneck problem that occurs at a specific ship by managing the network traffic in a decentralized way. Namely, each ship periodically checks the number of subscribing ships by referring to the routing table and then allocates <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>time</b> slots <b>as</b> necessary to manage the traffic from its subscribing ships.|$|R

The case of perishable commodities, where inventorying may be practicable for only one or several time periods, is handled within the model by appropriately defined feasibility conditions. Alternative variational inequality formulations are given and then exploited (akin to the work for static spatial price equilibrium problems) to construct Gauss—Seidel schemes.

It consists {{of the search for}} the comparison, training and vigilance parameters giving the minimum quadratic distances between the output of the training base and those obtained by the network. The same process is applied for the determination of the parameters of the fuzzy ARTMAP giving the most powerful network. The modification consist in making learn the fuzzy ARTMAP a base of examples not only once as it is of use, but <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> its architecture is in evolution or than the objective error is not reached. In this way, we don’t worry about the values to impose on the eight (08) parameters of the network. To evaluate each one of these three networks modified, a comparison of their performances is carried out. As application we carried out a classification of the image of Algiers’s bay taken by SPOT XS. We use as criterion of evaluation the training duration, the mean square error (MSE) in step control and the rate of good classification per class. The results of this study presented as curves, tables and images show that modified fuzzy ARTMAP presents the best compromise quality/computing time.
