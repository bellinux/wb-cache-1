5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E

In contrast to Porsche—his former employer—Bez announced that Aston Martin would not extract a premium for the track model; stripped for competition, the limited-production N24 would cost <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as a regular V8 Vantage. The N24 specification complies with FIA GT4 European Cup, German VLN series, Grand-Am Cup, and various other national series' requirements.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate {{derived from}} cocoa beans {{contains}} {{a small amount}} of caffeine. The weak stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine. A typical 28-gram serving of a milk chocolate bar has <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> caffeine as a cup of decaffeinated coffee. By weight, dark chocolate has one to two times the amount of caffeine as coffee: 80–160mg per 100g. Higher percentages of cocoa such as 90% amount to 200mg per 100g approximately and thus, a 100 gram 85% cocoa chocolate bar contains about 195mg caffeine.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps can run {{directly}} from a direct current (DC) supply of sufficient voltage to strike an arc. The ballast must be resistive, and would consume <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> power as the lamp. When operated from DC, the starting switch is often arranged to reverse the polarity of the supply to the lamp each time it is started; otherwise, the mercury accumulates {{at one end of}} the tube. Fluorescent lamps are (almost) never operated {{directly from}} DC for those reasons. Instead, an inverter converts the DC into AC and provides the current-limiting function as described below for electronic ballasts.|$|E

25|$|The {{capacity}} of an alkaline battery is strongly {{dependent on the}} load. An AA-sized alkaline battery might have an effective {{capacity of}} 3000mAh at low drain, but at a load of 1 ampere, which is common for digital cameras, the capacity could be as little as 700mAh. The voltage of the battery declines steadily during use, so the total usable capacity depends on the cut-off voltage of the application. Unlike Leclanche cells, the alkaline cell delivers <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> capacity on intermittent or continuous light loads. On a heavy load, capacity is reduced on continuous discharge compared with intermittent discharge, but the reduction is less than for Leclanche cells.|$|E
25|$|In December 2015, Israel and Jordan {{formally}} {{released the}} technical {{plans to move}} ahead with this project. A new desalination plant to be built near the Jordanian tourist resort of Aqaba would convert salt water from the Red Sea into fresh water for use in southern Israel and southern Jordan; each region would get eight billion to 13 billion gallons a year. This process would produces <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> brine as a waste product; the brine would be piped more than 100 miles to help replenish the Dead Sea, already known for its high salt content. This would reinforce {{the status of the}} Dead Sea as an important economic resource to both nations, in multiple areas including tourism, industry and business.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{success was}} short-lived. Following a lumbering {{recovery}} during 1933 to 1945, from 1946 to 1953 Argentina gained benefits from Perón's five-year plan. The GDP expanded by over a fourth during that brief boom, <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> {{as it had}} during the previous decade. Using roughly half the US$1.7billion in reserves inherited from wartime surpluses for nationalizations, economic development agencies devoted {{most of the other}} half to finance both public and private investments; the roughly 70% jump in domestic fixed investment was accounted for mostly by industrial growth in the private sector. All this much-needed activity exposed an intrinsic weakness in the plan: it subsidized growth which, in the short term, led to a wave of imports of the capital goods that local industry could not supply. Whereas the end of World War II had allowed Argentine exports to rise from US$700million to US$1.6billion, Perón's changes led to skyrocketing imports (from US$300million to US$1.6billion), and erased the surplus by 1948.|$|E

There {{are a lot}} factors that make electricity generation fewer than {{installed capacity}}, such as some equipment failing to work as planned, a lower capacity factor and equipment maintenance.|$|R
25|$|Just like data {{on water}} availability, {{publicly}} available data on water use in Greater Damascus are contradictory and outdated. In 2001 water use {{has been estimated}} at between 1,350 and 1,700 million cubic metres per year. This includes water use for irrigation that was estimated at between 920 and more than 1,200 million cubic metres per year, accounting for 68% and 76% of total water use in the basin. Domestic water use was estimated at between 300 and 390 million cubic metres per year. The lower bound of this estimate is probably more realistic and is equivalent {{to an average of}} about 220 liter/capita/day before distribution losses for a population connected to the network of about 3.75 million. Taking into account non-revenue water of about 50%, this corresponds to about 110 liter/capita/day which is <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as domestic water use in Germany. However, during summer water availability and thus water use drop significantly. For example, in the summer of 2001 the city received 317,000 cubic meter per day, corresponding to about 85 liter/capita/day before losses and 43 liter/capita/day after losses.|$|E

[...] Michael Azerrad praised the strength of the material while denigrating the [...] "frustrating lack of ensemble feel" [...] as the album was recorded without a full lineup. [...] Critic Clay Jarvis commended the album, emphasizing the risks taken on it and its influence, calling it [...] "more a test than an album", and saying, [...] "independent music is stronger because Black Flag formulated it". [...] John Dougan at AllMusic called the A-side of the album [...] "quite good", but described the B-side as [...] "self-indulgence masquerading as inspiration and <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> fun as wading through a tar pit".

Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun Times gave the record a three-and-a-half star review, calling it [...] "inconsistent", but admitting [...] "it's satisfying and surprising to hear a band of U2's status being so playful, experimental, and downright weird". Robert Christgau gave the album a B−, calling it [...] "half an Eno album" [...] in the same manner that David Bowie's Eno-produced albums Low and [...] "Heroes" [...] were, but saying, [...] "The difference is that Bowie and Eno were fresher in 1977 than Bono and Eno are today." [...] The Irish media was most consistently negative in their reviews of the album; George Byrne of the Irish Independent said, [...] "The songs sound like they were knocked up in double-quick time and with <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> thought put into the lyrics as goes into a DJ's timecheck". Byrne remarked that the record resembles [...] "a lot of mickey-taking over a variety of drum patterns". In a retrospective, four-star review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that [...] "most of the record is far more daring than its predecessor". For him, although there were moments that the album was [...] "unfocused and meandering ... the best moments of Zooropa rank among U2's most inspired and rewarding music".|$|E
