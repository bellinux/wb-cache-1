5|$|In August 2012, <b>a</b> <b>scarlet</b> ibis {{escaped from}} the zoo and went on the loose in the city after a {{squirrel}} had chewed {{a hole in the}} netting at the top of its cage.

The ibis was missing for nearly a week before being recaptured four miles from the zoo.|$|E

5|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} Longstreet family in January 1862. <b>A</b> <b>scarlet</b> fever {{epidemic}} in Richmond, Virginia claimed {{the lives of}} his one-year-old daughter Mary Anne, his four-year-old son James, and eleven-year-old Augustus ("Gus"), all within a week. His 13-year-old son Garland almost succumbed. The losses were devastating for Longstreet and he became withdrawn, both personally and socially. In 1861 his headquarters were noted for parties, drinking, and poker games. After he returned from the funeral the headquarters social life became for a time more somber. He rarely drank, and he became a devout Episcopalian.|$|E

25|$|To {{differentiate}} {{themselves from}} the infantry, musicians—at that time, buglers and signal callers—would reverse the traditional colors. Today members of the ten Marine Corps field bands wear the standard Blue Dress uniforms, while {{the members of the}} United States Marine Corps Band (The President's Own) and the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps (The Commandant's Own), both based in Washington, D.C., carry on this tradition by wearing the Red-Dress uniform (<b>a</b> <b>scarlet</b> blouse with blue trim).|$|E
25|$|Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron, took {{command of}} Jasta 11 in January 1917. His protege Karl Allmenröder scored {{the first of}} his 30 {{confirmed}} victories on 16 February 1917. Flying <b>a</b> <b>scarlet</b> Albatros D.III trimmed out with white nose and elevators, Allmenröder would score until 26 June 1917, the day before his death. On 27 June 1917, Karl Allmenröder fell to his death near Zillebeke, Belgium. His posthumous legacy of patriotic courage would later be utilised by the Nazi Party.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} uniform was grey with scarlet facings and the headgear was a shako, {{in which}} the 5th Northampton RVC wore a red tuft. The shako {{was replaced by a}} spiked helmet in 1879. When the Volunteers were affiliated to the Regular county regiments they were given the option of adopting the scarlet coat, but the 1st Northampton VB rejected this and retained the grey jacket. Only when the battalion became the 4th Northamptons did it adopt <b>a</b> <b>scarlet</b> uniform faced in white. The facings were changed to the buff of the old 48th Foot (1st Bn Northampton Regiment) in 1926.|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{variation}} on the standard RGB or Hex combination that produces <b>a</b> truer <b>Scarlet</b> color on some monitors. It is slightly more orange than the standard Scarlet RGB value of 255, 36, 0, but does give a truer color on displays where the red dominates over the orange and would otherwise make the color appear more as a normal red rather than <b>a</b> genuine <b>Scarlet.</b>|$|R

25|$|Jouett {{also helped}} General Edward Stevens escape. The general was {{recovering}} from wounds he received at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. From Swan Tavern, Jouett rode with General Stevens {{as he made his}} escape, but the wounded Stevens could not ride quickly enough to keep the British from catching up. Fortunately, Jouett had the eccentric habit of dressing in ornate military costume with <b>a</b> <b>scarlet</b> coat and a plumed hat and Stevens was dressed in shoddy clothing. British cavalry assumed that Jouett must be a high military officer, so they ignored the shabby general, and pursued Jouett, who successfully eluded them.|$|E
25|$|Guidons {{are also}} used in recruit {{training}} to identify individual platoons. First and second phase platoons have a gold background with their four-digit platoon number in scarlet, while third phase platoons have <b>a</b> <b>scarlet</b> background with gold lettering and trim. The guidon is used {{as an aid to}} instilling unit identity and pride, representing the platoon. Some drill instructors will test that pride by attempting to dishonor the guidon and expecting the recruits to intervene. Also, the recruit assigned to carry it, the guide, is treated as the most senior recruit of the platoon, and uses the guidon to marks the line of advance in close-quarters drill.|$|E
25|$|In 1297 king Denis of Portugal took {{personal}} interest {{in the development of}} exports, having organized the export of surplus production to European countries. On May 10, 1293 he instituted a maritime insurance fund for Portuguese traders living in the County of Flanders, which were to pay certain sums according to tonnage, accrued to them when necessary. Wine and dried fruits from Algarve were sold in Flanders and England, salt from Setúbal and Aveiro was a profitable export to northern Europe, and leather and kermes, <b>a</b> <b>scarlet</b> dye, were also exported. Portuguese imported armors and munitions, fine clothes and several manufactured products from Flanders and Italy.|$|E

25|$|Bishops {{wear the}} {{above-mentioned}} purple cassock with scarlet piping, {{and add a}} pectoral cross suspended from a green and gold cord, a mozzetta over the rochet, and a purple zucchetto under the biretta. A cardinal wears <b>a</b> <b>scarlet</b> cassock with scarlet trim, pectoral cross on a red and gold cord and a red mozzetta over the rochet, with a red zucchetto. The Pope's choir dress includes a white cassock, rochet, red silk mozetta, red brocade stole and his pectoral cross hangs from a golden cord. Some canons wear their cross on a ribbon, but only a bishop may wear the cross on a cord. Under new regulations, neither bishops nor canons wear fur trimmed cappas.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 1918, nine Siemens-Schuckert D.IIIs {{began to}} arrive. Despite high {{expectations}} for the craft because of its superior performance, it suffered engine failures at only seven to ten hours usage. The mark was rapidly withdrawn from the wing. Meanwhile, Berthold had his men begin repainting the wing's aircraft with a common background marking. The wing's craft had standard dark blue paint applied to the fuselage, a la Jasta 15. However, instead of also copying <b>a</b> <b>scarlet</b> nose from them, the other squadrons each sported their own hue on the cowlings. Jagdstaffel 12 had white cowlings; Jasta 13 had dark green ones; Jasta 19 settled on yellow. To these markings, pilots added their own personal insignia.|$|E
25|$|Measuring 19–21cm (8in) in length, {{this small}} vibrant and brightly {{coloured}} parrot is sexually dimorphic.

The tail is green, {{the eyes are}} brown and the bill is blackish, and legs are brown-grey. The female likewise has a blue face, although the coloration is less extensive, green upperparts and green breast, with yellow underparts. Immature birds are duller versions of their respective adult forms. Males begin to get red plumage on their chest from around {{two or three months}} of age, though do not complete their red chest until fifteen to eighteen months old.|$|E
