5|$|The PanzerI's design {{history can}} be traced to the British Carden Loyd tankette of which it {{borrowed}} much of its track and suspension design. After six prototype Kleintraktor were produced the cover name was changed to Krupp-Traktor whereas the development codename was changed to Landwirtschaftlicher Schlepper (LaS) (<b>Agricultural</b> <b>Tractor).</b> The LaS was intended not just to train Germany's panzer troops, but to prepare Germany's industry for the mass production of tanks in the near future; a difficult engineering feat for the time. The armament of production versions was to be two 7.92mm MG 13 machine guns in a rotating turret. Machine guns were known to be largely useless against even the lightest tank armour of the time, restricting the PanzerI to a training and anti-infantry role by design.|$|E

25|$|The Bajac <b>agricultural</b> <b>tractor</b> however proved not mobile enough — {{the initial}} {{experiment}} had only tested the wire-cutting ability — {{and had the}} severe disadvantage of having to approach the enemy lines driving backwards. Breton and Prétot then considered {{using some of the}} two hundred American four-wheel drive Jeffery tractors that had been commanded by the French Artillery. When this was refused, Commandant Boissin directed Breton to the Schneider company which was working on the caterpillar track system, under a production licence from the American Holt Manufacturing Company. Experiments with the Holt caterpillar tracks had started in May 1915 at the Schneider plant with a 75hp wheel-directed model and the 45hp integral caterpillar Baby Holt, showing the superiority of the latter. On 16 June, new experiments had followed in front of the President of the Republic, and again on 22 July 1915 in front of War Minister Alexandre Millerand, who decided on 7 August 1915 on the construction of 10 armoured and armed Breton-Prétot machines. For his machine, Breton was thus allowed to order ten Holt tractors, to use as a base for his wire-cutting machine,. Experiments again took place on 10 September for Commander Ferrus. This order was modified on 7 December 1915 into an order to re-use the caterpillars to produce the first Schneider CA1 tanks.|$|E
