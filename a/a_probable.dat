5|$|One of the {{aircraft}} Dundas flew in combat, Supermarine Spitfire number R6915, still exists and is preserved in the Imperial War Museum in London. In this aircraft, he claimed <b>a</b> <b>probable</b> kill over a Bf 110 on 7 October 1940.|$|E
5|$|A {{colder climate}} {{introduced}} cold-limited animal species which appeared at lower altitudes, and glaciers formed on the San Bernardino Mountains. <b>A</b> <b>probable</b> southward {{shift of the}} storm belts led to windier weather. According to data obtained from tufa in Lake Cahuilla, a wet period ended 9,000 years before present, and between 6,200 and 3,000-2,000 years before present extended droughts occurred.|$|E
5|$|An {{even greater}} Swedish force of 5000 {{soldiers}} (of which 3000 were cavalry) under Lars Kagg, Gustaf Horn and Harald Stake laid siege to Frederikshald in January 1660.

5|$|Garamond is {{the name}} of a {{character}} in the Wii game Super Paper Mario. He appears in the world of Flopside (the mirror-image of Flipside, where the game begins). He is a prolific and highly successful author, unlike his Flipside counterpart, Helvetica (<b>a</b> <b>probable</b> recognition of the relative suitability of the two fonts for use in book typesetting).|$|E
5|$|Numerous nectar-feeding {{insects are}} {{attracted}} to the flower spikes, which in turn attract honeyeaters, silvereyes and sunbirds, many of which consume both nectar and insects. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) forages among the flower spikes and is <b>a</b> <b>probable</b> pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) feeds on nectar. B.dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D.signata.|$|E

5|$|Sinoceratops {{is known}} from the Xingezhuang Formation of {{southern}} China. It is known from skull material. Alongside it, in the formation, lived Shantungosaurus, a very common hadrosaurid to {{which most of the}} material has been assigned, Zhuchengtyrannus, an Asian tyrannosaurid related to Tarbosaurus, Zhuchengceratops, an Asian leptoceratopsid, and Huaxiaosaurus, a possible older individual of Shantungosaurus. Other possible remains have been assigned to Zhuchengosaurus, <b>a</b> <b>probable</b> junior synonym of Shantungosaurus, and material tentatively assigned to Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The Blitz ended as the Luftwaffe {{moved its}} forces to support Operation Barbarossa and the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and air raids slackened. During the second half of 1941, small numbers of German aircraft made pinpoint attacks across Britain and German night fighters attempted intercept operations over England to disrupt RAF Bomber Commands bombing of Germany. On 23 June Braham claimed <b>a</b> <b>probable</b> against a He 111 which Royal Observer Corps personnel saw crash. But since he had lost contact with ground control (having wandered out of No. 29s area of operations) and fearing being lost or pursuing the He 111 too low into Barrage balloons, Braham ended the chase and claimed <b>a</b> <b>probable.</b> Records show only one claim was made that night by an RAF fighter other than Braham, and German records list two bombers failing to return.|$|E
5|$|The last carucage {{was imposed}} in 1224, after {{which most of}} the medieval government's revenue was raised by levying taxes on {{moveable}} or personal property, instead of on land; taxes on moveable property were first assessed in 1207. <b>A</b> <b>probable</b> reason for the abandonment of land taxes was the greater revenues raised by taxes on property and income.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War, Bedford sided with Parliament; the town was temporarily captured by Prince Rupert of the Rhine in 1643 and the castle was refortified {{for the duration of the}} war. <b>A</b> <b>probable</b> wooden fort and prison were built on the remains of the motte and defended by a hundred-man garrison. After the war the motte became used as a bowling green until the 19th century. In 1804 the north-east tower of the castle was turned into a hexagonal building for the local militia unit. Bedford began to spread eastwards in the late 19th century and the castle baileys became desirable property for housing; in 1851 the last parts of the barbican were destroyed to make way for the construction of cottages.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that the Normans conquered England in 1066, the town of Southampton {{occupied}} a rectangular area overlooking the mouth of the River Test, an important medieval waterway. It was protected by water on most sides and by protective ditches and banks to the north and east. Southampton at this time was a relatively large town, but not as significant as in the later medieval period. The Normans built a castle within the town on the site of <b>a</b> <b>probable</b> large English hall, and considerable damage was caused to the surrounding local buildings as space was opened up for the new fortification.|$|E

Despite firing a 12–14 second burst at the enemy fighter, {{he did not see}} it crash. During the battle Dundas was hit in the leg when a cannon round exploded in his cockpit, but flew again the next day. The Spitfire Dundas flew that day, R6915, still exists, having been preserved by the Imperial War Museum. By 9 October 1940, his score stood at 10 and he was award the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
5|$|HD 205739 is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F7V that is around 1.22times as massive and 2.3times as luminous as the Sun. It has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of 280days that {{was discovered by}} the radial velocity method. WASP-7 is a star of spectral type F5V with an apparent magnitude of 9.54, about 1.28times as massive as the Sun. Its hot Jupiter planet—WASP-7b—was discovered by transit method and found to orbit the star every 4.95days. HD 202628 is a sunlike star of spectral type G2V with a debris disk that ranges from 158 to 220 AU distant. Its inner edge is sharply defined, indicating <b>a</b> <b>probable</b> planet orbiting between 86 and 158AU from the star.|$|E
5|$|In 1874 Long {{chaired the}} state Republican convention, and finally won {{election}} to the state legislature. He formed {{a close relationship with}} Speaker John E. Sanford, and in what historian James Hess describes as <b>a</b> <b>probable</b> move of political calculation, supported the successful gubernatorial candidate in 1875, Alexander H. Rice, even though Rice supported liberal legislation on alcohol sales that Long opposed. He was able to parlay this support into his own {{election to the}} speakership in 1876. He widened his reform views to the national stage by supporting Benjamin Bristow in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination.|$|E

5|$|Large thin flat mineralized plates {{have been}} found next to the ribs' sides. Their {{function}} is unknown; they {{may have played a}} role in respiration. However, muscle scars or other indications of attachment have not been found for the plates, which argues against a respiratory function. Recent histological study of layered plates from <b>a</b> <b>probable</b> subadult indicates that they may have started as cartilage and became bone as the animal aged. Such plates are known from several other ornithopods and their cerapodan relatives.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{generally}} dismiss {{these numbers}} as exaggerations. One approach {{to estimate the}} number of troops is to calculate the number of marines carried by 600 triremes. Herodotus tells us that each trireme in the second invasion of Greece carried 30 extra marines, in addition to <b>a</b> <b>probable</b> 14 standard marines. Thus, 600 triremes could easily have carried 18,000–26,000 infantry. Numbers proposed for the Persian infantry are in the range 18,000–100,000. However, the consensus is around 25,000.|$|E
