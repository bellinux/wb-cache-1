5000|$|Bolts {{are often}} {{used to make a}} bolted joint. This is a {{combination}} of the nut applying an <b>axial</b> <b>clamping</b> force and also the shank of the bolt acting as a dowel, pinning the joint against sideways shear forces. For this reason, many bolts have a plain unthreaded shank (called the [...] ) as this makes for a better, stronger dowel. The presence of the unthreaded shank has often been given as characteristic of bolts vs. screws, [...] but this is incidental to its use, rather than defining. The grip length should be chosen carefully, to be around the same length as the thickness of the materials, and any washers, bolted together. Too short places the dowel shear load onto the threads, which may cause fretting wear on the hole. Too long prevents the nut from being tightened down correctly. No more than two turns of the thread should be within the hole.|$|E
50|$|An HSK {{connection}} {{depends on}} a combination of <b>axial</b> <b>clamping</b> forces and taper-shank interference. All these forces are generated and controlled by the mating components’ design parameters. The shank and spindle both must have precisely mating tapers and faces that are square to the taper’s axis. There are several HSK clamping methods. All use some mechanism to amplify the clamping action of equally spaced collet segments. When the toolholder is clamped into the spindle, the drawbar force produces a firm metal-to-metal contact between the shank and the ID of the clamping unit. An additional application of drawbar force positively locks the two elements together into a joint {{with a high level of}} radial and axial rigidity. As the collet segments rotate, the clamping mechanism gains centrifugal force. The HSK design actually harnesses centrifugal force to increase joint strength. Centrifugal force also causes the thin walls of the shank to deflect radially at a faster rate than the walls of the spindle. This contributes to a secure connection by guaranteeing strong contact between the shank and the spindle. The automotive and aerospace industries are the largest users of HSK toolholders. Another industry that is seeing increasing use is the mold and die industry.|$|E

A verygood agreement between theory and experiments is found. Inparticular it is shown that, during creep-mode (slow) shifting,the rate of change of the speed ratio depends linearly on thelogarithm of the ratio between the <b>axial</b> <b>clamping</b> forces actingon the two movable pulleys. The shifting speed is also shown tobe proportional to the angular velocity of the primary pulley.

40|$|Abstract. Despite {{being an}} {{important}} element to connect the major building materials in a steel bridge, bolt joints have not been sufficiently studied in terms of each defect generated in them. Among defects in bolt joints of steel bridges currently in public use, the most frequently occurring problem is the insufficient <b>axial</b> bolt <b>clamping</b> force. To measure sliding load caused by change in <b>axial</b> bolt <b>clamping</b> force, a test sample of H-beam applied with pure bending was created and static tests were administered. Based on the <b>axial</b> bolt <b>clamping</b> force of the test sample where the designed <b>axial</b> bolt <b>clamping</b> force is 100 %, tests were carried out with different <b>axial</b> bolt <b>clamping</b> forces of 75 %, 50 % and 25 %. Then, the sliding load caused by change in the <b>axial</b> bolt <b>clamping</b> force was analyzed...|$|R
50|$|When a {{cable is}} {{terminated}} by a connector, the various wires {{in the cable}} are connected to contacts (pins) in the connector. The most common methods of connecting pins to individual wires are soldering, insulation displacement, insulation piercing, screw <b>clamping,</b> <b>axial</b> screw termination, cage clamping, crimping, press-in termination, and wire wrapping. Some of these wiring methods can be accomplished without specialized tools. Other methods, while requiring a special tool, can assemble connectors to a cable much faster and more reliably, and make repairs easier.|$|R
30|$|We have {{simulated}} {{clinical conditions}} {{by use of}} saw bone models; we recruited subjects with experience in mounting frames and instructed them to assemble these constructs {{in a manner similar}} to their clinical practice. In the first part of the experiment, loosening torque values were determined. These are not the same as the tightening torque values as different forces are involved (static vs dynamic). Values obtained demonstrate statistically significant higher loosening torque values when bolts are used to secure half pins. This suggests a higher torque is applied when half pins are secured with bolts. We surmise the difference is due to a wrench (spanner) being used in contrast to the straight hex driver for grub screws. The <b>axial</b> compression force (<b>clamp</b> force) applied through either bolt or grub screw would determine the security of hold at the half pin–Rancho cube interface. This clamp force is affected by many other variables too: the bolt diameter. The type and number of threads on the bolt, the bolt material and the torque applied. The last variable is that under control by the surgeon and may influence the likelihood of these constructs to failure.|$|R

40|$|The {{process design}} {{is a very}} {{important}} step in NC machining which will ensure the manufacturing quality of the part. For the low rigidity part, due to the low rigidity and high deformation under certain load, herein, the low rigidity part often shows more clamping deformation under clamping force and cutting force in manufacturing, so that it will lead to machining error out of tolerance. In this paper, we choose a low rigidity shell part as research target, the machining process will be designed and analyzed, two clamping schemes were designed for this part, and the comparison and analysis were finished by using finite element method (FEM), the results showed that the smaller deformation and error was obtained in the <b>axial</b> <b>clamping</b> scheme, therefore, we choose this scheme as the ultimate clamping scheme for the low rigidity shell part...|$|E
40|$|Inactivation of delayed {{rectifier}} K conductance (gK) was {{studied in}} squid giant axons {{and in the}} somata of giant fiber lobe (GFL) neurons. Axon measurements were made with an <b>axial</b> wire voltage <b>clamp</b> by pulsing to VK (∼− 10 mV in 50 – 70 mM external K) for a variable time and then assaying available gK with a strong, brief test pulse. GFL cells were studied with whole-cell patch clamp using the same prepulse procedure {{as well as with}} long depolarizations. Under our experimental conditions (12 – 18 °C, 4 mM internal MgATP) a large fraction of gK inactivates within 250 ms at − 10 mV in both cell bodies and axons, although inactivation tends to be more complete in cell bodies. Inactivation in both preparations shows two kinetic components. The faster component is more temperature-sensitive and becomes very prominent above 12 °C. Contribution of the fast component to inactivation shows a similar voltage dependence to that of gK, suggesting a strong coupling of this inactivation path to the open state. Omission of internal MgATP or application of internal protease reduces the amount of fast inactivation. High external K decreases the amount of rapidly inactivating IK but does not greatly alter inactivation kinetics. Neither external nor internal tetraethylammonium has a marked effect on inactivation kinetics. Squid delayed rectifier K channels in GFL cell bodies and giant axons thus share complex fast inactivation properties that do not closely resemble those associated with either C-type or N-type inactivation of cloned Kv 1 channels studied in heterologous expression systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} {{had been}} conducted for shipside collision against unstiffened, inclined jacket leg segment (column). The inclined column has been modelled with horizontal-to-vertical ratio of 1 / 7. Two types of boundary {{conditions of the}} column has been modelled; perfectly clamped boundary conditions (clamped or fixed) and boundary conditions with axial flexibility (<b>axial</b> spring). For <b>clamped</b> column, two different impact locations have been simulated, namely middle span impact and quarter span impact. For each impact location, three (3) design categories have been analysed; ductile design (Rigid Ship versus deformable column), integrated design (deformable ship versus deformable column), and strength design (Rigid column versus deformable ship). For rigid ship and integrated cases, three (3) column wall thicknesses had been simulated to present the transition from ductile to integrated and strength categories. From the force-displacement relationships, the force demanded to generate the same displacement both on the column and shipside is slightly higher for middle span impact than for quarter span impact, for all column wall thickness assessed herein. However, the resistance to indentation appeared to be significantly higher for middle span impact after the contact area had developed until over {{the height of the}} shipside. Considering the analysis results from fixed columns, the column with the wall thickness of 40 mm under middle span impact had been chosen as main representative model to reveal the influence of the axial flexibility to the capacity of the column. Two (2) types of the spring arrangement on each column-end have been modelled, namely the multiple springs and the single springs. For multiple springs type, two different spring coefficients have been evaluated, namely the equivalent and the unequal (nodal) spring stiffness. The spring coefficients are calculated according the analysis results generated on USFOS, taking only the linear elastic spring stiffness. The ‘real’ axial flexibility proved no major contribution to the overall resistance and deformation of the column. Therefore, assuming a fixed column is prudent for practical design. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{particular}} study case in {{this thesis}} is the shock test performed on the LISA Pathfinder satellite conducted in a laboratory environment on a dedicated test bed: Vega Shock Test Apparatus (VESTA). This test is considered fully representative to study shock levels produced by fairing jettisoning event at Vega Launcher Vehicle, which induces high shock loads towards the satellite. In the frame of this thesis, some transient response analyses have been conducted in MSC Nastran, and a shock simulation tool for the VESTA test configuration has been developed. The simulation tool is based on Nastran Direct Transient Response Analysis solver (SOL 109), and {{is representative of the}} upper composite of Vega with the LISA Pathfinder coupled to it. Post-processing routines of transient response signals were conducted in Dynaworks which served to calculate Shock Response Spectra (SRS). The simulation tool is a model of forcing function parameters for transient analysis which adequately correlates with the shock real test data, in order to understand how the effect of shock generated by the launcher is seen in the satellite and its sub-systems. Since available computation resources are limited the parameters for analysis were optimised for computation time, file size, memory capacity,  and model complexity. The forcing function represents a release of the HSS clamp band which is responsible for fairing jettisoning, thus the parameters which were studied are mostly concerning the modelling of this event. Among many investigated, those which visibly improved SRS correlation are radial forcing function shape, implementation of <b>axial</b> impulse, <b>clamp</b> band loading geometry and refined loading scheme. Integration time step duration and analysis duration were also studied and found to improve correlation.   From each analysis, the qualifying shock environment was then derived by linear scaling in proportion of the applied preload, and considering a qualification margin of 3 dB. Consecutive tracking of structural responses along shock propagation path exposed gradual changes in responses pattern and revealed an important property that a breathing mode (n = 0) {{at the base of a}} conical Adapter translates into an axial input to the spacecraft. The parametrisation itself was based on responses registered at interfaces located in near-field (where the clamp band is located and forcing function is applied) and medium-field with respect to the shock event location. Following shock propagation path, the final step was the analysis of shock responses inside the satellite located in a far-field region, which still revealed a very good correlation of results. Thus, it can be said that parametrisation process was adequate, and the developed shock simulation tool can be qualified. However, due to the nature of shock, the tool cannot fully replace VESTA laboratory test, but can support shock assessment process and preparation to such test. In the last part of the thesis, the implementation of some finite element model improvements is investigated. Majority of the panels in spacecraft interior exhibited shock over-prediction due to finite element model limitation. Equipment units modelled as lump masses rigidly attached with RBE 2 elements to the panel surface are a source of such local over-predictions. Thus, some of the units were remodelled and transient responses were reinvestigated. It was found that remodelling with either solid elements, or lump mass connected to RBE 3 element and reinforced by RBE 2 element, can significantly improve local transient responses. This conclusion is in line with conclusions found in ECSS Shock Handbook...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} {{experimental study of}} the pushing V-belt CVT dynamics and compare the experimental data withthe theoretical predictions of the Carbone, Mangialardi, Mantriota (CMM) model [G. Carbone, L. Mangialardi, G. Mantriota, The influence of pulley deformations on the shifting mechanisms of MVB-CVT, ASME Journal of MechanicalDesign 127 (2005) 103 – 113]. A very good agreement between theory and experiments is found. In particular it is shownthat, during creep-mode (slow) shifting, {{the rate of change}} of the speed ratio is a linear function of the logarithm ofthe ratio between the <b>axial</b> <b>clamping</b> forces acting on the two movable pulleys. The shifting speed is also shown to be proportionalto the angular velocity of the primary pulley, and to increase as the clamping force on the secondary pulley isincreased. Indeed, a growth of the clamping force increases the pulley bending and, therefore, in agreement with the CMMmodel, increases the shifting speed. The authors also propose a relatively simple differential equation to describe the creepmodeevolution of the variator. Few parameters appear in the formula, which may be calculated either experimentally ortheoretically. The results of this study are of utmost importance for the design of advanced CVT control systems and theimprovement of the CVT efficiency, cars’ drivability and fuel economy...|$|E
40|$|V-band {{retainers}} {{are widely}} used in the automotive, aircraft and aerospace industries to connect a pair of circular flanges to provide a joint with good axial strength and torsional rigidity. V-band retainers are manufactured using a cold roll forming process. Despite their wide application, once assembled {{to a pair of}} flanges {{little is known about the}} interaction between flange and band. Moreover the failure mode of V-band retainers when applying an axial load is not fully understood. In this thesis the ultimate axial load capacity of V-band retainers is predicted using finite element and theoretical models and validated using experimental testing. It was shown that the ultimate axial load capacity was strongly dependent on the joint diameter, increasing between 114 mm and 235 mm, and decreasing beyond that. Moreover, the peak in ultimate axial load capacity was dependent on parameters such as the <b>axial</b> <b>clamping</b> load and coefficient of friction, and its position lay between 235 mm and 450 mm, as predicted by the finite element models. Other geometrical parameters such as flange and band thickness showed large impacts on the ultimate axial load capacity as well. A theoretical model was developed that allowed the ultimate axial load capacity to be calculated from a single formula for larger bands and using a simple algorithm for smaller bands. This model supported the findings that, depending on the band diameter, the ultimate axial load capacity had a peak, but predicted its position at approximately 181 mm. This position at 181 mm was validated by the experimental data. However, when compared to the tests, the finite element and theoretical models both over-predicted the ultimate axial load capacity. Both the finite element models and practical tests showed that for small V-bands axial failure is due to a combination of section deformation and ring expansion, whereas large V-bands fail due to ring expansion only. These two distinct types of behaviour were incorporated into the theoretical model. The hardness development throughout the cold roll forming process was predicted using finite element models. This was validated by hardness measurements, for which a new technique was generated, that directly linked plastic strain and hardness values...|$|E
40|$|Turbochargers play an {{important}} role in increasing the fuel economy of passenger vehicles. With emissions standards getting stricter in Europe over the passing years, turbochargers have soared in popularity in the automotive industry. Due to increasing competition in the market place, manufacturers have had to optimize each of the sub-systems of the turbocharger for peak performance. One such sub-system is the V-clamp connection between the turbine housing and the bearing housing of the turbocharger. The critical loads on the components of the turbocharger are the cycles of thermal loading, with peak temperatures of the exhaust gases reaching 1100 ±C. It is the goal of this research to understand the behavior of the V-clamp clamping system when it is subjected to cycles of thermal loading. The bolted V-clamp has been investigated quite extensively in literature, but only under cold conditions. The behavior of this clamping connection under thermal loading has received surprisingly little attention by the scientific community. This is probably due to the fact that V-clamps are not widely used in academic research. Nevertheless, they are the go-to solution for clamping purposes in the turbocharger industry. Thus, understanding the reasons for the behavior of the connection under thermal loading is of importance in order to design a robust system. First, a simplified component model is created to model the V-clamp and the flanges it connects. Component models are combinations of 1 -dimensional spring elements, friction elements, and rigid bodies connected together to represent a mechanical system. The component model created here models the elastic stiffness of the V-clamp and the turbine housing (as 1 -dimensional springs), and the plasticity in the V-clamp (as a 1 -dimensional friction block). Previous investigations from the literature have shown that plasticity in the V-clamp should be modelled as it plays {{an important}} role in the response of the clamping system. The component model is analysed with the help of dimensionless ratios, which make it easy to study the relative effects of the components on each other. It is found that the component model behaves in a similar way as the actual clamping system. Since dimensionless ratios were used for the analysis, the effects of different relative stiffnesses of the V-clamp and the turbine housing, and the effects of different thermal expansions of the V-clamp and the turbine housing could be easily studied. The results of the analysis help in understanding the behavior of the connection when thermal loading is applied. Next, an optimization study is conducted with the goal of maximizing the minimum <b>axial</b> <b>clamping</b> force in the system for the duration of three heat load cycles. A parameterized axially symmetric model is created in Abaqus 6. 14 - 1 to simulate a simplified version of the turbocharger clamping geometry. The parameterization is done with design variables that allow changing the connection geometry of the clamping connection. Due to non-convexity of the design domain and non-linearity of the objective function, a response surface is first created to understand the variation of the objective function over the design domain. This is also useful in choosing proper starting points for the optimization process, in order to get close to the global optimum. The optimum found with this strategy is analysed for its validity, and compared with the conclusions obtained from the component model. Finally, the sensitivity of the optimum with respect to varying thermal loads, and varying thicknesses of the V-clamp is studied. It is found that lower heat loads and thicker V-clamps are beneficial to the performance of the clamping system. The investigation of the clamping system presented here will hopefully provide clear guidelines in the rational design of the clamping done by bolted V-clamps. This study of the V-clamp under thermal cyclic loading has contributed to a better understanding of the working of the system. The study proposes changes to the connection geometry that affects the relative stiffnesses of the V-clamp and the turbine housing, and their relative thermal expansions. Future work could investigate the effect of differentmaterial grades of the components on the response of the system.
