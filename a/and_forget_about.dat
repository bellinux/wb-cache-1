25|$|Produced on a shoestring, about 75% of {{the budget}} was funded by Bord Scannán na hÉireann (The Irish Film Board), plus some of Carney's own money. The {{director}} gave his salary to the two stars, and promised {{a share of the}} back-end for everyone if the film was a success. Shot with a skeleton crew on a 17-day shoot, the filmmakers saved money by using natural light and shooting at friends' houses. The musical party scene was filmed in Hansard's own flat, with his personal friends playing the partygoers/musicianshis mother, Catherine Hansard, is briefly featured singing solo. The Dublin street scenes were recorded without permits and with a long lens so that many passersby didn't even realize that a film was being made. The long lens also helped the non-professional actors relax <b>and</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> the camera, and some of the dialogue ended up being improvised.|$|E

500|$|The North American {{release was}} {{scheduled}} for July 11, 2008, but was delayed until August 15, before being brought forward to August 13. As {{a result of the}} move from July, 20th Century Fox moved its family comedy Meet Dave in the open slot. The August 13 release date was also the opening weekends for the animated family film [...] and the horror film Mirrors. Studios consider the third week of August to be a weaker performing period than earlier in the summer because of students returning to school. Previous R-rated comedies such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Superbad were released in mid-August and performed well at the box office. Reacting to Tropic Thunders release date, Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, stated: [...] "For a young person at the end of summer, you want to have some fun <b>and</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> going back to school.

500|$|Aaliyah, who {{maintained}} a perfect 4.0 {{grade point average}} when graduating from Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, felt education was important. She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: [...] "I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing <b>and</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important {{to have something to}} fall back on." [...] She did this in her own life, as she planned to [...] "fall back on" [...] another part of the entertainment industry. She believed that if she could teach music history or open her own school to teach that or drama if she did not make a living as a recording artist because, as she reasoned, [...] "when you pick a career it has to be something you love".|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, recent {{industry}} trends suggest the reemergence {{of something like}} the traditional A-B split in major studio production, though with fewer [...] "programmers" [...] bridging the gap. According to a 2006 report by industry analyst Alfonso Marone, [...] "The average budget for a Hollywood movie is currently around $, rising to $ when the cost of marketing for domestic launch (USA only) is factored into the equation. However, we are now witnessing a polarisation of film budgets into two tiers: large productions ($120–) and niche features ($5–20m). ... Fewer $30– releases are expected." [...] Fox launched a new subsidiary in 2006, Fox Atomic, to concentrate on teen-oriented genre films. The economic model was deliberately low-rent, at least by major studio standards. According to a Variety report, [...] "Fox Atomic is staying at or below the [...] mark for many of its movies. It's also encouraging filmmakers to shoot digitally—a cheaper process that results in a grittier, teen-friendly look. <b>And</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> stars. Of Atomic's nine announced films, not one has a big name". The newfangled B movie division was shut down in 2009.|$|E

500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner <b>and</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

The women grew up together but lost touch when Clare's white father died and she was taken {{to live with her}} two paternal white aunts. Irene learns that Clare [...] "passes" [...] for white, living primarily in Europe with her unsuspecting, rich, white husband and their daughter. Although Irene tries to avoid further engagement with Clare, she never is able to fully exclude her from her life as she later visits Clare for tea along with another childhood friend, Gertrude Martin. Toward the end of the visit, Clare's white husband John (Jack) Bellew arrives. Unaware that all three women are black, Jack expresses some very racist views and makes the women uneasy. However, the women play along in an effort to maintain Clare's secret identity. Afterward, Irene and Gertrude decide that Clare's situation is too dangerous for them to continue associating with her and are uncomfortable around Clare and her husband [...] Irene receives a letter of apology from Clare but destroys it and in her quest to try <b>and</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> Clare and get her out of her life.

500|$|Conversely, Andy Webster of The New York Times said, [...] "Its bargain-basement {{production}} {{values and}} lack of wit unexpectedly prove a greater liability than an asset". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times criticized its characters, costumes, and dialogue; he said it [...] "so desperately wants to be cultishly admired...that it forgets to be genuinely offbeat or funny". Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, mentioning the influences of John Carpenter, The Warriors, Mad Max 2, and A Clockwork Orange, and criticizing Jason Trost's performance. He said the film was [...] "a junky, disposable lark, created for a midnight audience to swallow, belch, <b>and</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> the next morning". Nick Schager of Slant Magazine gave it 1½ stars out of 4, and called it a [...] "humorless void" [...] and a [...] "wannabe cult hit". Eric Hynes of The Village Voice said, [...] "the film's charm fades fast" [...] and , [...] "he problem with paying such dogged homage to shitty movies is that integrity is best achieved by producing a shitty movie in turn. Mission accomplished, for whatever that's worth." [...] Ethan Gilsdorf of The Boston Globe gave the film 1 star out of 4, saying it was not [...] "obliviously dreadful enough to be 'so bad it's good'". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press echoed this opinion, giving it 1 star out of 4; she said the film is [...] "just plain badand boring, and repetitive" [...] and that [...] "as comedy, it just feels numbing". Max Nicholson of IGN said the film [...] "is {{by no means the}} worst thing I've ever seen", but that it [...] "should have been a three-minute sketch on Funny or Die".|$|E

2500|$|Little Miss Sunshine was {{produced}} by Fox Searchlight, the major studio's pseudo-indie subsidiary, for $8 million. With its quirky, [...] "indie"-style comedy, the film hardly meets any conventional definition of a B movie beyond its relatively small budget, but the sorts of movies embraced by the term have shifted drastically before. Classic film noir's combination of visual beauty and verbal wit, for instance, was hardly common coin in exploitation-era B filmmaking. Further expanding the field, Fox launched a new subsidiary in 2006, Fox Atomic, to concentrate on teen-oriented genre films (horror in particular, at first, then increasingly comedy, as well). The genre focus {{was similar to that}} of Sony's Screen Gems division and the Weinsteins' Dimension Films, but the economic model was deliberately low-rent, at least by major studio standards. According to a Variety report, [...] "Fox Atomic is staying at or below the $10 million mark for many of its movies. It's also encouraging filmmakers to shoot digitally—a cheaper process that results in a grittier, teen-friendly look. <b>And</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> stars.

Arkoff and James H. Nicholson's AIP helped define in the 1950s. Despite its low budgets and consequently low benchmarks for profitability, Fox Atomic's output was seen as unsuccessful by its parent company, which shut it down in 2009.|$|E
