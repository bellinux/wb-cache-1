25|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome can be induced by overfeeding with sugar or fructose, particularly concomitantly with high-fat diet. The resulting oversupply of omega-6 fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid (AA), {{is an important}} factor in the pathogenesis of {{metabolic syndrome}}. Arachidonic acid (with its precursor - linoleic acid) serve as a substrate to the production of inflammatory mediators known as eicosanoids, whereas the arachidonic acid-containing compound diacylglycerol (DAG) is a precursor to the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) while fatty <b>acid</b> <b>amide</b> hydrolase (FAAH) mediates the metabolism of arachidonic acid into anandamide. Anandamide can also be produced from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine via several pathways. Anandamide and 2-AG can also be hydrolized into arachidonic acid, potentially leading to increased eicosanoid synthesis.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed acyl-transfer {{reactions}} in water {{the specificity of}} the enzyme (the nucleophile reactivity of amino <b>acid</b> <b>amides)</b> is correlated with the substrate hydrophobicity and increases as the hydrophobicity of the side chain of the amino <b>acid</b> <b>amides</b> is increased. In a low water system (4 % H 2 O) bulky amino <b>acid</b> <b>amides</b> are less efficient nucleophiles. The specificity of α-chymotrypsin towards the amino <b>acid</b> <b>amides</b> in acyl transfer {{reactions in}} this case {{does not depend on}} the hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chains but correlates with their size. Therefore, different factors can be responsible for the specificity of enzymes in water and in a mainly organic medium...|$|R
50|$|Fatty <b>acid</b> <b>amides</b> (FAAs) are amides {{formed from}} a fatty acid and an amine. In nature, many FFAs have {{ethanolamine}} as the amine component. Also known as N-acylethanolamines, they contain the functionality RC(O)N(H)CH2CH2OH. A well known example is anandamide. Other fatty <b>acid</b> <b>amides</b> are fatty <b>acid</b> primary <b>amides</b> (FAPAs). They contain the funcitonality RC(O)NH2). Oleamide {{is an example}} of this class of FAPAs.|$|R

25|$|Unlike anandamide, {{formation}} of 2-AG is calcium-dependent and is {{mediated by the}} activities of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). 2-AG acts as a full agonist at the CB1 receptor. At a concentration of 0.3nM, 2-AG induces a rapid, transient increase in intracellular free calcium in NG108-15 neuroblastoma X glioma cells through a CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism. 2-AG is hydrolyzed in vitro by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), fatty <b>acid</b> <b>amide</b> hydrolase (FAAH), and the uncharacterized serine hydrolase enzymes ABHD6 and ABHD12. The exact contribution {{of each of these}} enzymes to the termination of 2-AG signaling in vivo is unknown, though it is estimated that MAGL is responsible for ~85% of this activity in the brain. There have been identified transport proteins for 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide. These include the heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs).|$|E

40|$|To get insight in the {{biodegradation}} {{and potential}} read-across of fatty <b>acid</b> <b>amides,</b> N-[3 -(dimethylamino) propyl] cocoamide and N-(1 -ethylpiperazine) tall oil amide {{were used as}} model compounds. Two bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PK 1 and Pseudomonas putida PK 2 were isolated with N-[3 -(dimethylamino) propyl] cocoamide and its hydrolysis product N,N-dimethyl- 1, 3 -propanediamine, respectively. In mixed culture, both strains accomplished complete mineralization of N-[3 -(dimethylamino) propyl] cocoamide. Aeromonashydrophila PK 3 was enriched with N-(1 -ethylpiperazine) tall oil amide and subsequently isolated using agar plates containing dodecanoate. N-(2 -Aminoethyl) piperazine, the hydrolysis product of N-(1 -ethylpiperazine) tall oil amide, was not degraded. The aerobic biodegradation pathway for primary and secondary fatty <b>acid</b> <b>amides</b> of P. aeruginosa and A. hydrophila involved initial hydrolysis of the amide bond producing ammonium, or amines, where the fatty acids formed were immediately metabolized. Complete mineralization of secondary fatty <b>acid</b> <b>amides</b> depended on the biodegradability of the released amine. Tertiary fatty <b>acid</b> <b>amides</b> were not transformed by P. aeruginosa or A. hydrophila. These strains were able to utilize all tested primary and secondary fatty <b>acid</b> <b>amides</b> independent of the amine structure and fatty acid. Read-across of previous reported ready biodegradability results of primary and secondary fatty <b>acid</b> <b>amides</b> is justified based on the broad substrate specificity and the initial hydrolytic attack of the two isolates PK 1 and PK 3...|$|R

40|$|Gene {{silencing}} by siRNA (synthetic dsRNA of 21 - 25 nucleotides) is a {{well established}} biological tool in gene expression studies and has a promising therapeutic potential for difficult-to-treat diseases. Five fatty acids of various chain length and oxidation state (C 12 : 0, C 18 : 0, C 18 : 1, C 18 : 2, C 22 : 1) were conjugated to the naturally occurring polyamine, spermine, and evaluated for siRNA delivery and gene knock-down. siRNA delivery could not be related directly to gene silencing efficiency as N 4,N 9 -dierucoyl spermine resulted in higher siRNA delivery compared to N 4,N 9 -dioleoyl spermine. GFP silencing in HeLa cells showed that the unsaturated fatty <b>acid</b> <b>amides</b> are more efficient than saturated fatty <b>acid</b> <b>amides,</b> with N 4,N 9 -dioleoyl spermine resulting in the most efficient gene silencing {{in the presence of}} serum.

Transgenic in vitro-grown tobacco lines expressing TDC activity accumulated {{high levels of}} tryptamine but not hydroxycinnamic amides of tryptamine. In contrast, transgenic tobacco lines expressing TYDC accumulated tyramine as well as p-coumaroyltyramine and feruloyltyramine.
