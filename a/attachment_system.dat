40|$|Background: Different <b>attachment</b> <b>systems</b> for mandibular two-implant overdentures could {{influence}} levels of patient satisfaction. Positive {{consensus of the}} majority of patients being satisfied does not preclude the possibility of dissatisfaction for some. Purpose: To evaluate patient satisfaction before and after 5 years of wearing mandibular two-implant overdentures using different <b>attachment</b> <b>systems.</b> Materials andMethods: A total of 106 edentulous participants enrolled in a clinical trial completed a preliminary self-report inventory of their original complete denture complaints. New complete maxillary dentures and mandibular two-implant overdentures were provided to each participant using one of six different <b>attachment</b> <b>systems.</b> Patient satisfaction was determined at pretreatment; at baseline with mandibular two-implant overdenture insertion; and then annually for 5 years, using visual analogue and Likert-type scales. Results: Patient satisfaction with mandibular two-implant overdentures at baseline was significantly improved in all domains compared to pretreatment (old dentures) and sustained up to the 5 -year recall.

40|$|John Bowlby {{formulated}} {{the core}} of Attachment Theory whilst working in a multidisciplinary team of childcare professionals, psychoanalysts, ethologists and other researchers at the Tavistock Clinic for over thirty years after the Second World War (Holmes 1993).

Attachment Theory attempts to set out descriptions {{of a set of}} observable behaviours related to social and emotional attachment in animals and humans and the cognitive mechanisms that give rise to these observable phenomena. It can therefore be presented as incorporating theoretical components that can be termed the behavioural and cognitive components of Attachment Theory. The behavioural component of Attachment Theory is valuable for researchers interested in engineering artificial <b>attachment</b> <b>systems</b> because the set of attachment behaviours that have been observed and recorded over the last half century provide numerous behavioural scenarios. These can act as standardised specifications of requirements for the engineering process allowing artificial <b>attachment</b> <b>systems</b> to be focused in their design and evaluation (Petters 2004, 2006).

We then immersed 40 of the magnetic <b>attachment</b> <b>systems</b> in two media, namely, 1 % lactic acid solution (pH 2. 3), and 0. 9 % NaCl solution (pH 7. 3).

500|$|Psychoanalyst/psychologists Peter Fonagy and Mary Target have {{attempted}} to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship through cognitive science as mentalization. Mentalization, or theory of mind, is the capacity of human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression. It has been speculated that this connection between theory of mind and the internal working model may open new areas of study, leading to alterations in attachment theory. Since the late 1980s, {{there has been a}} developing rapprochement between attachment theory and psychoanalysis, based on common ground as elaborated by attachment theorists and researchers, and a change in what psychoanalysts consider to be central to psychoanalysis. Object relations models which emphasise the autonomous need for a relationship have become dominant and are linked to a growing recognition within psychoanalysis of the importance of infant development in the context of relationships and internalized representations. Psychoanalysis has recognized the formative nature of a child's early environment including the issue of childhood trauma.

500|$|The {{attachment}} behavioural system {{serves to}} achieve or maintain {{proximity to the}} attachment figure. Pre-attachment behaviours occur {{in the first six}} months of life. During the first phase (the first eight weeks), infants smile, babble, and cry to attract the attention of potential caregivers. Although infants of this age learn to discriminate between caregivers, these behaviours are directed at anyone in the vicinity. During the second phase (two to six months), the infant increasingly discriminates between familiar and unfamiliar adults, becoming more responsive toward the caregiver; following and clinging are added to the range of behaviours. Clear-cut attachment develops in the third phase, between the ages of six months and two years. The infant's behaviour toward the caregiver becomes organized on a goal-directed basis to achieve the conditions that make it feel secure. By the end of the first year, the infant is able to display a range of attachment behaviours designed to maintain proximity. These manifest as protesting the caregiver's departure, greeting the caregiver's return, clinging when frightened, and following when able. With the development of locomotion, the infant begins to use the caregiver or caregivers as a [...] "safe base" [...] from which to explore. Infant exploration is greater when the caregiver is present because the infant's <b>attachment</b> <b>system</b> is relaxed and it is free to explore. If the caregiver is inaccessible or unresponsive, attachment behaviour is more strongly exhibited. Anxiety, fear, illness, and fatigue will cause a child to increase attachment behaviours.|$|E
500|$|There {{is rapidly}} growing {{interest}} in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers. However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as [...] "open-ended, {{in the sense that}} subcategories may be distinguished", as she worried that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated {{as if they were the}} same thing. Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the <b>attachment</b> <b>system</b> has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger). Moreover, Crittenden argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that [...] "even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent". However, [...] "the presumption that many indices of 'disorganization' are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response." [...] For example, [...] "Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person." ...|$|E

2500|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective, grief is perplexing because it appears costly, {{and it is}} not clear what benefits it provides the sufferer. Several researchers have proposed functional explanations for grief, attempting to solve this puzzle. Sigmund Freud argued that grief is a process of libidinal reinvestment. The griever must, Freud argued, disinvest from the deceased, which is a painful process. But this disinvestment allows the griever to use libidinal energies on other, possibly new attachments, so it provides a valuable function. John Archer, approaching grief from an attachment theory perspective, argued that grief is a byproduct of the human <b>attachment</b> <b>system.</b> [...] Generally, a grief-type response is adaptive because it compels a social organism to search for a lost individual (e.g., a mother or a child). However, in the case of death, the response is maladaptive because the individual is not simply lost and the griever cannot reunite with the deceased. Grief, from this perspective, is a painful cost of the human capacity to form commitments.|$|E
