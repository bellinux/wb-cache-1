5|$|Accusing the Song {{of violating}} the <b>agreement</b> <b>and</b> realizing the {{weakness}} of the Song, the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign, again dividing their troops into two armies. Wanyan Zonghan, who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng <b>agreement</b> <b>and</b> left a small force in charge of the siege, came back with his western army. Overwhelmed, Taiyuan fell in September 1126, after 260 days of siege. When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan, the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement. In mid December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year.|$|E

5|$|ASL signs have {{a number}} of phonemic components, {{including}} movement of the face and torso as well as the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime, but iconicity does play a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal <b>agreement</b> <b>and</b> aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.|$|E

5|$|Among Harrison's former bandmates, Lennon {{initially}} {{agreed to}} take part in the concert without his wife and musical partner Yoko Ono, as Harrison had apparently stipulated. Lennon then allegedly had an argument with Ono as a result of this <b>agreement</b> <b>and</b> left New York in a rage two days before the concerts. Starr's commitment had never been in question, and he interrupted the filming of his movie Blindman in Almeria, Spain, in order to attend. Paul McCartney declined to take part, however, citing the bad feelings caused by the Beatles' legal problems on their break-up.|$|E
5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the <b>Agreement</b> <b>and</b> freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E

Crittenden disagreed, and insisted that Britain be given two years notice before the joint occupation of the territory was ended {{in order to allow}} time for a diplomatic resolution. Ultimately, Crittenden's position prevailed, and a compromise with Britain was effected, setting the dividing line between the two nations' claims at the 49th parallel north.|$|E
