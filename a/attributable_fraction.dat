For 2008 the Global Burden of Disease for OPC in 2008 is estimated at 85,000 cases, of which 22,000 were attributable to HPV, a population <b>attributable</b> <b>fraction</b> (PAF) of 26%. Of these, 17,000 were males and 4,400 females, 13,000 (60%) were aged between 50 and 69 years of age, and the majority of cases (15,000) were in developed regions compared to developing regions (6,400).

As a hypothetical example, if all radon exposure in a community were removed, and everything else were left unchanged, the number of lung cancer cases would decrease. The population <b>attributable</b> <b>fraction</b> provides an indication of the relative reduction in new cases of the disease in the event that this could be done.

40|$|Abstract Background Acute lower {{respiratory}} infections (ALRI) are a {{major cause}} of hospitalisation in young children. Many factors can lead to increased risk of ALRI in children and predispose a child to hospitalisation, but population <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> for different risk factors and how these fractions differ between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children is unknown. This study investigates population <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> of known infant and maternal risk factors for ALRI to inform prevention strategies that target high-risk groups or particular risk factors. Methods A retrospective population-based data linkage study of 245, 249 singleton births in Western Australia. Population <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> of known maternal and infant risk factors for hospitalisation with ALRI between 1996 and 2005 were calculated using multiple logistic regression.

40|$|Studies of {{body weight}} and {{mortality}} sometimes exclude participants who have ever smoked or who may have had preexisting illness at baseline. This exclusionary approach was applied to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to investigate the potential effects of smoking and preexisting illness on estimates of the <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> of US deaths in 2000 that were associated with different levels of body mass index (BMI; weight (kg) /height (m) 2). Synthetic estimates were calculated by using postexclusion relative risks for BMI cate-gories in place of BMI relative risks from the full sample, holding the relative risks for all other covariates constant. When the postexclusion relative risks were used, the <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> of deaths associated with underweight and {{with higher levels of}} obesity increased slightly and the <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> of deaths associated with over-weight and with grade 1 obesity decreased slightly. The relative risks for BMI categories did not show large or systematic changes after simultaneous exclusion of ever smokers, persons with a history of cancer or cardiovas-cular disease, and persons who died early in the follow-up period or had their heights and weights measured at older ages.

40|$|Abstract Background Asthma {{is among}} the most common chronic {{diseases}} in working-aged populations and occupational exposures are important causal agents. Our aims were to evaluate the best methods to assess occurrence, public health impact, and burden to society related to occupational or work-related asthma and to achieve comparable estimates for different populations. Methods We addressed three central questions: 1 : What is the best method to assess the occurrence of occupational asthma? We evaluated: 1) assessment of the occurrence of occupational asthma per se, and 2) assessment of adult-onset asthma and the population <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> due to specific occupational exposures. 2 : What are the best methods to assess public health impact and burden to society related to occupational or work-related asthma? We evaluated methods based on assessment of excess burden of disease due to specific occupational exposures. 3 : How to achieve comparable estimates for different populations? We evaluated comparability of estimates of occurrence and burden attributable to occupational asthma based on different methods. Results Assessment of the occurrence of occupational asthma per se can be used in countries with good coverage of the identification system for occupational asthma, i. e. countries with well-functioning occupational health services. Assessment based on adult-onset asthma and population <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> due to specific occupational exposures is a good approach to estimate the occurrence of occupational asthma at the population level. For assessment of public health impact from work-related asthma we recommend assessing excess burden of disease due to specific occupational exposures, including excess incidence of asthma complemented by an assessment of disability from it. International comparability of estimates can be best achieved by methods based on population <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions.</b> Conclusions Public health impact assessment for occupational asthma is central in prevention and health policy planning and could be improved by purposeful development of methods for assessing health benefits from preventive actions. Registry-based methods are suitable for evaluating time-trends of occurrence at a given population but for international comparisons they face serious limitations.

Methods A nationwide representative sample of 2, 000 Japanese aged 20 or older was asked about their perception and level of concern about various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention, {{as a part of}} an Omnibus Survey. Interviews were conducted with 1, 355 subjects (609 men and 746 women). Results Among 12 risk factor candidates, the <b>attributable</b> <b>fraction</b> of cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection was considered highest (51 %), followed by that of tobacco smoking (43 %), stress (39 %), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37 %). On the other hand, the attributable fractions of cancer by charred fish and meat (21 %) and alcohol drinking (22 %) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. For most risk factors, <b>attributable</b> <b>fraction</b> responses were higher in women than in men. As a whole, the subjects tended to respond with higher values than those estimated by epidemiologic evidence in the West. The <b>attributable</b> <b>fraction</b> of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32 %, while 36 % of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle.

Design We compare actual practices to a minimum exposure pattern consisting of exclusive breast-feeding for infants ≤ 6 months of age and continued breast-feeding for older infants and children ≤ 2 years of age. For infants, we consider deaths due to diarrhoeal disease and lower respiratory tract infections, and deaths due to all causes are considered {{in the second year}} of life. Outcome measures are <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions,</b> deaths, years of life lost and offsetting deaths potentially caused by mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breast-feeding. Setting Developing countries. Subjects Infants and children ≤ 2 years of age. Results <b>Attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> for deaths due to diarrhoeal disease and lower respiratory tract infections are 55 % and 53 %, respectively, {{for the first six months}} of infancy, 20 % and 18 % for the second six months, and are 20 % for all-cause deaths in the second year of life. Globally, as many as 1. 45 million lives (117 million years of life) are lost due to suboptimal breast-feeding in developing countries. Offsetting deaths caused by mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breast-feeding could be as high as 242 000 (18. 8 million years of life lost) if relevant World Health Organization recommendations are not followed.

Obesity and abdominal obesity are risk factors for high blood pressure. Population <b>attributable</b> <b>fraction</b> (PAF) answers the question of how much of the disease burden in a certain population may be reduced if a risk factor like obesity is removed from the population. It implies that reducing prevalence of obesity as a risk factor of hypertension, may reduce the burden of hypertension and its consequences.

We calculate smoking <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> for the 50 states and the U. S. as a whole in 2000 and 2004. We estimate that 21 % of adult deaths among men and 17 % among women were attributable to smoking in 2004. Across states, <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> range from 11 % to 30 % among men and from 7 % to 23 % among women. Smoking related mortality also explains as much as 60 % of the mortality disadvantage of Southern states. At the national level, our estimates are in close agreement with those of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Preston/Glei/Wilmoth, particularly for men. But we find greater variability by state than does CDC. We suggest that our coefficients are suitable for calculating smoking-attributable mortality in contexts with relatively mature cigarette smoking epidemics...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} {{association}} between chronic immune-mediated diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or the following chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diagnoses groups: inflammatory bowel diseases, inflammatory polyarthropathies, systemic connective tissue disorders and spondylopathies) and the 6 -year coronary artery disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease incidence and overall mortality; and to estimate the population <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> for all four end-points for each chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Methods Cohort study of individuals aged 35 - 85 years, with no history of cardiovascular disease from Catalonia (Spain). The coded diagnoses of chronic immune-mediated diseases and cardiovascular diseases were ascertained and registered using validated codes, and date of death was obtained from administrative data. Cox regression models for each outcome according to exposure were fitted to estimate hazard ratios (HR) in two models: (1) after adjustment for sex, age, cardiovascular risk factors and (2) further adjusted for drug use. Population <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> were estimated for each exposure. Results Data were collected from 991, 546 participants. The risk of cardiovascular disease was increased in systemic connective tissue disorders [Model 1 : HR= 1. 38 (95 % confidence interval= 1. 21 - 1. 57) and 2 : HR= 1. 31 (1. 15 - 1. 49) ], rheumatoid arthritis [HR= 1. 43 (1. 26 - 1. 62) and HR= 1. 31 (1. 15 - 1. 49) ] and inflammatory bowel diseases [HR= 1. 18 (1. 06 - 1. 32) and HR= 1. 12 (1. 01 - 1. 25) ]. The effect of anti-inflammatory treatment was significant in all instances [HR= 1. 50 (1. 24 - 1. 81); HR= 1. 47 (1. 23 - 1. 75); HR= 1. 43 (1. 19 - 1. 73), respectively]. The population <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> for all three disorders were 13. 4 %, 15. 7 %, and 10. 7 %, respectively. Conclusion Systemic connective tissue disorders and rheumatoid arthritis conferred the highest cardiovascular risk and population impact, followed by inflammatory bowel diseases...|$|R
40|$|Poster Presentations: S 2 -P 37 Conference Proceedings entitled: Incidence, Severity, and Impact 2012 : poster presentationsBACKGROUND: The {{burden of}} {{mortality}} attributable to influenza virus {{can be quantified}} by influenza-associated excess deaths estimated from statistical models. Given the discrepancies that have often been observed in the prevalence and burden of major diseases between men and women, we aimed to examine the patterns in influenza-associated excess mortality among {{men and women in}} Hong Kong in the past decade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple linear regression models were applied to age-specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates in Hong Kong from 1998 through 2009 for men and women separately. The activities of different types/subtypes of influenza virus and co-circulating respiratory syncytial virus were adjusted as the product of influenza-like illness rates from sentinel surveillance and laboratory detection rates of the specific viruses. Models were also adjusted for environmental temperature and absolute humidity and periodic temporal trends in mortality rates. The influenza-associated excess mortality was measured as the differences between estimated mortality rates in {{the presence or absence of}} influenza activity. <b>Attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> were estimated for each cause. RESULTS: The annual influenza-associated all-cause excess mortality rates were 9. 6 and 12. 6 per 100, 000 person-years for men and women from 1998 through 2009. The <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> of all-cause deaths were 2. 0 % and 2. 1 % in men and women, respectively. More than 90 % of the influenza-associated all-cause excess deaths were estimated in the elderly for both men and women. Cardiorespiratory diseases accounted for more influenza-associated excess deaths in men (80 %) than in women (70 %). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza infection led to a higher number of excess deaths among men than women each year in Hong Kong, but more men die of all causes and the <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> were very similar for men and women. Most of the influenza-associated excess deaths occurred in the elderly for both sexes. Cardiorespiratory diseases accounted for the majority of the influenza-associated excess deaths in both sexes, particularly among men. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundChlamydia trachomatis {{infection}} is highly prevalent among {{young women in}} the United States. Prevention of long-term sequelae of infection, including tubal factor infertility, is a primary goal of chlamydia screening and treatment activities. However, the population <b>attributable</b> <b>fraction</b> of tubal factor infertility associated with chlamydia is unclear, and optimal measures for assessing tubal factor infertility and prior chlamydia in epidemiologic studies have not been established. Black women have increased rates of chlamydia and tubal factor infertility compared to white women, but have been underrepresented in prior studies {{of the association of}} chlamydia and tubal factor infertility. ObjectivesTo estimate the population <b>attributable</b> <b>fraction</b> of tubal factor infertility associated with Chlamydia trachomatis infection by race (black, non-black), and assess how different definitions of C. trachomatis seropositivity and tubal factor infertility affect population <b>attributable</b> <b>fraction</b> estimates. Study DesignWe conducted a case-control study, enrolling infertile women attending infertility practices in Birmingham, AL and Pittsburgh, PA during October 20122 ̆ 013 June 2015. Tubal factor infertility case status was primarily defined by unilateral or bilateral fallopian tube occlusion (cases) or bilateral fallopian tube patency (controls) on hysterosalpingogram. Alternate tubal factor infertility definitions incorporated history suggestive of tubal damage or were based on laparoscopic evidence of tubal damage. We aimed to enroll all eligible women, with an expected ratio of one and three controls per case for black and non-black women, respectively. We assessed C. trachomatis seropositivity with a commercial assay and a more sensitive research assay; our primary measure of seropositivity was defined as positivity on either assay. We estimated C. trachomatis seropositivity and calculated C. trachomatis-TFI odds ratios and population <b>attributable</b> <b>fraction,</b> stratified by race. ResultsWe enrolled 107 black women (47 cases, 60 controls) and 620 non-black women (140 cases, 480 controls). C. trachomatis seropositivity by either assay was 81...|$|E

40|$|Noise is {{the most}} {{frequent}} type of occupational exposure {{and can lead to}} both auditory and extra-auditory dysfunction as well as increasing the risk of work accidents. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate the <b>attributable</b> <b>fraction</b> of work accidents related to occupational noise exposure in a medium-sized city in Southeast Brazil. In this hospital-based case-control study, including 600 cases and 822 controls, the odds ratio of work accidents (controlled for several covariables) was obtained classifying occupational noise exposure into four levels and determining the prevalence at each level. Based on these data, the calculated <b>attributable</b> <b>fraction</b> was 0. 3041 (95 %CI: 0. 2341 - 0. 3676), i. e., 30 % of work accidents in the study area were statistically associated with occupational noise exposure.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: High blood pressure, blood glucose, serum cholesterol, and BMI are {{risk factors}} for {{cardiovascular}} diseases {{and some of these}} factors also increase the risk of chronic kidney disease and diabetes. We estimated mortality from cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes that was attributable to these four cardiometabolic {{risk factors for}} all countries and regions from 1980 to 2010. METHODS: We used data for exposure to risk factors by country, age group, and sex from pooled analyses of population-based health surveys. We obtained relative risks for the effects of risk factors on cause-specific mortality from meta-analyses of large prospective studies. We calculated the population <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> for each risk factor alone, and for the combination of all risk factors, accounting for multicausality and for mediation of the effects of BMI by the other three risks. We calculated attributable deaths by multiplying the cause-specific population <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> by the number of disease-specific deaths. We obtained cause-specific mortality from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2010 Study. We propagated the uncertainties of all the inputs to the final estimates. FINDINGS: In 2010, high blood pressure was the leading risk factor for deaths due to cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes in every region, causing more than 40...|$|R
40|$|Many human cancers {{develop as}} a result of {{exposure}} to risk factors related to the environment and ways of life. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> of 25 types of cancers resulting from exposure to modifiable risk factors in Brazil. The prevalence of exposure to selected risk factors among adults was obtained from population-based surveys conducted from 2000 to 2008. Risk estimates were based on data drawn from meta-analyses or large, high quality studies. Population-attributable fractions (PAF) for a combination of risk factors, as well as the number of preventable deaths and cancer cases, were calculated for 2020. The known preventable risk factors studied will account for 34 % of cancer cases among men and 35 % among women in 2020, and for 46 % and 39 % deaths, respectively. The highest <b>attributable</b> <b>fractions</b> were estimated for tobacco smoking, infections, low consumption of fruits and vegetables, excess weight, reproductive factors, and physical inactivity. This is the first study to systematically estimate the <b>fraction</b> of cancer <b>attributable</b> to potentially modifiable risk factors in Brazil. Strategies for primary prevention of tobacco smoking and control of infection and the promotion of a healthy diet and physical activity should be the main priorities in policies for cancer prevention in the country...|$|R
