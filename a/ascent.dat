5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} <b>ascent</b> {{is interrupted by}} stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire <b>ascent</b> {{is part of the}} decompression, and <b>ascent</b> rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting <b>ascent</b> rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful decompression {{is that the}} depth and <b>ascent</b> rate of the diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in depth and rate of <b>ascent,</b> but unless the decompression is being monitored in real time by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control depth and <b>ascent</b> rate, or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at the surface.|$|E

5|$|Bottom time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} the <b>ascent.</b> Bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final <b>ascent</b> at 10 metres per minute, and if the <b>ascent</b> rate is slower, then the whole of the <b>ascent</b> time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E
5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} <b>ascent</b> {{is interrupted by}} stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire <b>ascent</b> {{is part of the}} decompression, and <b>ascent</b> rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting <b>ascent</b> rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation. Staged decompression may include deep stops depending on the theoretical model used for calculating the <b>ascent</b> schedule. Omission of decompression theoretically required for a dive profile exposes the diver to significantly higher risk of symptomatic decompression sickness, and in severe cases, serious injury or death. The risk is related to the severity of exposure and the level of supersaturation of tissues in the diver. Procedures for emergency management of omitted decompression and symptomatic decompression sickness have been published. These procedures are generally effective, but vary in effectiveness from case to case.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast <b>ascent</b> interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. The <b>ascent</b> rate and the depth and duration of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process. The advantage of staged decompression {{is that it is}} far easier to monitor and control than continuous decompression.|$|E

5|$|Dive {{computers}} {{also provide}} a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. If the diver exceeds a no-decompression limit, decompression additional to the <b>ascent</b> rate will be necessary.

5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{also provides}} {{an explanation for}} the criticality of the initial <b>ascent</b> phase. Bubbles associated with symptoms are not necessarily generated on site. There is a growth process {{at the beginning of the}} <b>ascent</b> that may last for several cycles until the bubbles have reached a critical size when they are either filtered in the lung or stopped at the tissue level. It is postulated that the production of a shower of small arterial bubbles during the first minutes of the initial <b>ascent</b> is a precursor for DCS symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ascent</b> is an {{important}} part of the process of decompression, as this is the time when reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of critical importance to safe decompression that the <b>ascent</b> rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. <b>Ascent</b> rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum <b>ascent</b> rate compatible with the decompression model chosen. This will be specified in the decompression tables or the user manual for the decompression software or personal decompression computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from the specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. Failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase the risk of decompression sickness.|$|E
