50|$|A recent {{development}} is {{the release of a}} double studio album in which the two discs contain different mixes of the same tracks. An example is Shania Twain's Up!, which was sold with <b>a</b> pop-mix <b>disc</b> and <b>a</b> country-mix <b>disc</b> in North America, or <b>a</b> pop-mix <b>disc</b> and <b>a</b> filmi-mix <b>disc</b> internationally.|$|R
5|$|An {{intervertebral}} disc has a gelatinous core {{surrounded by a}} fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When <b>a</b> <b>disc</b> degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of <b>a</b> <b>disc</b> changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root. Any of these changes may result in back pain.|$|E
5|$|Stone carvings made of jade or serpentinite are in {{the form}} of {{ceremonial}} axe representing clan's strength and power. These were used to behead enemies during war and during ancestor celebrations known as Pilou. The bottom of the handle represents the particular clan and is embellished with stones and shells. The axe is polished smooth like <b>a</b> <b>disc.</b> Carvings made of soapstone are also popular.|$|E
5|$|The war then {{interrupted}} Ring's first-class career. Ring {{joined the}} Australian Army {{and served with}} an anti-aircraft regiment in New Guinea. During his military service he injured his back, displacing <b>a</b> <b>disc.</b> The injury flared up from time to time, especially in cold weather, and this affected his ability to bowl to a consistent length.|$|E

5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries <b>a</b> <b>disc</b> pallet.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Final Fantasy I, Uematsu {{remained}} with the series to compose the soundtrack to Final Fantasy II (1988). Although I and II were composed separately, music from the two games have only been released on albums together. These albums include a soundtrack album and two arranged albums. Final Fantasy III (1990) was released two years later and featured a soundtrack from Uematsu that has been lauded {{as one of the}} best soundtracks of any NES game. The soundtrack spawned two soundtrack albums, as well as <b>a</b> <b>disc</b> of vocal and orchestral arrangements.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} marine {{invertebrates}} which includes the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The basic unit of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by <b>a</b> <b>disc</b> with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.|$|E

5|$|Deathrow {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2219, where Blitz is the world's most popular sport. Players attempt to toss <b>a</b> <b>disc</b> through a hoop while {{avoiding}} full-contact from their opponents, including punches, kicks, throws, and stomps. Like a futuristic rugby, the sport combines elements of hockey, basketball, and full-contact American football. Critics compared the game's mechanics to Discs of Tron, Mortal Kombat, Blood Bowl, Final Fantasy Xs Blitzball, Blades of Steel, and Speedball, and its aesthetic to that of Blade Runner. The game's premise was also compared to the 1975 film Rollerball.|$|E

5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} <b>a</b> <b>disc</b> that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better {{outcomes}} at one year {{but not at}} four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown {{to result in a}} different outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, there is not enough evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1998 an {{optically}} thick dust shell obscured Sakurai's Object, causing a rapid decrease in visibility of the star, until in 1999 it disappeared from optical wavelength observations altogether. Infrared observations showed that the dust cloud around the star is primarily carbon in an amorphous form. In 2009 it was discovered that the dust shell is strongly asymmetrical, as <b>a</b> <b>disc</b> with a major axis oriented at an angle of 134°, and inclination of around 75°. The disc is thought to be growing more opaque due to the fast spectral evolution of the source towards lower temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Everett H. Kimmell, another U.S. Surveyor, {{found this}} newer stone had broken too and he {{replaced}} it with a brass disc marker set in cement.

The monument was completely rebuilt in 1992, and the 1931 brass marker was replaced with <b>a</b> <b>disc</b> shaped aluminum-bronze plate set in granite. The monument was again rebuilt in 2010, although the disc shaped plate from 1992 remained in place.|$|E
