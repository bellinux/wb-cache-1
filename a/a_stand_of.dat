5|$|After several {{seasons of}} {{struggling}} for runs, Kippax returned {{to form in}} 193334. Against Queensland at New Year, he hit 125 and shared <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 363 in only 135minutes with Bradman. Altogether, he made four centuries and averaged almost 72 to earn selection for the 1934 tour of England. Passed over for the vice-captaincy of the team in favour of Bradman, Kippax had the confidence of knowing that the Australian Board of Control had reached {{an agreement with the}} MCC that the Australians would not have to face Bodyline during the tour.|$|E

5|$|A second road in California {{was built}} by Horace Gasquet, who {{acquired}} <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> trees at the present site of Gasquet, California— where the North and Middle Forks of the Smith River converge— in 1857. In 1881, he began to build a corduroy road from what had become Gasquet Flats to the plank road at the state line near Oregon Mountain, shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps. Tolls were charged starting in 1882, and in 1887 the road was completed. Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along the Smith River {{to the mouth of}} the South Fork, including a suspension bridge across that waterway, and Del Norte County extended it along the Smith River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City Plank Road just east of Crescent City.|$|E

5|$|After {{five minutes}} on the final morning, Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket, thereby causing more uneven bounce and making the surface more likely to spin. The declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour the spin bowlers. However, Morris partnered Bradman in <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 301 in 217 minutes to set up the win, although they were helped by England’s fielders, who missed several catching and stumping chances. Harvey came to the crease at 3/396 and got off the mark by hitting the winning boundary.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia were {{struggling}} when Healy {{came to the}} crease with the score at 7/63 after 14.2 overs. Three wickets had fallen {{in the space of}} 16 balls, during which only three runs had been added, and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory. Healy then struck three fours, making 15 from 9 balls before being dismissed by Nicki Shaw, ending <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 23 from 13 balls with Sthalekar. However, Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{was given}} another life at 108 when he {{advanced}} two metres down the pitch to Jim Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 having added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed for 182, having partnered Bradman in <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 301 in 217 minutes. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. He struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling with eight runs still needed. Harvey {{came in and}} got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. This sealed an Australian victory by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 with 29 fours in only 255 minutes.|$|E

5|$|In the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, {{his last}} {{at his home}} ground, Loxton's 32 formed part of <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 84 with Hassett, the highest {{partnership}} in a closely fought, low-scoring game in which no team passed 200. He again failed in the second innings, scoring two as Australia scraped home by 28 runs. After contributing 17 {{in a total of}} 426 in the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, which Australia won by an innings to take an unassailable 3–0 series lead, he was dropped in favour of Jim Burke, who scored a century on debut. The Victorian never played Test cricket again.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{was given}} another life on 136, when Laker dropped him at square leg from the bowling of Compton. Bradman was given another life at 108; he {{advanced}} two metres down the pitch towards Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, after hitting a tired-looking shot to mid-off, having partnered Bradman for <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. Australia still needed 46 for victory, {{and went on}} to win by seven wickets with 15 minutes to spare, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Bradman installed Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown batted out of position at No. 6. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same positions. It was a chance for players from both sides to gain a psychological advantage, but Brown failed to capitalise. He came to the crease with the score at 4/280 to join Keith Miller and scored 26 in <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 63 before being dismissed as Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings. This was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, against Lancashire, a draw for which Brown was rested.|$|E

5|$|Australia were bowled out for 458 {{early on}} the fourth morning after the rest day, and England set about {{extending}} their lead, adding 129 for the first wicket, until both openers fell without further addition. In the meantime the workload on the Australian bowlers was heavy as Ernie Toshack had broken down in the first innings and unable to participate further. Edrich and Denis Compton took the score to 232/2 until a late collapse saw England reach stumps at 362/8. England batted on for two overs on the final day, declaring at 365/8. Bill Johnston was the most successful bowler with 4/95. This left Australia a target of 404 {{in less than a}} day, which would require a world record runchase, and allowed Yardley to use the heavy roller to break up the pitch, making batting even harder for the tourists. Most observers predicted an easy England win on a deteriorating surface. Australia started slowly, and Bradman joined Morris at 57/1 with 347 runs still needed in 257 minutes. They put together <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 301 in only 217 minutes, aided by erratic bowling, several missed catches and stumpings to help Australia to a win by seven wickets with 15 minutes remaining. Morris made 182 while Bradman was unbeaten on 173. The England selectors were heavily criticised after the match for failing to include a leg spinner in the team to exploit the favourable conditions. For the third time in a row, the match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Hamence earned {{selection}} for the match against Northamptonshire, batting at No. 4 and scoring 34; he partnered acting captain Hassett in <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 104 {{for the third}} wicket. He took 1/11 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings. In the second match before the Second Test, which was against Yorkshire, Hamence made 48 and six not out, and took a total of 1/17 as the game ended in a draw. He batted slowly and cautiously; Bradman gave him few opportunities, {{so he had to}} make the most of them. The first innings 48 was a determined performance on a sticky wicket that helped Australia to 249; Bradman felt that Hamence's grit was a notable factor in Australia managing to pass 200. Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener. This was enough for Brown to retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Australia went on to a crushing win by 409 runs but Brown made only 24 and 32.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{was given}} another life on 136 when Laker dropped him while fielding at square leg from Compton's bowling. Bradman was given another life at 108 when he {{advanced}} two metres down the pitch to Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity with the batsman {{far out of}} his ground. Australia reached tea at 292/1 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, after hitting a tired-looking shot to mid-off, having partnered Bradman in <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in a 290-minute innings. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. Miller struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling lbw to Cranston with eight runs still needed. Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. Australia had won by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test runchase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes of batting with 29 fours.|$|E

5|$|This {{extremely}} long-tracked EF4 tornado {{touched down}} near Raleigh, Mississippi, in Smith County at 5:42p.m. CDT (2242 UTC), and {{continued into the}} Uniontown, Alabama area before dissipating. The tornado initially downed trees, blew skirting from mobile homes, and tore shingles from roofs. The tornado intensified as it moved northeast across Smith County and produced up to EF2 and EF3 damage. One mobile home was picked up, bounced a couple times, and thrown into a tree line, where it was torn apart and debris was scattered up to a mile away, including the frame. The tornado mowed down <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> pine trees and destroyed two frame houses, with major damage to the interior walls, and the exterior walls completely destroyed. Many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed as well. It then moved into Jasper County and snapped and debarked many pine trees. The first area of EF4 damage was observed near Louin as a frame home and several mobile homes were completely destroyed, with parts of the mobile homes being thrown long distances, {{and some of the}} frame home foundation being swept clean. The tornado caused significant damage to a poultry farm and cattle ranch before it weakened briefly. It then destroyed two mobile homes and caused extensive tree and power line damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF1-strength tree and power line damage for several miles, until re-intensifying near to EF3 strength near Rose Hill.|$|E
5|$|Upon resumption, Morris {{severely}} attacked Compton, who {{had been}} bowling {{in an attempt to}} exploit the spin, aided by a series of full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs. This prompted Yardley to take the new ball and replace Compton with pacemen. Australia reached 202, halfway to the required total, with 165 minutes left. When Bradman suffered a fibrositis attack, Morris had to shield him from the strike until it subsided. Morris passed his century, and was then given another life on 126 when Laker dropped him while fielding at square leg. Bradman was given another life at 108 when Evans missed a stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 288/1 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 167 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, having partnered Bradman in <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>of</b> 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. He struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling to Cranston with eight runs still needed. Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. Australia had won by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes with 29 fours. The attendance of 158,000 was the highest for any cricket match on English soil and the takings were 34,000 pounds. The attendance remains a record for a Test in England.|$|E
