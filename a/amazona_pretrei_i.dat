40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a list of}} 169 bird species registered at the "RPPN da UNISC", Private Natural Heritage in Sinimbu municipality, Rio Grande do Sul state. The survey was carried out between January 2007 and January 2009. Five species were highlighted as being most threatened with extinction in the state: Odontophorus capueira, Patagioenas cayennensis, <b>Amazona</b> <b>pretrei,</b> Triclaria malachitacea and Grallaria varia. One of them, <b>Amazona</b> <b>pretrei,</b> was also threatened on a national and global level, and eight species, were classified as near-threatened globally (Triclaria malachitacea, Strix hylophila, Picumnus nebulosus, Piculus aurulentus, Carpornis cucullata, Leptasthenura setaria, Cyanocorax caeruleus and Euphonia chalybea). The occurrence of four species was previously unknown in the region (Pulsatrix koeniswaldiana, Trogon rufus, Myiopagis viridicata and Turdus leucomelas) {{and the presence of}} six rare or rarely-registered species for Rio Grande do Sul state (Accipiter striatus, Geranospiza caerulescens, Micrastur semitorquatus, Chamaeza ruficauda, Macropsalis forcipata and Muscipripa vetula) was also verified. These records, in conjunction with other surveys conducted in the central escarpment of the Planalto, show high diversity of bird life, albeit unprotected {{due to the lack of}} conservation areas, environmental policies and fiscalization...|$|R

40|$|A flora entérica dos psitacídeos é composta principalmente por bactérias Gram positivas. Bactérias Gram negativas, como Escherichia coli e Salmonella spp., apresentam elevado potencial patogênico, sendo consideradas indicativo de problemas de manejo, que poderão culminar em manifestação de doenças em decorrência de fatores estressantes, dietas deficientes e superlotação, combinados com alta carga bacteriana no ambiente. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a presença de Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli e os fatores de virulência dos genes iss e iutA dos isolados de E. coli. Analisou-se um total de 44 amostras provenientes de psitacídeos criados em cativeiro, sendo estas 15 fragmentos de órgãos de aves submetidas a exame de necropsia e também 29 amostras de swabs de cloaca e inglúvio de papagaios-charão (<b>Amazona</b> <b>pretrei)</b> criados em cativeiro. Nenhuma amostra foi positiva para Salmonella spp. Nas amostras de E. coli detectou-se ambos os fatores de virulência pesquisados. The enteric flora of psittacines {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of Gram positive bacteria. Gram negative bacteria, like Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp., {{have a high}} pathogenic potential and can be considerate as an indicative of management problems that may culminate in disease manifestation due to stress factors, poor diets and overcrowding, in combination with a high bacterial load on the environment. The objective {{of this study was}} evaluated the presence of Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli and the virulence genes iss and iutA from E. coli isolates. Forty-four samples were analyzed from psittacines living in captivity, which fifteen samples were from organs fragments of necropsied birds, and twenty-nine were from cloacal and crop swabs of red-spectacled parrots (<b>Amazona</b> <b>pretrei)</b> keeping in captivity. No samples were positive for Salmonella spp. In the samples in which E. coli was detected, both virulence factors (genes iss and iutA) were present...|$|R
40|$|Most ornithological fieldworks in {{the state}} of Santa Catarina {{concentrate}} on the eastern half of state, while the middle-west lacks information. Between March 2000 and May 2002 a bird inventory was made in the influence areas of the hydroelectric power plants of Machadinho and Barra Grande, along the right banks of the Uruguai and Pelotas rivers, on Santa Catarina State territory. We carried out ad libitum surveys, point count sampling, and capture with mist nets. We present seventy-two noteworthy records for Santa Catarina, including three new occurrences for the state (Cypseloides senex, Polioptila dumicola e Procacicus solitarius), three species whose available information was only in general bibliography (<b>Amazona</b> <b>pretrei,</b> Ramphastos toco e Capsiempis flaveola), four whose records are the first in the last 40 years (Megascops sanctaecatarinae, Macropsalis forcipata Phyllomyias virescens e Corytops delalandi), and 63 species first cited for the eastern section of the Uruguai river valley...|$|R
40|$|Alimentary {{habits of}} {{free-living}} Psittaciformes vary significantly among different species. <b>Amazona</b> <b>pretrei</b> is under risk of extinction and has very specific free-living dietary habits, {{which are based}} on Parana pine seeds. Hemosiderosis is a pathologic process characterized by intracellular accumulation of iron without other evident lesions. It is associated with increased prevalence of infections, neoplasms, and hepatopathies. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify hepatic hemosiderin deposits in captive A. pretrei and verify their association with nutritional parameters. Liver samples were processed for histopathology and stained with Prussian blue. The sections were analyzed by computerized morphometry to quantify the hepatic hemosiderin deposits. The hepatic hemosiderosis rates showed positive correlation with age and time in captivity. These results suggest that the menus and commercial rations for Psittacidae must be carefully revised.

40|$|Over 70 % of {{threatened}} {{birds in the}} state of Rio Grande do Sul, south Brazil, inhabit forest environments. The creation and maintenance of protected areas {{is one of the most}} important measures aiming to mitigate these problems. However, the knowledge of the local biodiversity is essential so that these areas can effectively preserve the natural resources. Between 2004 and 2009 we sampled the avifauna in two conservation units in Rio Grande do Sul: Floresta Nacional de Canela (FNC) and Parque Natural Municipal da Ronda (PMR), both representative of the Mixed Humid Forest (Araucaria Forest). A total of 224 species was recorded, 116 at FNC and 201 at PMR, ten of which threatened regionally: Pseudastur polionotus, Odontophorus capueira, Patagioenas cayennensis, <b>Amazona</b> <b>pretrei,</b> A. vinacea, Triclaria malachitacea, Campephilus robustus, Grallaria varia, Procnias nudicollis and Sporophila melanogaster. Richness and species composition seem to be related to different stages of forest conservation, to size and connectivity, as well as to the diversity of environments. The better conservation of PMR compared to FNC, allied to its geographic position, results in a richer avifauna, with a larger amount of rare and endangered species, as well as species sensitive to disturbance and endemic to the Atlantic Rainforest. We suggest management actions aiming the conservation and the long-term recovery of natural environments at these sites...|$|R
