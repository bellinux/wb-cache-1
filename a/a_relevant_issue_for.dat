In this paper we present a languageindependent probabilistic model which can automatically generate stemmers for several different languages. The variety of word forms makes the match between the end user’s words and the document words impossible even if they refer to the same concept - this mismatch degrades retrieval performance. Stemmers can improve the retrieval effectiveness, but the design and the implementation of stemmers requires a laborious amount of effort. The proposed model describes the mutual reinforcement relationship between stems and derivations and then provides a probabilistic interpretation of it. A series of experiments shows that the stemmers generated by the probabilistic model are as effective as the ones based on linguistic knowledge...|$|R

Then, we build an imperfect information model of corruption and political accountability to study if the influence local elites may have on the allocation of public resources can explain this outcome. We find that not only the power of the elites but also other unexpected factors matter. In particular, both the existence of regions with a relatively weak accountability sector and the design of decentralization and grants can also explain the lack of success of decentralization in combating corruption in these economies.
