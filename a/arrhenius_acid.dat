50|$|Acidic oxides are not <b>Arrhenius</b> <b>acids</b> {{because they}} do not donate protons; they are not Brønsted-Lowry acids {{because they do}} not {{increase}} the hydrogen ion concentration of water. However, they are Lewis acids, because they accept electron pairs from some Lewis bases, most notably base anhydrides.|$|R

50|$|In the <b>Arrhenius</b> theory <b>acids</b> {{are defined}} as {{substances}} which dissociate in aqueous solution to give H+ (hydrogen ions). Bases {{are defined as}} substances which dissociate in aqueous solution to give OH− (hydroxide ions).|$|R
50|$|Aqueous <b>Arrhenius</b> <b>acids</b> have {{characteristic}} properties which provide a practical description of an acid. Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste, can turn blue litmus red, and react with bases and certain metals (like calcium) to form salts. The word acid {{is derived from}} the Latin acidus/acēre meaning sour. An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid' (as in 'dissolved in acid'), while the strict definition refers only to the solute. A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution. Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{example of}} this is found in physics, where the Bohr model of atomic {{electron}} shells is still often used to introduce atomic structure before moving on to more complex models based on matrix mechanics; and in chemistry, where the <b>Arrhenius</b> definitions of <b>acids</b> and bases are often introduced, followed (in a manner similar to the historical development of the model) by the Brønsted-Lowry definitions and then the Lewis definitions.|$|R

50|$|The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius {{attributed}} {{the properties of}} acidity to hydrogen ions (H+) or protons in 1884. An <b>Arrhenius</b> <b>acid</b> is a substance that, when added to water, increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water. Note that chemists often write H+(aq) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a proton, does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, H3O+. Thus, an <b>Arrhenius</b> <b>acid</b> can also {{be described as a}} substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water. Examples include molecular substances such as HCl and acetic acid.|$|E
50|$|Due to this equilibrium, any {{increase}} in the concentration of hydronium {{is accompanied by a}} decrease in the concentration of hydroxide. Thus, an <b>Arrhenius</b> <b>acid</b> could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration, while an Arrhenius base increases it.|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} and {{mechanism of}} oxidation of paracetamol (PAM) by sodium N-bromobenzenesulphonamide (bromamine-B or BAB) {{have been investigated}} in NaOH medium at 298 K. The rate shows first order in BAB, zero order in PAM, and fractional order in NaOH. Addition reaction product, benzenesulphonamide, retards the reaction rate. The dielectric effect is positive. Variation of ionic strength of the medium and addition of halide ions have no {{significant effect on the}} rate. The solvent isotope effect was studied using D 2 O. The reaction fails to induce the polymerisation of acrylonitrile. Composite activation parameters for the reaction have been determined from the <b>Arrhenius</b> plot. Hypobromous <b>acid</b> (HOBr) is assumed to be the reactive oxidant species. 4 -amino- 2, 6 -dibromophenol was identified as the oxidation product of PAM. A mechanism consistent with the observed kinetic data has been proposed and discussed...|$|R
50|$|The second {{category}} of acids are Lewis acids, which form a covalent bond with an electron pair. An example is boron trifluoride (BF3), whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a {{lone pair of electrons}} on an atom in a base, {{for example the}} nitrogen atom in ammonia (NH3). Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons (H+) into the solution, which then accept electron pairs. However, hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Brønsted-Lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids. Conversely, many Lewis <b>acids</b> are not <b>Arrhenius</b> or Brønsted-Lowry <b>acids.</b> In modern terminology, an acid is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid.|$|R
40|$|Eggshell of the African Ostrich, Struthio camelus, {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} African archaeological sites, {{some of which}} are beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating. In order to date those sites beyond the range of ¹⁴C dating using amino acid geochemistry, an understanding of the reaction kinetics governing amino acid chemistry must be achieved. The integrity of the eggshell matrix provides an excellent medium to investigate the kinetics of protein hydrolysis, amino acid decomposition, and isoleucine epimerization. Mathematical equations are derived from high temperature simulations of time and well-dated sites at ambient temperatures to determine rate constants for the reactions to a D/L ratio of 1. 0. The reactions studied are Free and Total isoleucine epimerization, "classical" and "extended" hydrolysis, and the change in concentrations of free, bound, and total amino <b>acids.</b> <b>Arrhenius</b> plots aided in deriving the equations for each method which are then applied to predict kinetic parameters. Temperatures can be predicted within a 2 °C range and time within 15 % of its actual value if the appropriate method is used...|$|R
50|$|The first {{category}} of acids is the proton donors or Brønsted acids. In the special case of aqueous solutions, proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and {{are known as}} Arrhenius acids. Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents. A Brønsted or <b>Arrhenius</b> <b>acid</b> usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+.|$|E
50|$|Both {{theories}} easily {{describe the}} first reaction: CH3COOH {{acts as an}} <b>Arrhenius</b> <b>acid</b> because it acts {{as a source of}} H3O+ when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Brønsted acid by donating a proton to water. In the second example CH3COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH3), but does not relate to the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium. Nevertheless, CH3COOH is both an Arrhenius and a Brønsted-Lowry acid.|$|E

Microfiche. xix, 189 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThis work describes {{studies of}} the kinetics and mechanism for the autocatalytic dehydration of tert-butanol in near-critical water at 225 °C, 34. 5 MPa and 250 °C, 34. 5 MPa. Two tasks were performed in this study. First, to identify the mechanism for the autocatalytic dehydration of tert-butanol; second, to study the temperature effect to verify the mechanism. Experiments were conducted on two flow reactors which perform as plug flow reactors. At 225 °C, 34. 5 MPa and 250 °C, 34. 5 MPa, tert-butanol undergoes rapid and selective dehydration to isobutene without any catalyst in near-critical water. Four different models were postulated and tested. The kinetics of the dehydration reaction are consistent with an autocatalytic E 1 mechanism with ether formation and decomposition. In this mechanism, tert-butanol plays three different roles: 1) dissociates as <b>Arrhenius</b> <b>acid</b> with catalytic acid/conjugate base pair H 3 O+/H 2 O; 2) acts as Bronsted acid with catalytic acid/conjugate base pair (CH 3) 3 COH/(CH 3) 3 CO; 3) acts as alcohol which suffers dehydration. The autocatalytic E 2 model with ether formation and decomposition, water catalytic E 1 model with ether formation and decomposition, and a simplified autocatalytic E 1 model without ether formation and decomposition are {{not consistent with the}} experiment measurements. The dissociation of tert-butanol as an acid in water is an endothermic reaction. The standard enthalpy and entropy associated with this reaction were found to be: ΔH°= 142 kJ/mol, ΔS°= 82 J/moI. K. The dehydration of tert-butanol is also an endothermic reaction, high temperature favors the conversion of tert-butanol to isobutene. The values of the standard entropy of activation associated with the elementary rate constant of the autocatalytic E 1 model with ether formation and decomposition are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Kinetics of {{oxidation}} of isoniazid (INH) by sodium hypohalites NaOX (X=Cl or Br) {{has been}} investigated at 303 K in NaOH medium. Under comparable experimental conditions the oxidation behaviour is similar with both the oxidants with first order dependence of rate each on [NaOX] and [INH] and fractional order on [OH]. Variation of ionic strength or dielectric constant of the medium {{does not have any}} effect on the reaction while the addition of halide ions slightly retards the rate. The reaction fails to induce polymerisation of acrylonitrile. The rate increases in D 2 O medium and the inverse solvent isotope effect k(D 2 O) /k (H 2 O) is around 1. 52. Proton inventory studies have been made in H 2 O - D 2 O mixtures. Activation parameters for the reaction have been computed from the <b>Arrhenius</b> plots. Isonicotinic <b>acid</b> has been identified as the oxidation product of INH, by CC-MS. Under identical experimental conditions the rate of oxidatian of INH is found to be higher with NaOBr than NaOCl by a factor of 3. The proposed reaction mechanism and the derived the law are consistent with the observed kinetics...|$|R
