50|$|Crampton {{realised}} {{that the}} locomotives of the GWR {{were better than}} the standard gauge locomotives {{for a number of}} reasons. The broad gauge <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> larger boiler diameter and higher centre of gravity for the same stability. Broad gauge also <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> bigger firebox and heating area.

5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only <b>allowing</b> <b>a</b> constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E
5|$|According to archaeological {{and genetic}} evidence, North and South America {{were the last}} continents {{in the world with}} human habitation. During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska). Alaska was {{ice-free}} because of low snowfall, <b>allowing</b> <b>a</b> small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.|$|E

On August 25, Greinke struck out 15 batters, breaking Mark Gubicza's team record for strikeouts in a single game. On August 30, Greinke had a one-hit complete game against the Seattle Mariners.|$|E
