5|$|His 1952 {{paper on}} the subject, {{together}} with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery and Leo Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean group is a Lie group. Gleason's contribution was to prove that this is true when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this property. As Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that monotonic functions are differentiable <b>almost</b> <b>everywhere.</b> On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper of Montgomery and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed some technical side conditions from Gleason's proof.|$|E
5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual. He was gay, and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee, who accompanied him <b>almost</b> <b>everywhere</b> that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from <b>almost</b> <b>everywhere</b> on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to see it, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E

In this paper, we describe a method that allows to build triangular meshes that are better suited for recombination into quadrangles. This is performed by using the infinity norm to compute distances in the meshing process. The alignment of the elements in the frontal Delaunay procedure is controlled by a cross field defined on the domain.

30|$|At {{negative}} temperature like‐sign vortices tend to cluster {{very rapidly}} by the violent relaxation and make two clumps exclusively {{consisting of the}} same‐sign vortices. The self‐rotation time scale of the clumps is approximately T∼ 10. At {{the beginning of the}} simulation, the clumps form within the time scale of T∼ 10 which is regarded as the time scale of the violent relaxation. After the violent relaxation, the clump distribution quasi‐statically maintains up to T= 200 which {{is the end of the}} simulation. On the other hand, at positive temperature both types of vortices spread over the circular area uniformly. There is no rapid relaxation process as the value of the stream function is almost zero due to the uniform and symmetric distributions of the positive and negative vortices. Thus, the induced velocity is <b>almost</b> zero <b>everywhere</b> in the circular domain.|$|R

The framework aims in real-time to point out individuals who act according to a suspicious pattern across these locations. The system works in large-scale scenarios. We present two scenarios to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework. The goal in the first scenario is to point out individuals who visited a sequence of airports, using face recognition algorithms. The goal in the second scenario is to point out individuals who called a set of phones, using speaker recognition algorithms. Theoretical performance analysis and simulation results show a high overall accuracy of our system in real-time. ...|$|R
