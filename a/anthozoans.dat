5|$|Unlike {{other members}} of this phylum, <b>anthozoans</b> {{do not have a}} medusa stage in their development. Instead, they release sperm and eggs into the water. After fertilisation, the planula larvae form part of the plankton. When fully developed, the larvae settle on the seabed and attach to the substrate, {{undergoing}} metamorphosis into polyps. Some <b>anthozoans</b> can also reproduce asexually through budding or by breaking in pieces. More than 6,100 species have been described.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anthozoans</b> are carnivores, {{catching}} prey {{with their}} tentacles. Many species supplement their energy needs by {{making use of}} photosynthetic single-celled algae that live within their tissues. These species live in shallow water and many are reef-builders. Other species lack the zooxanthellae and, having no need for well-lit areas, typically live in deep-water locations.|$|E
5|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} the related tube-dwelling anemones. Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids look {{very similar to}} sea anemones, but belong to an entirely different subclass of <b>anthozoans.</b> They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which are made of a fibrous material, which is made from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|E

5|$|In {{molecular}} phylogenetics analyses from 2005 onwards, important {{groups of}} developmental genes {{show the same}} variety in cnidarians as in chordates. In fact cnidarians, and especially <b>anthozoans</b> (sea anemones and corals), retain some genes that are present in bacteria, protists, plants and fungi but not in bilaterians.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other cnidarians, anemones (and other <b>anthozoans)</b> entirely {{lack the}} free-swimming medusal stage of their lifecycle; the polyp {{produces}} eggs and sperm, and the fertilized egg develops into a planula larva which develops directly into another polyp. Both sexual and asexual reproduction can occur.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>anthozoans</b> are {{unisexual}} {{but some}} stony corals are hermaphrodite. The germ cells {{originate in the}} endoderm {{and move to the}} gastrodermis where they differentiate. When mature, they are liberated into the coelenteron and thence to the open sea, with fertilisation being external. To make fertilisation more likely, corals emit vast numbers of gametes, and many species synchronise their release in relation to the time of day and the phase of the moon.|$|E
5|$|These are all corals and {{correspond}} to the fossil record time line. With readily-preserved hard calcareous skeletons, they comprise the majority of <b>Anthozoan</b> fossils.|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial genes {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in population genetic and phylogeographical analyses, {{in part due to}} a high rate of nucleotide substitution in animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Nucleotide sequences of <b>anthozoan</b> mitochondrial genes, however, are virtually invariant among conspecifics, even at third codon positions of protein-coding sequences. Hence, mtDNA markers are of limited use for population-level studies in these organisms. Mitochondrial gene sequence divergence among <b>anthozoan</b> species is also low relative to that exhibited in other animals, although higher level relationships can be resolved with these markers. Substitution rates in <b>anthozoan</b> nuclear genes are much higher than in mitochondrial genes, whereas nuclear genes in other metazoans usually evolve more slowly than, or similar to, mitochondrial genes. Although several mechanisms accounting for a slow rate of sequence evolution have been proposed, there is not yet a definitive explanation for this observation. Slow evolution and unique characteristics may be common in primitive metazoans, suggesting that patterns of mtDNA evolution in these organisms differ from that in other animal systems...|$|R
50|$|Corynactis annulata, the {{strawberry}} anemone, {{is a bright}} pink colonial <b>anthozoan</b> similar in body form to sea anemones and scleractinian stony corals. Unlike the true sea anemones, this species is a colonial animal of the order Corallimorpharia.|$|R
5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} marine {{invertebrates}} which includes the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Adult <b>anthozoans</b> are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The basic unit of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>anthozoans</b> are {{colonial and}} consist of {{multiple}} polyps {{with a common}} origin joined together by living material. The simplest arrangement is where a stolon runs along the substrate in a two dimensional lattice with polyps budding off at intervals. Alternatively, polyps may bud off from a sheet of living tissue, the coenosarc, which joins the polyps and anchors the colony to the substrate. The coenosarc may consist of a thin membrane from which the polyps project, as in most stony corals, or a thick fleshy mass in which the polyps are immersed apart from their oral discs, as in the soft corals.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of <b>Anthozoans</b> is {{not clearly}} understood {{and a number}} of different models have been proposed. Within the Hexacorallia, the sea anemones, coral anemones and stony corals may constitute a monophyletic grouping united by their six-fold symmetry and cnidocyte trait. The Octocorallia appears to be monophyletic, and primitive members of this group may have been stolonate. The cladogram presented here comes from a 2014 study by Stampar et al. which was based on the divergence of mitochondrial DNA within the group and on nuclear markers.|$|E
50|$|The Cape {{zoanthid}} {{is a small}} colonial, anemone-like <b>anthozoan.</b> It {{grows up}} to 0.5cm across. It has an upright hollow columnar body with a tentacle-ringed mouth. It is orange to pink with a few spiky tentacles and a sand coated body column.|$|R

50|$|Zoanthus sociatus has nematocysts, {{which makes}} it a cnidarian. As it has polyp morphology, it is an <b>anthozoan.</b> It also has tentacles in {{multiples}} of 6, so it falls under the subclass Hexacorallia. It is in the order Zoanthidea due to its lack of a calcium carbonate skeleton.|$|R
5|$|<b>Anthozoans</b> are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less than half a centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anthozoans</b> exhibit {{great powers}} of regeneration; lost parts swiftly regrow {{and the sea}} anemone Aiptasia pallida can be vivisected in the {{laboratory}} {{and then returned to}} the aquarium where it will heal. They are capable of a variety of asexual means of reproduction including fragmentation, longitudinal and transverse fission and budding. Sea anemones for example can crawl across a surface leaving behind them detached pieces of the pedal disc which develop into new clonal individuals. Anthopleura species divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and patterning. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing on the column before the sea anemone tears itself apart. Zoanthids are capable of budding off new individuals.|$|E
5|$|With longitudinal, {{transverse}} and radial muscles, polyps {{are able}} to elongate and shorten, bend and twist, inflate and deflate, and extend and contract their tentacles. Most polyps extend to feed and contract when disturbed, often invaginating their oral discs and tentacles into the column. Contraction is achieved by pumping fluid out of the coelenteron, and reflation by drawing it in, a task performed by the siphonoglyphs in the pharynx which are lined with beating cilia. Most <b>anthozoans</b> adhere to the substrate with their pedal discs but some {{are able to}} detach themselves and move about, while others burrow into the sediment. Movement may be a passive drifting with the currents {{or in the case}} of sea anemones, may involve creeping along a surface on their base.|$|E
50|$|The {{strawberry}} anemone (Actinia fragacea) is an <b>Anthozoan</b> of {{the order}} Actiniaria, a sea anemone, that occurs from Norway to Africa, including adjacent islands (Azores, Canary Islands and Cape Verde) and the Mediterranean. It is generally found on rocks of the lower shoreline and depths up to 8 - 10 m.|$|R
5000|$|Isozoanthus sulcatus {{is a small}} colonial, anemone-like <b>anthozoan.</b> The polyps grow to 2 mm in {{diameter}} and are found in patches which are typically about 50 mm across.

40|$|Organisms {{commonly}} {{respond to}} infectious agents via effector arms of immune systems. However, whereas innate immunity in vertebrates has been intensely investigated, we still strive {{to understand how}} cnidarians’ immunity operates, consulting literature that is rife with unsubstantiated statements. Here I contend that the striking superficial similarities with regard to some vertebrate genes promote the false notion that considers vertebrate’s and cnidarian’s immunities as homologous. This is enhanced by intermingling allorecognition with host-parasite interactions and by synthetic comparisons of anthozoans-vertebrates putative immune genes. As complex as it is, cnidarian’s historecognition is probably not associated with host-parasite/disease responses and studies on <b>anthozoan</b> host-parasite interactions are not yet supported by underlying mechanisms. Therefore, I demarcate allorecognition from other aspects of <b>anthozoan</b> immunity and discuss the lack of research studies on the anecdotally recorded <b>anthozoan</b> phagocytes. Further attention {{is given to the}} roles of ‘non-immunological defenses’, stand-alone defense mechanisms that respond to environmental assaults independently of immunity, also mistakenly regarded as revealing immune properties. Because defining immunity in the Anthozoa remains deficient, reflecting the needs for improved distinction between historecognition and host-response/disease disciplines, it is required to establish an accepted synthesis for what immunity in cnidarians is or is not, and to evaluate changes in immunocompetence through quantitative approaches. Following the current state-of-the-art on cnidarian immunity, six counsels for re-evaluating immune criteria are offered...|$|R
5|$|Coral reefs form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both <b>Anthozoans</b> (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>anthozoans</b> are {{opportunistic}} predators, catching prey which drifts {{within reach}} of their tentacles. The prey is secured {{with the help of}} sticky mucus, spirocysts (non-venomous harpoon cells) and nematocysts (venomous harpoon cells). The tentacles then bend to push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia to the tip of the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can stretch to accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with mucus and slowly swallowed by peristalsis and ciliary action. When the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by the discharge of the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by phagocytosis by the gastrodermal cells that line the cavity.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} of a stony coral in the order Scleractinia is secreted by the epidermis of {{the lower part of}} the polyp; this forms a corallite, a cup-shaped hollow made of calcium carbonate, in which the polyp sits. In colonial corals, following growth of the polyp by budding, new corallites are formed, with the surface of the skeleton being covered by a layer of coenosarc. These colonies adopt a range of massive, branching, leaf-like and encrusting forms. Soft corals in the subclass Octocorallia are also colonial and have a skeleton formed of mesogloeal tissue, often reinforced with calcareous spicules or horny material, and some have rod-like supports internally. Other <b>anthozoans,</b> such as sea anemones, are naked; these rely on a hydrostatic skeleton for support. Some of these species have a sticky epidermis to which sand grains and shell fragments adhere, and zoanthids incorporate these substances into their mesogloea.|$|E

5000|$|The {{basic body}} {{form of an}} <b>anthozoan</b> is the polyp. This {{consists}} of a tubular column topped by a flattened area, the oral disc, with a central mouth; a whorl of tentacles surrounds the mouth.

5|$|The {{sea onion}} Paranthus rapiformis lives on subtidal mud flats and burrows into the sediment, holding itself {{in place by}} {{expanding}} its basal disc to form an anchor. If it gets washed out of its burrow by strong currents, it contracts into a pearly glistening ball which rolls about. Tube-dwelling anemones which live in parchment-like tubes, are in the <b>anthozoan</b> subclass Ceriantharia, and are only distantly related to sea anemones.|$|R
500|$|Most <b>anthozoans</b> {{supplement}} their predation by incorporating into their tissues certain unicellular, photosynthetic organisms known as zooxanthellae (or zoochlorellae {{in a few}} instances); many fulfil {{the bulk of their}} nutritional requirements in this way. In this symbiotic relationship, the zooxanthellae benefit by using nitrogenous waste and carbon dioxide produced by the host while the cnidarian gains photosynthetic capability and increased production of calcium carbonate, a substance of great importance to stony corals. The presence of zooxanthellae is not a permanent relationship. Under some circumstances, the symbionts can be expelled, and other species may later move in to take their place. The behaviour of the anthozoan can also be affected, with it choosing to settle in a well lit spot, and competing with its neighbours for light to allow photosynthesis to take place. Where an anthozoan lives in a cave or other dark location, the symbiont may be absent in a species that, in a sunlit location, normally benefits from one. <b>Anthozoans</b> living at depths greater than [...] are azooxanthellate because there is insufficient light for photosynthesis.|$|E
500|$|Many cnidarians {{are limited}} to shallow waters because they depend on endosymbiotic algae for much of their nutrients. The life cycles of most have polyp stages, which {{are limited to}} {{locations}} that offer stable substrates. Nevertheless, major cnidarian groups contain species that have escaped these limitations. Hydrozoans have a worldwide range: some, such as Hydra, live in freshwater; Obelia appears in the coastal waters of all the oceans; and Liriope can form large shoals near the surface in mid-ocean. Among <b>anthozoans,</b> a few scleractinian corals, sea pens and sea fans live in deep, cold waters, and some sea anemones inhabit polar seabeds while others live near hydrothermal vents over [...] below sea-level. Reef-building corals are limited to tropical seas between 30°N and 30°S with a maximum depth of , temperatures between [...] and [...] high salinity and low carbon dioxide levels.

5|$|<b>Anthozoan</b> larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them.
