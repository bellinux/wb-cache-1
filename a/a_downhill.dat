5|$|British and Soviet ballistic-missile {{submarines}} are mysteriously disappearing. James Bond—MI6 agent 007—is {{summoned to}} investigate. On {{the way to}} his briefing, Bond escapes an ambush by Soviet agents in Austria, killing their leader during <b>a</b> <b>downhill</b> ski chase. The plans for a highly advanced submarine tracking system are being offered in Egypt. There, he encounters Major Anya Amasova—KGB agent Triple X—his rival to recover the microfilm plans. They travel across Egypt together, encountering Jaws – a tall assassin with razor sharp steel teeth – along the way. Bond and Amasova reluctantly join forces after a truce is agreed by their respective British and Soviet superiors. They identify the person responsible for the thefts as the shipping tycoon and scientist Karl Stromberg.|$|E
5|$|Neuner {{suffered}} further setbacks at the 2009 World Championships in Pyeongchang, {{where she}} struggled {{with a cold}} and {{a high number of}} shooting errors. She finished eighth in the sprint, in which she crashed on <b>a</b> <b>downhill</b> slope, and came in eleventh in the pursuit race. She was not appointed for the individual race and could not start in the mixed relay due to her cold. On 21 February 2009, Neuner claimed silver as part Germany's women's relay team, alongside Martina Beck, Andrea Henkel and Kati Wilhelm. On {{the last day of the}} championships, she came in seventh in the mass start race.|$|E

50|$|According {{to the law}} it {{is illegal}} to ride in the forests.

Plans have recently been announced for the construction of <b>a</b> purpose built <b>downhill</b> facility near Glenflesk in County Kerry. It will be the second highest downhill course in Europe.|$|R
5|$|As of 2010, {{the company}} had a revenue of NOK56 million, up NOK10 million from 2009, {{yielding}} a profit of NOK2 million. The company employed between 51 and 55 people, it is based at Håkons Hall and is entirely owned by Lillehammer Municipality. The company's revenue comes {{from a series of}} sources, the most important being events and tourists. At Lysgårdsbakken, the company operates a chairlift and viewing platform {{at the top of the}} tower, as well as <b>a</b> <b>downhill</b> and bobsleigh simulator. The company tailors events to companies with various activities at the hill, including a ceremony to light to Olympic Flame. Kanthaugen and its lift is rented out for tobogganing. The sledding track serves groups and tourists with activities such as wheelbob and for-man bobsleigh with an authorized pilot, bobrafting, skeleton and skeleton rafting. Next to the track is an activity park with activities such as snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle tracks.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Marine artillerymen of the 2nd Battalion, 13th Marines Regiment were {{supposed}} to support the Ngok Tavak garrison, their arrival created significant logistical issues for Captain White. Due to the poor condition of the road that connected Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức, {{where most of the}} ammunition was stocked, the Marines had to rely on transport aircraft to bring in ammunition supplies. However, due to high demand and scarce resources, the U.S. 1st Marine Aircraft Wing simply did not have the flexibility to provide the support required by the soldiers at Ngok Tavak. Furthermore, only 31% of the Marines' heavy-lift aircraft was available for operations. The lack of logistical support was exemplified by {{the manner in which the}} 105mm howitzers were deployed; when the Marines arrived at Ngok Tavak, White ordered the Marine detachment to place their howitzers on <b>a</b> <b>downhill</b> position outside the camp's perimeter, as the hill-top position was still covered by trees, making the position of the howitzers a non-ideal location for security.|$|E
5|$|Located at {{the highest}} point of the Municipality lies El Volcan, a small {{mountain}} of about 1500 meters from sea level. This mountain has <b>a</b> <b>Downhill</b> course that has about 500 meters of vertical drop, it is used by hundreds of riders a day during dry and wet weather, mostly on weekends. The course {{is open to the}} public and riding is neither specifically allowed nor prohibited by law. The trails are also used by hikers all week long. Shuttles are about 10 Venezuelan bolivars per trip, they run from the parking lot of a Farmatodo drug store in La Boyera, up to the summit using public avenues and paved roads, taking from 15 minutes to 30 minutes depending on traffic on the area. The course apart from being used mostly for recreational purpose, also has been used for irregularly scheduled downhill races due to the lack of organisation in the riders community.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 29 June, Skanderbeg {{arranged}} his army for battle. Apart from the 3,000 warriors hidden behind the Ottoman army, Skanderbeg left another reserve force of 3,000 {{under the command of}} Vrana Konti. The Albanian army was positioned in a crescent shape curving inwards. They were divided into three groups, each composed of 3,000 men. They were all placed {{at the bottom of a}} hill, with the intention of luring the Ottoman cavalry-based army into <b>a</b> <b>downhill</b> charge. The Albanian left wing was commanded by Tanush Thopia with 1,500 horsemen and an equal number of infantrymen. On the right wing, Skanderbeg placed Moisi Golemi in the same manner as Thopia. In front of the wings, foot archers were placed to lure the Ottomans in. In the center, there were 3,000 men under the command of Skanderbeg and Ajdin Muzaka. One-thousand horsemen were placed in front of the main division with orders to blunt the initial Turkish cavalry charge. An equal number of archers, trained to accompany the horses, was placed next to these horsemen. The main body of infantry, commanded by Ajdin Muzaka, was placed behind the archers.|$|E
5|$|The sixteenth leg was <b>a</b> <b>downhill</b> stage {{from the}} Swiss Alps. A {{breakaway}} did form but was caught before the {{run into the}} finish as the peloton prepared for a sprint finish. The stage was initially won by Giovanni Lombardi, but he was deemed by race judges to have had an irregular sprint and the victory was awarded to the second placed rider Giuseppe Citterio. The next day consisted of a climbing time trial to Selvino. Rominger extended his advantage over all his competitors by winning the stage {{by a margin of}} one minute and thirty-nine seconds over Berzin. The eighteenth stage was plagued by rainy conditions throughout the undulating course. The day's breakaway consisted of sixteen riders, which Tony Rominger's Mapei team chose not to chase down. Denis Zanette and Giuseppe Guerini formed an attack group from the breakaway and rode into the finish where Zanette managed to edge out Guerini for the win. The main contenders did not have any time gaps during the stage, leaving the general classification unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Snowboarding is a {{sport that}} has been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Snowboarding was one of five new sports or {{disciplines}} added to the Winter Olympic programme between 1992 and 2002, and {{was the only one}} not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, <b>a</b> <b>downhill</b> event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the half-pipe, in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other. Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding. Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after testing positive for marijuana. However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association. For the 2002 Winter Olympics, the giant slalom was dropped in favour of the parallel giant slalom, an event that involves head-to-head racing. In 2006, a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles.|$|E

An existing rock quarry, part of the property, was also secured. The efforts were spurred by public outcry following overtures by the former landowner to sell the land to a nearby rock and gravel operation for the expansion of the existing quarry.|$|E
25|$|The Preserve {{lies between}} Petaluma and Santa Rosa, California; access may be {{achieved}} from Petaluma Hill Road, and thence to Roberts Road and Lichau Road.
