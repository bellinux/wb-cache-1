A 1995 report from Saudi Arabia found a doubled incidence at 7 cases per 100,000; this was attributed to the fact that Behçet's disease, which increases risk of CVST, is more common in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism.

Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the <b>annual</b> <b>incidence</b> would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose-Rates of {{development}} of de novo intracranial aneurysms and {{of growth of}} untreated additional aneurysms are largely unknown. We performed MRA in a large patient cohort with coiled aneurysms at 5 -year follow-up. Methods-In 276 patients with coiled intracranial aneurysms and 5 +/- 0. 5 years of follow-up MRA (totaling 1332 follow-up patient-years), additional aneurysms were classified as unchanged, grown, de novo, or incomparable with previous imaging. We calculated 5 -year cumulative incidence of de novo aneurysm formation and growth of untreated aneurysms. We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for studies assessing aneurysm development, and growth. Results-In 50 of 276 patients (18 %), 75 additional aneurysms were present at follow-up MRA. Of these 75, 2 were de novo (both 3 mm), 58 were unchanged, 5 had grown from 1 to 3 mm (7. 9 % of 63 known additional aneurysms; 95 % CI, 1. 3 %- 14. 6 %), and 10 were incomparable.
