50|$|In {{his focus}} on undocumented migrants, Poblete notes {{that more than a}} third of U.S. {{immigrants}} have been undocumented and a large percent has been Latino.

Their invisibilization as political actors therefore allows for their exploitation and vulnerability while their visibility <b>as</b> <b>publics</b> and consumers allows society to profit from them as a market, often representing them in a culturally homogeneous or stereotyped fashion.|$|R
