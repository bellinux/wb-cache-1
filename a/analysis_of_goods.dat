50|$|Following {{this line}} of {{research}} Pagano has enlarged the standard economic view about scarcity. In addition to standard material scarcity he has taken into account some dimensions usually neglected in mainstream economics among which social and intelligence scarcities. With reference to social scarcity Pagano has suggested a way of integrating the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> such as prestige and power in economic theory. This {{has been done by}} introducing a new type of good - positional goods - which have been defined as having the opposite character of public goods. The positive consumption of this type of good is possible only if corresponding negative quantities are consumed by other individuals. Pagano has shown that while public goods are typically undersupplied, positional goods are typically oversupplied. For what concerns instead intelligence scarcity he has suggested that bounded rationality has many dimensions each of which can be represented as a maximization problem with some additional constraints, only at the cost of contradicting the scarcity assumption at a higher level.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} topic in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) concerns the evaluation of environmental impact of human labour. The omission of human labour effects may constitute an unfortunate bias, resulting in leaking of environmental effects and, thereby, systematically misin-formed decision-making. In this paper, the innovative Bioeconomic Input-Output model is pro-posed to internalize human labour in LCA. Specifically, the production of human labor is defined as a new productive sector of a given economy: this process absorbs a portion of the national final demand in order to produce working hours. Both the standard and the Bioeconomic models are then applied for the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services produced by the Italian economy in 2010, and results are compared.

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{tradition in}} international trade seeks to establish whether the predictions of factor abundance theory match present-day data. In the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> trade and factor endowments, mildly encouraging results were found by Leamer et al. But ever since the appearance of Leontief's paradox, the measured factor content of trade has always {{been found to be}} far smaller than its predicted magnitude in the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek framework, the so-called 'missing trade' mystery. We wonder if this problem was there in the theory from the beginning. This seems like a fairer test of its creators' original enterprise. We apply contemporary tests to historical data on goods and factor trade from Ohlin's time. Our analysis is set in a very different context than contemporary studies [...] an era with lower trade barriers, higher transport costs, a more skewed global distribution of the relevant factors (especially land), and comparably large productivity divergence. We find some support for the theory, but also encounter common problems. Our work thus complements the tests applied to today's data and informs our search for improved models of trade. ...|$|E

40|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) {{and life}} cycle inventory (LCI) practice needs to engage with the debate on water use in agriculture and industry. In {{the case of the}} red meat sector, some of the methodologies proposed or in use cannot easily inform the debate because either the results are not denominated in units that are meaningful to the public or the results do not reflect environmental outcomes. This study aims to solve these problems by classifying water use LCI data in the Australian red meat sector {{in a manner consistent with}} contemporary definitions of sustainability. We intend to quantify water that is removed from the course it would take in the absence of production or degraded in quality by the production system. The water used by three red meat supply systems in southern Australia was estimated using hybrid LCA. Detailed process data incorporating actual growth rates and productivity achieved in two calendar years were complemented by an input-output <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services purchased by the properties. Detailed hydrological modelling using a standard agricultural software package was carried out using actual weather data. The model results demonstrated that the major hydrological flows in the system are rainfall and evapotranspiration. Transferred water flows and funds represent small components of the total water inputs to the agricultural enterprise, and the proportion of water degraded is also small relative to the water returned pure to the atmosphere. The results of this study indicate that water used to produce red meat in southern Australia is 18 - 540 L/kg HSCW, depending on the system, reference year and whether we focus on source or discharge characteristics. Two key factors cause the considerable differences between the water use data presented by different authors: the treatment of rain and the feed production process. Including rain and evapotranspiration in LCI data used in simple environmental discussions is the main cause of disagreement between authors and is questionable from an environmental impact perspective because in the case of some native pastoral systems, these flows may not have changed substantially since the arrival of Europeans. Regarding the second factor, most of the grain and fodder crops used in the three red meat supply chains we studied in Australia are produced by dryland cropping. In other locations where surface water supplies are more readily available, such as the USA, irrigation of cattle fodder is more common. So whereas the treatment of rain is a methodological issue relevant to all studies relating water use to the production of red meat, the availability of irrigation water can be characterised as a fundamental difference between the infrastructure of red meat production systems in different locations. Our results are consistent with other published work when the methodological diversity of their work and the approaches we have used are taken into account. We show that for media claims that tens or hundreds of thousands of litres of water are used in the production of red meat to be true, analysts have to ignore the environmental consequences of water use. Such results may nevertheless be interesting if the purpose of their calculations is to focus on calorific or financial gain rather than environmental optimisation. Our approach can be applied to other agricultural systems. We would not suggest that our results can be used as industry averages. In particular, we have not examined primary data for northern Australian beef production systems, where the majority of Australia's export beef is produced...|$|E
