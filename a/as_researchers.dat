5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues <b>as</b> <b>researchers</b> followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{represents the}} unbiasedness hypothesis, {{which states that}} the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Given strong evidence that CIRP holds, the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis {{can serve as a}} test to determine whether UIRP holds (in order for the forward rate and spot rate to be equal, both CIRP and UIRP conditions must hold). Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future spot rate, is mixed <b>as</b> <b>researchers</b> have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E

25|$|Nurses {{practice}} {{in a wide range}} of settings, from hospitals to visiting people in their homes and caring for them in schools to research in pharmaceutical companies. Nurses work in occupational health settings (also called industrial health settings), free-standing clinics and physician offices, nurse-led clinics, long-term care facilities and camps. They also work on cruise ships and in military service. Nurses act as advisers and consultants to the health care and insurance industries. Many nurses also work in the health advocacy and patient advocacy fields at companies such as Health Advocate, Inc. helping in a variety of clinical and administrative issues. Some are attorneys and others work with attorneys as legal nurse consultants, reviewing patient records to assure that adequate care was provided and testifying in court. Nurses can work on a temporary basis, which involves doing shifts without a contract in a variety of settings, sometimes known as per diem nursing, agency nursing or travel nursing. Nurses work <b>as</b> <b>researchers</b> in laboratories, universities, and research institutions. Nurses have also been delving into the world of informatics, acting as consultants to the creation of computerized charting programs and other software.|$|E

500|$|The {{species is}} territorial, with the males {{defending}} the territory. Nesting timing varies by location; in Venezuela {{it is reported}} to occur {{during the rainy season}} (June to September), and in Argentina during the austral summer (October to January). The nests are cup-shaped, [...] across, [...] high and [...] deep. Nests have been recorded being constructed from fine dry grass, or woven plant fibre and a few rootlets. Nests are placed in the forks of branches [...] up in trees [...] tall. The clutch size is three eggs, which are greenish with brown spots. Both sexes incubate the eggs during the 14–15 day brooding period. The species has been described as very tame during this interval – staying on the nest even <b>as</b> <b>researchers</b> came within a few centimetres of the bird – but were very aggressive in attacking birds, like guira cuckoos, or other animals that came near the nest. The hatchlings are dark-skinned with grey down and pink mouths. Pink mouths in chicks are very unusual in suboscines.|$|E
500|$|The war had a {{significant}} influence on Moore's life - he said his only romance ended when his fiancée Lorna, a nurse, was killed in London in 1943 by a bomb which struck her ambulance. Moore subsequently remarked that he never married because [...] "there {{was no one else}} for me... second best is no good for me... I would have liked a wife and family, but it was not to be." [...] In his autobiography he said that after sixty years he still thought about her, and because of her death [...] "if I saw the entire German nation sinking into the sea, I could be relied upon to help push it down." [...] In May 2012 he said to the Radio Times magazine, [...] "We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance". He also said, in the same interview, that [...] "The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut." [...] However, some doubt has arisen over Moore's account, <b>as</b> <b>researchers</b> have been unable to identify Lorna, despite the meticulous records kept of wartime civilian casualties.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{consensus}} from experts {{that there is}} no link between thiomersal and autism, many parents continue to hold belive that such a link exists. These parents share the viewpoint that autism is not just treatable, but curable through [...] "biomedical" [...] interventions and have been frustrated by the lack of progress from more [...] "mainline" [...] scientists in finding this cure. Instead, they have supported an alternative community of like-minded parents, physicians and scientists who promote this belief. This mindset has taught these parents to challenge the expertise from the mainstream scientific community. Parents have also been influenced by a large number of online anti-vaccination websites that present themselves as an alternative source for evidence using pseudoscientific claims. These websites use emotional appeals to gather support and frame the controversy as an adversarial dispute between parents and a conspiracy of doctors and scientists. Advocates for a thiomersal-autism link have also relied on celebrities like model Jenny McCarthy and information presented on Don Imus' Imus in the Morning radio show to persuade the public to their cause, instead of relying only on [...] "dry" [...] scientific papers and scientists. McCarthy has published a book describing her personal experience with her autistic son and appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to promote the hypothesis of vaccines causing autism. Bitterness over this issue has led to numerous threats made against the CDC as well <b>as</b> <b>researchers</b> like Offit, with increased security placed by the CDC in response to these threats.|$|E

500|$|In June 2014, Raúl and Carlos de la Fuente Marcos {{included}} a thirteenth minor planet {{and noted that}} all have their argument of perihelion close to 0°. In a further analysis, Carlos and Raúl de la Fuente Marcos with Sverre J. Aarseth confirmed that the only known way that the observed alignment of the arguments of perihelion can be explained is by an undetected planet. They also theorized that a set of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) are kept bunched together by a Kozai mechanism {{similar to the one}} between Comet 96P/Machholz and Jupiter. They speculated that it would have a mass between that of Mars and Saturn and would orbit at some [...] from the Sun. However, they also struggled to explain the orbital alignment using a model with only one unknown planet. They therefore suggested that this planet is itself in resonance with a more-massive world about [...] from the Sun, just like the one predicted in the work by Trujillo and Sheppard. They also did not {{rule out the possibility that}} the planet could have to be much farther away but much more massive in order to have the same effect and admitted the hypothesis needed more work. They also did not rule out other explanations and expected more clarity <b>as</b> <b>researchers</b> study orbits of more such distant objects. A later analysis of the distributions of the directions of perihelia and orbital poles of the ETNOs also suggests that one additional planet may not be sufficient to explain the observed clustering.|$|E
500|$|In 1925 Brooks had solo {{exhibitions}} in Paris, London, and New York. There {{is no evidence}} to substantiate the claim that Brooks ceased painting after 1925. [...] While in New York during the '30s she produced portraits of Carl Van Vechten in 1936 Mureal Draper in 1938 that we know of. [...] We know that she purchased paints in WWII when she and Natalie were trapped in Florence. [...] <b>As</b> <b>researchers,</b> we know from photographs that there are lost works by Brooks still to be rediscovered. [...] After that year she produced only four more paintings, including portraits of Carl Van Vechten in 1936 and Muriel Draper in 1938. [...] Moreover, Brooks did complete what previous scholars thought to be her last portrait at the age of 87 in 1961. [...] The artist stated that she had drawn all her life so {{there is no reason to}} assume she was not doing so by the time McAvoy painted her portrait. [...] In fact, she herself says in her audio interview from 1968 that she was miffed by the fact that McAvoy portrait of her showed a bunch of dried up brushes rather than the glass table she used as a palette [...] "As if I didn't paint." [...] Her comments seem to indicate she was anything but dried up as a painter. [...] In fact, she had intended to paint a portrait of McAvoy but he never had time to sit for her. [...] During the '30s she became the subject of literary portraits by three writers. [...] Each portrayed her as part of lesbian social circles in Paris and Capri.|$|E
500|$|There {{is rapidly}} growing {{interest}} in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well <b>as</b> <b>researchers.</b> However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as [...] "open-ended, {{in the sense that}} subcategories may be distinguished", as she worried that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated {{as if they were the}} same thing. Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger). Moreover, Crittenden argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that [...] "even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent". However, [...] "the presumption that many indices of 'disorganization' are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response." [...] For example, [...] "Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person." ...|$|E
