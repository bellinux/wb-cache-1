This rule, called the cligths rule, {{is based on the}} wellknown constrained equal <b>awards</b> <b>principle.</b> The essential feature of the rule however is that, for each bankruptcy problem, it takes into account a vector of clights.

The brief provides a short history of changes in teacher compensation over the last century and a discussion of key organizational and educational changes today that could be reinforced by a new teacher-compensation structure. It also suggests some new teacher-pay elements and a set of principles that states and districts could follow if they were to redesign how teachers are paid. Sidebars present examples of innovative compensation programs in Kentucky, South Carolina, Dallas, and Colorado. Three types of new compensation systems are described: skills- or competency-based, pay-at-risk, and group-based performance <b>awards.</b> Ten process <b>principles</b> for the development, design, and implementation of a new compensation system include: (1) the involvement of all key parties; (2) broad agreement on the most valued educational results; (3) sound, comprehensive evaluation systems; (4) adequate funding; (5) investments in ongoing professional development; (6) avoidance of quotas; (7) consideration of the general conditions of work; (8) management maturity; (9) labor maturity; and (10) persistence.

40|$|When a tort rule {{is fully}} aligned, harms are valued equally across the elements. Because the {{valuation}} of harm within duty equals the valuation within the damages remedy, a fully aligned rule gives dutyholders {{the option to}} fully comply with the duty with respect to any harm by paying (the equally valued) compensatory damages for that harm. Full alignment characterizes a rule of strict liability but not negligence liability, which partially misaligns the elements for reasons of principle. Owing to its primary reliance on the damages remedy, a fully aligned rule is unable to address adequately the problem of irreparable injury, a common law category encompassing bodily injury and damage to real or tangible property. In cases of irreparable injury, the common law has long recognized the principle {{that it is better}} to prevent the harm instead of attempting to compensate for its occurrence with the inherently inadequate monetary damages <b>award.</b> This <b>principle</b> explains why tort law has adopted a default rule of negligence liability that seeks to prevent the irreparable injury of physical harm without imposing undue hardship on the dutyholder. To function in this manner, the negligence rule must misalign the elements so that dutyholders are prohibited from rejecting the primary duty of care (based on a higher legal valuation of harm) in exchange for payment of (the lower-valued) compensatory damages. The principle of misalignment reorients the interpretation of tort law in a manner that has been missed by leading accounts. It decisively shows that courts have formulated the negligence rule in a fundamentally inefficient manner, while also showing that the rights-based accounts of corrective justice must explain why that form of justice would primarily value the exercise of reasonable care as opposed to the payment of compensatory damages. For reasons revealed by the misaligned negligence rule, that type of explanation can be supplied by a compensatory tort norm that redirects the dutyholder’s compensatory obligation from the damages remedy into expenditures that would prevent physical harm, yielding the type of misaligned negligence rule that now constitutes the default rule of tort liability. In a world of irreparable injuries and scarce resources, the varied limitations of tort liability can all be understood in relation to a norm of compensation for reasons fully illustrated by the misaligned negligence rule...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{addresses}} the timely and controversial topic of constitutional limits on punitive damages and brings a criminal punishment theory perspective {{to the analysis}} of this issue. The question of how to determine when punishment is unconstitutionally excessive has been and continues to be a subject of intense debate in the courts and scholarly circles. The United States Supreme Court has subjected criminal sanctions, criminal forfeitures, and punitive damages to a proportionality requirement, but the Court uses different approaches to the proportionality analysis {{depending on the type of}} punishment. In the criminal context, the Court has retreated in large part from proportionality review, deferring to legislative maxima for criminal sentences. By contrast, where there is no legislative cap on the punitive damages a jury can award, the Court has undertaken a more active role in determining the proportionality of punitive damages. Similarly, where there is no legislative limit to the amount of property that can be forfeited, the Court has engaged in a more active proportionality review. An analysis of the Supreme Court's different proportionality reviews demonstrates that the different approaches are explained by the presence or absence of legislative limits on punishment. This Article examines the nature of punishment and the requirements for just punishment-notice, proportionality, and limits-and applies these principles to punitive damages. It concludes that a system that imposes no limits on the amount of punitive damages <b>awards</b> contravenes the <b>principle</b> of notice and leaves courts with little guidance in assessing the excessiveness of particular awards. To bring punitive damages into conformity with the principles of just punishment and to provide courts with a benchmark for evaluating the proportionality of punitive damages awards, the Article concludes with proposals for legislative limits on such awards. Because of the importance of limits on punishment, including punitive damages, this Article suggests how states can impose caps on punitive damages awards that serve the policy interests of punishing and deterring wrongful and harmful conduct, and how states can use caps to justify large awards in appropriate cases that will survive excessiveness challenges...|$|R
40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for receiving protection through investment arbitration for foreign investments under investment protection treaties {{is that the}} investments concerned satisfy the definitions of "investor" and "investment" in those treaties. To date, however, the interpretation of provisions concerning the definition of investors and investments {{has given rise to}} a variety of legal problems. With regard to the concept of an investor, a major point at issue is that of how to construe the nationality requirements, and in arbitral awards that have been made to date, the following two issues in particular have been disputed. (i) When the link between an investor and the investing country is weak, and in fact a national of a third country controls that investor, the point at issue is whether the said investor is qualified as a national of the investing country to file an investment arbitration claim. (ii) Even if a company is established in the recipient country, if it is controlled by a national of another country (a signatory to an investment protection treaty) it can file for investment arbitration against the recipient country on the basis of paragraph 2 (b) of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, but the point at issue is whether simply holding shares in a local company is sufficient to constitute control as defined here (or in other words, whether a local company can file a claim even when a top parent company residing in a country that has not concluded an investment protection treaty has effective management control of the local company). On these issues the stance shown by some arbitral <b>awards</b> has in <b>principle</b> been to respect the intentions of the countries or private actors that have been party to the investment protection treaties or investment agreements, and they have recognized jurisdiction for arbitration in the above two situations unless there have been special provisions limiting the eligibility of investors for protection. Nevertheless, if a firm is established as a corporation of convenience in a country that has concluded an investment protection treaty {{for the sole purpose of}} obtaining arbitration jurisdiction, and even if the treaty contains no provisions for refusing protection to such investors, an arbitral tribunal still could exercise its own discretion to deny jurisdiction, for example by piercing the corporate veil. Therefore, although the eligibility of the investors to enjoy protection is in principle subject to the intensions of the parties to the agreements concerned, an arbitral tribunal could conclude otherwise if they were inconsistent with the object and purpose of those agreements. The same is true with regard to the concept of investment. That is, parties to an investment protection treaty can freely determine what sort of investments would fall under the treaty's protection, and can also make it a condition for protection that foreign investment must be made in accordance with the domestic rules of the recipient country. However, according to some arbitral awards, the concept of investment in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, for example, implicitly includes objective requirements to be satisfied by all investments in order to fall within the coverage of protection, rejecting subjective modifications by the contracting states. In addition, there have been a couple of cases in which even where foreign investments violate the laws and regulations of the recipient country, and arbitral jurisdiction would have been denied if the provision of compliance with domestic rules had been applied in an automatic manner, what in fact happened was that after taking into account the circumstances of each case and the object and purpose of the investment protection agreements concerned, arbitral tribunals resorted to their own rational judgments to affirm jurisdiction. Accordingly, with regard to the concept of investment, too, the scope of protection is determined by a combination of the intentions of the parties concerned and the tribunals' original evaluations. ...|$|R
