5|$|Another {{conspiracy}} claim regards a {{patch of}} missing data in Google Sky near the constellation of Orion, which has often been cited as evidence that Nibiru has been redacted.

5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood on it, {{and the surface}} of it had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had gone by the time the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. <b>A</b> <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E
5|$|The next day, on Christmas, Aya and her partner, Daniel, {{go to see}} <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> the Museum of Natural History named Dr. Klamp. He {{teaches the}} protagonists about mitochondria, {{but they do not}} find his {{information}} useful since it does not explain the previous night's events. Later that day, they hear that Eve is in Central Park, and to make matters worse, an audience has gathered at the park's theater intending to see a performance that Melissa Pearce was to give. Aya enters Central Park alone as Daniel is unable to pass through the entrance without spontaneously combusting. She makes it to the theater, but is too late to stop Eve, who causes the theater audience's mitochondria to rebel against their hosts and turns the crowd into a slimy orange mass. Aya chases after Eve and is knocked unconscious after a fight with her aboard a horse-drawn carriage. Daniel discovers that his son, Ben, was at the park, but had left the audience at the Central Park theater when he began to feel ill and when his mother began to act strange. He also learns that Manhattan is being evacuated due to the threat that Eve poses.|$|E

The $300,000,000 Celera effort was intended to proceed at a faster pace and {{at a fraction of}} the cost of the roughly $3 billion publicly funded project. The Celera approach was able to proceed at a much more rapid rate, and at a lower cost than the public project because it relied upon data made available by the publicly funded project.|$|E

Through his initiatives for diversity in science and health education and his development of a STEM curriculum for grades K-12, as well as undergraduate and graduate programs, Bertley earned his position as Senior Vice President of Science and Education at The Franklin Institute.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> the Naval Research Laboratory {{published}} {{a report of}} ten sightings of ivory-billed woodpeckers, including nine in the Pearl River along the Louisiana-Mississippi border {{and one in the}} Choctawhatchee River. Three of the sightings are supported by video footage of birds with flights, behaviors, field marks, and other characteristics that {{do not seem to be}} consistent with any species of the region other than the ivory-billed woodpecker. Nobody has managed to obtain indisputable photographic evidence for the persistence of the ivory-billed woodpecker, but the paper contains an analysis based on factors related to behavior and habitat suggesting that such evidence is unlikely to be obtained in time to make a difference in the conservation of this species.|$|E

25|$|During {{restoration}} in 2002, {{the back}} of the cloth was photographed and scanned for the first time. Giulio Fanti, <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> the University of Padua, wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic corona discharge as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud. Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those {{on the other side of}} the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> the Tower named Dr. Imran Zere (Roger Aaron Brown), who was {{attempting}} to develop a cure for the virus, is kidnapped by Rais, prompting Crane to attempt a rescue mission. Crane is also captured by Rais, who reveals that the file he stole contains proof that the GRE intends to weaponize the virus rather than develop a cure and releases the file to the public. Crane manages to escape before being executed, and, in the process, cuts off Rais' hand. Dr. Zere is killed in the rescue attempt, but manages to tell Crane that he had entrusted his research to Jade, who is tasked with delivering it to another scientist named Dr. Allen Camden (Dan Gilvezan). As Crane goes to look for Jade, he finds out that the Defence Ministry is planning to bomb Harran {{in an effort to}} completely eradicate the outbreak, claiming that there are no survivors left in the city. He manages to reactivate a radio tower and broadcasts a message to the outside world, thwarting the Ministry's plan. Jade is captured by Rais, who also steals Dr. Zere's research. Crane manages to rescue Jade and recover a part of Dr. Zere's research, but Jade admits that she has been bitten, and pleads with Crane to stop Rais. Jade then succumbs to the wound, forcing Crane to mercifully kill her, also by snapping her neck. After killing Rais' second-in-command, Tahir (Michael Benyaer) with his own machete, Crane delivers the tissue samples to Dr. Camden, who believes that he is very close to the cure, but needs the rest of Dr. Zere's data. Crane then finds out that Rais has cut a deal with the GRE, in which he will hand over Dr. Zere's research data to them in return for extraction from Harran. Crane then assaults Rais' headquarters (filled with infected) and battles him atop a skyscraper, just as a GRE helicopter shows up, eventually stabbing Rais in the neck and throwing him off the building. He narrowly recovers the research data and decides to turn it over to Dr. Camden instead of the GRE, intending to stay in Harran to help the remaining survivors.|$|E
