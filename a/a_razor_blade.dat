Pavelić survived the war and died in Spain in 1959. Stepinac, who failed to publicly condemn the atrocities in Glina, was accused of collaborating with the Ustaše by Yugoslavia's new Communist government and was tried in 1946, where Jednak testified against him. He was subsequently sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment and died while under house arrest in 1960. In 1986, Jednak testified against the Ustaše government's Minister of the Interior, Andrija Artuković, at his trial in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Gaalipata turned Ganesh {{into one of}} the most sought-after actors in Kannada cinema. He was already coming on the back of major {{commercial}} successes Mungaru Male (2006), Cheluvina Chittara (2007), and moderate successes Hudugaata (2007) and Krishna (2007). Yogaraj Bhat had delivered his two consecutive films that emerged as massive commercial successes, the other being Mungaru Male. Ganesh was seen in the film wearing a chain around the neck with <b>a</b> <b>razor</b> <b>blade</b> as the pendant. It became a trend among male fans. The film also proved to as a major break for Diganth who would go on to collaborate with Bhat frequently— Manasaare (2009), Pancharangi (2010) and Parapancha (2015). The nickname 'Doodh Peda' (an Indian sweet), by which Ganesh addresses to him as, in the film, came to be attached with his name in the media along with a tag of 'Chocolate Hero'. The film also proved to be a launchpad in the careers of actresses Neethu and Bhavana Rao.|$|E

The following year, Nilsen was transferred to a vulnerable-prisoner unit at HMP Full Sutton upon concerns for his safety. He was to remain at Full Sutton until 1993, when he was transferred to Whitemoor Prison, again as a Category A prisoner, and with increased segregation from other inmates.|$|E

During his 1930s European tour, he suffered an ulceration so severe that he had to stop playing entirely for a year. Eventually he took to using salves and creams on his lips and also cutting off scar tissue with <b>a</b> <b>razor</b> <b>blade.</b> By the 1950s, he was an official spokesman for Ansatz-Creme Lip Salve.|$|E

25|$|While imprisoned, Hamilton Rowan met the Reverend William Jackson, an Irish-born Anglican clergyman who {{was working}} as a spy for the French Committee of Public Safety. Jackson's mission was to assess Ireland's {{readiness}} for revolution and French invasion. Jackson, Tone, and others met in Hamilton Rowan's Newgate cell to discuss the state of Ireland and the population's willingness to overthrow British rule. But Jackson was betrayed by a friend acting as a spy for the British Government, {{was arrested and charged with}} high treason. Immediately following Jackson's arrest, Hamilton Rowan fled to escape being tried for high treason. He convinced his jailer to allow him to visit his wife on the pretense of signing legal documents. While the jailer sat in the dining room of their home in Dublin, Hamilton Rowan excused himself to the bedroom, where he climbed down a rope made of knotted bed sheets to a waiting horse. Unwilling to be taken alive, he kept <b>a</b> <b>razor</b> <b>blade</b> in his sleeve and fled south to the coast. There he hired a boat to sail to France, and upon his arrival he was immediately arrested as a British spy. While in prison he was interrogated by Robespierre, who found him innocent of the charges raised against him and had Hamilton Rowan freed.|$|E
25|$|Not every suicide {{case was}} successful. Some mothers who had drowned their {{children}} were unable to drown themselves thereafter. In other cases, doses of poison proved to be lethal for children, but not for their mothers. There were also cases where children survived attempted drownings. After a failed suicide, some killed themselves by others methods. A mother and her repeatedly raped daughter, for instance, died by hanging themselves in an attic, after repeatedly failing to drown themselves in the Peene river. Another mother who had poisoned and buried three of her four children before, tried to hang herself on an oak three times, only to be prevented to do so each time by Soviet soldiers. There are further records of Soviet soldiers preventing suicides by retrieving people from the river and nursing cut wrists. In another case, a grandfather forcibly took away <b>a</b> <b>razor</b> <b>blade</b> from a mother {{who was about to}} kill her children and herself after being raped by Soviet soldiers and hearing of the death of her husband. After Soviet soldiers had raped a girl to death and shot her father, an aunt cut her daughter's and son's wrists as well as her own. The other women of the family committed suicide, only one aunt was able to save the grandmother. One family survived, because the 15-year-old son persuaded his mother, who had become a rape victim, to abort her induced drowning, when she was already being dragged by the Tollense river.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the notch {{sharpening}} on the fracture toughness obtained under Elastic–Plastic Fracture Mechanics (EPFMs) approach has been analyzed in {{two different types of}} thermoplastic polymers, a semicrystalline multi-phase ethylene–propylene block copolymer and an amorphous polycarbonate. The samples for fracture characterization were sharpened using <b>a</b> steel <b>razor</b> <b>blade</b> and the femtosecond laser ablation technique. Both notching techniques gave rise to the very same size of crack tip radii, 1 – 2 μm. For all the materials under study, the fracture toughness values of the specimens sharpened through femtosecond laser ablation were lower than those measured on samples sharpened using <b>a</b> steel <b>razor</b> <b>blade.</b> The largest differences were achieved for the amorphous polycarbonate. The damage produced ahead of the crack tip through plastic deformation in the steel <b>razor</b> <b>blade</b> sharpened samples over against the lack of damage in the femtolaser sharpened specimens explains the disparity in the fracture values. Besides, the stress state ahead of the crack tip is closely related to the plastic deformation zone to specimen thickness ratio. The fracture toughness values determined from the femtolaser sharpened samples were all in plane strain conditions while the values of the fracture toughness obtained from the steel <b>razor</b> <b>blade</b> sharpened specimens were not.
