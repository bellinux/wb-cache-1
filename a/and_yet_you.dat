Santer explained: [...] "There’s that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone’s changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>you</b> still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed."

And that’s the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, John Altman (Nick) agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him.

500|$|Chopin's successes as a {{composer}} and performer {{opened the door}} to western Europe for him, and on 2 November 1830, he set out, in the words of Zdzisław Jachimecki, [...] "into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever." [...] With Woyciechowski, he headed for Austria again, intending to go on to Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the November 1830 Uprising broke out, and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, [...] "I curse the moment of my departure." [...] When in September 1831 he learned, while travelling from Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: [...] "Oh God!... You are there, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>you</b> do not take vengeance!" [...] Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer's maturing [...] "into an inspired national bard who intuited the past, present and future of his native Poland." ...|$|E

[...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times called it [...] "...a trustworthy family drama but with aliens."

500|$|... "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] lyrically {{discusses}} feminism; {{the song}} criticizes [...] "common" [...] gender-related double standards, {{in which men}} are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave {{in a similar fashion}} are disdained. In the book Therapeutic Uses of Rap and Hip-Hop, Susan Hadley and George Yancy discuss that [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] is a hip hop song that [...] "encourages young women to be proud, strong, and empowered to be all that they can be". At the song's first verse, Aguilera sings [...] "Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind / Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled"; she later rejects that all women [...] "should be seen, not heard" [...] and encourages them to [...] "shout louder" [...] during the chorus. Aguilera comments on the double standard with the lyrics [...] "The guy gets all the glory the more he can score / While the girl can do the same <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>you</b> call her a whore". Lil' Kim shares a similar sentiment during her verse in the bridge, questioning why a man is able to give a woman [...] "some sex or sex her raw" [...] while [...] "if the girl do the same and then she's a whore".|$|E

500|$|The 19th century {{transcription}} of Merina oral history, Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, relates that Andriamampandry privately {{assessed the}} leadership qualities {{of each of}} the four selected sons, with disappointing results. He presented Andriambonimena of Alasora with a beautiful parrot, which the prince killed and served as food. The elder concluded that he was [...] "a gun that loads itself." [...] The oldest son, Andrianjakanavalonamandimby, was given a pot of honey, which he smashed in order to eat every last drop. Afterward Andriamampandry remarked that the kingdom had become a pot of honey without a lid, implying the first one to come along would be free to reach his hand inside and take all its bounty for himself. He visited Andriantomponimerina at Ambohidratrimo and offered him a zebu kidney (considered unpalatable), which the prince ordered to be prepared as a meal nonetheless, leading the elder to remark, [...] "This man can't even resist the temptation to eat the kidney." [...] He visited Andrianavalonimerina at Ambohitrabiby carrying a lemon and a weaver's stake, which the prince's wife demanded he give to them, demonstrating their greediness. Andriamampandry also visited prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana at Ambohimanga, carrying an axe and a rope. The prince asked to borrow the two items, then ordered a servant to use the axe and rope to butcher a zebu, put some of the best meat in a basket, cook the rest of the good meat for their meal, and set aside the neck and the ribbed part of the tripe in a second basket. The elder dined with the prince and spent the night at the village. When Andriamampandry was about to leave, the prince returned the rope and axe, gave him the basket of fine meat for his wife, and gave him the second basket, declaring [...] "These are the parts for the axe (i.e. the neck) and the rope (i.e. the striated omasum)." [...] Andriamampandry was deeply impressed by the hospitality and foresight of the prince. He related these incidents to Andriamasinavalona, who decided to test his sons in turn by calling them together to his house, then observing how they slept on the bed they shared there. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana had his head highest on the pillow, but Andriamasinavalona failed to understand the significance of this, and Andriamampandry rebuked him, remarking [...] "You are the king, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>you</b> do not understand?" ...|$|E

[...] This inability, therefore, can be overcome by diminishing these irrational sentiments: [...] "Learn from those who were bound like you[...] [...] [...] Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.—'But this is what I am afraid of.'—And why?

2500|$|Nick {{has been}} {{described}} by EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer as [...] "the show's premier villain".

Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: [...] "You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that [...] "There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: [...] "It's good to have an out and out villain. I think sometimes you can get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter.
