5|$|Human beings <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{microcosm}} of the universe, and for example comprise the Wu Xing in form of the zang-fu organs. As a consequence, {{it is believed that}} deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved by understanding oneself.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} is {{terrestrial}} and uses structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air. They cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they possess a rudimentary set of gills. They can breathe {{on land and}} hold their breath underwater. The branchiostegal lungs <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.|$|E
50|$|Schumpeterian rent <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of {{economic}} rent, although Schumpeterian rent may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> incentive towards greater economic inefficiency.|$|R

5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
5|$|The project brings free, encrypted, gigabit {{wireless}} internet coverage {{to the five}} boroughs by converting old payphones into Wi-Fi hotspots where free phone calls could also be made. , there are 920 Links citywide; eventually, there will be 7,500 Links installed in the New York metropolitan area, making the system the world's fastest and most expansive. Intersection has also proposed installing Links in other cities such as London and Columbus, Ohio. The Links <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> model for future city builds as part of smart city data pools and infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E
40|$|When {{modelling}} a domain, it {{is often}} the case that certain individuals are represented as belonging to multiple categories, generating therefore "tangled" hierarchies: 1. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> amount of matter 2. <b>A</b> hole can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> region of space 3. <b>A</b> building can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> place 4. A biological organ can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> aggregate of molecules 5. An association can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group of people 6. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> temporal process This phenomenon is quite common: the examples above have been taken from existing toplevel ontologies used in practice, and they are responsible, in our opinion, of many situations of tangleness, confusion, and lack of semantic rigour. We advocate in the present paper a design principle aimed to clarify such situations and produce more reusable and well-founded ontologies. It can be stated as follows: Ontological Distinction Principle: Classes corresponding to different ident...|$|R

5|$|In 1852, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was {{commissioned}} {{to build a}} life-sized concrete model of Megalosaurus for the exhibition of prehistoric animals at the Crystal Palace Park in Sydenham, where it remains to this day. Hawkins worked {{under the direction of}} Owen and the statue reflected Owen's ideas that Megalosaurus would have been a mammal-like quadruped. The sculpture in Crystal Palace Park shows a conspicuous hump on the shoulders and it has been suggested this was inspired by a set of high vertebral spines acquired by Owen in the early 1850s. Today, they <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate genus Becklespinax, but Owen referred them to Megalosaurus. The models at the exhibition created a general public awareness for the first time, at least in England, that ancient reptiles had existed.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea {{live in a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship with the neighboring Masikoro farmers and herders, and the Vezo fishing clan. The Mikea live primarily on food scavenged from the forest but also grow seasonal crops. Their mobility and reliance on scavenging as opposed to crop growing shifts in response to changes in environmental and economic pressures on availability of resources within the Mikea {{community as well as}} those of their Vezo and Masikoro neighbors. The Mikea sell their forest products, as well as woven mats and food animals they raise, at weekly Vezo and Masikoro markets in nearby villages to obtain the necessities they cannot scavenge, such as clothing and medicine. Some Mikea migrate for periods of time to work in local villages or the town of Morombe. They are also hired to work for Vezo and Masikoro villagers, such as by cutting forest for villagers or other Mikeas' corn fields, or guarding villagers' zebu herds. They occasionally acquire one or more zebu in addition to or in lieu of payment, as these <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of wealth and are mainly sacrificed in ancestral ceremonies rather than eaten as food. The rainy season is the time when Mikea are most likely to leave their scavenging encampments for wage labor opportunities in villages or for the corn harvest. This is also the time when Masikoro and Vezo villagers are most likely to move into the forest to grow corn.|$|E

25|$|Symbols, {{for many}} {{cultures}} that use magic, <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> type of technology: native peoples might use symbols and symbolic actions {{to bring about}} change and improvements {{in the same way as}} those from advanced cultures use advanced irrigation techniques to promote soil fertility and crop growth. Michael Brown discusses the use of nantag stones among the Aguaruna as being similar to this type of technology.|$|E

Politics has played a major in role in determining the status and meaning of what is considered to be honorable within Brazils’ society.|$|E
25|$|Historians have {{traditionally}} blamed Rudolf's {{preoccupation with the}} arts, occult sciences, and other personal interests {{as the reason for}} the political disasters of his reign. More recently historians have re-evaluated this view and see his patronage of the arts and occult sciences as a triumph and key part of the Renaissance, while his political failures <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legitimate attempt to create a unified Christian empire, which was undermined by the realities of religious, political and intellectual disintegrations of the time.|$|E
