5|$|Historically, Białystok {{has been}} a {{destination}} for internal and foreign immigration, especially from Central and Eastern Europe.

World War II changed all of this, in 1939, around 107,000 people lived in Białystok, but in 1946 – only 56,759, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of the city's history.

Most of the modern-day population growth is based on internal migration within Poland and urbanization of surrounding areas.|$|E
