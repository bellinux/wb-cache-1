5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Voyager 1 encounter, Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Science predicting a volcanically modified surface and a differentiated interior, with distinct rock types rather than <b>a</b> <b>homogeneous</b> blend. They based this prediction on models of Io's interior that took into account the massive amount of heat produced by the varying tidal pull of Jupiter on Io caused by its slightly eccentric orbit. Their calculations suggested {{that the amount of}} heat generated for an Io with <b>a</b> <b>homogeneous</b> interior would be three times greater than the amount of heat generated by radioactive isotope decay alone.

5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which <b>a</b> <b>homogeneous</b> and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{during the}} Ford and Carter administrations to force {{metrication}} were seized on by many newspaper editorialists as being dictatorial.

5|$|Galileo {{proposed}} that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration, {{as long as}} the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (d∝t2). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through <b>a</b> <b>homogeneous</b> medium would be uniformly accelerated. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day.
