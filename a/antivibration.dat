In 1964, Trelleborgs Gummifabriks AB was floated at the Stockholm Stock Exchange. The current name was adopted in 1977. Between 1983 and 1991, the strategy was to act as a wide-ranging industrial conglomerate, with a particular focus on mining and metals. Later, the company's focus returned to rubber products. In 1999, the scope was further narrowed by specializing in industrial applications. In 2003, polymer-based precision seals were added to the product offerings.

50|$|A bushing or {{rubber bushing}} {{is a type}} of {{vibration}} isolator. It provides an interface between two parts, damping the energy transmitted through the bushing. A common application is in vehicle suspension systems, where a bushing made of rubber (or, more often, synthetic rubber or polyurethane) separates the faces of two metal objects while allowing a certain amount of movement. This movement allows the suspension parts to move freely, for example, when traveling over a large bump, while minimizing transmission of noise and small vibrations through to the chassis of the vehicle. A rubber bushing may also be described as a flexible mounting or <b>antivibration</b> mounting.|$|E
50|$|Kléber-Colombes, {{a company}} specialising in {{elastomers}} and expansion joints, {{was established in}} 1910. Nearly 50 years later, in 1956, the automotive supplier Woco Industrietechnik GmbH (http://www.wocogroup.com) went into operation. In 1980, Woco entered the <b>antivibration</b> sector. Its work soon resulted in the first automotive parts that used a rubber-metal combination that could reduce vibration and driving noise in cars. The basis of these parts was innovations {{in the area of}} natural-rubber, plastic and metal adhesion technology. Michelin acquired the Kléber Group in 1982, established CMP Kléber Industry and also worked in the area of rubber processing for vehicles. At the turn of the millennium, the knowledge acquired in this work flowed into a Joint Venture set up by Woco and Michelin. Under the name Woco Michelin AVS, the company made its products at its base in Bad Soden-Salmünster and locations around the world. In 2007, Olaf Hahn joined with the financial investor Arques Industries AG (Geschichte der Arques Industries) to acquire the joint venture and gave the company the name that it uses today, Anvis Group GmbH. Olaf Hahn became managing director, a position that he still holds today. With the complete takeover by the Japanese Sumitomo Riko Company Limited, a strategic investor from the relevant industry acquired the company in 2013.|$|E
50|$|In the Factory, Lana {{approaches}} the Dessicator {{and sees the}} Heart standing next to it. He criticizes her for never settling down even when she had everything, however Lana retorts that she refuses {{to live in a}} world where people have to fight for the will to live. At this point the Heart says that she is just like her mother, implying that he is her father. Lana steps onto the Dessicator. Her goal is to overload the Dessicator with wild energy so that it breaks and the Factory doesn't have to kill people anymore to provide energy. Despite her best efforts to maintain her own rhythm despite the membrane filling her with <b>antivibration,</b> she starts weakening. At this point all of her companions jump onto the membrane and each of them starts doing their best to maintain their own rhythm by performing anything that fills them with wild energy such as dancing and playing on drums. The battle starts going much better as the Dessicator starts overloading, but Lana realizes that they won't be able to keep it up for long enough. Suddenly, the Heart jumps onto the center of the membrane and starts channeling his own wild energy. As the Dessicator absorbs him. it overloads, leaving the Heart a pile of ashes and the Dessicator broken. Afterwards Lana sees off her friends by putting them on the same cart that the Heart used to take to the city.|$|E
40|$|We {{focus on}} the <b>antivibration</b> {{controller}} design problem for electrical power steering (EPS) systems. The EPS system has significant advantages over the traditional hydraulic steering system. However, the improper motor controller design {{would lead to the}} steering wheel vibration. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the <b>antivibration</b> control strategy. For the implementation study, we also present the motor driver design and the software design which is used to monitor the sensors and the control signal. Based on the investigation on the regular assistant algorithm, we summarize the difficulties and problems encountered by the regular algorithm. After that, in order to improve the performance of <b>antivibration</b> and the human-like steering feeling, we propose a new assistant strategy for the EPS. The experiment results of the bench test illustrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed control strategy.

40|$|Anti-vibration gloves {{have been}} used to block the {{transmission}} of vibration from powered hand tools to the user, and to protect users from the negative health consequences associated with exposure to vibration. However, there are conflicting reports as to the efficacy of gloves in protecting workers. The goal {{of this study was to}} use a characterized animal model of vibration-induced peripheral vascular and nerve injury to determine whether <b>antivibration</b> materials reduced or inhibited the effects of vibration on these physiological symptoms. Rats were exposed to 4 h of tail vibration at 125 Hz with an acceleration 49 m/s(2). The platform was either bare or covered with antivibrating glove material. Rats were tested for tactile sensitivity to applied pressure before and after vibration exposure. One day following the exposure, ventral tail arteries were assessed for sensitivity to vasodilating and vasoconstricting factors and nerves were examined histologically for early indicators of edema and inflammation. Ventral tail artery responses to an 12 C-adrenoreceptor agonist were enhanced in arteries from vibration-exposed rats compared to controls, regardless of whether <b>antivibration</b> materials were used or not. Rats exposed to vibration were also less sensitive to pressure after exposure. These findings are consistent with experimental findings in humans suggesting that <b>antivibration</b> gloves may not provide protection against the adverse health consequences of vibration exposure in all conditions. Additional studies need to be done examining newer <b>antivibration</b> materials. CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 01 - 05 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 25965192 PMC 470082...|$|E

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{as well as}} {{application of}} process damping in milling of thin-walled workpiece made of titanium alloy is investigated. Titanium alloy used commonly in aviation industry is one typical difficult-to-machine material. Chatter usually occurs in cutting of titanium alloy, which results in poor surface quality and damaged tool. Thus, chatter is one important restriction for the quality and efficiency of titanium alloy manufacture, especially for the thin-walled workpiece made of titanium alloy due to poor structural stiffness. Process damping results from interference between flank face and machined surface, which is critical but usually ignored in chatter analysis for difficult-to-machine material. The paper presents one nonlinear dynamic model considering process damping for milling of thin-walled workpiece made of titanium alloy and designs <b>antivibration</b> clearance angle to suppress chatter based on the model. The experimental and computational {{results indicate that the}} presented methods for chatter stability analysis are reasonable, and the <b>antivibration</b> clearance angle designed is effective in suppressing chatter and improving machining quality...|$|E

40|$|Tan δ {{and energy}} {{dissipated}} during hysteresis testing of isotropic and anisotropic MREs containing silane modified iron sand particles {{in a natural}} rubber matrix were compared with existing <b>antivibration</b> rubbers. Tan δ was measured using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) over a range of frequency (0. 01 – 130 Hz), strain amplitude (0. 1 – 4. 5 %), and temperature (− 100 – 50 °C). Energy dissipated was measured using a universal tester under cyclic tensile loading. The chosen <b>antivibration</b> rubbers for comparison contained different contents of carbon black filler (30, 50 and 70 phr) in a natural rubber matrix. It was found that energy absorption for comparative samples was generally higher than isotropic and anisotropic MREs over the range of frequency and strain amplitude explored, {{as well as in}} hysteresis testing and this was believed to be largely due the presence of carbon black in the formulation. Further assessment was carried out on materials that were the same as anisotropic MREs except they had additions of carbon black. The energy absorption was found higher than comparative samples with the same carbon black contents, supporting the use of iron sand to improve damping. However, trends for energy absorption at around Tg were found to reverse which is considered to be due to the segmental motion of rubber chains being by far the most significant influence on energy absorption in the glass transition zone...|$|E
