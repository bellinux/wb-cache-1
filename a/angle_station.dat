The Leitner Group was the contractor for the cable car system. Between the Tung Chung and Ngong Ping Terminals, the 5.7km cableway changes direction twice at the two angle stations, one on the south shore of Chek Lap Kok; the other west of Nei Lak Shan within the Lantau North Country Park.

50|$|In November 2008, voters {{approved}} {{funding for the}} segment between Sea-Tac Airport and Redondo/Star Lake at South 272nd Street. However, reduced tax revenue {{as a result of}} the economic recession led Sound Transit to suspend all work south of <b>Angle</b> Lake <b>Station</b> (South 200th Street) in December 2010. Construction on the South 200th Link Extension to <b>Angle</b> Lake <b>station</b> began in April 2013, with this segment scheduled to open for service in late 2016.|$|R

5000|$|The {{island is}} located north of Lantau Island off Ma Wan Chung and Tung Chung. Before the {{building}} of the airport platform, it was a small and hilly island, about 4 km long, with an area of 3.02 km2 (other sources mention 2.8 km2). The southern end of the island formed a small peninsula, which has been left largely undeveloped. This area is facing Tung Chung and is now named [...] "Scenic Hill". It is the site of the Ancient Kiln Park and the Airport Island <b>Angle</b> <b>Station</b> of the Ngong Ping 360 cable car.|$|E

50|$|The Ngong Ping 360 is a 5.7 km {{cableway}} {{that links}} Tung Chung and Ngong Ping via <b>angled</b> <b>stations</b> at Airport Island and Nei Lak Shan. Ngong Ping {{is the home}} of the Big Buddha and Po Lin Monastery. The Ngong Ping 360 and Ngong Ping Village form the Ngong Ping 360 tourism project. Following an accident involving one of the cable cars falling from the ropeway in June 2007, Ngong Ping Cable Car services were suspended until passenger safety could be guaranteed. Ngong Ping 360 is now fully operational.|$|R
50|$|By January 2017, {{the station}} was {{attracting}} an average of over 2,500 passengers per day, with the garage reaching 93 percent occupancy. Sound Transit expects that <b>Angle</b> Lake <b>station</b> will have an average of 5,400 weekday boardings by 2018.|$|R
50|$|Provision {{was made}} at Monks Ferry for a {{connection}} to the internal rail system of shipbuilders Cammell Laird, which lay to the south of the station. This was via a set of sidings, with the connecting track at a right <b>angle</b> to <b>station</b> approaches.|$|R
50|$|The system {{consists}} of three types of stations: Power Stations with 135 hp (101 kW) electric motors, powering one or both connecting sections. Terminal stations in Forsby and Köping where the limestone was loaded/unloaded also functioned as power <b>stations.</b> <b>Angle</b> <b>stations</b> lack motors and only change {{the angle of the}} cable track by splicing together two sections powered from their respective other sides. Station buildings have an iron frame, wooden walls and roof constructed from asbestos cement. The pulling cables go in endless loops between stations, and kept taut by counterweights in towers in the power stations. The heavier carrying cable is divided into four runs along each section, connected by tension stations. These stations are comparatively small, simple structures regulating cable tension along the way.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} {{adjacent}} and at right <b>angles</b> to Kita-Asaka <b>Station</b> on the Musashino Line operated by JR East.|$|R
5000|$|Limestone {{from the}} Forsby quarry was {{coarsely}} crushed and sorted by hand. Passing cableway cars were automatically loaded from a storage silo, {{after the passage}} to Köping cars were automatically unloaded, the limestone was fine-ground and ready for cement production.The cableway is supported by 235 concrete trestles and split into 4 sections with stations in Forsby och Köping {{as well as the}} <b>angle</b> <b>stations</b> at Granhammar, Malmberga and Knotberget. Of these trestles, 10 are tall [...] "special trestles" [...] at the crossing of the Hjälmaren strait and Arboga River, the tallest being 45 m. Power stations are located in Köping, Malmberga and Forsby. 12 tension stations line the track, and 8 road or railway intersections are protected by steel nets. The limestone was transported in 750 bucket-shaped cars, each carrying 1200 kg for a total capacity of 90 metric tons per hour.|$|R
5|$|<b>Angle</b> Lake <b>station</b> {{consists}} of a single island platform elevated above street level, {{on the west side}} of 28th Avenue South.
