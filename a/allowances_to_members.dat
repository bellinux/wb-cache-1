According to now-repealed Rules governing the payment of expenses and <b>allowances</b> <b>to</b> <b>Members</b> of the European Parliament, MEPs could claim up to £125,000 per year for assistants' wages, but this money must be paid either directly to the employees or to a third-party agent.

50|$|Corruption in Brazil {{exists on}} all levels of society from the top echelons of {{political}} power (as seen in the Mensalão Scandal and the Operation Car Wash and the Petrobras scandals) to the smallest municipalities. The Operation Car Wash shows central government members using the prerogatives of their public office for rent-seeking activities, ranging from political support to siphoning funds from state-owned corporation for personal gain. Specifically, mensalão typically referred {{to the practice of}} transferring taxpayer funds as monthly <b>allowances</b> <b>to</b> <b>members</b> of congress from other political parties in consideration for their support and votes in congress. Politicians used the state-owned and state-run oil company Petrobras to raise hundreds of millions of reais for political campaigns and personal enrichment.

40|$|This article aims to {{contribute}} to the ongoing debate over population politics and the perceived reinvigoration of eugenic practices in “people’s home” countries. The ability of governments to subsidize genetic technologies or familial lifestyle choices also gives them the ability to choose who has access to these technologies and in so doing the ability to favor the procreation of one group over another. The authors suggest that such subsidization is used under the guise of productivist strategies by nations interested first and foremost in preserving their ethno-national identity. Although these countries, adhering to liberal democratic economics, profess to reward productivity, there seems {{to be more than a}} coincidental relationship between the “productive ” and the ethnic national stock. The authors use as a case study a comparison between Israel and Sweden to show how such eugenic strategies arose over time in people’s home countries that synthesized productivism and national welfare. They suggest that genetics today is just as prone to being used for purposes of social engineering in welfare states and results in exclusion of individuals and communities. Indeed, as the authors demonstrate, welfare states provide generous benefits such as reproductive technology and child <b>allowances</b> <b>to</b> <b>members</b> of their national at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on May 11, 2016 cps. sagepub. comDownloaded from 1392 Comparative Political Studies 43 (11) stock, at the same time hardly providing benefits to those who do not have share in ethnic membership...|$|E

60|$|It was {{two months}} from the {{commencement}} of the strike before Jack Simpson returned from Birmingham, coming home to stay from Saturday till Monday. Nothing can be more discouraging than {{the appearance of a}} colliery village where the hands are on strike. For the first week or two there is much bravado, and anticipation of early victory; and as money is still plentiful, the public-houses do a great trade. But as the stern reality of the struggle becomes felt, a gloom falls over the place. The men hang about listlessly, {{and from time to time}} straggle down to the committee-room, to hear the last news from the other places to which the strike extends, and to try to gather a little confidence therefrom. At first things always look well. Meetings are held in other centres, and promises of support flow in. For a time money arrives freely, and the union committee make an <b>allowance</b> <b>to</b> each <b>member,</b> which, far below his regular pay as it is, is still amply sufficient for his absolute wants. But by the end of two months the enthusiasm which the strike excited elsewhere dies out, the levies fall off, and the weekly money scarce enables life to be kept together.|$|R
50|$|It was {{revealed}} in March 2009 that Cohen had received £104,701 {{over the previous}} five years under the Additional Costs Allowance for his Wanstead home based upon the representation that this was his second home. The home that Cohen represented as his primary home was a house in Colchester, despite the fact that Cohen spent very little time at that location and used it only as a holiday home. As his Wanstead home is where Cohen resides both when going to Westminster and attending to his constituency, the claim of the Additional Costs Allowance was criticised as an abuse of an expense <b>allowance</b> intended <b>to</b> help <b>Members</b> of Parliament who need to maintain one home in their constituency and another in London.

40|$|The EU Directive 2003 / 87 /EC for the {{introduction}} of a European emission trading system has left the task of allocating the emission <b>allowances</b> mainly <b>to</b> the <b>member</b> states. In Germany the details of the allocation method are laid down in the Allocation Act (ZuG 2007). One central element of the Allocation Act is the so called transfer-rule, which is intended to provide incentives for the replacement of emission intensive installations and thus to achieve environmental benefits. This paper takes {{a closer look at the}} transfer-rule?s ecological impacts and competitive effects in the field of electricity generation. The analysis suggests that the investment incentives provided by the transfer-rule are limited and uncertain, while at the same time the overall amount of emissions from participants of the trading scheme will not be reduced. Instead the transfer-rule causes windfall profits for incumbent generators and leads to a significant distortion of competition. This cannot be justified by environmental benefits as has been done by the German government and the European Commission...|$|R
