X-Men co-creator Stan Lee and Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld make cameo {{appearances}} as a strip club emcee and a patron of Weasel's bar, respectively. Rob Hayter makes a cameo appearance as Bob, Agent of Hydra, a recurring character in the comics alongside Deadpool. The rights for Bob are owned by Marvel Studios, who did not give permission {{for him to be}} used in the film, so his comic history and connections to the organization Hydra are not referenced in the film. He is instead explained as a former special forces operative like Wilson. Wolverine star Hugh Jackman was very supportive of Deadpool, and of it making fun of himself and his character, and is seen in the film via his People's Sexiest Man Alive magazine cover.|$|E
5|$|In December1941, {{just before}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, he went to Iowa City, where he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) Flying Cadet program with <b>a</b> <b>recruiter.</b> On January 17 of the {{following}} year, {{he was sent to}} Fort Des Moines and soon inducted into the USAAF.

25|$|In general, child {{trafficking}} {{takes place in}} three stages: recruitment, movement, and exploitation. Recruitment occurs {{when a child is}} approached by <b>a</b> <b>recruiter,</b> or in some cases, directly approaches <b>a</b> <b>recruiter</b> themselves. Recruitment is initiated in many different ways: adolescents may be under pressure to contribute to their families, children may be kidnapped or abducted into trafficking, or families may be trafficked together. Then, movement will occur - locally, regionally, and/or internationally - through a variety of transportation types, including by car, train, boat, or foot. Ultimately, the final goal of {{child trafficking}} is exploitation, whereby traffickers use the services of children to garner illegal profit. Exploitation can take place in a variety of forms, including forced labor, sexual exploitation, and child begging, among other practices.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{temporary}} labor {{programs in the}} United States are subject to abuse. The H-2A visas and H-2B visas, which typically go to Mexican migrants, are tied to specific jobs, giving the employers a lot {{of control over the}} migrants who work for them. Because of the lack of regulation, enforcement, and supervision in both Mexico and the United States, many migrants are exploited in the process of moving locations. Often, a migrant will purchase a visa for a particular job from <b>a</b> <b>recruiter,</b> only to cross the border and be forced to work in a different position or in poor working conditions with insufficient pay. Though the aim of the system is to promote legal circular migration, the system actually results in illegal and permanent stays.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} for the Daily Mail, Nawaz notes how self-segregation has created Muslim {{communities}} in London where third-generation teenagers are growing up without having any non-Muslim friends, or friends from the opposite sex. He notes how their lives revolve around faith schools, mosque, Islamic extracurricular activities and cultural events involving members of the Muslim community only. Without any exposure to the complexities of modern life, he argues, such teens are susceptible to simplistic worldviews and dogma. On an individual level, Nawaz maps a person's path to radicalisation with four key stages: grievances, identity crisis, charismatic recruiter and ideology. It begins {{with a sense of}} real or perceived grievances, which leads to an identity crisis. This condition is then capitalised on by <b>a</b> <b>recruiter</b> from an organisation who lays out the ideology as a solution to that individual's alienation.|$|E

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, al-Husseini received a commission in the Ottoman Army as an artillery officer and {{was assigned to the}} Forty-Seventh Brigade stationed in and around the city of Izmir. In November 1916 he obtained a three-month disability leave from the army and returned to Jerusalem. He was recovering from an illness there when the city was captured by the British a year later. The British and Sherifian armies, for which some 500 Palestinian Arabs were estimated to have volunteered, completed their conquest of Ottoman-controlled Palestine and Syria in 1918. As a Sherifian officer, al-Husseini recruited men to serve in Faisal bin Al Hussein bin Ali El-Hashemi's army during the Arab Revolt, a task he undertook while employed as <b>a</b> <b>recruiter</b> by the British military administration in Jerusalem and Damascus. The post-war Palin Report noted that the English recruiting officer, Captain C. D. Brunton, found al-Husseini, with whom he cooperated, very pro-British, and that, via the diffusion of War Office pamphlets dropped from the air promising them peace and prosperity under British rule, 'the recruits (were) being given to understand that they were fighting in a national cause and to liberate their country from the Turks'. Nothing in his early career to this point suggests he had ambitions to serve in a religious office: his interests were those of an Arab nationalist.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, 2008, ICE {{successfully}} removed Sarafat Mohamed to Egypt. Mohamed was an Imam for the Hoda Islamic Center in Gainesville, Florida. Mohamed {{entered the}} United States on October 26, 1999 on a non-immigrant religious worker visa. He later obtained a special immigrant religious worker visa. He applied {{to become a}} lawful permanent resident in 2001. The FBI interviewed Mohamed in 2005. Mohamed confessed to the FBI {{that he was a}} founding member of Takfir wal-Hijra (TWH). TWH was an Egyptian-based terrorist organization responsible for the 1977 kidnapping and murder of the Egyptian Minister of Islamic Endowment, Mohamed Hussain al-Zahabi. TWH was notable because, unlike many other radical Islamic groups, it did not refrain from murdering other Muslims. Though Mohamed denied any role in the murder, he admitted to being <b>a</b> <b>recruiter</b> for TWH. He also admitted that he served as the religious leader for TWH. After the murder, Egyptian authorities arrested many members of TWH, including Mohamed. He was convicted for his membership in the organization and served a 20-year prison sentence. Mohamed failed to include his arrest and conviction in his application to become a lawful permanent resident of the United States. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services denied Mohamed’s residency application and placed him in removal proceedings, charging him with lying in order to gain an immigration benefit. ICE vigorously sought a removal order in immigration court. Over the strong objections of ICE, an immigration judge in Miami granted Mohamed’s request to become a lawful permanent resident. ICE successfully appealed this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals. The Board agreed with ICE and reversed the ruling of the immigration judge. The Board ordered the removal of Mohamed on July 30, 2008.|$|E
