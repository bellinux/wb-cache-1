5|$|Ashot III {{established}} the Kingdom of Lori (Tashir-Dzoraget Kingdom) in Gugark for strategic reasons and enthroned Gurgen in 982. Gurgen {{along with his}} brother Smbat are depicted on the sculptures of the patrons in both Sanahin and Haghpat. When the Tashir-Dzoraget kingdom fell {{as a result of}} Seljuk raids the Kyurikids migrated to Tavush and Metsnaberd yet they maintained ties with their ancestral fortress and compound in Akhtala. The fortress was built on an elevated rocky outcrop surrounded by deep canyons from three sides forming a natural protection. The somewhat accessible parts between the cliffs are reinforced by towers <b>and</b> <b>walls.</b> The only entrance to the compound is on the northern side protected by bell-shaped towers <b>and</b> <b>walls.</b> The walls and towers of the fortress are built of bluish basalt and lime mortar. The Kyurikids gradually lost their influence under the Seljuk grasp {{by the end of the}} 12th century.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Although {{prophylaxis}} with beta-blockers {{has been}} shown to decrease variceal pressure <b>and</b> <b>wall</b> tension in cirrhotic patients, this has not been demonstrated in non-cirrhotic portal hypertension caused by Schistosoma mansoni infection. Methods: Thirteen patients without history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding were included. All of them had high-risk esophageal varices at endoscopy. An endoscopic gauge and a high-frequency endoscopic ultrasonography miniprobe were used to assess transmural variceal pressure <b>and</b> <b>wall</b> tension before <b>and</b> after achieving beta-blockade with propranolol. Results: Baseline variceal pressure decreased from 13. 3 +/- 3. 5 to 8. 2 +/- 2. 0 mmHg (P < 0. 0001) <b>and</b> <b>wall</b> tension from 500. 2 +/- 279. 8 to 274. 0 +/- 108. 3 mg. mm- 1. The overall effect of propranolol on decreasing variceal pressure <b>and</b> <b>wall</b> tension expressed in percentage change in relation to baseline values was 35. 7 +/- 18. 4 % and 35. 9 +/- 26. 7 %, respectively (P = 0. 9993). Conclusion: Propranolol significantly reduced variceal pressure <b>and</b> <b>wall</b> tension in schistosomiasis. Alves de Queiroz Family Fund for Researc...|$|R

5|$|Edward {{employed}} trusted {{architects and}} engineers {{to run the}} projects, most prominently the Savoyard Master James of St George, but also Edward's close friend Otto de Grandson, the soldier Sir John de Bonvillars and the master mason John Francis. The English had built castles {{in the wake of}} the 1272 conflict, usually larger and more expensive than those of the local Welsh rulers, but the new fortifications were on a still grander scale. Carpenters, ditch diggers and stonemasons were gathered by local sheriffs from across England and mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home each winter. The number of workers involved was so great that it placed a significant strain on England's national labour force. The costs were huge: Caernarfon's castle <b>and</b> <b>walls</b> cost £15,500, Conwy's castle <b>and</b> <b>walls</b> came to around £15,000 and Harlech Castle cost £8,190 to construct.|$|E
5|$|Etruscan {{architecture}} {{was created}} between about 700 BC and 200 BC, when the expanding civilization of ancient Rome finally absorbed Etruscan civilization. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood {{and other materials}} of temples, houses, tombs and city walls, as well as bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in anything like their original condition are tombs <b>and</b> <b>walls,</b> but through archaeology and other sources {{we have a good}} deal of information on what once existed.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural {{features in the}} landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, doors, <b>and</b> <b>walls</b> along {{the path of the}} sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde's Sun Temple is thought to have been an astronomical observatory.|$|E

5|$|The Fatimid Caliphs {{competed with}} {{the rulers of}} the Abbasid and Byzantine empires, and indulged in luxurious palace building. Their palaces, their {{greatest}} architectural achievements, are known only by written descriptions, however. Several surviving tombs, mosques, gates <b>and</b> <b>walls,</b> mainly in Cairo, retain original elements, although they have been extensively modified or rebuilt in later periods. Notable extant examples of Fatimid architecture include the Great Mosque of Mahdiya, and the Al-Azhar Mosque, Al-Hakim Mosque, Juyushi and Lulua of Cairo.|$|E
5|$|The common {{element to}} both church and palazzi {{interior}} design was the stucco work. Stucco {{is an important}} component of the Baroque design and philosophy, as it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in three-dimensional form. Its combination with trompe l'oeil ceilings <b>and</b> <b>walls</b> in Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art. While in churches the stucco could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers, in a private house it might represent the owner's favourite foods or musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|The king {{decided that}} the {{location}} would become the centre of a new county and {{the capital of the}} principality of North Wales, with a new castle and walled town forming the administrative centre. Edward's plan was a colonial enterprise and placing the new town <b>and</b> <b>walls</b> on the Caernarfon site was in part a symbolic act to demonstrate English power; the walls also symbolised the town's status as the capital of North Wales.|$|E

5|$|After {{civil war}} broke out in England in 1135, the third earl, also called William, set about {{improving}} the defences of the castle. He began to build a tall keep {{on top of the}} motte, reinforcing the surrounding earthworks with stone walls. A planned settlement was established alongside the castle, surrounded by its own earthworks <b>and</b> <b>walls,</b> and the Peddars Way was redirected to pass by the castle, town and priory, all important symbols of the de Warennes' power in the region. Hamelin de Warenne acquired the castle through marriage and curtailed the building work on the keep around 1165, but completed the construction of three large stone gatehouses in the castle and town. One of these, the town's bailey gate, still survives intact.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat is {{decorated}} with depictions of apsaras and devata; {{there are more than}} 1,796 depictions of devata in the present research inventory.

In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period.|$|E
5|$|At home {{in front}} of 75,321 fans, the Giants played the Washington Redskins in Week 8. Each team totaled 16 first downs, four punts and five penalties, and the {{difference}} in time of possession was less than one minute. However, the Giants committed no turnovers while coercing three from the Redskins. Giants cornerback Everson Walls intercepted two passes—including one that he returned for his first career touchdown—and free safety Greg Jackson intercepted another. Walls' interception set up a Giants touchdown and a 14–0 lead in the second quarter. Jackson then intercepted a pass {{in the end zone}} in the third quarter to preserve a 14–10 lead, <b>and</b> <b>Walls</b> returned his second interception 28yards for a touchdown that made the score 21–10 and put the game of reach in the fourth quarter.|$|E
