40|$|Cancer {{illnesses}} show {{a bigger}} and bigger health-political problem worldwide. In Germany the prostate carcinoma {{is the most common}} tumor which is diagnosed within men. This increase of incidence is associated, above all, with the higher life expectancy and the improvement of the diagnostic tests used. The good healing chances of a carcinoma recognised in an early stage stand in contrast to the low claim of early diagnosis investigations within the male population. Arrangements like the Men's Health <b>Awareness</b> <b>Days</b> which were evaluated in this work have the purpose to anchor the topic prostate cancer in the general public even more. In addition, men have the possibility to find out about the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities of this subject and can allow determining their PSA. The purpose of this work was to value the arrangements of 2003 and 2004 with the subject Men Health and to derive improvements for future arrangements. Therefore the number of the carried out PSA tests, {{the average age of the}} persons participating, the used test procedure, the different ways of notification of the particular test-result and the used clarification forms were compared to each other. Due to the high number of participants, in a total of seven arrangements, from 8465 ascertained PSA values and the ascertained average age of 61 years, it can be assumed that the Men's Health <b>Awareness</b> <b>Days</b> are on the right way to anchor the importance of early diagnosis investigations, especially the PSA-testing for prostate cancer, in general public. For future arrangements, however, an expansion of the topic besides urological subjects seems sensible just as the arrangement of Men's Health <b>Awareness</b> <b>Days</b> in certain companies to reach the real target group, namely the men less conscious of health. The stronger integration of practising urologists is to be aimed; thus patients should be given after the notification of the result directly to practicing urologists to guarantee a doctor's patient's connection and to lead not only the further diagnostics but also if necessary a suitable therapy in the ways. Since the PSA test is not an ideal tumour marker and his application as a screening-test is valued differently in the scientific discussion it points out the importance of a well-considered application as well as a detailed clarification before testing. Nevertheless arrangements such as the Men's Health <b>Awareness</b> <b>Days</b> fulfil the purpose to draw the attention of the general public to the topic prostate cancer and to motivate the male population, to take part in early diagnosis investigations from own responsibility...|$|R
