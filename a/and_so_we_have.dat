25|$|It is now {{believed}} that the club was originally a Thursday Club in the literal sense {{but that it was}} understood from the beginning that it considered itself to be representative of Middlesex as a county. It may even have had a Middlesex birth qualification for membership, like Yorkshire CCC so famously had until recently. Very soon, they decided to call themselves the Middlesex county team <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> here a parallel with Hambledon Club/Hampshire.|$|E

5000|$|Jim Walker (2007): “At The Manor {{we wanted}} a live drum sound, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to use the old billiard room. It was set up {{so it was just}} me and Rotten eye to eye, as I drummed and he sang.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] Mr. Cathro observed, [...] "none {{of us was}} on the spot, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> no {{opportunity}} of showing our heroism. But you were near by, Mr. Sandys, {{and if you had}} fished up the water that day, instead of down, you might have been called upon. I wonder what you would have done?" ...|$|R
2500|$|We are {{slaves in}} Punjab. Our {{brothers}} and sisters are being killed <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{to stand up for}} ourselves. Nobody's going to help us.

2500|$|Egyptian pharaohs {{were always}} {{regarded}} as deities, but other deities {{are much less}} common in large statues, except when they represent the pharaoh as another deity; however the other deities are frequently shown in paintings and reliefs. The famous row of four colossal statues outside the main temple at Abu Simbel each show Rameses II, a typical scheme, though here exceptionally large. [...] Small figures of deities, or their animal personifications, are very common, and found in popular materials such as pottery. Most larger sculpture survives from Egyptian temples or tombs; by Dynasty IV (2680–2565 BCE) at the latest {{the idea of the}} Ka statue was firmly established. These were put in tombs as a resting place for the ka portion of the soul, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a good number of less conventionalized statues of well-off administrators and their wives, many in wood as Egypt {{is one of the few}} places in the world where the climate allows wood to survive over millennia. The so-called reserve heads, plain hairless heads, are especially naturalistic. Early tombs also contained small models of the slaves, animals, buildings and objects such as boats necessary for the deceased to continue his lifestyle in the afterworld, and later Ushabti figures.|$|E
60|$|Take {{almost any}} member of the present Government and {{consider}} his case. You may credit him with a lifelong industrious intention to get there, but ask yourself what is this man's distinction, and for what great thing in our national life does he stand? By the complaisance of our party machinery he was able to present himself to a perplexed constituency as the only possible alternative to Conservatism and Tariff Reform, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> him. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> most of his colleagues.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, it's inevitable. There {{is nothing}} to bring us together, unless it's some happy accident, like the present. But we don't have a {{traveler}} from Altruria to exploit every day, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no business to come into people's houses." ...|$|E

60|$|Nor did Queen Mary promise, nay, swear {{less than}} is now promised for the pretender; for she swore to the Gospellers of Suffolk {{to make no}} {{alteration}} in religion; and they, like the blinded protestants of this age, brought her in, {{for which they were}} the first that felt the fury and rage of the popish party, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> great cause to believe it would be again.|$|E
60|$|We {{have made}} the mistake of turning life inside out: of {{dragging}} the day-self into the night, and spreading the night-self over into the day. We have made love and sex a matter of seeing and hearing and of day-conscious manipulation. We have made men and women come together on the grounds of this superficial likeness and commonalty--their mental, and upper sympathetic consciousness. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> forced the blood to submission.

5000|$|... "It was not war; {{they did}} not {{understand}} yielding. As long as their national drum beat, the whole party would stand, and {{allow themselves to be}} shot down. Their arrows often killed our men, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to fire on them as long as they stood. When their drum ceased, they would move off a quarter of a mile; then their drums beat again, and they calmly stood till we came up and poured a few volleys into them.

6000|$|... "Even now, {{though our}} victorious armies are {{surrounding}} Helium, {{the people of}} Zodanga are voicing their displeasure, for the war is not a popular one, since it {{is not based on}} right or justice.

6000|$|Then Ayala {{began to}} explain the great {{difference}} between Uncle Tom and Uncle Reginald,--how Uncle Tom had so many thousands that nobody could count them, how Uncle Reginald was so shorn in his hundreds that there was hardly enough to supply the necessaries of life. [...] "You see," [...] she said, [...] "when papa died Lucy and I were divided. I got the rich uncle, and Lucy got the poor one; but I made myself disagreeable, and didn't suit, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been changed." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's sexual overtones {{led to its}} {{enthusiastic}} {{acceptance in}} American gay clubs shortly after its release. Bono commented on this phenomenon, saying, [...] "First of all we started out and made Boy, which is a sexual LP, and we changed the cover in America to stop any concern there might be about paedophilia and the like, because it was our first album. But import copies got in and, as you know, in America a lot of music is broken in gay clubs <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a gay audience, {{a lot of people}} who were convinced the music was specifically for them. So there was a misconception if you like." ...|$|R
5000|$|The first lesson, {{simple as}} it is, is that {{whatever}} court we are in, whatever we are doing, whether {{we are in a}} trial court or an appellate court, {{at the end of our}} task some human being is going to be affected. Some human life is going to be changed in some way by what we do, whether we do it as trial judges or whether we do it as appellate judges, as far removed from the trial arena as it is possible to be. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better use every power of our minds and our hearts and our beings to get those rulings right.|$|R
