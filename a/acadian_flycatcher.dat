40|$|Many {{songbird}} {{species have}} experienced significant population declines, {{partly because of}} brood parasitism by the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), which is positively associated with increasing landscape forest cover in the midwestern United States. However, cowbirds are also experiencing long-term population declines, which should reduce parasitism pressure and thus increase productivity of host species. We used 20 years of nest monitoring data from five sites in Missouri across a gradient of landscape forest cover to assess temporal trends in the rate and intensity of brood parasitism for <b>Acadian</b> <b>Flycatchers</b> (Empidonax virescens), Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), and Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis). We evaluated whether there were concomitant changes in fledging brood size, nest survival, {{a combination of the}} two metrics (i. e., host young produced per nest attempt), and whether such changes were more substantial with decreasing landscape forest cover. Parasitism rates and intensities declined substantially during 1991 – 2010. Fledging brood size and nest survival rates were positively associated with landscape forest cover, confirming the fragmentation hypothesis for Midwest forest birds. Declining parasitism rates were associated with increased fledging brood sizes, with more pronounced increases as landscape forest cover decreased. Nest survival increased insubstantially across time during laying and incubation, but not during the nestling stage. The best predictor of nest survival was parasitism status, with parasitized nests surviving at lower rates than unparasitized nests.

A wider ecological approach is needed to provide managers with a more justifiable target deer density. I investigated the use of breeding birds to determine an ecologically based carrying capacity for deer management by studying the relationship between the forest breeding bird community and deer density in Delaware. Using Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data from 2005 - 2009, my own point count data from 2008 - 2009, and Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife deer density data from the same time periods, I compared avian species richness and relative abundance to deer density. I divided deer densities into low (≤ 10 deer/km 2), moderate (11 - 19 deer/km 2) and high (≥ 20 deer/km 2) categories. I placed birds into 7 deer-sensitive guilds: interior obligates, ground nesters, shrub nesters, ground gleaners, low canopy foragers, and neo-tropical migrants. The abundance or richness of most guilds and most individual species did not differ by deer density. Of those guilds that did, shrub nesters (P = 0. 074), interior forest obligates (P = 0. 050), low canopy foragers (P < 0. 001), and neo-tropical migrants (P = 0. 023) had the greatest species richness and/or relative abundance at low or moderate deer densities. Chipping Sparrows (P = 0. 021), Red-eyed Vireos (P = 0. 023), Great Crested Flycatchers (P = 0. 044), <b>Acadian</b> <b>Flycatchers</b> (P < 0. 001), and Ovenbirds (P = 0. 028) had the greatest abundances at low or moderate deer densities. Our results suggest that areas in Delaware with deer densities of < 20 deer/km 2 have the greatest avian richness and abundance. Thus, management efforts should focus on this level as an ecological threshold that will maintain the quality of the ecosystem as a whole.

50|$|When {{different}} kinds of birds have the same adaptations, such similarities are not necessaily indicative of any familial relationship between bird species. Rather, they {{are the result of}} convergent evolution. Consider, for example, the marked resemblance in body size, shape, and coloration between flycatchers of several families, though these species are not closely related: the Asian brown flycatcher (of the Muscicapidae or Old World flycatcher family), <b>Acadian</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (of the Tyrannidae or tyrant flycatcher family) of the New World, and slaty monarch (of the Monarchidae or monarch flycatcher family), endemic to Fiji. All three use flycatching to acquire some or all of their food. But these three families belong to separate branches of the evolutionary tree of songbirds, which diverged in two branching events some 60 and 90 million years ago and continued to evolve independently {{in different parts of the}} world. Likewise, the similarities of swifts and swallows once led naturalists to conclude they were related, but it is now established that they are unrelated, and that the same lifestyle has led to the same adaptations.|$|E
5000|$|In hawking behavior, a bird {{will watch}} for prey from a {{suitable}} perch. When it spies potential prey, the bird will fly swiftly from its perch {{to catch the}} insect in its bill, {{then return to the}} perch or sometimes to a different perch. This maneuver is also called a [...] "sally". Prey that is very small relative to the bird, such as gnats, may be consumed immediately while in flight, but larger prey, such as bees or moths, are usually brought back to a perch before being eaten. Sometimes the prey will attempt to escape and this can result in a fluttering pursuit before returning to the perch. Depending on the species of bird, there are observable variations on this behavior. Some species, such as the olive-sided flycatcher of North America and the ashy drongo of the Indian Subcontinent, tend to choose an exposed perch, such as a dead tree branch overlooking a clearing, whereas others, such as the North American <b>Acadian</b> <b>flycatcher</b> and the Asian small niltava perch within the cover of foliage deep in a forest or woodland habitat.|$|E

Data were collected from nine 30 ha study plots. I measured habitat features at 37 <b>Acadian</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> nests and compared them to 30 nonuse sites randomly selected within the vegetation types associated with nests. Because Acadian Flycatchers have a strong riparian habitat association for nest-site selection, nonuse sites were established along riparian corridors not occupied by nesting flycatchers. Data also were collected to determine relationships between microhabitat characteristics and nesting success of the <b>Acadian</b> <b>Flycatcher.</b> Nest-sites were associated with a more mature or climax community, as evident from the high percentage (75 %) of nests in eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), a climax community tree species and the greater basal area found at nest-sites over nonuse sites. Nest-sites also had lower small stem density and ground cover than nonuse sites. Nest-sites were always found near streams, although I found no conclusive evidence that any stream characteristic influenced nest-site selection. Habitat features did not differ between successful and depredated nests. Brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) was not {{a major factor in}} the reproductive success of Acadian Flycatchers (only a 2 % parasitism rate); depredation accounted for the majority of nest failures. These results suggest that silviculture activities near riparian corridors could drastically reduce habitat availability and subsequently contribute to population declines of the <b>Acadian</b> <b>Flycatcher.</b> Future research should focus on determining the size of riparian buffer strips needed to retain this species along riparian corridors in the Appalachian Mountains. This strategy can be applied to the current downtown revitalization efforts by the City of Muncie.

40|$|In {{response}} to the critique by Schmidt and Whelan (Condor 101 (4) : 916 - 920, 1999), {{we find that the}} relationship between nest success and tree selectivity is dependent upon inclusion or exclusion of particular tree species, whether or not years are pooled, and the selectivity index used. We question their use of point estimates of nest success with extremely high variances, defend our index, question the application of the Chesson (1983) index to our data, and explain the need to analyze years separately. Bottomland hardwood forest systems are extremely variable; hydroperiods alter the suitability of nesting substrates, availability of alternative food, and behavior of predators and their prey. Given these features, actively searching for <b>Acadian</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> (Empidonax virescens) nests is seldom an efficient predator foraging strategy.

30|$|Many {{silvicultural}} practices can be {{used with}} prescribed fire in hardwood systems to create, maintain, or enhance food and cover resources for wildlife. Regeneration harvests (e.g., shelterwood and group selection), various types of thinnings, and midstory removal via herbicide applications may be used in combination with fire to manage habitat for wildlife (Brose and Van Lear 1998, Johnson et al. 2009, Lashley et al. 2011, Bakermans et al. 2012, McCord et al. 2014, Kendrick et al. 2015, Silvis et al. 2016). The amount of canopy removal and resultant increased sunlight directly influences plant composition and structure, as well as habitat for different wildlife species. Increased canopy removal stimulates increased woody stem density, which may be suitable for species such as brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum L.), chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica L.), ruffed grouse, or black bear (Ursus americanus Pall.)
