5|$|During the {{training}} expedition, Shaw's group came to Walla Brook at a crossing near Watern Tor in the north-east of Dartmoor. According to evidence given at Shaw's inquest in 2009, the group {{believed they had}} to cross because the alternative route would add at least four miles to the trek. Another {{member of the group}} got into difficulties crossing the stream, which, due to heavy rain, had swollen to approximately five times its normal size. The other group member removed her rucksack <b>and</b> <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> to Shaw. As Shaw, the last member of the group on her side of the stream, was throwing the rucksack across, she slipped and fell into the water.|$|E
5|$|In early-to-mid 1912, Stojanović and his schoolmate Todor Ilić joined Narodna Odbrana (National Defence), an {{association}} founded in Serbia in December 1908 on {{the initiative of}} Branislav Nušić. It aimed to organise a guerrilla resistance to the Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to spread nationalist propaganda. National Defence soon established a network of local committees throughout Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its members from the latter territory gathered intelligence on the Austrian army <b>and</b> <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> to the Serbian secret service.|$|E
5|$|Koenig {{first became}} {{involved}} with writing a script for The Animated Series after he asked Susan Sackett, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's assistant, to type up some writing he was working on. After reading it through, {{she thought it was}} good <b>and</b> <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> to Roddenberry, who agreed and asked Koenig if he was interested in writing for the animated show. He accepted the offer, and started working on a plot involving cloning which was inspired by newspaper articles about the subject, becoming the first actor from Star Trek to write for the franchise.|$|E

The bill {{moved back to the}} House but was indefinitely postponed by a voice vote initiated by House Speaker Calvin Say, requiring a vote of two-thirds of Representatives to be taken up again in 2010, and was considered dead. In April 2010, {{on the last day of}} the legislative session, the House suspended the rules on the Senate bill <b>and</b> <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> with a majority, sending the bill to Governor Linda Lingle, who vetoed it in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{originally}} {{occupied by a}} house, which pre-dated the Norman conquest of England. After the conquest, it came into the possession of the Earls of Chester. Circa 1232, Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester gave the house to Stephen de Segrave, who served as Chief Justiciar of England. His son, Gilbert de Segrave, inherited the property, <b>and</b> <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> on to his son, Nicholas de Segrave, 1st Baron Segrave, who was created Baron Segrave. The house was first described as a manor in 1239, and, at that time, was the only permanent nobleman's residence in Coventry. The Caludon estate expanded slightly into Wyken, to the north, in 1279 when Nicholas de Segrave purchased a carucate and mill.|$|E

50|$|A {{network was}} then {{established}} in which Townsend would pass intelligence to a courier, almost always Hawkins, until September 1779, or Roe, {{who would take}} it 55 mi to Setauket <b>and</b> <b>pass</b> <b>it</b> to Woodhull, usually via dead drop. Woodhull would evaluate and comment on <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>pass</b> <b>it</b> to Caleb Brewster, who would take it across Long Island Sound, occasionally adding an intelligence note of his own, <b>and</b> <b>pass</b> <b>it</b> to Tallmadge, who would usually add a cover letter with comments. Tallmadge found that personally taking the message to Washington was too time consuming. So he sent messages after {{the first one to}} Washington by a dragoon, then by a relay of dragoons, acting as couriers.|$|R
50|$|After Townsend {{began his}} {{intelligence}} activities in New York City, Woodhull operated almost exclusively from Setauket. A revised communications network was then established, in which Townsend would pass intelligence to a courier—at first Hawkins, then Hawkins and Roe, and exclusively Roe after September 1779. The courier would take <b>it</b> to Setauket <b>and</b> <b>pass</b> <b>it</b> to Woodhull, usually via dead drop {{in a box}} hidden in a field which Roe rented from Woodhull. Woodhull would evaluate and comment on <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>pass</b> <b>it</b> to Brewster, who would take it across Long Island Sound, occasionally adding an intelligence note of his own, <b>and</b> <b>pass</b> <b>it</b> to Tallmadge. Tallmadge would usually add a cover letter with comments.|$|R

Betty Cuthbert, Raelene Boyle, Dawn Fraser, Shirley Strickland, Shane Gould, and Debbie Flintoff-King, all medallists in previous Games, were given the honour of carrying the Flame before passing it to the final torch-bearer.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{he joined}} Pitts to form The Southern Melody Boys with Bob Wren and Burke Reeder, {{which became the}} first string band to feature improvised solos, {{patterned}} after jazz violinist Joe Venuti, who Brower idolized.

Brower used it to great effect <b>and</b> <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> along to other Texas fiddlers in the early 1930s. The Southern Melody Boys played popular music and appeared on WBAP-AM and KTAT-AM in Fort Worth.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} closely fought until MSJ pulled {{away in the}} closing minutes. With the Lions having the ball with 30 seconds to play and a safe 9-point lead, Benjamin called a timeout and sent Hill back into the game. They ran another play for Hill, this time for a {{right-handed}} layup, but she missed. One of her teammates rebounded the ball <b>and</b> <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> back to her for a second right-handed layup, which she made to close out the scoring in the Lions' 66–55 win. After the game, MSJ announced that $40,000 had been raised for TCSN.|$|E

25|$|The Ontario government, {{in concert}} with the City of Toronto, and Gardiner's Planning Board, {{proposed}} an amalgamated city to the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) to overcome the roadblocks in building capital projects and facilitate growth. The OMB deliberated over the plan from 1951 until 1953, when it proposed a two-tier federal government named 'Metropolitan Toronto'. The Frost government approved the idea <b>and</b> <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> in April 1953, naming Gardiner the first chairman of the Metropolitan Council, made up equally of city and suburban representatives. Gardiner was also the chief administrative officer of the Metro Toronto organization. The two-tier plan was not new, it had been first proposed in 1934.|$|E

25|$|Britannicus' name {{at birth}} was Tiberius Claudius Germanicus. The agnomen, his first surname Germanicus, was first awarded to his {{paternal}} grandfather Drusus the Elder {{after his death in}} 9 BC to commemorate his victories over the Germanic tribes. Accordingly, Drusus' sons (Claudius and Germanicus) inherited the name <b>and</b> <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> to their sons as well. Britannicus was given to his father in AD 43 following his conquest of Britain. Claudius never used it himself and gave the name to his son instead, and his full name became: Tiberius Claudius Caesar Britannicus. He came to be known by his new name which seems to have replaced Germanicus altogether.|$|E
25|$|In 1848, Masten built a barn. He made {{few other}} {{modifications}} to the property, <b>and</b> <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> along to his son Hiram in 1876. It remained in the Masten family for another two decades, until 1895. Afterwards it passed through several different owners until becoming property of John and Kate Linton in 1909. They continued to own it until John's death in 1948 (his wife predeceased him), when it was passed to his wife's nephew Joseph Quinn. It's {{interesting to note that}} the house never contained an indoor toilet until after Linton's death, as he felt that the practice was unsanitary. The Linton's were buried in Sylvan cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The {{petition}} {{was presented}} to the ARC, which formally endorsed it <b>and</b> <b>passed</b> <b>it</b> to its subsidiary, ARTA, recommending that passenger services should be started to both Onehunga and to Helensville. The petition was later handed back by ARTA to the ARC, with ARTA stating that the track was the responsibility of government track organisation, ONTRACK (now part of KiwiRail). The petition {{was presented to}} Parliament's Transport and Labour Relations Select Committee by Lee as Chairman of the ARC. On 13 March 2007 the Government announced that it had given approval for ONTRACK to spend $10 million on reopening the line for passengers and freight. As part of the rehabilitation work a private siding was built at the Owens truck depot.|$|E
