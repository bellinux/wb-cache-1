5|$|Not {{long after}} the release of Third/Sister Lovers, Bell died in a car accident. He {{apparently}} lost control of his car while driving alone and was killed when he struck a lamp post after hitting the curb a hundred feet before. A blood test found that he was not drunk at the time, and no drugs were found on him other than a bottle of vitamins. Bell is believed to have either fallen asleep <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> or become distracted.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact with}} the fire {{extinguisher}} wrenched Pryce's helmet upward sharply. Death was almost certainly instantaneous. Pryce's Shadow DN8, now with its driver dead <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> continued at speed down the main straight towards the first corner, called Crowthorne. The car left the track to the right, scraping the metal barriers, hitting an entrance for emergency vehicles, and veering back onto the track. It then hit Jacques Laffite's Ligier, sending both Pryce and Laffite head-on into the barriers. Jansen van Vuuren's injuries were so extensive that, initially, his body was identified only after the race director had summoned all of the race marshals {{and he was not}} among them.|$|E

5|$|Before the ceremony, Chuck {{talks to}} Blair who professes her undying {{love for him}} -which has been filmed by Georgina- but still refuses to call off the wedding. During the ceremony, someone sends the video of the {{discussion}} between Blair and Chuck to everyone's cell phones. The ceremony is temporarily suspended until Blair {{comes back to the}} aisle determined to marry Louis. As a result, she becomes Her Serene Highness, Princess Blair of Monaco. At the reception, Serena tells Dan how she feels about him but quickly leaves before he can answer. During their last dance, Louis reveals to Blair {{that it will be a}} loveless, contracted marriage. After hearing that, Blair runs away in a limousine with Dan <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> At the end of the episode, the identity of Gossip Girl is seemingly revealed to be Georgina Sparks.|$|E
5|$|During the trip, Homer {{falls asleep}} and wakes up {{abruptly}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> {{of the truck}} due to taking a combination of pep pills and sleeping pills that he bought at a general store. He awakes {{to discover that the}} truck drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other truck drivers, who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all truck drivers lose their jobs. However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus about the system, which causes an angry mob of truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on time, and then commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|The dream girl {{is found}} in the form of Nancy, who {{responds}} minimally to Vic but is enamored of Renaldo. Victor and several residents of the building, including Mrs. Trend, run afoul of the killers, and a seemingly random series of slapstick murders occur, for all of which Victor is ultimately blamed. Nancy inevitably becomes target and Vic saves her and kills the exterminators after a long comical fight sequence. The flashback ends and Victor is in the electric chair, and awaits his execution while an elaborate race sequence occurs in which Nancy, accompanied by several nuns, drive manically, Nancy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> to the scene in order to prove his innocence. Before the switch is pulled however, Nancy arrives just in time and clears his name. The movie concludes with their marriage.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the expected improvement on the active safety of road vehicles deriving {{from the real}} time measurement of forces and moments <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> Many researches in the literature attempt to find devices able to measure accurately the forces and <b>the</b> moments <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> of road vehicles. A six-components measuring wheel developed and patented <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Politecnico di Milano is described. The active safety of road vehicles is mainly related to longitudinal motions (braking, traction control) and lateral motions (yaw moment control). Up-to date control strategies are described in the paper. Weak points of the todays controls are highlighted in the paper. New controls are presented, aiming to use {{all of the information}} available and provided by <b>the</b> six-axis measuring <b>wheels.</b> It is envisaged, a signicant improvement of the vehicle active safety by sensing <b>the</b> forces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels...</b>|$|R

5|$|For 2002, Courage Compétition {{began running}} a factory team again (using a Judd-engined C60), whilst Pescarolo Sport {{continued}} with their Peugeot-engined C60. The 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Catalunya saw Courage's Thed Björk, Derichebourg and Cottaz take fifth overall, whilst Pescarolo's Boullion and Bourdais won the race. At the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Estoril, it was Cottaz and Derichebourg who took second for Courage, whilst Boullion and Franck Lagorce finished fourth for Pescarolo. At the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Brno, Cottaz and Derichebourg took another second for Courage, whilst Pescarolo did not compete. Three C60s were entered for the 2002 24 Hours of Le Mans; Courage selected Cottaz, Derichebourg and Björk to drive their car, whilst Pescarolo ran Boullion, Lagorce and Bourdais {{in one of}} their C60-Peugeots, and Stéphane Ortelli, Ukyo Katayama and Éric Hélary drove their other car. Although the C60 of Ortelli/Katayama/Hélary succombed to engine trouble after 144 laps, the other Pescarolo-entered C60 finished tenth overall, and ninth in class whilst the Courage-entered C60 finished 15th overall, and 11th in class. Pescarolo reverted to a single-car entry for the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Magny-Cours, which, with Bourdais and Boullion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> finished in second; the Courage-entered car, driven by Cottaz and Derichebourg, succumbed to electrical issues before completing a lap. Courage did not run their car again, whilst Pescarolo's Boullion and Lagorce took third at the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Dijon, before Bourdais and Boullion finished the season with a victory at the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Spa. Courage finished the season tied with Dome on 97 points in the SR1 Constructor's Championship, but lost the title to Dome as they had won a single race less.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a braking and driving strategy {{based on the}} real time measurement of forces and moments <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>The</b> longitudinal forces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> are optimally distributed between {{the front and rear}} axles on the basis the actual vertical loads distribution. For implementing on 4 WD vehicles a standard ABS/traction control strategy (being the speed measurement of non-driven <b>wheels</b> not available), <b>the</b> vehicle longitudinal speed can be estimated via a vehicle model with relevant errors. The proposed strategy doesn’t rely on <b>wheel</b> slip information. <b>The</b> tire operating mode can be evaluated by measuring in real time the torque applied to <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> braking/traction force. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> spinning is detected and the actual friction coefficient estimated, as the tire vertical forces are measured in real time. In particular a six-components measuring wheel developed and patented <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Politecnico di Milano is applied. The proposed 4 WD ABS and traction control strategy is verified by means of computer simulations...|$|R

McLean ii A method of measuring the discomfort transmission of full-suspension mountain bikes is presented. This method reduces the effect of trail inconsistencies by normalizing the ride comfort measurement <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rider interface against the roughness of the trail input measured <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> Discomfort transmission is here defined as a single-number ratio of <b>the</b> discomfort experienced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> seat to <b>the</b> discomfort measurement <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> discomfort measurement <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>wheel</b> represents <b>the</b> vibrations that would be experienced if the suspension did not attenuate <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> vibrations. Some data is presented to demonstrate that discomfort transmission does reduce the effect of terrain variations. The results of a test program demonstrate that discomfort transmission is sensitive to different damping settings, bikes and riders. Some subjective testing is also presented...|$|R
