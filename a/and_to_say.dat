5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
25|$|When the United States became {{involved}} in World War II, many families of Japanese descent were moved from San Diego and other West Coast cities to internment camps in Arizona and other inland locations. Many of these Japanese-American children were patrons of the library. Breed noticed that before the children {{were sent to the}} camps, their behavior and manners had changed; the formerly outgoing and enthusiastic learners had become sullen and withdrawn. When the day came for the children's departure, many of them came to the library to return their library cards <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to Breed. She gave the children self-addressed stamped postcards and told them to write to her and to tell her what they needed. When the children wrote, she responded and sent them not only reading materials but personal items such as soap and toothbrushes as well. Many of her former library patrons were sent to the Poston War Relocation Center internment camp in Arizona, where she visited them multiple times.|$|E
25|$|Forgetting the raw gas {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that there was nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E

500|$|In 1804, Bonaparte was crowned the Emperor Napoleon after a {{plebiscite}} {{in which}} Lafayette did not participate. The retired general remained relatively quiet, although he made Bastille Day addresses. After the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson, by then president, {{asked if he}} would be interested in the governorship. Lafayette declined, citing personal problems and his desire to work for liberty in France. During a trip to Auvergne in 1807, Adrienne became ill, suffering from complications stemming from her time in prison. She became delirious but recovered enough on Christmas Eve to gather the family around her bed <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to Lafayette: [...] "Je suis toute à vous" [...] ("I am all yours").

500|$|Arthur Sifton's {{political}} {{style was}} to remain aloof and detached, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{no more than}} necessary; this cemented his reputation as [...] "the Sphinx". [...] He was authoritarian and, while he inspired respect, he was not loved; historian L. G. Thomas credits him with holding the Liberal Party together through his strength, but blames him for failing to heal its underlying divisions. [...] Sifton was originally selected as Premier {{in the hopes that}} he would lead the Liberal Party to continued dominance of provincial politics in Alberta. [...] His success in this regard was mixed: although he led the party to victory in the 1913 and 1917 elections, its majorities declined each time. Moreover, his victories were marred by accusations of unethical electoral tactics.|$|E
500|$|Aguilera's {{new image}} was so widely {{rejected}} by the public that it began to overshadow her music. Tim Walker from The Independent wrote: [...] " [...] simulated masturbation while wearing {{little more than a}} pair of leather chaps." [...] Entertainment Weekly described Aguilera's image in the video as [...] "the world's skeeziest reptile woman," [...] and The Village Voice captioned her as a xenomorph from the Alien series. Aguilera's contemporaries Shakira, Kelly Osbourne, and Jessica Simpson expressed disapproval of the video. Time magazine commented that [...] "she appeared to have arrived on the set... direct from an intergalactic hooker convention." [...] Jancee Dunn of Rolling Stone dubbed the video [...] "Girls Gone Wild: Beyond Thunderdome". Writer Emma Forrest remarked: [...] "What she's depicting is subcultures within sexuality, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that this is normal young woman's sexuality is just not fair. ...

[...] Here, for the first time, Starr exonerated both President Clinton and the First Lady of complicity in the FBI files matter, saying [...] "while there are outstanding issues that we are attempting to resolve with respect to one individual [...] found no evidence that anyone higher [...] was in any way involved in ordering the files from the FBI. Second, we have found no evidence that information contained in the files of former officials was used for an improper purpose."

500|$|When asked before {{publication}} {{about the}} forthcoming book, Rowling stated {{that she could}} not change the ending even if she wanted. [...] "These books have been plotted for such a long time, and for six books now, that they're all leading a certain direction. So, I really can't". She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, [...] "almost as though they are two-halves of the same novel". She has said that the last chapter of the book was written [...] "in something like 1990", as part of her earliest work on the series. Rowling also revealed she originally wrote the last words to be [...] "something like: 'Only those who he loved could see his lightning scar.

500|$|Many funeral processions {{were held}} in Ireland and even in a few British cities during the weeks {{following}} the executions, sometimes attracting crowds of thousands. These demonstrations {{of support for the}} three Fenians further outraged British public opinion, and [...] "reinforced the prevailing sentiment that the Irish moral compass was somehow off-center". The executions gave rise to an enormous groundswell of feeling among Irish communities the world over. In New Zealand, for instance, seven men were convicted of unlawful assembly in a high-profile trial following a mock funeral to Hokitika cemetery; two of the seven, a newspaper editor and a priest, pleaded guilty to seditious libel, having published [...] "a succession of very rabid articles about the Queen's Government." [...] The viceregal government declared the holding of a Manchester Martyr funeral procession illegal. Throughout Ireland Masses, even public ones, were said for the three, although Bishop David Moriarty of Kerry prohibited celebration of Mass for them in his diocese. Archbishop John MacHale of Tuam, on the other hand, personally assisted at a High Mass for them, and Cardinal Archbishop Paul Cullen of Dublin, while opposing public celebrations, instructed his priests to pray for the dead Fenians, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Mass privately for them.|$|E

500|$|On 1 December Sunderland beat Derby County 1–0. The defeat against Everton led to Craig Gordon {{being dropped}} from the side. He was {{replaced}} by Darren Ward who made a save to push Kenny Miller's strike onto the post. With the game looking to be heading towards a draw, Anthony Stokes scrambled to ball in to win the game. On 8 December Sunderland travelled to Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea. Sunderland went behind in the 23rd minute through an Andriy Shevchenko goal. Chelsea won the game 2–0 after Liam Miller was sent off whilst giving a penalty away, which Frank Lampard scored. Sunderland played Aston Villa on 15 December, Danny Higginbotham put Sunderland ahead with a 10th-minute header. Villa midfielder Shaun Maloney equalised when he scored a from a 71st minute free kick. Sunderland could have won the game late on, but Danny Collins' header was ruled out by referee Steve Bennett for a foul. Roy Keane displayed his annoyance at Bennett saying [...] "It sums up (the referee's) day. He was giving everything against us <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> we're disappointed would be an unbelievable understatement. You could sense he was waiting to blow his whistle. It {{would be nice to}} see him later." ...|$|E
500|$|Few female {{respondents}} reported engaging in sex {{play with their}} siblings, {{and it seemed to}} have no {{role in the development of}} sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to report having enjoyed typical girls' activities, but more likely to report having enjoyed typical boys' activities, such as football, and to describe themselves as having been very masculine while they were growing up. These and other variables were combined into a [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity" [...] measure, which proved to be the second strongest predictor of homosexuality. Bell et al. noted, however, that childhood gender nonconformity did not seem to have been important in the way proposed by psychoanalytic theory, in that it was not a crucial link between family influences and their respondents' sense of womanhood, and nor was it explained by relationships within the family. Homosexual women were more likely to recall having felt different from other girls their age during grade school and high school years, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that they felt different because they were more masculine than other girls, more interested in sports, or not interested in boys. Homosexual women were also more likely to have felt sexually different. However, these feelings did not appear to play a role in the development of female homosexuality. Homosexual women, unlike heterosexual women, were sometimes labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, but such labeling also appeared to play no significant role in the development of female homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I promise you that. But {{this is not the time}} to do it.... Give me a few days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E
