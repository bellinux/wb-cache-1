The couple, who did not have any children of their own, became the dominant influence on John's life.|$|E

5|$|At {{the edge}} of the Greenstead Parish {{boundary}} is Rovers Tye Farm, which has been documented as being established by 1353. A new causeway at this location had been built by 1429, by which point Ipswich Road ran on its current route. This road was turnpiked in 1725, when the road was predominantly rural in nature. In 1841, a prison, known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Correction or County Gaol, was built on the road to alleviate pressure on Colchester Castle, but it only held about 25 or 30 prisoners, both male and female, at any one time.|$|E

This system is similar to that used by many UK schools, including the one the author attended; Siddell has even stated that the school in which Gunnerkrigg Court takes place is modeled after his own secondary school.|$|E
5|$|Harry became {{interested}} in science fiction and read comics by candlelight (<b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> had no electricity), eventually joining the Liverpool Science Fiction Society. At the age of 13, he produced his own science fiction fanzine, Biped, using a Gestetner machine to print 60 copies. His pen friend {{at the time was}} Michael Moorcock; the writer of science fiction and fantasy novels. After winning a scholarship to the Junior School of Art in Gambier Terrace, Liverpool, Harry started his first school newspaper, Premier.|$|E

5|$|Several common {{birds in}} North America, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> sparrow, the rock pigeon, the European {{starling}} and the mute swan are introduced species, {{meaning that they}} are not native to this continent but were brought here by humans from Europe or elsewhere. Introduced species are marked on this list as (I). There may be species that have individual escapees or small feral populations in North America that are not on this list. This is especially true of birds that are commonly held as pets, such as parrots and finches.|$|E
5|$|Since {{birds are}} highly visible and common animals, humans {{have had a}} {{relationship}} with them since the dawn of man. Sometimes, these relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana. Other times, they may be commensal, as when species such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> sparrow have benefited from human activities. Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests, and some pose an aviation hazard. Human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds).|$|E

5|$|The Cape sparrow is social, {{lives in}} flocks, and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it {{spends much of}} the year {{wandering}} nomadically, in flocks of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost.|$|E

5|$|The rise of {{successful}} freedmen—through either political influence in imperial service, or wealth—is {{a characteristic of}} early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by , and by their ownership {{of some of the}} most lavish houses at Pompeii, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of the Vettii. The excesses of nouveau riche freedmen were satirized in the character of Trimalchio in the Satyricon by Petronius, who wrote in the time of Nero. Such individuals, while exceptional, are indicative of the upward social mobility possible in the Empire.|$|E
5|$|When Freddy Mike's {{statement}} {{became known}} to the public, various petitions and campaigns to free Williams were organised throughout the country. A petition containing 35,000 signatures requesting a reprieve {{was sent to the}} Home Secretary. As soon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons opened on 23 January 1913, McKenna was questioned by Labour, Conservative, and Liberal MPs. Robert Munro, MP for Wick Burghs, made a speech asking the Home Secretary {{to take into account the}} conflicting accounts, lack of any direct evidence, and the way the judge had directed the jury, and pardon Williams. In this he was supported by Will Crooks, the Marquess of Tullibardine, and Ian Macpherson.|$|E
5|$|A further {{testament}} to this devotion included Hasan-Jalal's commissioning of the Gandzasar Monastery. Construction {{of the monastery}} began in 1216 and lasted until 1238. On July 22, 1240, amid great celebration during Vardavar celebrations and {{in the presence of}} nearly 700 priests including Nerses, the Catholicos of Albania, the church was consecrated. The monastery {{went on to become the}} residence and sepulcher of the family as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> of the catholicos; beginning in the 15th century, the family also monopolized control over the seat of Catholicos itself, which would from thereon in pass down from uncle to nephew.

He married the daughter of Alan fitz Walter, a leading {{member of the family}} later known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Stewart—future monarchs of Scotland and England. Donnchadh was the first mormaer or earl of Carrick, a region he ruled for more than six decades, making him one of the longest serving magnates in medieval Scotland. His descendants include the Bruce and Stewart Kings of Scotland, and probably the Campbell Dukes of Argyll.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Councillors can veto a {{decision}} made by the House of Representatives, the House of Councillors can cause the House of Representatives to reconsider its decision. The House of Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overwriting the veto by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|E
