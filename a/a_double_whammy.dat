40|$|WHAT?S THE TAKEAWAY? The Texas {{franchise}} tax burdens taxpayers without generating sufficient tax revenue.

50|$|Interest rate risk is {{also present}} inside the trusts {{themselves}} on their balance sheets since many trusts hold very long term capital assets (pipelines, power plants, etc.), {{and much of the}} excess distributible income is derived from a duration mismatch between the life of the asset, and the life of the financing associated with it.

5000|$|The {{first single}} from {{the album was}} [...] "Whoopsie Daisy", {{produced}} by Remee and Cutfather & Joe. The song missed the UK Top 40 by one place, peaking at number 41. The second single was [...] "This Is My Time" [...] which featured a sample of Dynasty's [...] "Adventures in the Land of Music" [...] but the song was not commercially released, even though a music video was produced for the song. Despite a more mainstream direction, L.O.V.E performed worse on the UK Albums Chart than its predecessor, peaking at number 142.

40|$|There {{seems to}} be nothing short of <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>whammy</b> hitting the users of probability, and among them physicists, {{especially}} {{those involved in the}} foundations of quanta. First is the instant instinctual reaction that phenomena which interest one do sharply and clearly divide into the dichotomy of two and only two alternatives of being either "deterministic", or on the contrary, being "probabilistic". However, there is also a second, prior and yet deeper trouble, namely, the "probabilistic" case is strongly believed to be equally clear and well-founded as is the "deterministic" one. And the only difference seen between the two is that the latter can talk also about "individual" phenomena, while the former can only do so about large enough "ensembles" for which, however, it is believed to be equally clear, precise and rigorous with the "deterministic" approach. Or briefly, "probabilistic" is seen as nothing else but the "deterministic" on the level of "ensembles" [...] .|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Europe’s young, dynamic, high-growth {{firms are}} in a {{precarious}} position, despite their pivotal role in bringing radically new innovations to market. EU start-ups face higher entry and growth barriers than their coun-terparts in the United States, and consequently Europe has fewer young innovative companies (YICs) than the US. Those that Europe does have are less R&D intensive. The main barriers to innovation are access to finance and the difficulty that YICs have in accruing the benefits from their innova-tions. In the current crisis, YICs must also adapt to <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>whammy</b> of credit that is even more constrained than usual, and higher bankruptcy risk. Policymakers must provide support for these firms, and they must get their policy interventions right. POLICY CHALLENGE EU member state recovery programmes pay most attention to large, long-established firms, and all but ignore young, radical innovators. This short-term approach jeopardises the long-term benefits that breakthrough innova-tions can bring. An EU YIC programme should first and foremost deal with financial constraints, and should reward the risk-taking inherent in radical innovation. Such a programme could be targeted to particular policy areas – especially environmental technology development – would relate to the pre-commercialisation stage of projects, would involve phased financing, and would not include the typical EU stipulation that projects should involve cross-border collaboration. However, project applications and evaluation should be pooled at EU level to ensure highest standards of excellence in the selection procedure...|$|E
40|$|Albert O. Hirschman's {{principle}} of the Hiding Hand stands stronger and more celebrated today than ever. The principle states that ignorance is good in planning, because if decision makers knew the real costs and difficulties of projects, few ventures would ever get started. The paper presents the first systematic test of the {{principle of}} the Hiding Hand, including a test of whether Hirschman's theory may be replicated with more and better data. This was found not to be the case. First, statistical tests reject the {{principle of the}} Hiding Hand at an overwhelmingly high level of significance (p < 0. 0001). In reality, the exact opposite happens of what the principle states: instead of project success being secured by "creative error" and "beneficial ignorance"-where higher-than-estimated costs are outweighed by even higher-than-estimated benefits-the average project is in fact undermined by <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>whammy</b> of substantial cost overruns compounded by substantial benefit shortfalls. Second, Hirschman was found to have made the error of sampling on the dependent variable, undermining the validity of his findings. Third, Hirschman's sample of projects, on which he built his principle, is too small to support his wide conclusions. Fourth, Hirschman misrepresented his findings and misled his readers. In sum, the data do not support Hirschman's proposition that ignorance is good in planning. Ignorance is bad, if by bad we mean that ignorance leads to starting projects that should not have been started. Finally, the data also do not support an interpretation of Hirschman as an early behavioral economist, as proposed by Sunstein. Hirschman was a victim, not a student, of bias...|$|E
