50|$|KefC and KefB of E. coli are {{responsible}} for glutathione-gated K+ efflux. Each of these proteins consists of a transmembrane hydrophobic N-terminal domain, and a lesser conserved C-terminal hydrophilic domain. Each protein interacts with a second protein encoded by genes that overlap the gene encoding the primary transporter. The KefC ancillary protein is YabF while the KefB ancillary protein is YheR. These <b>ancillary</b> proteins stimulate <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> about 10-fold. These proteins are important for cell survival during exposure to toxic metabolites, possibly because they can release K+, allowing H+ uptake. Activation of the KefB or KefC K+ efflux system only occurs {{in the presence of}} glutathione and a reactive electrophile such as methylglyoxal or N-ethylmaleimide. Formation of the methylglyoxal-glutathione conjugate, S-lactoylglutathione, is catalyzed by glyoxalase I, and S-lactoylglutathione activates KefB and KefC. H+ uptake (acidification of the cytoplasm) accompanying or following K+ efflux may serve as a further protective mechanism against electrophile toxicity. Inhibition of transport by glutathione was enhanced by NADH.|$|R

In vitro phosphorylation of membranes in the presence of ATP and protein kinase A produced a stimulation of the reconstituted glucose <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> in plasma membranes and low-density microsomes (51 % and 65 % stimulation respectively), provided that the cells had been treated with insulin prior to isolation of the membranes. Conversely, treatment of membrane fractions with alkaline phosphatase produced an inhibition of reconstituted <b>transport</b> <b>activity.</b> However, in vitro phosphorylation catalysed by protein kinase C failed to alter reconstituted glucose <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> in membrane fractions from both basal and insulin-treated cells. In experiments run under identical conditions, the phosphorylation state of GLUT 4 was investigated by immunoprecipitation of glucose transporters from membrane fractions incubated with [32 P]ATP and protein kinases A and C. Protein kinase C stimulated a marked phosphate incorporation into GLUT 4 in both plasma membranes and low-density microsomes. Protein kinase A, in contrast to its effect on reconstituted glucose <b>transport</b> <b>activity,</b> produced a much smaller phosphorylation of the GLUT 4 in plasma membranes than in low-density microsomes.

Antagonism of the endocannabinoid- 1 receptor (CB 1 R) leads to a transient reduction in food intake, a sustained decrease in body weight and an improvement in metabolic parameters in animal models of obesity. Skeletal muscle is the primary tissue involved in glucose uptake in response to insulin, and insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle is vital to the maintenance of whole-body euglycemia. Little is known regarding the effects of CB 1 R antagonism on skeletal muscle glucose <b>transport</b> <b>activity.</b> The purpose of this dissertation was to test the hypothesis that antagonism of the CB 1 R activates signaling molecules of the insulin signaling pathway to increase glucose <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> in normal and insulin-resistant skeletal muscle, thereby improving whole-body glucose tolerance. CB 1 R antagonism with SR 141716 directly enhanced basal and insulin-stimulated glucose <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> in skeletal muscle from lean and obese Zucker while activation of the CB 1 R with ACEA, decreased glucose <b>transport</b> <b>activity.</b> Key proteins associated with regulation of glucose <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> were not altered by either CB 1 R agonism (ACEA) or antagonism (SR 141716). Chronic CB 1 R antagonist treatment (10 mg/kg SR 141716 i. p. / 14 days) also enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> in skeletal muscle of both lean and obese animals, again with no alteration in relevant signaling factors. Plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) were decreased in chronically-treated lean and obese animals and whole-body insulin sensitivity was improved in obese Zucker rats. The enhanced insulin sensitivity seen in chronically-treated obese animals was associated with a dramatic reduction in insulin secretion following a glucose challenge. Acute CB 1 R antagonism in obese animals also elicited a reduction in insulin secretion following a glucose challenge; however, with no improvement of whole-body insulin sensitivity. Acute CB 1 R antagonist treatment did not alter skeletal muscle glucose <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> or circulating FFAs for any animals. These data suggest that although CB 1 R antagonism directly enhances basal and insulin stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle of lean and obese rats, direct action on the skeletal muscle is not responsible for the improvement in insulin-stimulated glucose <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> and whole-body insulin sensitivity seen in chronically-treated obese animals...|$|R

40|$|This {{project was}} based on our {{discovery}} that sucrose acts as a signaling molecule that regulates the activity of a proton-sucrose symporter in sugar beet leaf tissue. A major objective here was determining how sucrose transporter activity is being regulated. When sucrose accumulates in the phloem sucrose <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> drops dramatically. Western blots of plasma membrane proteins isolated from sucrose treated leaves showed {{that the loss of}} sucrose <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> was proportional to a decline in symporter abundance, demonstrating that sucrose transport is regulated by changes in the amount of BvSUT 1 protein. BvSUT 1 transcript levels decreased in parallel with the loss of sucrose <b>transport</b> <b>activity.</b> Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrated that BvSUT 1 gene transcription was repressed significantly in nuclei from leaves fed 100 mM exogenous sucrose, showing that sucrose-dependent modulation of BvSUT 1 mRNA levels is mediated by changes in transcription. To identify which secondary messenger systems might be involved in regulating symporter activity, we used a variety of pharmacological agents to probe for a role of calcium or protein phosphorylation in sucrose signaling. In a detailed analysis, only okadaic acid altered sucrose <b>transport</b> <b>activity.</b> These results suggest a protein phosphatase is involved. We hypothesized that protein kinase inhibitors would have a neutral affect or increase symporter transcription. Transpirational feeding of the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine had no impact on sucrose transport while calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, caused a 60 % increase. These data provided good evidence that protein phosphorylation plays a central role in regulating sucrose symporter expression and sucrose <b>transport</b> <b>activity.</b> To determine whether protein phosphorylation is involved in sucrose regulation of proton-sucrose symporter activity, we pre-fed leaves with staurosporine for 4 h and then fed the treated leaves water or 100 mM sucrose for an additional 20 h. Sucrose <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> was higher than the water control in both staurosporine/water- and staurosporine/sucrose-fed leaves. In contrast, sucrose <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> was only 40 % of the water control in sucrose-fed leaves.

Peak B appeared {{to coincide with the}} peak of UDPGal:N-acetylglucosamine galactosyltransferase, a marker of the Golgi apparatus. Peak A was considerably smaller than peak B under basal conditions. When cells were exposed to 1 nM insulin for 5 min before homogenization, the height of peak A increased whereas that of peak B decreased. Insulin had no significant effect on the galactosyltransferase activity. The Km values of glucose transport facilitated by the activities in peaks A and B were both approximately 10 - 15 mM. These results imply that insulin facilitates translocation of the <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> from an intracellular storage site to the plasma membrane...|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of {{the efficiency of the}} L-alanine and L-malate transport systems was undertaken with the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum grown on the amino acid whose uptake was measured. An all-glass apparatus was constructed for measuring <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> under anaerobic conditions. L-Alanine <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> decreased under conditions of Mg 2 + depletion. When cells were allowed to become inactive by suspending them in the dark in Mg 2 +-free buffer, full activity could be restored with a few minutes by adding 20 mM Mg 2 + and illuminating the cells. The <b>transport</b> <b>activity</b> was completely inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and by ammonia. The quantum yield for the uptake of either L-alanine or L-malate was 0. 015 molecules per photon. The results are discussed in relation to the expected efficiencies for metabolite transport and regulation by Mg 2 +...|$|R
