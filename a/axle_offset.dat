50|$|All Dana 18s have {{front and}} rear outputs offset {{to the right side}}. Most {{vehicles}} built with a Dana 18 have the rear <b>axle</b> <b>offset</b> to the right side to accommodate this. Most other transfer cases used in Jeeps have a centered rear output that lines up with the input shaft. The Dana 18 always has gears turning, which makes it noisier then some other transfer cases when in two-wheel-drive mode.|$|E
50|$|The {{drive shafts}} {{were laid out}} like the US6, but as a mirror image, the front <b>axle</b> {{differential}} was <b>offset</b> to the left, while American trucks were offset to the right. Air brakes were used, on the ZiL-157 the air system also supplied the centralized inflation system.|$|R
50|$|Stephenson's 'steam suspension' {{provided}} each {{wheel with}} its own 'steam spring'. Vertical cylinders were set into {{the base of the}} boiler, above each <b>axle</b> and <b>offset</b> in pairs to the sides. The chassis or frames of Stephenson's locomotives provided little structural strength, most of which came from the shell of the boiler. Inside each cylinder a piston carried the load of the axle and pressed upwards against steam pressure within the boiler. A piston of only a few inches in diameter was sufficient to balance the locomotive's weight. The axlebox bearings could slide vertically within hornblocks attached to the wooden frame beneath the boiler.|$|R
50|$|Running {{the bridge}} out is {{effected}} by pushing it along its rails until the outer two wheels {{are at the}} edge of the granite sill of the ditch. When the bridge is pushed beyond this point the two outer wheels do not descend the slopes of the granite slabs but instead the bridge remains in a horizontal position. This is due to the centre <b>axle</b> being <b>offset</b> from the centre of the girders causing the bridge to run on its inner two wheels. The middle two wheels follow along the trays. When the bridge is just less than halfway out, the ends of the centre axle then engage in the cups of the lifting arms. The middle two wheels partially descend the slopes of the granite sill. The bridge continues to move out, its outer end dipping below the horizontal, its inner wheels still running along the trays of the courtyard. The weight of the bridge, at the point where the centre of gravity of the lifting arms is beyond the pivot point of the arms and the stays, causes the bridge mechanism to descend, its wheels running up the vertical racers set into the wall of the pit. At a point where the inner wheels are at the top of the slope down the granite sill, the outer ends of the girders and the outer wheels hit curved sprung metal guides.These guide the outer end of the bridge upwards so that the ends of the girders come to rest on the lip of the granite slab, the inner wheels descending the slope of the inner granite slab. The inner end of each girder is angled to form a close fit with the granite slab.|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} we {{consider}} an approximate transmission. The work {{is aimed at}} development of gear-powered transmission on parallel axes, which is RF patent-protected. The paper justifies a relevance of the synthesis of new kinds of engagement with the simplified geometry of the contacting condition. A typical solution for powered mechanisms received by F. L. Livinin and his disciples is characterized. The paper describes {{the arrangement of the}} coordinate systems used to obtain the function of the position of the gear-powered transmission consisting of two wheels with fifteen leads. For them, also the coordinates of the contact points are obtained, and errors of function of the position in tooth changeover are calculated. To obtain the function position was used a method of matrix transformation and equality of radius and unit normal vectors at the contact point. This transmission can be used in mechanical and instrumentation engineering, and other sectors of the economy. Both reducers and multipliers can be made on its basis. It has high manufacturability (with no special equipment required for its production), and a displacement function is close to linear. This article describes the influence of the axle spacing error {{on the quality of the}} transmission characteristics. The paper presents the graphic based relationships and tabular estimates for nominal <b>axle</b> spacing and <b>offsets</b> within ï‚± 0. 2 mm. This error of axle spacing is significant for gearing. From the results of this work we can say that the transmission is almost insensitive to errors of axle spacing. Engagement occurs without an exit of contact point on the lead edge. To solve the obtained system of equations, the numerical methods of the software MathCAD package have been applied. In the future, the authors expect to consider other possible manufacturing and mounting errors of gear-powered transmission (such as the error of the step, misalignment, etc.) to assess their impact on the quality of engagement. </p...|$|R
