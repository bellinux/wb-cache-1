40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1963 the Materials Department noted the three to four ·year old {{concrete}} pavement on I- 80 in Cass County was showing extensive surface cracking adjacent to joints and cracks.

Blue-line cracking was found on some primary pavement and the indications of incipient cracks were seen on I- 29 in Pottawattamie County, north of Council Bluffs. A good "D"-crack pattern is now evident. Surveys were then made of the entire Interstate concrete pavement.
