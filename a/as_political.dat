5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was {{the realization that}} the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles <b>as</b> <b>political</b> and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E
5|$|As a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Rudolphine Tables {{and the related}} Ephemerides, Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld. In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather as well <b>as</b> <b>political</b> events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions. By 1624, however, the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>political</b> {{awareness}} {{among the}} black majority {{on the island}} spread, so did bebop, a kind of jazz which was associated, in the United States, with social activism and Afrocentrism.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>political</b> {{tensions}} escalated in {{the years}} leading to World War II, the Belgian government again announced its intention to remain neutral {{in the event of}} war in Europe. The military was reorganised into a defensive force and the country left several international military treaties it had joined in the aftermath of World War I. Construction began of defences in the east of the country. When France and Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Belgium remained strictly neutral while mobilising its reserves.|$|E
5|$|Bucer {{believed}} that the Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by Charles V, he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, <b>as</b> <b>political</b> events led to the Schmalkaldic War and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the Augsburg Interim, which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.|$|E
5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by God to serve not merely <b>as</b> <b>political</b> or {{military}} leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations were created to reflect and enable these alleged connections; however, the belief systems {{that gave birth to}} them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism and the rise of constitutionalism and democracy. During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E

The album expresses other topics such as Jay-Z's thoughts on fatherhood, West's reflection on being deemed a social villain, and their success as performers. Music writers interpreted the subject matter to concern the rappers' plight as African Americans struggling with financial success in America.|$|E

Aiming to achieve ecclesiastical as well <b>as</b> <b>political</b> {{independence}} from East Frankish influence, his successor Rastislav asked the Byzantine emperor Michael III for missionaries. As a result, Cyril and Methodius arrived in Moravia in 863 and commenced missionary activities among the Slavic people there. To further their goals, the brothers developed a written Slavic liturgical language: Old Church Slavonic, which employed the Glagolitic alphabet created by them. They translated the Bible and other church texts into this language, thus establishing a foundation for the later Slavic Eastern Orthodox churches.|$|E
