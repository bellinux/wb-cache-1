40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{performed}} in a climatic chamber to evaluate the combined effects of noise intensity, heat stress, workload, and exposure duration on both noise-induced temporary threshold shift (TTS) and the recovery time by adopting Taguch’s method. Fourteen subjects without previous significant noise exposure and smoking history were recruited {{to participate in this}} study. All hearing threshold levels at eight different frequencies (250 to 8, 000 Hz) of better ear were measured in an <b>audiometric</b> <b>booth</b> by using the ascending method in 2 dB steps before each exposure condition. The test was also carried out after exposure to evaluate TTS at various times. The TTS recovery tim...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{machines}} are typical noisy sources causing discomfort and {{risk to the}} workers’ health. Studying in what extent individual hearing protection devices influences, or not, the perception of alarms in industrial environments and {{in the presence of}} background noise was the main aim of this work. The warning signal used was a warning signal from a textile finishing machine and the background noise was produced by a white noise generator. The tests were performed with the subjects in an <b>audiometric</b> <b>booth</b> using different hearing protection devices. The obtained results shown evidence that, under the used test conditions, earplugs and passive earmuffs were the devices showing less interference with the perception of warning signals in the presence of background noise. At the same time {{it was found that the}} active (level dependent) earmuffs interfere with the perception of the warning signal in the same conditions...|$|E
40|$|International {{standards}} define {{normal hearing}} threshold levels (HTLs) and many studies describe speech recognition in noise (SRN) for adults. Less {{has been published}} on these characteristics for children. This study aims to establish ranges of HTLs and SRN for otologically normal 7 -year-olds. Air conduction HTLs were measured in 189 7 -year-olds within an <b>audiometric</b> <b>booth.</b> Speech recognition was measured adaptively for BKB sentences in noise presented binaurally through headphones, determining the speech-to-noise ratio (SNR) required to score 71 % correct. The mean HTLs of otologically normal 7 -year-olds were significantly lower (better) than those published for young adults at 1 and 2 kHz. Speech recognition in noise was unrelated to HTLs and was higher (worse) for 7 -year-olds (SNR?=??? 4 dB) than has been found for young otologically normal adults (SNR?=??? 6 dB). It is concluded that although the HTLs of 7 -year-old children are generally better than those of young adults, their speech recognition in noise is worse. This confirms that their ability to recognise speech in noise is not fully developed at this age...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [38]- 40) Ambient {{noise levels}} were measured within 13 <b>audiometric</b> test <b>booths</b> contained in 12 different industrial mobile test vans and trailers {{operating in the}} Midwest. These levels were recorded manually in octave bands and tape recorded for third octave spectral analysis at a later time. The resulting levels were compared with the 1983 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Maximum Permissible Ambient Noise Levels (MPANLs) and the MPANLs in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) S 3. 1 - 1991 to determine if each booth was in compliance with these standards. The results indicated that all 13 (100 %) of the industrial mobile test vans and trailers evaluated in the study complied with 1983 OSHA permissible levels. With regard to the 1991 ANSI MPANLs, 5 (38 %) of the 13 booths were in compliance at all frequencies. Those that failed did so at 125, 250, and 500 Hz. The data were evaluated {{in regard to the}} MPANLs suggested by the National Hearing Conservation Association in 1996. It was determined that all 13 (100 %) booths were in compliance with the new NHCA criteria. Since 1983 OSHA and 1996 NHCA MPANLs do not extend below 500 Hz, MPANLs were proposed for 250 and 125 Hz based on the concept of the upward spread of masking. The data were evaluated in regard to the proposed MPANLs, and all 13 (100 %) of the booths were in compliance. The ambient levels outside the mobile units were also gathered for informational purposes. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R
40|$|Conclusions: The Bonebridge (R) (BB) {{transcutaneous}} bone conductive implant (BCI) may overcome some of {{the issues}} related to a percutaneous BCI, such as management of the external screw, delayed activation or possible skin complications. Moreover, it has been shown to enable a functional outcome similar to percutaneous BCI in both conductive and mixed types of hearing loss. Objectives: To obtain clinical data from a preliminary series of patients implanted with a new transcutaneous BCI. Methods: Four subjects affected by conductive/mixed hearing loss underwent implantation of the BB by two approaches: the transmastoid, presigmoid approach and the retrosigmoid approach. Soundfield thresholds were assessed with warble tones in a soundproof <b>audiometric</b> <b>booth,</b> and word recognition scores (WRSs) as speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were used to compare the unaided versus the post-implantation condition. Results: The surgical procedure was completed in all cases, with only minor intraoperative divergence from the CT-based planning and no postoperative complications. The average improvement of the SRT in quiet with the BB in comparison to the unaided condition was 36. 25 dB. All the implanted subjects reached SRT values below 65 dB, indicating a better understanding in quiet, with 100 % word recognition...|$|E
40|$|The global {{need for}} {{increased}} hearing health care currently far exceeds {{the capacity for}} delivering these services, especially in developing countries where the ratio of audiologists to the population is often less than one per every million. The imbalance is further compounded by the requirement for diagnostic assessments to be conducted in an audiometric (sound proof) booth, as {{a large proportion of}} the population has limited access to centres where these booths can be found. A tele-audiology approach utilising a portable diagnostic audiometer could provide the solution, enabling hearing assessments to be conducted remotely and without an <b>audiometric</b> <b>booth.</b> This would obviate the necessity for people from rural communities having to travel long distances, often with great difficulty and at great expense, to the nearest sound (<b>audiometric)</b> <b>booth.</b> An additional advantage would be that an audiologist could service a range of remote communities at the same time. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of pure tone air conduction (AC) thresholds obtained using a synchronous telehealth approach without a sound booth in a rural South African community. Hearing thresholds in a sound booth and in a natural environment were obtained from an initial sample of 20 adults (range 19 to 63 years; mean age 50 ± 13 years; 55 % female), recruited from a rural agricultural community. A subgroup of ten adults (20 ears) volunteered for the tele-audiology threshold testing. AC thresholds (250 - 8000 Hz) were determined and subsequently compared in these environments. Typical threshold variability was determined using test-retest correspondence as a reference for the threshold correspondence using a telehealth mode. Test-retest threshold correspondence in the booth and natural environments were within ± 5 dB in 96. 7 % and 97. 5 % of comparisons respectively. No significant differences were noted when AC hearing thresholds determined in the telehealth configuration were compared to those recorded in the gold standard booth environment. Threshold correspondence between the telehealth environment on the one hand and booth and natural environments on the other hand were within ± 5 dB in 82 % and 85 % of comparisons, respectively. The current study is the first of its kind to report synchronous telehealth hearing assessments conducted in a natural environment in a rural community. It demonstrates the validity of using synchronous tele-audiology for conducting hearing assessments in a remote rural agricultural community without a sound booth. It also highlights the potential for using non-clinical facilitators in remote locations, which could reduce the burden on the limited number of audiologists. These technologies make it possible for diagnostic hearing assessments to be included as part of a remote telemedicine kit and open up new possibilities in telehealth and tele-audiology support.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 10 % of the global population is impaired to a significant degree by a decrease in hearing sensitivity. With the greatest proportion of these persons residing in developing countries where communities are grossly underserved, it is incumbent on hearing healthcare professionals to seek means of offering equitable hearing health care services to these communities. The delivery of conventional diagnostic hearing services to these population groups is challenged by limitations in human resources, financial constraints and by the dearth of audiometric testing facilities that are compliant with permissible ambient noise levels for reliable testing. Valid diagnostic hearing assessment without an <b>audiometric</b> test <b>booth</b> will allow greater mobility of services and could extend hearing healthcare service delivery in underserved areas. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the validity of diagnostic pure tone audiometry in a natural environment, outside a sound treated room, using a computer-operated audiometer with insert earphones covered by circumaural earcups incorporating real-time monitoring of environmental noise. A within-subject repeated measures research design was employed to assess elderly adults with diagnostic air (250 to 8000 Hz) and bone (250 to 4000 Hz) conduction pure tone audiometry. The study was of a quantitative nature and the required data was collected by testing subjects initially in a natural environment and subsequently in a sound booth environment to compare the threshold measurements. One experienced audiologist used audiometric KUDUwave test equipment to evaluate subjects in both environments. A total of 147 adults with an average age of 76 (± 5. 7) years were tested. Ears had pure tone averages (500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz) of ≥ 25 dB in 59 %, > 40 dB in 23 % and ˃ 55 dB in 6 % of cases. Analysis of collected data showed air conduction thresholds (n = 2259) corresponding within 0 to 5 dB in 95 % of all comparisons between testing in the natural and sound booth environments. Bone conduction thresholds (n = 1669) corresponded within 0 to 5 dB in 86 % of comparisons and within 10 dB or less in 97 % of cases. Average threshold differences (– 0. 6 to 1. 1) and standard deviations (3. 3 to 5. 9) were within typical test-retest reliability limits. Recorded thresholds showed no statistically significant differences with a paired samples t-test (p ˃ 0. 01) except at 8000 Hz in the left ear. Overall the correlation between the air-conduction thresholds recorded in the sound booth environment and the natural environment was very high (˃ 0. 92) across all frequencies while for bone conduction threshold correlation for the two environments fell between 0. 63 and 0. 97. This study demonstrates that valid diagnostic pure tone audiometry in an elderly population can be performed in a natural environment using an audiometer employing insert earphones covered by circumaural earcups with real-time monitoring of ambient noise levels. Mobile diagnostic audiometry performed outside of an <b>audiometric</b> sound <b>booth</b> may extend current hearing healthcare services to remote underserved communities where booths are scarce or inaccessible. In combination with Telehealth applications this technology could offer a powerful and viable alternate diagnostic service to persons unable to attend conventional testing facilities for whatever reasons.
