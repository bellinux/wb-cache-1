An <b>axicon</b> images a point source into a line along the optic axis, or transforms a laser beam into a ring.

In this paper, a novel optical setup based on <b>axicons</b> is proposed to convert linearly polarized beam into cylindrical vector beam directly.

50|$|<b>Axicons</b> {{are also}} used in optical trapping. The ring of light creates {{attractive}} and repulsive forces which can trap and hold microparticles and cells {{in the center of}} the ring.|$|R
50|$|As with a plane wave, a true Bessel beam {{cannot be}} created, {{as it is}} {{unbounded}} and would require an infinite amount of energy. Reasonably good approximations can be made, however, and these are important in many optical applications because they exhibit little or no diffraction over a limited distance. Approximations to Bessel beams are made in practice either by focusing a Gaussian beam with an <b>axicon</b> lens to generate a Bessel-Gauss beam, by using axisymmetric diffraction gratings, or by placing a narrow annular aperture in the far field. High order Bessel beams can be generated by spiral diffraction gratings.|$|E

We fabricated <b>axicon</b> micro lenses on a single-mode bare optical fiber by selective chemical etching technique. The laser beam from fiber <b>axicon</b> microlens was strongly focused and optical forces were sufficient {{to move a}} microorganisms and biological cells without physical contact. The apex angle of the chemically etched fiber <b>axicon</b> microlens was very important parameter for laser trapping.

This is made possible from the monolithic integration of spiral phase plates and <b>axicons</b> into helical <b>axicons</b> by direct laser writing using femtosecond laser nanopolymerization. The optical performances of the fabricated three-dimensional singular microstructures are experimentally measured and compared with their expected theoretical behavior, both in intensity and phase.

Nearly diffractionless beams have been generated from a Ti : sapphire, 100 fs, laser system by focussing ring-type radiation, {{which has been}} produced in two different ways: either, by inserting an annular slit into the incident Gaussian beam, or by placing a doublet of <b>axicons</b> in a vertex-to-vertex configuration before the focussing lens.

40|$|International audienceWhen {{illuminated}} by a plane wave, continuously self-imaging gratings (CSIGs) produce a field whose intensity profile is a propagation- and wavelength-invariant biperiodic array of bright spots. In {{the case of}} an extended and incoherent source, we show that CSIGs produce multiple images of the source. The fundamental properties of these gratings will be derived. In particular, methods to assess the image quality in angle of CSIGs will be introduced. it turns out that this new type of pinhole-array camera works on the same principle as diffractive <b>axicons,</b> which are known to produce wavelength-invariant nondiffracting beams. The formalism developed for CSIGS will be also extended to <b>axicons.</b> CSIGs and <b>axicons</b> both produce focal lines and can be robust in field, in compensation of a trade-off with the resolution. They also offer interesting properties in terms of compactness, achromaticity and long depth of focus for imaging systems. However, compared to classical imaging systems, they produce degraded images and an image processing is necessary to restore these images. Experimental images obtained with these components in the visible and infrared spectral ranges will be presented...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBy {{immersing}} {{a conventional}} glass <b>axicon</b> in index-matching liquid, we generated high quality, tunable, quasi-non-diffracting Bessel beams. The aberrations {{resulting from the}} roundness of the <b>axicon</b> tip are minimized when a large base angle is used in liquid-immersion. This configuration also allows coarse and fine tunability through changing the liquid and adjusting the temperature, respectively. Our experimental results match very well with calculated intensity profiles.

40|$|Axicons {{have been}} {{proposed}} for imaging applications since they offer the advantage of extended depth of field (DOF). This enhanced DOF comes {{at the cost of}} degraded image quality. Image processing has been proposed to improve the image quality. Initial efforts were focused on the use of an <b>axicon</b> in a borescope thereby extending depth of focus and eliminating the need for a focusing mechanism. Though promising, it is clear that image processing would lead to improved image quality. This would also eliminate the need, in certain applications, for a fiber optic imaging bundle as many modern day video borescopes use an imaging sensor coupled directly to the front end optics. In the present work, three types of refractive axicons are examined: a linear <b>axicon,</b> a logarithmic <b>axicon</b> and a Fresnel <b>axicon.</b> The linear <b>axicon</b> offers the advantage of simplicity and a significant amount of scientific literature including the application of image restoration techniques. The Fresnel <b>axicon</b> has the advantage of compactness and potential low cost of production. As no physical prior examples of the Fresnel axicons were available for experimentation until recently, very little literature exists. The logarithmic <b>axicon</b> has the advantage of nearly constant longitudinal intensity distribution and an aspheric design producing superior pre-processed images over the aforementioned elements. Point Spread Functions (PSFs) for each of these axicons have been measured. These PSFs form the basis for the design of digital image restoration filters. The performance of these three optical elements and a number of restoration techniques are demonstrated and compared. Master of Science (MASc) in Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} the intensity distribution of a laser beam, after its propagation through a real <b>axicon.</b> We show that, while an ideal <b>axicon</b> generates Bessel-like radial intensity profile and smooth on-axis intensity around the focal region, in practice, the bluntness of {{the tip of the}} <b>axicon</b> causes significant deviations from these profiles. In particular, strong oscillations occur on the on-axis intensity. The input beam size also plays a strong role; for small beams the <b>axicon</b> acts more like a conventional lens, while for the large ones, it exhibits two focal regions. We also propose scheme for apodization. In all cases, the experiments match closely with the calculations. Our results show that axicons cannot be assumed to always generate smooth on-axis intensities and the structures coming from the real profiles should be taken into account for most applications...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel method to {{generate}} switchable optical trapping by together tight focusing of two noncoherent cylindrical vector beams, which were produced by {{two pairs of}} <b>axicons</b> with polarizing films.

40|$|International audienceWe {{show that}} by {{focusing}} ultrashort-pulsed laser beams in air with an <b>axicon,</b> relatively long plasma channels can be generated. The <b>axicon</b> generates Bessel-like beams, where the on-axis intensity stays high over distances much longer compared to focusing with conventional lenses.
