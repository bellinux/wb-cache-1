40|$|National audienceThis paper {{deals with}} multiagent {{self-organization}} giving adaptive features to a distributed system embodied in an <b>agressive</b> <b>environment.</b> It proposes an original approach of open multiagent {{systems in the}} context of wireless networks of intelligent sensors. Such networks are composed by sensors with independant energy sources. These networks need routing techniques which minimize communication energy cost with a strong fault tolerant feature. The paper presents finally the simulation platform, which we built, who allows us to compare our solution based on self-organization and common ad hoc routing protocols...|$|E

Linkages {{will have to be}} developed with research, and all other partners in the agricultural development process. A Resource Profile Study will be carried out and a capacity building programme implemented to enhance technical support for an efficient and effective service to the community. THE INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT With the advent of trade liberalisation and the removal of many protective trade barriers, Mauritius will operate and carry out its economic and export-based activities in a very competitive and <b>agressive</b> <b>environment.</b> We have a number of handicaps including the following: 1. the island is small, and agricultural land is almost fully used. 2. the population is small, therefore the internal market is small. 3. our main export markets are far away. However, we do have a number of strategic advantages also, some of which are: 1. the state has a vast expanse of sea territory (as yet untapped?). 2. internal stability (political and social). 3. the will to face the challenge. 4. experience in agricultural production and export. Though {{there is a lot of}} uncertainty ahead, there is also a lot of optimism and opportunities. THE LOCAL CONTEXT Agriculture is still dominated by the sugar industry but there has been an important agricultural diversification effort. There is now an urgent need to reinforce diversification not only as a response to the international context but also as an adaptation strategy, as other sectors of the economy (industry, tourism and services) are putting a lot of pressure on the availability and price of resources to agriculture. In the above environment, DARE is responsible for non-sugar agricultural research and extension. The research component has been covered earlier by the other representatives of DARE. This paper presents the view on extension and advisory activities...|$|E
