5000|$|... #Caption: 1951 XK120 {{roadster}} racing at Silverstone has {{a single}} <b>aero</b> <b>screen</b> mounted behind the removable full-width windscreen ...|$|E
5000|$|Typically {{handmade}} in aluminium on a tubular frame, {{the classic}} barchetta body is devoid of bumpers and any weather {{equipment such as}} a canvas top or sidescreens, and has no provision for luggage. Some barchettas have no windscreen; others, a shallow racing-type screen or <b>aero</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 30 May 1949, on {{the empty}} Ostend-Jabbeke {{motorway}} in Belgium, a prototype XK120 timed by the officials of the Royal Automobile Club of Belgium achieved an average of runs in opposing directions of 132.6 mph with the windscreen replaced by just one small <b>aero</b> <b>screen</b> and a catalogued alternative top gear ratio, and 135 mph with a passenger-side tonneau cover in place. In 1950 and 1951, at a banked oval track in France, XK120 roadsters averaged over 100 mph for 24 hours and over 130 mph for an hour, and in 1952 a fixed-head coupé took numerous world records for speed and distance when it averaged 100 mph for a week.|$|E
50|$|Sports or racing cars would {{sometimes}} have <b>aero</b> <b>screens,</b> which were small semi-circular or rectangular windshields. These were often mounted in pairs behind a foldable flat windshield. <b>Aero</b> <b>screens</b> are usually less than 8 in in height. They {{are known as}} <b>aero</b> <b>screens</b> because they only deflect the wind. The twin aeroscreen setup (often called Brooklands) was popular among older sports and modern cars in vintage style.|$|R
50|$|The W152, {{does not}} have any doors (and on most cars) nor a windscreen, instead it uses two small Brooklands <b>aero</b> <b>screens</b> in the style of those classic Formula 1 cars. It has two seats which share a backrest.|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the three}} team cars was {{designed}} around its intended driver integrating each driver’s requirements and preferences. The asymmetrically inclined valves (inlet 20 degrees and outlet 40 degrees from vertical) were a significant departure for Henry and may be attributable to Sunbeam and Coatalen whose interest in desaxé configuration dated to 1911. Another unusual detail was the engine mounted directly on the chassis frame similarly to the 1921 'invincible Talbot-Darracq'. Following tests in Brooklands and Isle of Man prior to the Grand Prix, modifications were instigated to the tail support bracket. Different carburetor configurations and different tyre types were tried, axle ratios experimented with, <b>aero</b> <b>screens</b> and mudguards were installed or removed as required.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Roadster was {{an occasional}} four-seat, two-door tourer, mostly {{based on the}} Bantam saloon with a cheery character. It had Singer's overhead camshaft, 1074 cc inline-four engine used in the Bantam range but tuned slightly to give [...] at 5000 rpm by fitting a high efficiency [...] "hot-spot" [...] manifold and downdraught SU carburettor, as well as having slightly higher compression. For 1940 sliding glass panels replaced the celluloid in the sidescreens along with other equipment improvements. A chromed front bumper was now standard as were twin <b>aero</b> <b>screens</b> for use when the windscreen was folded flat to reduce frontal area. A fitted suitcase was supplied {{to take full advantage}} of the usable space in the luggage compartment. Performance was handicapped by the use of the Bantam's three speed gearbox and top speed was in the order of 65 mph.|$|R
