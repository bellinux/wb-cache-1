In the fall of 1837 a friend sold him a sizable property in Williamsburg. Unable to remain away from politics, Tyler successfully sought election to the House of Delegates and took his seat in 1838. He was a national political figure by this point, and his third delegate service touched on such national issues as the sale of public lands.|$|E
5|$|However he {{struggled}} with poor form during the 1950–51 season as his first marriage was coming to <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> he came into increasing conflict with his teammates. He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 – breaking Lawton's own transfer record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club's directors. He {{also found that the}} well paid job he was promised outside of football did not transpire. His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950–51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951–52 was disappointing, and he was made available for transfer.|$|E

There were reports that Mubarak's proclamation came after President Barack Obama's special envoy, Frank G. Wisner, told Mubarak the U.S. saw his presidency at <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> urged him to prepare for an orderly transition to real democracy. In the past, Mubarak had said {{he would continue to}} serve Egypt until his last breath.|$|E

Freedom of worship for Catholics in England, however, continued to be a major objective of Spanish policy, causing constant dilemmas for James, distrusted abroad for repression of Catholics while at home being encouraged by the Privy Council to show even less tolerance towards them.|$|E

5|$|Revie {{returned}} to the First Division when he joined Leeds United in November 1958 for a £14,000 fee. Manager Bill Lambton had hoped that Revie's creativity would help the Peacocks to turn their poor form around, and appointed him as captain. Leeds avoided relegation in 1958–59, but new manager Jack Taylor took Leeds down in the 1959–60 campaign with the division's worst defensive record. Revie recognised his playing days were coming to <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> relinquished the captaincy to Freddie Goodwin.|$|E
5|$|The film marked {{something}} of an {{end of an era}} for its creator. The director himself recognized this {{at the time of its}} release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind had just come to <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E

Less than two weeks after the battle a general truce brought major combat operations in the country to <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> on 5 May the German commander in chief in the Netherlands surrendered to the Canadian Army. Three days later Germany unconditionally surrendered, bringing the war in Europe to a close.|$|E

The Russians withdrew to the {{northeast}} to await reinforcements and to link up with surviving Austrian units. The French followed and captured Vienna on 12 November. On 2 December the decisive French victory at Austerlitz removed Austria from the war. The resulting Treaty of Pressburg in late December brought the Third Coalition to <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> left Napoleonic France as the major power in Central Europe, leading to the War of the Fourth Coalition with Prussia and Russia the following year.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{exiting the}} city, the establishments become {{a pair of}} {{shopping}} plazas centered around the intersection with the northern terminus of NY364. Across the town line in Hopewell a quarter-mile to the east, a third plaza, anchored by Runnings, formerly a Walmart, dominates {{the northeast corner of}} CR10 and Eastern Boulevard. On the adjacent parcel is another plaza containing the current Walmart. At the entrance to the second plaza, US20 and NY5 intersect Lakeshore Drive, the former routing of US20 and NY5 to the south of the bypass. Past the junction, the divided highway comes to <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and,</b> after another half-mile, narrows to two lanes.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} king, royal family, and chief noblemen, {{the church was}} {{a major force in}} Northumbria. Churchmen were not only figures of spiritual authority, they were major landowners, who also {{controlled}} trade, centred at major churches and monasteries in a land without cities and towns. The bishopric of Lindisfarne was held by Cuthbert at Aldfrith's accession; Cuthbert was succeeded by the Irish-educated Eadberht, who would later be Abbot of Iona and bring the Easter controversy to <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> then by Eadfrith, creator of the Lindisfarne Gospels. The bishops of Lindisfarne sometimes held the see of Hexham, but during Aldfrith's reign it was held by John of Beverley, a pupil and protégé of Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The bishopric of York was held by Bosa in 685. Wilfrid was given the see in 687, but removed in 691 with Bosa returning to York. The short-lived see at Abercorn, created in 681 for Bishop Trumwine, collapsed in the period after Ecgfrith's death and the first known Bishop of Whithorn was appointed in the reign of King Ceolwulf. Important monasteries existed at Whitby, where the known abbesses tended to be members of the Deiran royal family, at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, where Bede was a monk, and at Ripon.|$|E

5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, Sihanouk took up {{residence}} in state guesthouses at Beijing and Pyongyang, courtesy of the Chinese and North Korean governments, respectively. In February 1973 Sihanouk traveled to Hanoi, where he started on a long journey with Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge leaders. The convoy proceeded along the Ho Chi Minh trail and reached the Cambodian border at Stung Treng Province the following month. From there, they traveled across the provinces of Stung Treng, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap. Throughout this entire leg of the journey, Sihanouk faced constant bombardment from American planes participating in Operation Freedom Deal. At Siem Reap, Sihanouk visited the temples of Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei, and Bayon. In August 1973 Sirik Matak wrote an open letter calling on Sihanouk to bring the Cambodian Civil War to <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> suggesting the possibility of {{his return to the}} country. When the letter reached Sihanouk, he angrily rejected Sirik Matak's advances.|$|E
5|$|By N42 and S89 the equestrian parade is at <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> the {{following}} 16 {{figures on the}} north and 18 on the south are taken to be the elders of Athens judging by their braided hair, an attribute of distinguished age in Classical art. Four of these figures raise their right hand in a clenched fist gesture suggestive of a pose associated with the thallophoroi (olive branch bearers) who were older men chosen in competition for their good looks alone. No drill holes, however, exist for any branch to be inserted in their hands. Next in line (S107–114, N20–28) are the musicians: four kithara (a variant of the lyre) and four aulos (flute) players. N16–19 and S115–118 (conjectured) perhaps, as hydriaphoroi, the water-vessel carriers, here men, rather than metic girls mentioned {{in the literature on}} the Panathenaia. N13–15, S119–121 are the skaphephoroi, the tray bearers of the honeycombs and cakes used to entice the sacrificial animals to the altar. N1–12, S122–149 are the four cows and four sheep on the north and ten cows on the south meant for sacrifice on the acropolis, presumably an abbreviated form of the hecatomb usually offered on this occasion – there is an a-b-a rhythm of placid and restive cows.|$|E
5|$|Croatian President Franjo Tuđman {{called on}} the public to bring the siege to <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> the plea {{resulted}} in a large-scale protest against the JNA in Split, organised by the Croatian Trade Union Association in the Brodosplit Shipyard on 6 May 1991. On 7 May, 80 tanks and tracked vehicles and 23 wheeled vehicles of the JNA 10th Motorised Brigade left barracks in Mostar, only to be stopped by civilians ahead of Široki Brijeg, west of Mostar. The convoy remained in place for three days as the crowd demanded that the JNA lift the siege of Kijevo. The protest ended after Alija Izetbegović, the President of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, visited and addressed the protesters, assuring the crowd that the convoy was heading to Kupres rather than Kijevo. Tuđman and Cardinal Franjo Kuharić sent telegrams to the protesters supporting Izetbegović. The siege of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations a few days later, {{two weeks after the}} blockade had been imposed.|$|E

Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them.

5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
