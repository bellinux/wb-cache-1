The skills and procedures may be learned by any effective method which provides the appropriate competence, including formal training programmes with associated assessment and certification. Recreational solo diving, once discouraged by most training agencies, has been accepted since the late 1990s by some training agencies for experienced divers who have skills in self-sufficiency and redundant backup equipment, and by experienced divers as a personal choice and <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> for their own safety.|$|E
25|$|In {{the common}} law of England and Wales there is no {{criminal}} liability for failing {{to act in the}} event of another person being in danger; however, there are exceptions to this rule. In instances where there has been an <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> by the bystander, a dangerous situation was created by them, or there is a contractual or statutory duty to act, criminal liability would be imposed on the bystander for their failure to take action. The courts are reluctant to penalize people attempting rescue and English law makes provision for the actions of 'good Samaritans,' unless their actions were grossly negligent or made a situation worse.|$|E

Kennedy's complete <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the venture, which provoked a popular reaction against the invaders, {{proved to be}} a further propaganda boost for the Cuban government. The U.S. began the formulation of new plans aimed at destabilizing the Cuban government. These activities were collectively known as the “Cuban Project” (also known as Operation Mongoose). This was to be a coordinated program of political, psychological, and military sabotage, involving intelligence operations as well as assassination attempts on key political leaders. The Cuban project also proposed attacks on mainland U.S. targets, hijackings and assaults on Cuban refugee boats to generate U.S. public support for military action against the Cuban government, these proposals were known collectively as Operation Northwoods.|$|E

She accepted his words, he turned his eyes to her again to see in what manner she accepted them. It was with rising tears and a rare sweetness in the movement of putting out her hand to take his own. Nothing more wonderful had ever appeared to him than, in that little chamber of remembrance and homage, to see her convey with such exquisite mildness that as from Acton Hague any injury was credible. The clock ticked in the stillness—Hague had probably given it to her—and while he let her hold his hand with a tenderness that was almost an <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> for his old pain {{as well as his}} new, Stransom after a minute broke out: “Good God, how he must have used you!” ...|$|E

A search was made for equal <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and, specifically, forjoint leadership, i. e. a formal mandate for decision-making affecting the full range <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> attaching to the managerial post. The results show that shared leadership istracked on a work-life level, and that the most far-reaching form joint leadership was found among 5 % of the managers. Thus, the phenomenon cannot be ignored as anecdotal. This adds relevance to influencing perceptions of leadership towards more pluralism, in which questions of leadership naturally incorporate more interactive variations than does the hitherto accepted theory of singular leadership...|$|R

Deeply fulfilled through marriage, and at one with his own soul, he must now undertake the responsibility for the next step into the future. He must now give himself perfectly to some further purpose, some passionate purposive activity. Till a man makes the great resolution of aloneness and singleness of being, till he takes upon himself the silence and central appeasedness of maturity; and then, after this, assumes a sacred responsibility for the next purposive step into the future, there is no rest. The great resolution of aloneness and appeasedness, and the further deep <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> in purpose--this is necessary to every parent, every father, every husband, at a certain point.

40|$|This Essay {{responds}} {{to an article}} by Jennifer Collins, Ethan Leib, and Dan Markel, Punishing Family Status, 89 B. U. L. Rev. 1327 (2008). Among other things, Collins et al. offer a new normative framework for determining when and how the criminal law may appropriately be used to promote voluntary care-giving relationships. This Essay argues that their framework is misconceived in two respects. First, voluntariness does not offer a persuasive foundation for criminal enforcement <b>of</b> care-giving <b>responsibilities.</b> The voluntary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> later neglected has not generally been regarded as either necessary or sufficient {{as a basis for}} criminal liability, and the type of voluntariness upon which Collins and her coauthors rely actually provides little support for the possible expansion of criminal liability contemplated by their framework. Second, criminal law is generally a poor device for promoting changes in private behavior and raising the status of traditionally marginalized groups (a central aim of Collins and her coauthors). Indeed, in light of the vast gap between the scope of the criminal law and the resources available to police and prosecutors, changes in formal law may prove counterproductive with respect to the normative ends that Collins et al. seek to achieve...|$|R
