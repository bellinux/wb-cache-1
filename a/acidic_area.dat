50|$|M. acidophila has {{adapted to}} this extreme {{environment}} {{to fend off}} predators. Outside the snottites {{there are a lot}} of mites that most likely prey on the nematodes. These nematodes provide a high nutritional value to the mites, especially carbon. Consequently, the nematodes have adapted to a more <b>acidic</b> <b>area</b> inside the snottites so that the mites have more difficulty accessing to the nematodes. This way the nematodes have a better chance of survival.|$|E

50|$|If {{the active}} {{ingredient}} of a tablet is sensitive to acid, or is irritant to the stomach lining, an enteric coating can be used, which is resistant to stomach acid, and dissolves in the less <b>acidic</b> <b>area</b> of the intestines. Enteric coatings are also used for medicines that can be negatively affected by taking {{a long time to}} reach the small intestine, where they are absorbed. Coatings are often chosen to control the rate of dissolution of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract. Some drugs are absorbed better in certain parts of the digestive system. If this part is the stomach, a coating is selected that dissolves quickly and easily in acid. If the rate of absorption is best in the large intestine or colon, a coating is used that is acid resistant and dissolves slowly to ensure that the tablet reaches that point before dispersing.|$|E
40|$|A {{study in}} 1997, on mineral levels in acidic {{compared}} to alkaline well waters, and in women’s hair, revealed higher concentrations {{of a number}} of mineral elements like Ca, Mo and Se in alkaline waters and hair. Thus, median Ca levels were six times higher in well water and five times higher in hair from the alkaline area compared to the <b>acidic</b> <b>area.</b> This finding raised the probability of similar differences in vegetables from these areas. Thus, in the year 2006, 60 women who had participated in the study in 1997 were asked to cultivate parsley, lettuce, carrot and chive. During the spring of 2006, the women from the water and hair study of 1997, 30 of them from the <b>acidic</b> <b>area</b> and 30 women from the alkaline district cultivated vegetables: carrot (Daucus carota L), parsley (Petroselinum crispum), chive (Allium schoenoprasum) and lettuce (Eruca sativa). The vegetables were harvested, and rinsed in tap water from the kitchens of the participating women in August. The concentrations of about 35 elements and ions were determined by ICP OES and ICP-MS predominantly. In addition, soil samples from the different cultivators were also analyzed for a number of elements. Lettuce and parsley showed the highest concentrations of mineral elements per gram dry weight. Only Mo concentrations were significantly higher in all the different vegetables from the alkaline district compared to vegetables from the acidic areas. On the other hand, the concentrations of Ba, Br, Mn, Rb and Zn were higher in all the different vegetables from the <b>acidic</b> <b>area.</b> In the soil, only pH and exchangeable Ca from the alkaline area were higher than from the <b>acidic</b> <b>area,</b> while exchangeable Fe, Mn and Na concentrations were higher in soils from the <b>acidic</b> <b>area.</b> Soil elements like Al, Fe, Li, Ni, Pb, Si, Ti, V, Zn and Zr were found in higher concentrations in lettuce and parsley, which were attributed to soil particles being splashed on the plants by the rain and absorbed by the leaves. Strong correlations appeared between Ca and Sr in all the vegetables, except for carrot. No strong correlations were found between soil elements and vegetable elements, except for soil Mn and carrot/lettuce Mn. The differences in mineral levels in both, vegetables and soils were however small, compared to differences in well waters and hair. It was also suggested that the garden soils on limestone bedrock had been drained of minerals and thereby, the soil had an acidic pH. The contribution of mineral elements to daily intake in humans was considered minor from the analysed vegetables, except for some samples of lettuce that should give significant contributions of Ca, Zn, Mn and Mo. The main conclusion is that, differences in water and hair mineral levels between the two areas in the earlier study (1997) were not mirrored in vegetables cultivated in 2006. Principally, this suggests that, for humans the mineral intake of some elements from water may be more important than from vegetables...|$|E
40|$|Eukaryotic {{translation}} {{initiation factor}} (eIF) 5 {{is crucial for}} the assembly of the eukaryotic preinitiation complex. This activity is mediated by the ability of its C-terminal HEAT domain to interact with eIF 1, eIF 2, and eIF 3 in the multifactor complex and with eIF 4 G in the 48 S complex. However, the binding sites for these factors on eIF 5 –C-terminal domain (CTD) have not been known. Here we present a homology model for eIF 5 -CTD based on the HEAT domain of eIF 2 Bε. We show that the binding site for eIF 2 β {{is located in a}} surface area containing aromatic and acidic residues (aromatic/acidic boxes), that the binding sites for eIF 1 and eIF 3 c are located in a conserved surface region of basic residues, and that eIF 4 G binds eIF 5 -CTD at an interface overlapping with the <b>acidic</b> <b>area.</b> Mutations in these distinct eIF 5 surface areas impair GCN 4 translational control by disrupting preinitiation complex interactions. These results indicate that the eIF 5 HEAT domain is a critical nucleation core for preinitiation complex assembly and function...|$|E

Pers. is a {{perennial}} rhizomatous grass (Poaceae), grown for cattle nutrition on the riverbanks of Río Tinto (Southwest Iberian Peninsula, Spain), a highly <b>acidic</b> <b>area</b> with {{high concentrations of}} iron (Fe) and other metals. This study focuses on the absorption, distribution, and accumulation of Fe in the root, rhizome, and leaves of C. dactylon under controlled conditions. Plants collected from Río Tinto were grown in a Hoagland solution containing 500 mgkg- 1 of ferrous Fe. Samples were collected up to 2 months after exposure and analyzed for total Fe concentration using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and for Fe distribution and bioformations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an energy-dispersive x-ray analyzer (EDX). The results show high concentrations of Fe in all plant organs, with fast Fe translocation from roots to leaves. Iron bioformations composed mainly of Fe, S, and K were detected in all plant organs and were especially apparent in roots and leaves. These results differ from those reported for another species of Poaceae, Imperata cylindrica, which grows under the same environmental conditions, suggesting the existence of different resistance strategies between species of the same family. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

30|$|Calcification by charophytes {{improves}} {{the quality of}} water, although most studies on calcification have only examined ecorticate species. We investigated the formation and relationship of alkalines and acids with regard to calcification on internodal cells in Chara corallina, an ecorticate species, and Chara globularis, a corticate species. We observed that alkaline and acidic areas with distinct banding patterns form on the internodal cells of C. corallina. The entire periphery of internodal cells was alkalized, and no distinct <b>acidic</b> <b>area</b> developed in C. globularis. By electron microscopy of these internodal cells, the calcified areas occurred primarily in alkaline areas with a banding pattern in C. coralline. However, phenomenon also occurred homogeneously inside of the entire cortex and cell wall in C. globularis. We also investigated the formation and relatiohship of alkalines and acids with regard to calcification on internodal cells of various ages from a single thallus of C. globularis. For internodal cells of C. globularis, a uniform calcified area lay between the cell wall and cortex on all cells, irrespective of age. In contrast, young cells bore an alkaline area that was uniform and widespread throughout their entire periphery, but the alkaline area in older cells was split into smaller segments in a banding pattern. Acidic areas were absent in young cells. These {{results indicate that the}} mechanisms by which alkaline and acid areas form differ in the presence and absence of cortex and between species.|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric {{deposition}} is {{a global}} concern contributing to soil acidification and biodiversity changes in forest ecosystems. Although acidifying deposition has decreased in the last decades in Europe, few evidence of ecosystem recovery from acidification has been reported until now. The objective {{of this study was}} to reconstruct spatiotemporal changes in soil pH across the entire French forest territory over the last 100 -year period through herb species assemblages. Data were collected from floristic databases resulting in a total of 120 similar to 216 plots covering French forests and spanning from 1910 to 2010. To define acidity figures, pH values were inferred from herb assemblages for each plot of the prediction dataset based on a weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) model (R 2 similar to=similar to 0. 80, SD similar to=similar to 0. 59 for the validation dataset). Spatiotemporal trends of mean pH changes were obtained by comparing plots with respect to the period (mean year of the period similar to=similar to 1933, 1966, 1984, 1997, 2007) and substrate (acidic and nonacidic forest areas). Bioindicated pH highlighted a decrease in soil pH in both acidic and nonacidic forest areas. The sharpest and most significant pH decrease occurred before 1984 in <b>acidic</b> <b>areas,</b> reaching 0. 34 pH units. Subsequently, no significant changes were observed, with a tendency toward stabilization. By contrast, the pH decrease reached 0. 19 pH units in nonacidic areas, only reaching significance between 1984 and 1997. Thereafter, we observed a slight and significant pH increase. Spatially, pH trends revealed a regionalized character of acidification regarding the substrate, which could not be related to the extent of deposition modeled by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme. Both temporal and spatial trends highlight the lagged responses of nonacidic <b>areas</b> compared with <b>acidic</b> <b>areas.</b> Hence, floristic reconstructed pH trends demonstrate a gradual cessation and recovery from acidification of French forests after a period of intense atmospheric pollution...|$|R
50|$|Fungi are {{abundant}} in soil, but bacteria are more abundant. Fungi {{are important in}} the soil as food sources for other, larger organisms, pathogens, beneficial symbiotic relationships with plants or other organisms and soil health. Fungi can be split into species based primarily on the size, shape and color of their reproductive spores, which are used to reproduce. Most of the environmental factors that influence the growth and distribution of bacteria and actinomycetes also influence fungi. The quality as well as quantity of organic matter in the soil has a direct correlation {{to the growth of}} fungi, because most fungi consume organic matter for nutrition. Fungi thrive in acidic environments, while bacteria and actinomycetes cannot survive in acid, which results in an abundance of fungi in <b>acidic</b> <b>areas.</b> Fungi also grow well in dry, arid soils because fungi are aerobic, or dependent on oxygen, and the higher the moisture content in the soil, the less oxygen is present for them.|$|R

40|$|The {{activity}} of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that contain {{a large proportion}} of histidine residues (pKa 6) depends on the physiological pH environment. Advantages of these AMPs include high activity in slightly <b>acidic</b> <b>areas</b> of the human body and relatively low toxicity in other areas. Also, many AMPs are highly active in a multivalent form, but this often increases toxicity. Here we designed pH dependent amphiphilic compounds consisting of multiple ultrashort histidine lipopeptides on a triazacyclophane scaffold, which showed high activity toward Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans at acidic pH, yet remained nontoxic. In vivo, treatment with a myristic acid conjugated trivalent histidine–histidine dipeptide resulted in 55 % survival of mice (n = 9) in an otherwise lethal murine lung Aspergillus infection model. Fungal burden was assessed and showed completely sterile lungs in 80 % of the mice (n = 5). At pH 5. 5 and 7. 5, differing peptide–membrane interactions and peptide nanostructures were observed.

40|$|Platinum(IV) {{compounds}} like oxoplatin (cis, cis, trans-diammine-dichlorido-dihydroxido-platinum(IV)) show increased {{stability and}} therefore can be applied orally. In a panel of 38 human cancer cell lines this drug induced S-phase arrest and cell death with IC 50 values 2. 5 -fold higher than cisplatin. Oxoplatin may be converted to cisplatin by intracellular reducing agents, however, exposure to 0. 1 M HCl mimicking gastric acid yielded cis-diammine-tetrachlorido-platinum(IV) exhibiting twofold increased activity. Similar results were obtained for another platinum(IV) compound, JM 149 (ammine-dichlorido-(cyclohexylamine) dihydroxido-platinum(IV)), but not for its parent drug JM 216 /satraplatin. Genome-wide expression profiling of H 526 small cell lung cancer cells treated with these platinum species revealed clear differences in the expression pattern of affected genes between oxoplatin and cisplatin. In conclusion, oxoplatin constitutes a potent oral agent that is either reduced or converted to distinct active compounds, for example, by gastric acid or <b>acidic</b> <b>areas</b> prevailing in solid tumors, in dependence of the respective pharmaceutical formulation.
