5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Gellibrand {{founded the}} Remembrance Club in Hobart, {{with the aim}} of {{encouraging}} returned servicemen in business. Savige visited Gellibrand in Hobart during August 1923, and Gellibrand urged him to set up a similar club in Melbourne. Soon after Savige's return to Melbourne, a group of ex-servicemen met to say farewell to one of their number who was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> England. Savige used this opportunity to bring up the idea of a club similar to Gellibrand's Remembrance Club. After several informal meetings, the Melbourne club's inaugural meeting was held in Anzac House, Melbourne. Legacy Australia was founded as an ex-servicemen's club, but soon became a charitable organisation focusing on war widows and orphans. For the next 26years, due to his commitment, energy and enthusiasm, Savige's name became inseparable from both the club and the movement.|$|E
5|$|In The Path of the Hobbits, Frodo, Sam and Gollum {{must first}} escape from Osgiliath, {{fighting}} past orcs {{to get to}} the sewers and ensuring that Frodo is not captured by the Nazgûl. However, upon escaping, Gollum decides to betray them and take the Ring back for himself. He tricks Frodo into going on without Sam, but Sam follows them into Shelob's lair. In the lair, Gollum abandons Frodo, and Sam must fight past spiders and orcs, eventually facing Shelob herself, who has attacked Frodo. Sam defeats Shelob, but upon reaching Frodo, he mistakenly believes him to be dead. <b>About</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Mount Doom on his own, he hides as a group of orcs arrive, and hears them say that Frodo is alive, but unconscious. They take him with them as Sam follows them to the Tower of Cirith Ungol. As Sam is about to enter the Tower, the orcs begin fighting among themselves, and Sam uses the distraction to rescue Frodo. Together, they head to Mount Doom. However, before Frodo can throw the Ring into the lava below, he is attacked by Gollum, who takes the Ring. In the final level, the player controls Frodo as he fights Gollum {{on the edge of the}} precipice. Frodo successfully defeats Gollum, knocking him into the lava and destroying the Ring forever.|$|E

25|$|Part of the {{establishment}} of this church {{was the creation of}} a strong priesthood and to this end Afonso's son Henrique was sent to Europe to be educated. Henrique became an ordained priest and in 1518 was named as bishop of Utica (a North African diocese recently reclaimed from the Muslims). He returned to Kongo in the early 1520s to run Kongo's new church. He died in 1531 as he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Europe for the Council of Trent.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Thompson's {{most popular and}} acclaimed work appeared within the pages of Rolling Stone magazine. Along with Joe Eszterhas and David Felton, Thompson was instrumental in expanding {{the focus of the}} magazine past music criticism; indeed, Thompson was the only staff writer of the epoch never to contribute a music feature to the magazine. Nevertheless, his articles were always peppered with a wide array of pop music references ranging from Howlin' Wolf to Lou Reed. Armed with early fax machines wherever he went, he became notorious for haphazardly sending sometimes illegible material to the magazine's San Francisco offices as an issue was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> press.|$|E
25|$|A {{thorough}} {{investigation of the}} Luzhniki disaster corresponded with the new policies of Yuri Andropov, a former KGB head, who became {{the leader of the}} country just one month after the tragedy. He became known in the Soviet Union for his efforts to restore discipline {{at all levels of the}} society that had been loosened by the last years of Brezhnev's rule. On 17 December 1982, two months after the stampede, he even went as far as firing the interior minister Nikolai Shchelokov (Николай Щёлоков), the Soviet Union's top police officer, after learning of the corruption allegations against him. Shchelokov was later stripped of all state decorations, and committed suicide when he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> trial.|$|E

25|$|During {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} upon his {{exit from the}} treatment center in 1955, Lugosi stated that he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work on a new Ed Wood film, The Ghoul Goes West. This {{was one of several}} projects proposed by Wood, including The Phantom Ghoul and Dr. Acula. With Lugosi in his famed Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of Tor Johnson's home, a suburban graveyard and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in Plan 9 from Outer Space, which was mostly filmed after Lugosi's death. Wood hired Tom Mason, his wife's chiropractor, to double for Lugosi in additional shots. Mason was noticeably taller and thinner than Lugosi, and had the lower half of his face covered with his cape in every shot, as Lugosi sometimes did in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.|$|E
500|$|Lorian leads a raid and {{successfully}} steals the parts, but old Enterprise is disabled {{as it is}} <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> warp. He {{is placed in the}} brig. Archer is angered at having his own method of stealing engine components (as seen in [...] "") used against him, but they finally agree to work towards their shared mission. Meanwhile, T'Pol meets her older self and discuss her addiction to Trelium-D and her relationship with Tucker. The Enterprises then enter the nebula, but Archer's is quickly disabled. Lorian's then tows it into the corridor using a tractor beam, intending, as it turns to attack the Kovaalan ships, to follow shortly. Archer's Enterprise arrives safely, but old Enterprise never emerges and Archer wonders if, by successfully traversing the corridor, they ceased to exist. His thoughts are soon cut short as Degra arrives for their rendezvous.|$|E

[...] They found some meat in the refrigerator and seized it, but the family insisted it was mutton. The mob dragged the entire family outside and Akhlaq and Danish were repeatedly kicked, hit with bricks and stabbed. The family's neighbours {{tried to stop the}} mob but were not able to. The police were called and arrived an hour later. By then, Akhlaq was dead and Danish was badly injured.|$|E

2500|$|Once the {{war with}} the United States began, the Confederacy pinned its hopes for {{survival}} on military intervention by Great Britain and France. The Confederates who had believed that [...] "cotton is king" [...] – that is, Britain had to support the Confederacy to obtain cotton – proved mistaken. The British had stocks to last over a year and had been developing alternative sources of cotton, most notably India and Egypt. They were not <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war with the U.S. to acquire more cotton {{at the risk of}} losing the large quantities of food imported from the North. The Confederate government sent repeated delegations to Europe but historians give them low marks for their poor diplomacy. James M. Mason went to London and John Slidell traveled to Paris. They were unofficially interviewed, but neither secured official recognition for the Confederacy.|$|E
2500|$|About this time, Robeson's {{belief that}} trade {{unionism}} {{was crucial to}} civil rights became a mainstay of his political beliefs as he became proponent of the union activist Revels Cayton. Robeson was later called before the Tenney Committee where he responded to questions about his affiliation with the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) by testifying {{that he was not}} a member of the CPUSA. Nevertheless, two organizations with which Robeson was intimately involved, the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) and the CAA, were placed on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO). Subsequently, he was summoned before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and when questioned about his affiliation with the Communist Party, he refused to answer, stating: [...] "Some of the most brilliant and distinguished Americans are <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> jail for the failure to answer that question, and I am going to join them, if necessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paraphrasing [...] Josephus {{reported}} that Moses told the Israelites {{that when they}} were <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war, they should send emissaries and heralds to those whom they had chosen to make enemies, for it was {{right to make use}} of words before weapons of war. The Israelites were to assure their enemies that although the Israelites had a numerous army, horses, weapons, and, above these, a merciful God ready to assist them, they nonetheless desired their enemies not to compel the Israelites to fight against them or to take from them what they had. And if the enemies heeded the Israelites, it would be proper for the Israelites to keep peace with the enemies. But if the enemies trusted in their own strength as superior to that of the Israelites and would not do the Israelites justice, then the Israelites were to lead their army against the enemies, making use of God as their supreme Commander.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a famous}} episode, Bertrand Russell wrote to Frege, just as Vol. 2 of the Grundgesetze was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> press in 1903, showing that Russell's paradox could {{be derived from}} Frege's Basic Law V. It is easy to define the {{relation}} of membership of a set or extension in Frege's system; Russell then drew attention to [...] "the set of things x that are such that x is {{not a member of}} x". The system of the Grundgesetze entails that the set thus characterised both is and is not a member of itself, and is thus inconsistent. Frege wrote a hasty, last-minute Appendix to Vol. 2, deriving the contradiction and proposing to eliminate it by modifying Basic Law V. Frege opened the Appendix with the exceptionally honest comment: [...] "Hardly anything more unfortunate can befall a scientific writer than to have one of the foundations of his edifice shaken after the work is finished. This was the position I was placed in by a letter of Mr. Bertrand Russell, just when the printing of this volume was nearing its completion." [...] (This letter and Frege's reply are translated in Jean van Heijenoort 1967.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon afterwards, Valjean rescues a man pinned by {{a runaway}} cart ("The Runaway Cart"). Javert, who has {{up until now}} not {{recognized}} Valjean, though he has pursued him as a fugitive all these years, witnesses the incident and becomes suspicious, remembering the incredible strength Valjean displayed in the work camp. But it turns out another man has been arrested, and is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> trial for breaking parole. The real Valjean realizes that this {{case of mistaken identity}} could free him forever, but he's not willing to see an innocent man go to prison in his place and so confesses his identity to the court ("Who Am I?—The Trial"). At the hospital, a delirious Fantine dreams of Cosette. Valjean promises to find Cosette and protect her ("Come to Me" [...] / [...] "Fantine's Death"). Relieved, Fantine succumbs to her illness and dies. Javert arrives to take Valjean back into custody, but Valjean asks Javert for time to fetch Cosette. Javert refuses, insisting that a criminal like Valjean can never change or do good. They struggle, but Valjean overpowers Javert and escapes ("The Confrontation").|$|E
