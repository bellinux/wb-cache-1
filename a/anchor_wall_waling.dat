40|$|In {{the past}} several years, {{considerable}} {{attention has been given}} to the ultimate horizontal pull-out resistance of vertical deadman anchors, which are usually used together with earth retaining wall. Unfortunately, no significant effort has been made to understand/study the behaviour of discrete deadman anchor in earth retaining <b>wall</b> (<b>anchored</b> <b>wall)</b> subjected to the deflection of earth retaining wall. Therefore, this research aims to fill up this gap. The study on the behaviour of single-plate discrete deadman <b>anchor</b> in <b>anchored</b> <b>wall</b> subjected to the deflection of earth retaining wall is carried out by three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element analysis adopting finite element software named PLAXIS. The behaviour of discrete deadman anchor is studied by investigating the effects of several key factors. These include the effects of length of tie rod, embedment depth of anchor, spacing between deadman anchors, friction angle of soil, depth of <b>anchored</b> <b>wall,</b> and stiffness of <b>anchored</b> <b>wall.</b> Practicing geotechnical engineers are able to understand the interactions among soil-anchor-wall by studying the effects of several key factors on the behaviour of discrete deadman anchor. This allows practicing geotechnical engineers to determine the potential failure mechanisms and hence provide the most suitable design of <b>anchored</b> <b>wall</b> in geotechnical engineering. Furthermore, the effects of abovementioned key factors are summarised and design charts are proposed for the preliminary design of <b>anchored</b> <b>wall.</b> The design charts are developed based on limiting the wall deflection to 0. 5...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effects of <b>walls</b> and <b>walling</b> within the city’s history.

40|$|In this thesis, an {{investigation}} is described to the measured horizontal displacements of a quay {{wall in the}} Port of Rotterdam. This quay wall was built in 2003 to replace an existing jetty. A combined tubular wall was installed {{and some of the}} concrete jetty piles were reused as foundation piles for the relieving platform. Anchorage for the quay wall is provided by an eight meter high continuous <b>anchor</b> <b>wall,</b> 38 meter behind the quay wall made of steel sheet piles. The connection between the two walls consists of high strength steel presetressed strands. Prior to describing the actual research in this report, measurements are considered that have been carried out over time on top of the quay wall. These measurements indicate that horizontal displacements increase nonlinearly in time. This trend was the reason for {{an investigation}} to all possible causes of the horizontal displacements of the combi wall. In this thesis, the research is discussed and possible causes of the measurements are revealed by considering one representative cross section of the largest part of the quay wall. The main part of this thesis deals with the investigation for possible causes of the measurements and is elaborated by considering the different influences for the representative cross section. Firstly, time dependent soil behaviour is examined. The Koppejan formula and the finite element method are used to determine the influences of consolidation and creep. Due to counteracting prestressing and gravity forces the effects in time due to consolidation and creep seems to be negligible. Secondly, the capacity of the <b>anchor</b> <b>wall</b> is investigated based on Coulomb’s theory and the finite element method. Due to a proven densification of the passive soil wedge, the capacity appeared to be sufficient. Subsequently, macro stability of the soil body between the <b>anchor</b> and combined <b>wall</b> (Kranz stability) is considered. Stability is proven to be sufficient by performing a hand calculation for the drained and undrained situation, followed by a verification calculation with a program based on the sub grade reaction method. Another considered possible cause is the difference in interpretation of the soil profile used in this report and the one used in the design. Therefore, a parametric study for the soil parameters is performed with the sub grade reaction method. These calculations show that the design profile resulted in larger deformations than a soil profile with expected values. Furthermore, it was decided to investigate the influence of the position and magnitude of a surcharge load. When the design load of 50 kN/m 2 is applied near the <b>anchor</b> <b>wall,</b> it was concluded from calculations that horizontal displacements are almost equal to the measurements. When a higher load is applied at positions further away from the <b>anchor</b> <b>wall,</b> again horizontal displacements appeared to be close to the measured displacements. Both the position and magnitude of loading are described as possible explanations for the measured deformations. Finally, it is concluded that saving money in the design stage by applying an <b>anchor</b> <b>wall,</b> resulted in more deformations than expected and made them dependent on the position of loading. Additionally, it is concluded that applying a higher load than was agreed upon in the terms of reference, resulted in more deformations than expected as well.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of applying the principles of capacity design to the seismic protection of embedded retaining structures. The study hinges on {{the analysis of the}} plastic mechanisms that may be activated by cantilevered and <b>anchored</b> retaining <b>walls</b> during strong motion while preserving the integrity of the structural members. Through a combination of numerical analyses and simple limit equilibrium calculations, it is shown that that for the wall schemes considered in this work it is possible to derive the maximum internal forces that the structural members may undergo during a severe earthquake from the analysis of the relevant plastic mechanism. It is also shown that these internal forces do not depend on the amplitudes of seismic motion, but are related only to the strength of the dissipating elements of the system. For <b>anchored</b> <b>walls,</b> this approach indicates that the optimal way to limit the internal forces in the retaining wall is to design weak anchors, that during the seismic event may mobilise the strength at the contact of the soil with their injected active portion...|$|R

Generally, the subsoil liquefiable layers of the SRPCD site consisted of reclaimed layers of silty sand with the maximum depths of 7 to 12 meters and the fine content of 20 % – 40 %. The preliminary compaction patterns were obtained using the energy-based method and the available empirical relationships based on the depth of influence and the required improving energy. Considering the previously conducted researches, the effectiveness of dynamic compaction and the applied energy to subsoil collapsible layers deteriorates due to the presence of fine content.
