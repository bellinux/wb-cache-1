5|$|Although Mars has no {{evidence}} of a structured global magnetic field, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that <b>alternating</b> <b>polarity</b> reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.|$|E

40|$|The {{ionic liquid}} FEEP (IL-FEEP) is new, {{simplified}} {{version of the}} field emission thruster where the alkali metal propellant is replaced by an ionic liquid. Development of the IL-FEEP thruster {{is based on the}} heritage of the cesium FEEP and is currently funded by ESA and EU programmes. This paper presents the results of a recent experimental campaign aimed at assessing the performance of a novel linear slit FEEP emitter fed with a ionic liquid propellant. Tests were done on a newly designed, 8 -mm slit FEEP emitter made of glass, fed with EMI-BF 4. The test setup allowed for continuous monitoring of the thruster electrical parameters, as well as for direct scanning of the exhaust beam profiles using electrostatic wire probes. The test results essentially validate the possibility to operate the linear slit FEEP emitter with ionic liquid propellant in pure ionic mode and confirm that the glass emitter is suited for operation with the selected propellant. Experimental results show very regular and repeatable performance in positive mode, while operation in negative polarity showed some irregularities in beam profiles. Thruster performance in a later test in <b>alternate</b> <b>polarity</b> mode was remarkably stable over a very long period, in spite of the predominance of positive mode firing that could have affected the propellant composition in the reservoir due to electrochemical degradation. <b>Alternate</b> <b>polarity</b> is therefore regarded as a promising operating mode for the simplified FEEP thruster...|$|R
40|$|The study herein {{reported}} {{was aimed}} at the characterization of the plume of a ionic liquid fed, linear slit FEEP thruster, in terms of composition and velocity of the constituents. Ionic liquid propellants are actively investigated as promising alternatives to alkali metals in field emission thrusters, {{in order to reduce}} system cost and ground operation complexity. To this end, a large number of tests was carried out using the EMI-BF 4 ionic liquid as a propellant. The thruster was fired in either positive polarity or negative polarities to check the capability to extract anions and cations alone. Then, most of the testing was carried out in <b>alternate</b> <b>polarity</b> mode, in order to avoid electrochemical poisoning of the propellant, due to the unbalanced extraction of charged particles[1]. Such operating mode {{is believed to be the}} most promising candidate for flight operation, as it would allow to get rid of an external neutralizer to maintain electrical neutrality of the spacecraft. Ion beam composition was investigated by means of a time-of-flight mass spectrometry technique. The measurements show that the emitted beam is mostly composed of monomers (BF 4) -, dimers (C 6 H 11 BF 4 N 2) (BF 4) - and polymers (C 6 H 11 BF 4 N 2) n (BF 4) - (with n a function of applied extraction voltage). Under the assumption of a certain beam composition, propellant consumption was indirectly evaluated by means of time integration of the emitted current and independently verified by means of direct observation of the depletion of the propellant reservoir. The estimated resulting specific impulse is around 1400 s. The thruster behaviour resulted quite variable, especially when operated at high voltage levels in continuous polarity mode. Better performance was registered in <b>alternate</b> <b>polarity</b> operation with an alternation period of several tens of a seconds at extracted current of just a few µA...|$|R

The term caught the attention of Freud (1918, 1923 / 1927) who used it extensively to describe <b>alternating</b> <b>polarities</b> of love and hate and of life and death urges.
