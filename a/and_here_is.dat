500|$|There {{was once}} an old custom of {{removing}} one's shoes upon approaching the Wall. A 17th-century collection of special prayers to be said at holy places mentions that [...] "upon coming to the Western Wall one should remove his shoes, bow and recite...". Rabbi Moses Reicher wrote that [...] "it is a good and praiseworthy custom to approach the Western Wall in white garments after ablution, kneel and prostrate oneself in submission and recite [...] "This is nothing other than the House of God <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the gate of Heaven." [...] When within four cubits of the Wall, one should remove their footwear." [...] Over the years the custom of standing barefoot at the Wall has ceased, {{as there is no}} need to remove one's shoes when standing by the Wall, because the plaza area is outside the sanctified precinct of the Temple Mount.|$|E

500|$|Writing {{in retrospect}} for Daily Express, {{reviewer}} Simon Gage {{was critical of}} Minogue's lack of musical progression, charisma, and thought that she lacked a [...] "great voice". He stated [...] "There are dodgy tracks and the “voice”, more processed than a tinned pea, does start to grate but it’s still pretty good." [...] He awarded the box set three stars. British journalist Paul Du Noyer reviewed the box set, and complimented Minogue's Parlophone work as [...] "ambiguous pop". However, he stated [...] "There’s a lot of ambitious pop in here, but no conceptual overreach. Not even her experience of breast cancer was allowed to surface in Kylie’s subsequent material: lyrically, it was straight back to business. It seems unlikely such a 20-year lucky streak could be sustained {{without a lot of}} shrewd decisions by Minogue herself. So it seems that everyone is right after all: Kylie is A Good Thing, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> just enough of it." ...|$|E

He {{proceeds}} largely from historical, rather than personal, evidence: here are the fruits of Christianity, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> what one finds in its absence". In a negative review in the Winnipeg Free Press, Ted St. Godard wrote, [...] "What Hitchens can't seem to appreciate is that, even if 'Soviet Communism is organically linked to atheism, something his brother and others argue against (if somewhat feebly), and even if one accepts that Soviet tyranny was horrible, this says little {{about the existence of}} God". In a Washington Times review entitled [...] "Cain and Abel: The sequel?", Jeremy Lott wrote, [...] "Hitchens refuses to make a full-throated case for faith. He explains that 'those who choose to argue in prose... are unlikely to be receptive to a case that is most effectively couched in poetry' ... Peter does hope that Christopher might one day arrive at some sort of acceptance that belief in God is not necessarily a character fault—and that religion does not poison everything".|$|E

2500|$|On March 7, 2007, Rosselló {{stated that}} he was no longer {{interested}} in the Senate Presidency and then focused his attention in preventing Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño from winning the March 2008 gubernatorial primary, and allowed his name to be placed in nomination for the party's gubernatorial primary. McClintock and four other senators won in San Juan Superior Court a suit to nullify the sanctions and expulsions that the party leadership has levied against them. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court confirmed the lower court decision by a 5-to-1 vote. As a result, McClintock and his supporters were recognized as NPP members and free to run under the party banner. [...] Shortly after the primary polls closed on March 9, 2008, Pedro Rosselló conceded the victory to Luis Fortuño after a large margin of votes in favor of his opponent in the NPP party primaries for the presidency of the party and gubernatorial nomination. Rosselló admitted defeat even before the votes were completely tallied claiming Fortuño as the next candidate of the PNP party. In Rosselló's conceding speech he said [...] "Luis Fortuño has been selected by the people to be the new president of this party and the candidate for governor. I always say the people speak and I obey, Fortuño here is your party <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> your office (signaling the party's official headquarters). Now it's up to you, the loyal members of this party, {{to make sure that this}} new leadership works for statehood for Puerto Rico". After this conceding speech it was rumored and even announced at Fortuño's headquarters that the former Governor would arrive there along with his loyal supporter and mayor of the capital city of San Juan, Jorge Santini, but after Fortuño's followers waited for hours to see their leaders united neither Rosselló or Santini arrived. After the primary was over it was heavily rumored by many that Rosselló would not be campaigning for Fortuño and that he'd resign as senator to go back to his home in Virginia. On March 10, 2008, Rosselló sent the media a written statement regarding his future in which he confirmed he will be retiring from active politics and will not be campaigning for any candidate, however he would finish his term as senator for the Arecibo District, which he did.|$|E
