500|$|Although {{having written}} about eight songs while on tour in 2005, Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy {{decided to write}} new music because they wanted the album to be [...] "...quite new, to be quite {{different}} sounding from everything we've ever done before." [...] Despite having recorded their second album in {{a short amount of}} time, Kapranos stressed that the band wanted to take their time. He voices, [...] "This time we wanted to spend more time developing, and also, I suppose, allowing songs and sounds to evolve more before we ended up writing an album, and absorbing more music and ideas and, I suppose, life itself. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> life, I mean life off the road, because I wouldn't classify life on the road as real life." [...] Franz Ferdinand began working on Tonight in early 2007. Franz Ferdinand was supposed to record the album with producer Brian Higgins, yet in March 2008, the two entities parted ways. The drummer, Paul Thomson, says [...] "We wrote with Higgins for a while and initially we thought we'd work more with him but it didn't really work out. We just realized that we're not really a pop group." [...] However, they also commented they have not given up on the pop concept. The songs on the album were written and recorded at the old town hall of Govan, Scotland as well as Mr. Dan's Studio in Buckeye, Arizona. The band first moved into Govan's old town hall following a year of touring in support of their second studio album and mostly used it for storing and rehearsing.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2012, Wale had {{announced}} he was planning on releasing a Go-go album: [...] "I wanna do the album for me. This {{is the second time}} I’m announcing it, but I’m doing a Go-Go album after my album. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> Go-Go I don’t mean like cheesy Go-Go. It’s gonna be sequenced. It’s gonna be me probably rapping only 40-percent on the album, but getting the sound out." ...|$|E
2500|$|John O'Hara {{wrote in}} the New York Times; [...] "The most {{important}} author living today, the outstanding author {{since the death of}} Shakespeare, has brought out a new novel. The title of the novel is Across the River and Into the Trees. The author, of course, is Ernest Hemingway, the most important, the outstanding author out of the millions of writers who have lived since 1616." [...] Tennessee Williams, in The New York Times, wrote: [...] "I could not go to Venice, now, without hearing the haunted cadences of Hemingway's new novel. It is the saddest novel in the world about the saddest city, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> I think it is the best and most honest work that Hemingway has done, you may think me crazy. It will probably be a popular book. The critics may treat it pretty roughly. But its hauntingly tired cadences are the direct speech of a man's heart who is speaking that directly for the first time, and that makes it, for me, the finest thing Hemingway has done." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Make a clean job of it," [...] counselled Mr. Mills, who {{was very}} fond of a little cheap excitement. [...] "Get it over and done with. You’ve got good features, and you’d look splendid clean-shaved." [...] Mr. Simpson smiled faintly. [...] "Only on Wednesday the barmaid here was asking after you," [...] pursued Mr. Mills. Mr. Simpson smiled again. [...] "She says to me, ’Where’s Gran’pa?’ she <b>says,</b> <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> haughty like, ’Who do you mean?’ she says, ’Father Christmas!’ If you was {{to tell her that}} you are only fifty-three, she’d laugh in your face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Rosannah, unsay those words! There is some dreadful mystery here, some hideous mistake.

Rosannah, dear speak to me, won't you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Dan, [...] "I'll count, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> three you pitch in, and hammer {{each other}} until one of you has had enough. Cecily, keep quiet. Now, one--two--three!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I {{know nothing}} of your furlongs, but I am sure {{it is a very}} long wood, and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it; <b>and</b> therefore, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> that we have walked a mile in it, I must speak within compass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Half of it, half of two million!" [...] Young Dick cried. [...] "At {{that rate}} I'm a million richer every year. Get that, and {{hang on to}} it, and listen to me. <b>When</b> I'm good <b>and</b> willing to go back--but not for years an' years--we'll fix it up, you <b>and</b> <b>I.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> the word, you'll write to your father. He'll jump out {{to where we are}} waiting, pick me up, and cart me back. Then he'll collect the thirty {{thousand}} reward from my guardians, quit the police force, and most likely start a saloon." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ponce's art {{sometimes}} {{take the}} form of a community project, as volunteers are welcome to assist with public murals. [...] "These are our artists here in Pacoima", said Ponce, [...] "they don't have galleries.

6000|$|... "He was {{man enough}} to choose for himself," [...] she said; [...] "so may you. To {{tell you the}} truth, my dear friend, when you weary me like this, I feel {{inclined}} to say--go, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> go--it is for always." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m {{not going}} to," [...] {{said the other}} shortly. [...] "I’m a {{determined}} man, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> a thing I mean it. It’s going to be broken to her gradual, as I said; I don’t {{want her to be}} scared, poor thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't have it, Martha. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> so, {{let there}} be an end of it." [...] As she said this, she got up from her chair, and shook her head, and took a turn about the room. [...] "If I'm not {{mistress}} here, I'm nobody." ...|$|E
5000|$|Standing 6'9", Green played forward under Coach John Thompson III. He was {{the captain}} of the squad. Thompson stated in a Sports Illustrated interview: [...] "You'll stop <b>and</b> think <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> this, but it's true: Jeff Green is the smartest player I've ever coached. You would know this better than most: that's a hell of a statement." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{looked at}} me in a meaning manner. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> a meaning manner, I mean there was a respectful {{but at the same}} time uppish glint in his eye and a sort of muscular spasm flickered across his face which wasn't quite a quiet smile and yet wasn't quite not a quiet smile.

6000|$|Although it is summer weather, Sir Leicester {{always has}} his own {{particular}} fire in the evening.
