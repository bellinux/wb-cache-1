40|$|Rabies is a fatal {{neurological}} pathogen that is {{a persistent}} problem throughout the developing world where it is spread primarily by domestic dogs. Although the disease has been extensively studied in wildlife populations in Europe and North America, the dynamics of rabies in domestic dog populations has been almost entirely neglected. Here, we demonstrate that rabies epidemics in southern and eastern <b>Africa</b> <b>cycle</b> with a period of 3 – 6 years and show significant synchrony across the region. The observed period is shorter than predictions based on epidemiological parameters for rabies in domestic dogs. We find evidence that rabies prevention measures, including vaccination, are affected by disease prevalence and show that a simple model with intervention responses can capture observed disease periodicity and host dynamics. We suggest that movement of infectious or latent animals combined with coordinated control responses may be important in coupling populations and generating synchrony at the continental scale. These findings {{have important implications for}} rabies prediction and control: large-scale synchrony and the importance of intervention responses suggest that control of canine rabies in Africa will require sustained efforts coordinated across political boundaries...|$|R

The results suggest a strong systematic co-movement between wheat production and ship traffic, with less evidence for wine production and stock herding activities. While ship traffic created demand for wheat exports, the size of the co-movement provides evidence that ship traffic also stimulated local demand through secondary and tertiary sector activities, supporting the hypothesis that ship traffic acted as a catalyst for growth in the Cape economy.

40|$|The enemy release {{hypothesis}} is often invoked {{to explain why}} some alien plant species become invasive. Here, we investigated relationships between invasiveness, taxonomic isolation and leaf herbivory for tropical alien plant species introduced to a botanical garden in East <b>Africa</b> (<b>Amani</b> Botanical Garden, East Usambara mountains, northeast Tanzania). We measured the proportion of leaves damaged, and the percentage leaf area damaged on individuals of 28 alien plant species. We extracted data on the presence/absence of native congeners {{and the number of}} native confamilial species from an inventory of the East Usambara flora. We also obtained data on planting effort for 26 species, from historical records. Linear and generalized linear models were used to analyse the relationships between invasiveness, herbivory and taxonomic isolation. Mean proportion of leaves damaged per species was significantly explained by taxonomic isolation; proportion of leaves damaged increased with the number of native confamilial species and was greater, on average, for species with native congeners than those without native congeners. The mean percentage of leaf area damaged per species could not be explained by any variables considered in this study. There was no relationship between the degree of herbivory or taxonomic isolation and alien plant species invasiveness, but more-invasive species did have a significantly greater planting effort than less-invasive species. The role herbivores play in controlling alien plant invasions has been investigated relatively little in the tropics. In this study, although the amount of herbivory suffered by alien plants was related to taxonomic isolation, we found no evidence for leaf-feeding invertebrates having a significant role in invasion, suggesting that other factors may be responsible for differences in species success. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne {{viral disease}} {{widespread}} in <b>Africa.</b> The primary <b>cycle</b> involves mosquitoes and wild and domestic ruminant hosts. Humans are usually contaminated after contact with infected ruminants. As many environmental, agricultural, epidemiological, and anthropogenic factors are implicated in RVF spread, the multidisciplinary One Health approach {{was needed to}} identify the drivers of RVF epidemics in Madagascar. We examined the environmental patterns associated with these epidemics, comparing human and ruminant serological data with environmental and cattle-trade data. In contrast to East Africa, environmental drivers did not trigger the epidemics: They only modulated local Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) transmission in ruminants. Instead, RVFV was introduced through ruminant trade and subsequent movement of cattle between trade hubs caused its long-distance spread within the country. Contact with cattle brought in from infected districts was associated with higher infection risk in slaughterhouse workers. The finding that anthropogenic rather than environmental factors are the main drivers of RVF infection in humans {{can be used to}} design better prevention and early detection in the case of RVF resurgence in the region...|$|R

Cape Point {{is representative of}} a background monitoring station which is remote from pollution impacts, whereas the Eastern Transvaal Highveld (ETH) stations of Elandsfontein and Verkykkop are situated {{in an area of}} intense urban and industrial activity. At Cape Point the diurnal cycle in surface ozone is small, the seasonal cycle shows a winter maximum and a summer minimum. In contrast, the ETH stations show a spring maximum in surface ozone with evidence of a summer enhancement.

Seasonal variations in total ozone are consistent over the whole of South <b>Africa,</b> indicating a <b>cycle</b> which is independent of varying surface ozone concentrations. The spring maximum in free tropospheric ozone (up to 12 km) over the interior of South Africa is thought to be due to long-range transport of biomass burn products from latitudes to the north, rather than the extension of a localised surface photochemical influence through the troposphere...|$|R

40|$|Article purchased; Published online: 28 Sept 2017 Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a clonally {{propagated}} {{staple food}} crop in the tropics. Genomic selection (GS) has been implemented at three breeding institutions in <b>Africa</b> to reduce <b>cycle</b> times. Initial studies provided promising estimates of predictive abilities. Here, we expand on previous analyses by assessing {{the accuracy of}} seven prediction models for seven traits in three prediction scenarios: cross-validation within populations, cross-population prediction and cross-generation prediction. We also evaluated the impact of increasing the training population (TP) size by phenotyping progenies selected either at random or with a genetic algorithm. Cross-validation results were mostly consistent across programs, with nonadditive models predicting of 10 % better on average. Cross-population accuracy was generally low (mean = 0. 18) but prediction of cassava mosaic disease increased up to 57 % in one Nigerian population when data from another related population were combined. Accuracy across generations was poorer than within-generation accuracy, as expected, but accuracy for dry matter content and mosaic disease severity should be sufficient for rapid-cycling GS. Selection of a prediction model made some difference across generations, but increasing TP size was more important. With a genetic algorithm, selection of one-third of progeny could achieve an accuracy equivalent to phenotyping all progeny. We are {{in the early stages}} of GS for this crop but the results are promising for some traits. General guidelines that are emerging are that TPs need to continue to grow but phenotyping can be done on a cleverly selected subset of individuals, reducing the overall phenotyping burden.

Kalaharituber pfeilii (Hennings) Trappe & Kagan-Zur is a species of desert truffle that {{is found in the}} southern part of <b>Africa.</b> The life <b>cycle</b> of this truffle has not been fully investigated as there are many unconfirmed plant species that have been suggested as potential hosts. Many mycorrhizal associations often involve other role players such as associated bacteria that may influence the establishment of the mycorrhizal formation and function. As part of an effort to understand the life cycle of K. pfeilii, laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the role of ascocarp associated bacteria. Bacterial isolates obtained from the truffle ascocarps were subjected to microbiological and biochemical tests to determine their potentials as mycorrhizal helper bacteria. Tests conducted included stimulation of mycelial growth in vitro, indole acetic acid (IAA) production and phosphate solubilising. A total of 17 bacterial strains belonging to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were isolated from the truffle ascocarps and identified with sequence homology and phylogenetic methods. Three of these isolates showed potential to be helper bacteria in at least one of the media tested through the stimulation of mycelial growth. Furthermore, four isolates produced IAA and one was able to solubilise CaHPO 3 in vitro. One isolate, identified as a relative of Paenibacillus sp. stimulated mycelial growth on all the media tested. Other bacterial isolates that showed potential stimulation of mycelial growth were identified molecularly as a Bacillus sp. and two strains of Rhizobium sp. This study has contributed to the existing knowledge on the biotic interactions with K. pfeilii which may be useful in further symbiont and re-synthesis investigations...|$|R

Resolved genetic studies of T. parva are currently constrained {{by the lack of}} a genome-wide high-definition genetic map of the parasite. We undertook a genetic cross of two cloned isolates of T. parva to construct such a map from 35 recombinant progeny, using a genome-wide panel of 79 variable number of tandem repeat markers. Progeny were established by in vitro cloning of cattle lymphocytes after infection with sporozoites prepared from Rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks fed on a calf undergoing a dual infection with the two clonal parental stocks. The genetic map was determined by assigning individual markers to the four chromosome genome, whose physical length is approximately 8309 kilobasepairs (Kb). Segregation analysis of the markers among the progeny revealed a total genetic size of 1683. 8 centiMorgans (cM), covering a physical distance of 7737. 62 Kb (∼ 93 % of the genome). The average genome-wide recombination rate observed for T. parva was relatively high, at 0. 22 cMKb− 1 per meiotic generation. Recombination hot-spots and cold-spots were identified for each of the chromosomes. A panel of 27 loci encoding determinants previously identified as immunorelevant or likely to be under selection were positioned on the linkage map. We believe this to be the first genetic linkage map for T. parva. This resource, with the availability of the genome sequence of T. parva, will promote improved understanding of the pathogen by facilitating the use of genetic analysis for identification of loci responsible for variable phenotypic traits exhibited by individual parasite stocks...|$|R

Furthermore, the relationship between the South African CPI inflation and JSE-all share index returns was modelled with the intent of comparing the relationship to that of JSE-listed property index (versus South African CPI). The short-term relationship between CPI inflation and JSE-listed property index returns was discovered to be negative for the period starting from Jan 2005 to Jun 2015, in the other hand, the relationship between the JSE-all share index returns and CPI inflation was seen to be positive over the same period.

Schendel (1990) which placed great emphasis {{on the topic of}} entrepreneurship and admitted that some argue that entrepreneurship is {{at the very heart of}} strategic management. This thesis explores the strategic use of entrepreneurship in the telecommunication industry. Through the use of strategic entrepreneurship theories both from the strategy and entrepreneurial fields provide the thesis with a foundation to explore and extract empirical results from two case samples known as Vox telecom and Telkom limited. Through an Interpretivist research design which includes thirty interviews in three different phases resulted in the empirical primary data for analysis. The research approach was carried out through an adaptive GT (Grounded Theory) technique which allowed the thesis to capture industry and organisational specific behaviours. The adaptive GT resulted in open, axial and selective coding which finally represented three themed domains. The domains include: the environmental, innovation and corporate orientation domain. The adaptive GT results were conducted through eighteen steps which finally represented three cycles. Chapter 6 represent the first cycle, which demonstrate the analysis and result of the primary data which was gathered during the 1 st interview phase, mostly collecting entrepreneurial management practises while the 2 nd interview phase represent the strategic organisational empirical findings. The result mainly describes the telecom industry through the scope of the two organisations in our sample, namely Telkom and Vox telecom in South <b>Africa.</b> The second <b>cycle</b> demonstrates the analysis and results which ultimately described the thesis knowledge contribution.

The testing is conducted through evaluating the Telepreneur framework in the telecom industry through the third interview phase. The testing processes use two sets of survey data therefore quantitatively testing the result against specified industry data to further generalize the Telepreneur frame.

40|$|African Trypanosomiasis, {{which is}} caused by Trypanosoma brucei, {{is one of the}} {{crippling}} agents of social and economic development in <b>Africa.</b> T. brucei <b>cycles</b> between the cold-blooded insect vector, the tsetse fly (Glossina spp), and warm-blooded mammalian hosts. T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major are mammal infecting kinetoplastid parasites that are collectively referred to as TriTryps. These parasites experience extreme environments as they move between their warm-blooded mammalian hosts and cold-blooded insect vectors which trigger extensive morphological transformations during the life-cycle of the parasite. Molecular chaperones have been implicated in parasite differentiation. TriTryps display significant expansions and diversity in the gene complements encoding molecular chaperones, especially J-proteins. Generally, J-proteins function as co-chaperones of Hsp 70 s, forming part of vital protein homeostasis processes. Hsp 70 s show a high degree of conservation, while J-proteins appear to be an extreme case of taxonomic radiation. Although several studies have focused on the molecular and cell biology of Hsp 70 s in some kinetoplastid parasites, knowledge is still lacking pertaining to J-proteins and their partnerships with Hsp 70 s. This thesis focused on the classification of kinetoplastid Jproteins into the four types by examining the domain organizations using T. brucei as a guide. The potential partnership of J-proteins and Hsp 70 s were postulated based on predicted subcellular localization. Kinetoplastid parasites, particularly T. brucei, have evolved an expanded and specialized J-protein machinery, likely to be a consequence of an evolutionary fitness/trait to adapt to diverse environment present in hosts and vectors. These analyses will yield insight into the process of parasite differentiation as well as provide new leads for chemotherapeutic treatments. The presence of the STI 1 mediated Hsp 90 hetero-complex formation has not been confirmed in T. brucei. To this end, in silico and biochemical techniques were used to characterize the role of TbSTI 1, as an adaptor protein of Hsp 70 and Hsp 90. Through domain architecture analysis, sequence alignments, phylogenetic analysis and three-dimensional structure prediction, TbSTI 1 was demonstrated to be the most conserved TPR containing co-chaperone of Hsp 70 and Hsp 83 in T. brucei and also shown to be highly similar to its eukaryotic homologues. Recombinant TbSTI 1 was overproduced and purified in E. coli cells and subsequently shown to associate with TcHsp 70 in a concentration dependent manner and associate weakly with TbHsp 70. 4. TbSTI 1 and TbHsp 83 were also demonstrated to be expressed and upregulated upon exposure to heat shock at the bloodstream stage of parasite development. In conclusion, this study is the first to report the interaction of TbSTI 1 with a chaperone. Interactions between TbSTI 1 and Hsp 70 s were demonstrated and therefore, the formation of the hetero-complex is predicted based the similarity of TbSTI 1 to other STI 1 proteins...|$|R

In miombo woodlands, the seasonality of productivity remains poorly understood, and it is unclear whether stomatal limitations or variations in leaf traits cause seasonal changes in productivity. I use data of leaf gas exchange and leaf traits collected in dry and wet seasons to assess the response of photosynthesis to seasonality. I found a large degree of inter-specific responses, where photosynthetic capacity was maintained between seasons in some tree species but not in others. This was linked to inter-specific stomatal regulation on leaf gas exchange, access to soil water and varied leaf traits, indicating differing timing of leaf development during the dry season. Differing timing of leaf flushing can create niche separation, facilitating the co-existence of miombo woodland tree species. I use data collected along a 5 km transect through miombo woodland to characterise the spatial distributions and scales of variation of C stocks in woody biomass and soils, and assess the links between them. I found that on the scale of a few meters, soil C stocks varied in relation to soil texture. At the kilometre scale, surface soil and woody C stocks were coupled, and varied in relation to topography. By understanding the scales of variation I was able to make recommendations for optimal sampling of C stocks in a miombo woodland landscape for improved C stock assessments. I developed and tested a simple spatial model of deforestation and degradation, using a rule-based approach, to produce risk maps of areas more likely to be affected by deforestation and degradation for a study site in central Mozambique. I found that my model was able to accurately predict the locality of high risk areas, and that roads were the major axis for forest biomass loss. Risk maps created from this method are useful for exploring the drivers of deforestation and degradation in a region dominated by miombo woodland, and for targeting policy and management efforts. Overall, this thesis has contributed significantly to our understanding of natural and human driven miombo woodland C dynamics over a range of scales, from the leaf to the landscape. In the final chapter, I discuss the implications of each chapter for our understanding of miombo woodland C dynamics, and suggest areas for further research...|$|R
40|$|The {{variability}} of convective cloud spans {{a wide range}} of temporal and spatial scales and is of fundamental importance for global weather and climate systems. Datasets from geostationary satellite instruments such as SEVIRI provide high time resolution observations across a large area. In this study we use data from SEVIRI to quantify the diurnal cycle of cloud top temperature within the instrument’s field of view and discuss these results in relation to retrieval biases. We evaluate SEVIRI cloud top temperatures from the new CLAAS- 2 (CLoud property dAtAset using SEVIRI, Edition 2) dataset against CALIOP data. Results show a mean bias of + 0. 44 K {{with a standard deviation of}} 11. 7 K, which is in agreement with previous validation studies. Analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of these errors shows that absolute retrieval biases vary from less than 5 K over the southeast Atlantic Ocean up to 30 K over central Africa at night. Night and daytime retrieval biases can also differ by up to 30 K in some areas, potentially contributing to biases in the estimated amplitude of the diurnal cycle. This illustrates the importance of considering spatial and diurnal variations in retrieval errors when using the CLAAS- 2 dataset. Keeping these biases in mind, we quantify the seasonal, diurnal and spatial variation of cloud top temperature across SEVIRI’s field of view using the CLAAS- 2 dataset. By comparing the mean diurnal cycle of cloud top temperature with the retrieval bias we find that diurnal variations in the retrieval bias can be small, but are often of the same order of magnitude as the amplitude of the observed diurnal cycle, indicating that in some regions the diurnal cycle apparent in the observations may be significantly impacted by diurnal variability in the accuracy of the retrieval. We show that the CLAAS- 2 dataset can measure the diurnal cycle of cloud tops accurately in regions of stratiform cloud such as the southeast Atlantic Ocean and Europe, where cloud top temperature retrieval biases are small and exhibit limited spatial and temporal variability. Quantifying the diurnal cycle over the tropics and regions of desert is more difficult, as retrieval biases are larger and display significant diurnal variability. CLAAS- 2 cloud top temperature data are found to be of limited skill in measuring the diurnal cycle accurately over desert regions. In tropical regions such as Central <b>Africa,</b> the diurnal <b>cycle</b> can be described by the CLAAS- 2 data to some extent, although retrieval biases appear to reduce the amplitude of the real diurnal cycle of cloud top temperatures. This is the first study to relate the diurnal variations in SEVIRI retrieval bias to observed diurnal cycles in cloud top temperature. Our results may be of interest to those in the observation and modelling communities when using cloud top properties data from SEVIRI, particularly for studies considering the diurnal cycle of convection. </p...|$|R
