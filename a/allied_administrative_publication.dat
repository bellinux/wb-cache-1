These local governments are seen to be equipped with institutional systems to comprehensively collect their <b>administrative</b> <b>publications</b> in accordance with their regulations that require affiliated organizations to send their publications to them. As for the preservation of <b>administrative</b> <b>publications,</b> the study looked into the case of Osaka, which has a set of regulations that mandates the permanent preservation of <b>administrative</b> <b>publications</b> of historical or cultural value, and that of Tokyo, which has commissioned the task of publication preservation to the Tokyo Metropolitan Archives to which <b>administrative</b> <b>publications</b> are required to be sent. The regulations, however, are found to have some common limitations : first, the coverage of both the range of <b>administrative</b> organizations and <b>publications</b> is limited, for example, publications issued by the assembly or committees are excluded. Second, the regulations do not seem to cover all the stages of <b>administrative</b> <b>publication</b> management, including preservation. Third, the lack of efforts to incorporate agencies responsible for the management of <b>administrative</b> <b>publications</b> in local governments, which include the archive, assembly library, and public libraries, into the whole system of <b>administrative</b> <b>publication</b> management...|$|R

50|$|Austria {{had been}} {{divided into four}} {{occupation}} zones and jointly occupied by the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and France. Lower Austria, the region surrounding Vienna, {{was part of the}} Soviet zone. The capital itself was considered too valuable to be left to any one power and was, just like Berlin, separately divided into four sectors. In drafting their plans, the allies worked from the city's pre-1938 borders.The Nazi expansion of Vienna, however, had made some sense. A number of rural areas incorporated into Greater Vienna were inimical. Most of Lower Austria had been leaning conservative to nationalist for a century; Vienna had been a bastion of Social Democracy for decades. The bureaucracy steering Vienna, a city of industry and finance, was sociologically distant from the agricultural countryside. Some of the suburbs affected, however, had long had much closer ties to the capital than to the rest of their former province, both socially and in terms of infrastructure. Permanently ejecting these suburbs from Vienna would have been inadvisable. Reaffirming the Nazi border changes either entirely or in part, on the other hand, would have led to demarcation discrepancies between Austrian and <b>allied</b> <b>administrative</b> divisions. Disputes regarding communal debt added to the problem.|$|R

25|$|All four <b>Allies</b> shared <b>administrative</b> {{responsibilities}} for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency {{reform in the}} Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the Soviet Union imposed a blockade on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The Berlin airlift, conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949. In 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in West Germany and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the Marxist-Leninist German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} airport security decisions frequently fail to follow rules and procedures. Investigating this phenomenon through an analysis of data garnered from ethnographic and field surveys of European airports suggests that propensity to bend or ignore the rules {{can be associated with}} three distinct airport employee types, namely the ‘adaptive’, ‘social interactive’ and ‘compliant bureaucratic’. Each employee security profile is characterised in terms of the degree of rule compliance. ‘Adaptive’ employees are likely to bend rules. ‘Social interactive’ rely primarily on group decision making, and ‘compliant bureaucratic’ are <b>allied</b> with the <b>administrative</b> and security regulations. These findings should alert security officials to the possibility of leveraging such employee profiles in terms of human resource recruitment and physical distribution within the airport organisation to take advantage of specific requirements in the operation of the airport...|$|R
