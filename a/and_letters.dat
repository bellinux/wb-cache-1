40|$|Background/Aims: In Alzheimer's {{dementia}} (AD), letter fluency is less impaired than category fluency. To check whether category fluency <b>and</b> <b>letter</b> fluency depend differently on semantics and attention, 53 mild AD {{patients were}} given animal <b>and</b> <b>letter</b> fluency tasks, two semantic tests (the Verbal Semantic Questionnaire and the BORB Association Match test), and two attentional tests (the Stroop Colour-Word Interference {{test and the}} Digit Cancellation test). Methods: We conducted a LISREL confirmatory factor analysis to check {{the extent to which}} category fluency <b>and</b> <b>letter</b> fluency tasks were related to semantics and attention, viewed as latent variables. Results: Both types of fluency tasks were related to the latent variable Semantics but not to the latent variable Attention. Conclusions: Our findings warn against interpreting the disproportionate impairment of AD patients on category <b>and</b> <b>letter</b> fluency as a contrast between semantics and attention...|$|R
