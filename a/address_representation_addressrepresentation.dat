40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} {{provisional}} design proposal for {{modification of the}} numbering and <b>address</b> <b>representation</b> of Internet Protocol 4 (IP 4), the Internet address system nearing exhaustion, based on biology. Biologically-inspired design have been applied in numerous technological fields with success. The paper proposes the expansion of IP v 4 <b>address</b> <b>representation</b> {{by the addition of}} twelve 8 bit suffixes to each IP v 4 address using numbers inspired from DNA sequences. This work outlines a design proposal, without technical and networking specifications, which will be the outcome of future work. This scheme, if deemed feasible, could see the creation of at least 1. 6 × 1031 unique addresses and prolong the usefulness of IP v 4, beyond the projected operational exhaustion time frame of 10 years...|$|R

Recent surveys indicate that while there is a growing trend toward more active teaching approaches, the majority of faculty report extensive lecturing. For example, the 2010 – 2011 HERI survey of faculty (Hurtado et al. 2012) found that, in STEM, the majority of faculty (70 % of male faculty and 50 % of female faculty) report using extensive lecture most or all the time. Surveys in individual disciplines have found similar results. A 2010 survey of calculus faculty found 80 % of instructors lecturing “very often” or “often” (Apkarian and Kirin 2017). The majority of STEM faculty use extensive lectures the majority of the time. Our results indicate that shifting toward more active approaches may increase the persistence of women and students of color.|$|R

At the heart of our analyzer is a new algorithm recognizing scalar evolutions. We define a representation called trees of recurrences that is able to capture di#erent levels of abstractions: from the finer level that is a subset of the SSA representation restricted to arithmetic operations on scalar variables, to the coarser levels such as the evolution envelopes that abstract sets of possible evolutions in loops. Unlike previous work, our algorithm tracks induction variables without prior classification of a few evolution patterns: di#erent levels of abstraction can be obtained on demand. The low complexity of the algorithm fits the constraints of a production compiler as illustrated by the evaluation of our implementation on standard benchmark programs...|$|R
