2500|$|In 2013 prime {{minister}} Kevin Rudd {{introduced a new}} <b>asylum</b> <b>policy</b> which meant that all asylum seekers arriving by boat would be sent offshore to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea for processing and resettlement. This included gay refugees, even though they face persecution under Papua New Guinean law with homosexual acts criminalised and a potential penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Asylum seekers are warned in an orientation presentation on arrival by the Salvation Army that [...] "Homosexuality is illegal in Papua New Guinea. People have been imprisoned or killed for performing homosexual acts." [...] This places them {{in the position of}} being required to declare their sexuality to be eligible for refugee protection yet liable to face persecution from other people and under local laws. Gay asylum seekers also face bullying, assault and sexual abuse on Manus Island from others, including officials and other refugees, due to their sexuality. Australia faces accusations from refugee advocates that it has violated its non-refoulement obligations under international law by exposing LGBT asylum seekers to such dangers. After the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea in 2016 ordered the closure of Manus Island immigration detention centre on the basis that it breached constitutional guarantees of liberty, the Australian government confirmed the closure but not {{what would happen to the}} detainees.|$|E

40|$|The {{experiences}} of the ongoing refugee crisis in Europe highlight {{the failures of the}} current model of having the EU and its members states share responsibility for <b>asylum</b> <b>policies.</b> Based on standard criteria of fiscal federalism, this paper analyses the shortcomings of the status quo. We show that European <b>asylum</b> <b>policies</b> stand in sharp contradiction to the optimal assignment of tasks within a federal system. For example, the current system creates substantial incentives for free-riding and foregoes the potential benefits of European economies of scale. Given this diagnosis, we explore {{the pros and cons of}} different options for a more European approach. In particular, we analyze and provide estimates of the quantitative implications for the options of: (A) quotas that would distribute refugees across countries according to a pre-determined calculation of reception capacity; (B) EU financing of national service provision; and (C) EU service provision in <b>asylum</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{hopes to}} {{challenge}} the existing paradigm in refugee studies, which presents the development of domestic <b>asylum</b> <b>policies</b> as being essentially driven by a conflict between international humanitarian norms and the self-interest calculations of sovereign states. This paper will show that <b>asylum</b> <b>policies</b> are determined more by conflicting domestic principles, and that the dominance of {{one or another of}} the competing domestic principles is decided largely by the prevailing 'social contract' notions held by the state. That is, notions about social contract determine what the perceived obligations and priorities of the state are; this 'hierarchy of obligations' is clearly manifested in, and indeed guides the development of, <b>asylum</b> <b>policies.</b> Looking first at the macro level, the paper outlines some of the important philosophical dimensions of the social contract idea, some possible variations, as well as the role of the social contract in international refugee and human rights law. Moving on to the chosen case studies, {{the second half of the}} paper examines the dominant notions of 'social contract' in Turkey and Germany, and highlights some of the many ways these notions impacted upon refugee protection in each country during the 1990 s. Finally, the paper compares and contrasts briefly some of the themes and processes which emerged in the two case studies, and concludes by evaluating these results in light of the existing refugee studies paradigm...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{handling}} of asylum applications by the Danish Refugee Appeals Board in the spring of 2016. Centered on the tangible handling of applications amongst the changes to European <b>asylum</b> <b>policies</b> brought on by the European refugee crisis, the thesis investigates whether the rulings, when viewed together, show signs of adhering to any standards or traditions aside from the Danish Aliens Act and international conventions. Specifically, the thesis investigates whether such traditions are reflective of one of two schools of immigrations ethics, that are present in the debate on refugees: namely universalist cosmopolitanism, which has been dominant in the <b>asylum</b> <b>policies</b> of Germany, and is intellectually represented by Joseph Carens, and the particularist nationalism of David Miller, which has been observed in the <b>asylum</b> <b>policies</b> of Great Britain. The thesis finds that while certain non-explicit patterns in the rulings can be observed, these patterns cannot be unequivocally attributed to any one of the two aforementioned ethical views on immigration, mainly owing to a lack of publicly available details about the individual rulings, as well as the somewhat opaque culture of the Appeals Board and its inner workings. In the end, the thesis recommends that the Appeals Board embraces a more open and publicly accessible structure in order to encourage further studies on the subject...|$|R
