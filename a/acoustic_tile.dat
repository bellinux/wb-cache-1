25|$|In 1994, the Seahawks {{moved to}} nearby Husky Stadium {{on the campus}} of the University of Washington for the preseason and 3 regular season games after an <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile</b> fell inside the Kingdome. Upon {{returning}} to the Kingdome, the team finished with a 6-10 record; Tom Flores was replaced as president by David Behring, son of owner Ken Behring, and as head coach by University of Miami coach Dennis Erickson. The 1995 season was only average, with the Seahawks going 8-8, following by a 7-9 campaign in 1996.|$|E
2500|$|In the Smith building, {{the ground}} floor is {{commercial}} space, originally housing a hardware store. [...] Inside, the walls are finished with two-inch tongue-and-groove paneling. [...] The flooring is 1-by-4 tongue-and-groove planking. [...] Originally, there were built-in shelves along {{the full length of}} one wall. [...] The original light fixtures had glass shades and were suspended from the ceiling by drop-cords. [...] The door knobs, locks, and other hardware were brass. [...] Over the years, the original tongue-and-groove ceiling was covered by a suspended <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile</b> ceiling and fluorescent lights have been installed using the original drop-cords. [...] The original shelves have been replaced by new shelving that now runs along both sidewalls, and the floor is now carpeted.|$|E
2500|$|Prominent {{original}} exterior {{features include}} carved limestone detail, numerous false chimneys, steeply pitched slate roofs, and a seven-story clock tower. While {{it is not}} known for certain that Columbia High School was inspired by any earlier structures, there is a strong resemblance to Laynon Hall at Queen's University of Belfast. At {{the very top of the}} clock tower is a copper pyramidal structure. The entire pyramid structure rotates, and one side opens, serving as an observatory. The observatory is equipped with a large refracting telescope made by John Brashear. [...] That telescope is no longer functional, but there is a more modern Celestron C11 reflecting telescope that is used by students. Two levels below are the E. Howard & Co. Style #3 clock works. Alongside the clock is an enormous bronze bell by the Meneely Bell Foundry. Inside the school can be found rooms with fireplaces, hallways with beautiful faience wall tiles by John Scott Award recipient Herman Carl Mueller of Trenton, and mosaic inlaid terrazzo floors in the front hall. The front foyer was recently renovated, removing non-period lighting and mid-century <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile.</b> The restoration included doors that more closely replicated the 1926 originals, a new terrazzo floor, and dramatic lighting of the zodiac-inspired plaster ceiling. Recently, dubious student art dating from as far back as the 1970s was painted over, among other improvements. The auditorium includes a three-manual Ernest M. Skinner Organ. Although it is little used and not completely functional, the organ is one of the few unmodified Skinners in existence and has received an Organ Historical Society citation. Regrettably, on either side of the stage the large plaster grills that hide the organ pipes were water damaged. The original auditorium chandeliers have also been removed. A similar story exists with regard to the swimming pool; while the original vaulted Catalan Guastavino tile ceiling remains, the chandeliers are gone, and a giant arched window is blocked by a later addition.|$|E
50|$|The {{submarines}} have a single-skinned, teardrop-shaped hull {{constructed from}} NQ1 high tensile steel. The hull is fitted with elastomeric <b>acoustic</b> <b>tiles</b> {{to reduce the}} submarine's acoustic signature. The class has a reported dive depth of over 650 ft.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s RKO State Theatre {{began to}} host rock ‘n’ roll shows {{featuring}} popular artists like The Satins, Chubby Checker, and more. This emerging genre led {{to yet another}} renovation with <b>acoustic</b> <b>tiles,</b> which helped produce a booming sound.|$|R
50|$|She was {{reported}} in April 2015 to have struck ice some time in 2014 while tracking Russian vessels. This resulted in an estimated £500,000 worth of damages including a 6 ft dent {{at the top of}} her conning tower and damage to her outer layer of <b>acoustic</b> <b>tiles.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Construction {{on some of}} the {{exterior}} and nearly all of the interior of the memorial continued after its May 1932 dedication. Sheet metal for interior window sashes, doorjambs, and other moldings, fixtures, and fittings was provided by G.O. Robertson of Delaware; Ernest Gichner of Washington, D.C.; and the E. Van Norden Co. of New York. The Hires-Turner Glass Co. of Rosslyn, Virginia, provided the windows and stained glass. The lighting fixtures were supplied by the Sterling Bronze Works, while electrical supplies were furnished by the National Electrical Supply Co. of Washington and A.L. Ladd of Alexandria. Four firms oversaw the plumbing and sewage work: Earl Riley, the D.C. Engineering Co., Potomac Clay Works, and the Thos. Somerville Co. The interior heavy hardware as well as some heavy internal equipment was supplied by Henry H. Meyer & Co. of Washington, D.C., while lighter hardware and fixtures were supplied by Worth Hulfish & Sons of Alexandria; Baldwin-Stuart Co. of Hartford, Connecticut; and Sargent & Co. of New York. Many of the non-marble floors were covered in cork (provided and installed by the David E. Kennedy Co.), and carpeting was provided by Woodward & Lothrop (the department store chain). <b>Acoustic</b> <b>tile</b> was used in many rooms to dampen the echoes produced by the granite walls. This tile was provided by the George P. Little Co. Terrazzo (faux marble flooring) work was done by the V. Foscato Co. of New York. Much of the interior woodwork was supplied by W.A. Smoot & Co. of Alexandria. Interior painting was done by the W.W. MacCallum Co. of Alexandria, while the terracotta (unglazed baked ceramic) decorations were provided by Ernest Simpson of Alexandria. The aluminum for interior work was supplied by the Aerocrete Corporation, and worked and molded into forms by the Aluminum Company of America. Gold vein and Tennessee pink marble were used to line the walls of the first floor atrium and the second floor memorial hall, and ceilings on both floors were plastered. [...] But by the end of 1933, no heating had been installed in the second floor hall.|$|E
5000|$|There are gray {{vertical}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile</b> {{side walls}} and a glassed-in crossover. The mezzanine is glass and stainless steel and features a [...] "Sutphin Boulevard" [...] mosaic on the geographic north wall.|$|E
50|$|On {{the second}} and third stories 10 ft {{corridors}} run through the center. They are surfaced in tile, walled in concrete and drywall over terra cotta walls, and have modern <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile</b> ceilings. A few alcoves remain from where display cases were set into the walls.|$|E
50|$|Proprietary {{types of}} {{acoustic}} plaster {{developed in the}} 1920s included Macoustic Plaster, Sabinite, Kalite, Wyodak, Old Newark and Sprayo-Flake produced by companies such as US Gypsum. These superseded felts and quilts as a common preference of architects but were difficult to apply and so were superseded in turn by <b>acoustic</b> <b>tiles.</b>|$|R

5000|$|As the College of Charleston made {{improvements}} to the Sottile Theatre in early 2011, it discovered two large-scale murals hiding beneath <b>acoustic</b> <b>tiles.</b> Painted on canvas by Italian artists from New York City during the theatre's construction in the 1920s, one scene depicts a centaur and nymphs before a forested and mountainous background. The other shows Classical figures celebrating music and drama before a blue-green sea. The murals were unveiled in 1927 during the theatre's grand opening.  The College of Charleston has started to restore these masterpieces, already removing one mural for safekeeping and repair. The other mural has been uncovered and left hanging, its blemishes, damage and deterioration on display to theatre patrons, including the audiences of Spoleto Festival USA. Much of the restoration work will involve remediation of the many spots of glue used to attach <b>acoustic</b> <b>tiles</b> to the murals decades ago.|$|R
50|$|The {{auditorium}} {{would be}} decorated in <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile</b> of colors with rich ornamented side wall and ceiling panels, including a cornice {{at the junction}} of the side walls and ceiling decorated in deep colors. The lights being used for the auditorium would be an entirely new design. It can be switched to make an combination of colors either turned on or dimmed down.|$|E
50|$|Modern <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile</b> {{was removed}} from the {{interior}} ceiling to reveal the original plastered ceiling, which was restored and painted to match the original interior colors. The stage was reconstructed in the early 2000s. The wooden floor is undergoing research and analysis for restoration by a local historical architectural firm. Repointing of the nearly 90-year-old brick mortar is being conducted by a local historical preservation expert.|$|E
50|$|A third strike hit {{the site}} on August 2. This {{jurisdictional}} strike involved 180 plasterers and cement finishers, who {{walked off the}} job {{in a dispute over}} who would install more than 750000 sq ft of acoustic ceiling tile. The strike didn't idle many workers, just 60 lathers and plasterers' assistants. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service was called in to mediate the dispute. The strike received front-page coverage in The Washington Post. AFL officials denounced the strike, calling it an illegal wildcat strike. Deputy Secretary of Labor Daniel W. Tracy (president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers from 1933 to 1940), and BCTD President John P. Coyne personally intervened in the negotiations to bring them to a swift conclusion. The strike ended on August 8 after a special representative from National Defense Advisory Commissioner Sidney Hillman also intervened. In the past, the carpenters performed 50 percent of all <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile</b> work, with the bricklayers and plasterers installing 25 percent of the tile. Under the new agreement, the three unions shared equally in the work. Because the <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile</b> wasn't due to be installed yet, the strike created no real delay in the work.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{constructed}} in early December, 2016, by the technical committee—Pete Dalton, Erik Klausmeyer, Vic Tredwell, Zafra Whitcomb—and many other helpers. The basement room was soundproofed with donated <b>acoustic</b> <b>tiles.</b> Equipment was selected, purchased and installed. The antenna was strapped to the chimney of the building using a metal-banding machine from the transfer station. A dedicated internet connection was established.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a large}} {{space and}} presumably {{combines}} several earlier rooms. Almost no original fabric is visible, the walls being panelled in plywood and the ceiling covered in fibro. Over the bar area air conditioning ducting has been enclosed in a lowered ceiling finished with <b>acoustic</b> <b>tiles.</b> An irregular concrete slab has been laid across {{about half of the}} floor.|$|R

50|$|When {{built in}} 1867, the school housed four classrooms, {{two on the}} west side of each level, with stairwells, coatrooms, and other {{facilities}} on the east side. On the second floor this plan is still in place, with wainscoted plaster walls, blackboards, and original door and window surrounds. On the first floor, the wall between the two classrooms was removed in the 1920s to accommodate town meetings, and a suspended <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile</b> ceiling was added in the 1970s. The cupola is a reconstruction of the original, also made in the 1970s, and houses a bell originally hanging in the South Dennis Graded School.|$|E
50|$|On the east, {{a similar}} vestibule, {{connected}} to the main one by a hallway and stairs, leads into the fellowship room. It is similarly decorated, but more modestly, with <b>acoustic</b> <b>tiles</b> covering its ceiling. The windows have flat molding indicating that they survive from the 1840s predecessor to the current building. Four are memorial stained glass; two are figural while {{the other two are}} architectural.|$|R

50|$|The western half of {{the second}} floor is an open meeting room {{supported}} by steel I-beams visible from the attic, with carpeted floor and daises on the wall. The original master bedroom is in the northeast corner. It retains its marble mantelpiece in the chimney breast. It is currently carpeted, with <b>acoustic</b> <b>tiles</b> in the ceiling. The walls, baseboards and plaster cornice are original, as are the doors and silver hardware.|$|R

50|$|An {{empty room}} with cement floor and ceiling, cinderblock walls, and no {{flammable}} materials would have approximately zero fire loading; any fire entering such a room from elsewhere will find nothing to feed on. However, nearly anything {{that makes a}} room useful (such as furniture, electrical appliances, or computer equipment), or attractive (such as wood panelling, <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile,</b> carpeting, curtains, or wall decorations), will increase the fire loading. Some usages inherently carry high fire loading as a side effect (an art gallery and studio, for example, is likely to contain large amounts of canvas, paints, solvents, and wooden framing). Buildings under construction or renovation tend to carry high fire loads {{in the form of}} construction materials, solvents, and fuel for generators.|$|E
50|$|Still, {{playing at}} the Civic was no picnic. The site had been created as a multi-use facility, {{including}} for basketball games, and its <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile</b> ceilings and hardwood floors did nothing to enhance the instruments’ sound quality. But Rick Larsen, facilities manager for the Civic, was determined to make it work. In three phases, he and his crew, with the advice of acoustician Red Wetherill, installed an acoustic wall behind the orchestra, acoustic panels for the back wall (which came from the old Fox Theater), and acoustic “clouds” that came from Davies Hall in San Francisco. All together, the installations greatly improved the musical richness. The gift of a permanent Steinway piano in 2006 took the Symphony performances up another notch.|$|E
50|$|From the {{reception}} vestibule a metal staircase {{to the right}} arrives at the upper level loggia. The reception vestibule opens into the main bar area. Evidence suggests that later openings {{have been made in}} the wall between the main bar area and the west pavilion. The stair from here arrives at the upper loggia which connects to the dining area. At ground level, the east wing houses a billiard room and toilet/shower facilities. An <b>acoustic</b> <b>tile</b> ceiling has been inserted in the new reception and main bar areas. Plain plaster ceilings are found elsewhere throughout the ground floor. The toilets in the west wing retain original finishes and the former women's shower area has been altered to accommodate male toilets. The men's shower, change and toilet facilities in the east wing remain.|$|E
