The limits applicable at sea in Emission Control Areas (ECAs) were reduced from 1. 5 % to 1 % in 2010 and are planned to be further reduced to 0. 1 %, effective from 1 January 2015. This paper analyses {{the impact of the}} International Maritime Organization’s Tier II/III standards introduced by <b>Annex</b> <b>VI</b> amendments adopted in October 2008 on costs and prices of roro (roll on/roll off) traffic in the ECAs in North Europe and on the competitiveness of roro shipping in the ECAs compared to trucking. We demonstrate that the new <b>Annex</b> <b>VI</b> agreement may be quite costly for the participants in the shipping industry and will result in higher freight rates. Based on a detailed price analysis on modal competition between the roro/truck option and the ‘truck only’ option on thirty origin–destination routes linked to the ECAs, we conclude that the use of low sulphur fuel is expected to increase the transport prices particularly on the origin–destination relations with a medium or long short sea section. The paper also presents the results of a survey among leading short sea operators in the ECAs in view of providing more insight on expected modal shifts and price elasticity in the short sea market...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} written in Swedish {{and focus on the}} Port of Gothenburg’s and the trade {{association}} Ports of Sweden’s views on future handling of scrubber generated wastes. This report has been fulfilled because of the new rules from IMO, concerning maximum sulphur content in the marine fuels, which will come into force in SECA during 2015. Many of the petroleum based marine fuels contain high levels of sulphur that can be harmful for both human and the environment. e. g. acidification and secondary particulate matter. Acidification means that the pH value decreases in soils and lakes, which affect the ecosystem. Secondary particulate matter can cause human health issues such as early death. IMO MARPOL <b>Annex</b> <b>VI</b> was introduces in 1997 and revised in 2008 with amendments that entered into force in 2010. <b>Annex</b> <b>VI</b> contains the permissible limits of sulphur in marine fuels and emission into the air. Due to the revision of <b>Annex</b> <b>VI</b> in 2008 the European commission presented a proposal of amendment of the sulphur directive. The revised <b>Annex</b> <b>VI</b> from 2008 and the proposal of amendment states that all equivalent substitutes for low sulphur fuel that can provide the same positive environment impact is allowed to be used in SECA. One of the substitutes recommended by European Union is the use of an exhaust gas cleaning technology, i. e. scrubber. There are different types of scrubbers; wet and dry. To reduce the sulphur dioxide from the exhaust the wet scrubber uses either untreated seawater in an open system or caustic soda treated freshwater in a closed system. The open system is dependent on the oceans alkalinity. A closed system can be used in all kinds of waters, however, waste are generated and has to be taking care of in port. A dry scrubber uses pellets and generates a solid waste that also has to be handled in port. A semi-structured interview with the Port of Gothenburg and Ports of Sweden has been performed to fulfil the purpose of the report. The conclusion of the report is that the Port of Gothenburg, the industry and employers' organization Ports of Sweden believes that they have the possibility to receive waste from scrubbers. However, today they have not made any investigations to support this statement. Also both organizations have incomplete knowledge concerning the current amount of waste generated by using different scrubbers and the characteristics of the waste...|$|R
