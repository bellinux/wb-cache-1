50|$|Following Piscine, {{there is}} a short {{straight}} followed by heavy braking for a quick left which is immediately followed by the tight 135 degree right-hander called La Rascasse. This is another corner which requires full steering lock; it {{will be remembered for}} a long time as the location {{of one of the most}} suspicious manoeuvres in recent Formula One history after the 2006 season when Michael Schumacher appeared to deliberately stop his car in qualifying so as to prevent Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber - who were both following and were on flying laps - from out-qualifying him. The Rascasse takes the cars into a short straight that precedes the final corner, Virage Antony Noghès. Named after the organiser of the first Monaco Grand Prix, the corner is a tight right-hander which brings the cars back onto the start-finish straight, and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to <b>start</b> a new lap.|$|R
50|$|A {{starting}} gate {{consisting of}} two or more tapes is erected <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> riders must situate themselves not more than 10 cm from this and not touch it once the green light comes on, they must also remain stationary until the tapes are raised. Failure to do so is known as a tape infringement and can result in a false start being recorded and the rider penalised (disqualified, or in league matches in Great Britain, a 15-metre penalty or replace the disqualified rider with a team reserve). The race is started with the raising of the start tape mechanism operated by the match referee and the riders must proceed around the track in an anti-clockwise direction without both wheels illegally leaving the track boundaries.|$|R
50|$|Flyball is run {{in teams}} of four dogs, as a relay. The course {{consists}} of four hurdles placed 10 feet (3 m) apart from each other, with <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> six feet (1.8 m) from the first hurdle, and the flyball box 15 feet (4.5 m) after the last one, making for a 51-foot (15.5 m) length. The hurdle height {{is determined by the}} shoulder height of the smallest dog in the team. Under current North American Flyball Association (NAFA) rules this should be 5 inches (12.7 cm) below the withers height of the smallest dog, to a height of no less than 7 inches (20.3 cm) and no greater than 14 inches (40.6 cm). Current EFC (European Flyball Championship) rules limits the height to no less than 17.5 cm and no greater than 35 cm. Each dog must return its ball all <b>the</b> way <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line</b> before <b>the</b> next dog crosses. Ideal running is nose-to-nose at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> first team to have all four dogs cross <b>the</b> finish <b>line</b> error free wins the heat. Penalties are applied to teams if the ball is dropped or if the next relay dog is released early.|$|R
50|$|By 1960, {{a number}} of forces were to shape the {{direction}} of the company, the publication list and its graphic design. On 20 April 1961, Penguin became a publicly listed company on the London Stock Exchange; consequently, Allen Lane had a diminished role at the firm though he was to continue as Managing Director. New techniques such as phototypesetting and offset-litho printing were to replace hot metal and letterpress printing, dramatically reducing cost and permitting the printing of images and text on the same paper stock, thus paving the way for the introduction of photography and novel approaches to graphic design on paperback covers. In May 1960, Tony Godwin was appointed as editorial adviser, rapidly rising to Chief Editor from which position he sought to broaden the range of Penguin's list and keep up with new developments in graphic design. To this end, he hired Germano Facetti in January 1961, who was to decisively alter the appearance of the Penguin brand. Beginning with the crime series, Facetti canvassed the opinion of {{a number of}} designers including Romek Marber for a new look to the Penguin cover. It was Marber's suggestion of what came to be called the Marber grid along with the retention of traditional Penguin colour-coding that was to replace the previous three horizontal bars design and set the pattern for the design of the company's paperbacks for the next twenty years. Facetti rolled out <b>the</b> new treatment <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Penguin <b>line</b> <b>starting</b> with crime, <b>the</b> orange fiction series, then Pelicans, Penguin Modern Classics, Penguin Specials, and Penguin Classics, giving an overall visual unity to the company's list. A somewhat different approach was taken to the Peregrine, Penguin Poets, Penguin Modern Poets, and Penguin Plays series. There were over a hundred different series published in total.|$|R
50|$|The {{third row}} of the grid was a surprise, even at this power circuit. Ever since the item was made {{compulsory}} for turbo powered cars {{at the start of}} the 1987 season, the Arrows team had been experiencing problems with the FIA pop-off valve on their Megatron turbo engines, the problem being that the valve was cutting in too early and the drivers weren't able to exploit the full available power. In 1987 this meant that drivers Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever struggled to keep up with their turbocharged rivals. In 1988 it meant they were often only as fast as the leading atmos, and often they were in fact slower, even on noted power circuits such as Silverstone and Hockenheim which should have suited their turbo power. The team's engine guru Heini Mader had finally solved the pop-off valve problem (which turned out to be the pop-off valve being located too high above the engine, a problem Honda and Ferrari had long since solved), and suddenly with an extra 30-50 bhp at their disposal the Arrows A10B's were actually 5 km/h faster than <b>the</b> Honda-powered McLarens <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line</b> and by <b>the</b> time the reached the speed trap before the Rettifilo, Cheever was reported to be the only car to hit 200 mph while the McLarens and Ferraris were timed at around 192 mph. This new found power allowed Cheever and Warwick to line up 5th and 6th respectively, one place in front of World Champion Nelson Piquet in his Lotus Honda. This also meant that turbos filled the first seven places on the grid. Piquet's Lotus team mate Satoru Nakajima qualified 10th, with the Lotuses split by the fastest non-turbos, the Benetton-Fords of Thierry Boutsen and Alessandro Nannini in 8th and 9th places on the grid. Due in no small part to their sudden improvement in speed, Arrows were suddenly being seen as a dark horse for the race should McLaren and Ferrari run into problems.|$|R
5000|$|This {{operation}} {{began on}} the night of 31 October with an Australian attack keeping pressure on the Germans near the coast. Further South, timed for the early morning of 1 November, then delayed for 24 hours, the 151st Brigade with the 152nd Brigade, both under the command of the 2nd New Zealand Division, were to advance 4,000 yards to Tel el Aqqaqir on the Rahman Track, supported by tanks of 8th and 50th Royal Tank Regiments. Following them would be the 9th Armoured Brigade. The advance would be supported by a First World War style creeping barrage provided by 13 field regiments and two medium regiments of artillery. The 151st Brigade, supported by the 505th Field Company, Royal Engineers and the 149th Field Ambulance, was on the Northern edge of the advance, with the 28th (Māori) battalion providing the first half of their Northern flank, the second half would be formed by the 6th D.L.I performing a right wheel halfway through the advance. The infantry had a seven-mile march up to their <b>starting</b> <b>lines</b> during which time the objective were bombed by the Desert Air Force. Moving <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line</b> at 01:05hrs <b>the</b> infantry advanced into the smoke and dust of the barrage which reduced visibility to 50 yards. [...] The whole night to the east was broken by hundreds of gun flashes stabbing into the darkness. The shells whistled overhead to burst with a deafening crash in the target area, and from then, until the barrage closed about three hours later, the frightful shattering noise went on continually... Every twelve yards there was a shell hole. Col. Watson 6th D.L.I. [...] It was well organized. On each flank - on the battalion flanks - they had Bofors guns firing tracer every two or three minutes so that you could keep on <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> barrage was going for about two minutes then they'd drop two or three smoke bombs - they were a bloody nuisance... But when they dropped you knew the barrage was lifting. You just moved in. Pte Jackson Browne, 8th D.L.I. [...] In the advance through the German trenches and gun lines, some had been stunned by the bombardment, others fought back, with all three battalions coming under fire. <b>Lines</b> through <b>the</b> mines were cleared behind the advance, and by dawn, having reached their objective the infantry dug in, and were in place to witness the destruction of 9th Armoured Brigade as it charged dug in German guns. Relieved {{in the early hours of}} 3 November, the brigade had suffered almost 400 casualties and taken more than 400 prisoners.|$|R
