30|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effects of fluid-related {{processes}} during the early postseismic relaxation. First, we present the results of a reference model (REF) with fixed viscoelastic parameters that were based on previous studies (e.g., Hu et al., 2004; Hu and Wang, 2012; Wang et al., 2012) and were found to provide a good first-order fit to the early postseismic deformation. Then we evaluate the impacts of poroelasticity and mantle heterogeneity in the <b>arc</b> <b>center.</b> In REF, the shear moduli for the elastic plates and viscoelastic upper mantle are assumed to be 48 and 64  GPa, respectively. Poisson’s ratio and rock density are assumed to be 0.25 and 3.3  g/cm 3, respectively, for the entire domain. The Maxwell steady-state viscosity ηM of the mantle wedge and oceanic mantle is 1019 and 1020  Pa s, respectively. ηM of the shallow (≤ 50  km) and deep (50 to 120  km) afterslip shear zones are 1017 and 1018  Pa s, respectively. The Kelvin transient viscosity ηK of the Burgers body in the reference and all the following test models is assumed to be one order of magnitude lower than ηM. Details of the reference model and a thorough exploration of the model parameter space will be published elsewhere (Hu et al., manuscript in preparation).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a three {{dimensional}} {{numerical simulation}} is performed on a stationary arc {{to study the}} effect of torch angle in {{gas tungsten arc welding}} (GTAW) of SS 304 stainless steel. A comparison has been made to investigate 90 o and 70 o torch angles and analyze the effect on arc and weld pool shape. Current density, heat flux and gas shear stress are calculated in the arc region and are used as input to the workpiece to determine the weld pool. Buoyancy and Marangoni shear also affect the weld pool shape and are taken into account. The computed and experimental results are observed symmetric for 90 o torch angle. For 70 o torch angle, current density and hence the heat flux due to electron contribution is found the maximum behind and heat flux due to conduction and convection is found the maximum ahead of the electrode tip in the welding direction. This makes the maximum of total heat flux symmetric along the <b>arc</b> <b>center.</b> Heat flux due to conduction and convection decreases as the torch angle decreases resulting in a shallow weld pool. The nonsymmetric “w” shaped weld pool is developed by the combined effect of the gas shear and Marangoni convection. It is found that for 70 o torch angle, the weld pool becomes non-symmetric, shallow and wide ahead of the electrode tip in the welding direction. The numerical weld pool shapes are verified through experiments...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} implementation plan for Ames Research Center (ARC) within the overall {{framework of the}} NASA Strategic Plan. It describes how ARC intends to implement its Center of Excellence responsibilities, Agency assigned missions, Agency and Enterprise lead programs, and other roles in support of NASA's vision and mission. All Federal agencies are required by the 1993 Government Performance and Results Act to implement a long-term strategic planning process that includes measurable outcomes and strict accountability. At NASA, this planning process is shaped by the Space Act of 1958, annual appropriations, and other external mandates, {{as well as by}} customer requirements. The resulting Strategic Plan sets the overall architecture for what we do, identifies who our customers are, and directs where we are going and why. The Strategic Plan is the basis upon which decisions regarding program implementation and resource deployment are made. Whereas the strategic planning process examines the long-term direction of the organization and identifies a specific set of goals, the implementation planning process examines the detailed performance of the organization and allocates resources toward meeting these goals. It is the purpose of this implementation document to provide the connection between the NASA Strategic Plan and the specific programs and support functions that ARC employees perform. This connection flows from the NASA Strategic Plan, through the various Strategic Enterprise plans to the <b>ARC</b> <b>Center</b> of Excellence, primary missions, Lead Center programs, program support responsibilities, and ultimately, {{to the role of the}} individual ARC employee...|$|E
40|$|Computer {{assisted}} optimal illumination {{design is}} crucial when developing cost-effective machine vision systems. Standard local optimization methods, such as downhill simplex optimization (DHSO), often {{result in an}} optimal solution that {{is influenced by the}} starting point by converging to a local minimum, especially when dealing with high dimensional illumination designs or nonlinear merit spaces. This work presents a novel nonlinear optimization approach, based on design and analysis of computer experiments (DACE). The methodology is first illustrated with a 2 D case study of four light sources symmetrically positioned along a fixed arc in order to obtain optimal irradiance uniformity on a flat Lambertian reflecting target at the <b>arc</b> <b>center.</b> The first step consists of choosing angular positions with no overlap between sources using a fast, flexible space filling design. Ray-tracing simulations are then performed at the design points and a merit function is used for each configuration to quantify the homogeneity of the irradiance at the target. The obtained homogeneities at the design points are further used as input to a Gaussian Process (GP), which develops a preliminary distribution for the expected merit space. Global optimization is then performed on the GP more likely providing optimal parameters. Next, the light positioning case study is further investigated by varying the radius of the arc, and by adding two spots symmetrically positioned along an arc diametrically opposed to the first one. The added value of using DACE with regard to the performance in convergence is 6 times faster than the standard simplex method for equal uniformity of 97 %. The obtained results were successfully validated experimentally using a short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imager monitoring a Spectralon panel illuminated by tungsten halogen sources with 10 % of relative error. status: publishe...|$|E

30|$|We shall {{perform a}} rough {{estimate}} {{on the degree}} of attenuation for an ion precipitation structure with width similar to the onset electron arc. In the simulation examples shown in Fang et al. (2004), the lowest halfwidth of the proton arc is 30  km, in which the spreading causes the peak flux intensity at the <b>arc</b> <b>center</b> to decrease to ~[*] 48 % of the incident flux on top of the ionosphere. In our events the mean arc width is ~[*] 0.33 ° or ~[*] 18.5  km in terms of halfwidth. We make a rough estimate by extrapolating Fang et al.’s given examples and infer that, for an arc halfwidth of 18  km the incident proton flux might be reduced to ~[*] 36 %. In other words, the proton flux on top of the ionosphere is expected to be roughly 3 times as large as that after the spatial spreading. Assuming that the proton auroral intensity is proportional to the proton/hydrogen flux attenuated by the spatial spreading, since our observation indicates that the proton aurora averaged over the arc band is mostly within ~[*] 10 % of its mean late-growth-phase value, the variation of the arc-related ion precipitation flux from the CPS (before the spatial spreading) is likely within ~[*] 30 % of its mean late-growth-phase value, according to the above considerations. In comparison, the ion precipitation flux during a substorm dipolarization typically increases by several times (Gilson et al. 2012). It is key to note that, the spatial spreading effect of proton auroras applies to both the growth phase and the TSSO. Since we have noticed that the proton auroral variations are comparable in magnitude during the late growth phase and during the TSSO, our inference that the TSSO appears not to add much contribution to the arc-related ion precipitation flux still holds. To summarize, {{while it is true that}} the actual variation level of the ion precipitation flux in the CPS might be somehow higher than that reflected in proton auroras when the spatial spreading effect is considered, our main conclusions are not qualitatively altered.|$|E
40|$|This study {{involves}} {{an examination of}} geochemical data from the Tatara-San Pedro Volcanic Complex (TSPVC), an approximately 250 km 2 Quaternary frontal volcanic <b>arc</b> <b>center</b> located at 36 ° S, 70. 5 ° W in the Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) of the Chilean Andes. Every lava flow in almost thirty, mostly vertical, stratigraphic sections was sampled, and {{used in conjunction with}} field observations, K-Ar and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages, and paleomagnetic data, to construct generalized chemo-stratigraphic columns. These columns not only demonstrate changes in lava composition with time, but were used to reveal the sequence of petrogenetic processes that formed those lavas. Geochemical variation both within a single lava flow and amongst members of an eruptive package of lavas was established, using lava flows which had erupted at different times, and were characterized by different mineralogical and geochemical features. Paleomagnetic and geochemical data were also used to correlate lava flows and packages of flows erupted onto different geographic regions of the complex. ^ Petrogenetic modelling suggests that magma supply rates may be the dominant parameter controlling lava compositions; high rates of supply produce compositionally monotonous sequences of mixed basalt and basaltic andesite, which largely comprise the main volcanic edifices. The final-erupted lavas in many of these sequences are the least contaminated and may represent the best proxies for recharge magma compositions. During periods of intermediate magma supply rates, increased cooling and crystallization produces greater compositional range between mixing endmembers, and mixed andesites are the result. Low supply rates are associated with either single, short-lived flank eruptions of mafic lava, or more evolved compositions derived independently from differentiation of magma within small volume chambers. The relationship between fractionated, erupted, and recharge volumes determines the nature of erupted sequences. The range of lava compositions at TSPVC, as the result of multiple sources, different crustal contaminants, and different petrogenetic processes, is almost as great as that exhibited by all volcanoes from the Southern Volcanic Zone. This suggests that the dominant control on SVZ compositions may not be crust:mantle ratio, but different petrogenetic processes and changing crustal contaminants with time. ...|$|E
