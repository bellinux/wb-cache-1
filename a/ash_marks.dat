These, and every circumstance touching the Indian, were important in his eyes. His visits to Maine were chiefly for love of the Indian. He had the satisfaction of seeing the manufacture of the bark-canoe, {{as well as of}} trying his hand in its management on the rapids. He was inquisitive about the making of the stone arrow-head, and in his last days charged a youth setting out for the Rocky Mountains to find an Indian who could tell him that: [...] "It was well worth a visit to California to learn it." [...] Occasionally, a small party of Penobscot Indians would visit Concord, and pitch their tents for a few weeks in summer on the river-bank. He failed not to make acquaintance with the best of them; though he well knew that asking questions of Indians is like catechizing beavers and rabbits. In his last visit to Maine he had great satisfaction from Joseph Polis, an intelligent Indian of Oldtown, who was his guide for some weeks.|$|R

5000|$|In morning, Atisuran invited Enathinathar to a duel in {{a secluded}} place. Enathinathar consented {{and reached the}} spot with his sword and shield.

As Enathinathar (the lion) pounced the [...] "fox", the deceiving rival removed his shield and revealed the Tripundra on his forehead. The stunned Enathinathar took the Tripundra as a sign that Atisuran had converted to Shaivism and became a devotee of Shiva. Instead of slaying a Shaiva, Enathinathar decided to die. However, he did not lay down his weapons as he did not want Atisuran - the [...] "Shaiva" [...] - to incur the sin of killing an unarmed man. Enathinathar stood standstill in a pose as though he was combating, but did make his attempt to fight as he awaited the fatal blow from Atisuran. As Enathinathar fell on the ground, Shiva - pleased with his extreme [...] "self-sacrificing" [...] devotion - appeared before him and took him to Kailash, Shiva's abode. The tale emphasizes the importance of external Shaiva symbols like the Tripundra symbol and the rudraksha beads worn by Shiavas.|$|R
