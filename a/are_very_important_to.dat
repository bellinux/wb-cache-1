5|$|The vegetal diet of the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is high {{in fiber}} and only moderate in protein. Salt licks <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the nutrition of the rhino. These licks can be small hot springs, seepages of salty water, or mud-volcanoes. The salt licks also serve an important social purpose for the rhinos—males visit the licks {{to pick up the}} scent of females in oestrus. Some Sumatran rhinos, however, live in areas where salt licks are not readily available, or the rhinos have not been observed using the licks. These rhinos may get their necessary mineral requirements by consuming plants rich in minerals.|$|E

25|$|Coronal loops <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> our {{understanding}} of the current coronal heating problem. Coronal loops are highly radiating sources of plasma and are therefore easy to observe by instruments such as TRACE. An explanation of the coronal heating problem remains as these structures are being observed remotely, where many ambiguities are present (i.e. radiation contributions along the LOS). In-situ measurements are required before a definitive answer can be had, but due to the high plasma temperatures in the corona, in-situ measurements are, at present, impossible. The next mission of the NASA Solar Probe Plus will approach the Sun very closely allowing more direct observations.|$|E
25|$|During school-aged years, {{academic}} achievement {{is a significant}} contributor to self-esteem development. A student consistently achieving success or consistently failing will have a strong academic effect on their individual self-esteem. Social experiences are another important contributor to self-esteem. As children go through school, they begin to understand and recognize differences between themselves and their classmates. Using social comparisons, children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities. These comparisons {{play an important role}} in shaping the child's self-esteem and influence the positive or negative feelings they have about themselves. As children go through adolescence, peer influence becomes much more important. Adolescents make appraisals of themselves based on their relationships with close friends. Successful relationships among friends <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the development of high self-esteem for children. Social acceptance brings about confidence and produces high self-esteem, whereas rejection from peers and loneliness brings about self-doubts and produces low self-esteem.|$|E

25|$|Genetic maps <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} {{the structure and}} organization of genomes from which evolution patterns and syntenic relationships between species can be deduced. Genetic maps also {{provide a framework for}} the mapping of genes of interest and estimating the magnitude of their effects and aid our understanding of genotype/phenotype associations. DH populations have become standard resources in genetic mapping for species in which DHs are readily available. Doubled haploid populations are ideal for genetic mapping. It is possible to produce a genetic map within two years of the initial cross regardless of the species. Map construction is relatively easy using a DH population derived from a hybrid of two homozygous parents as the expected segregation ratio is simple, i.e. 1:1. DH populations have now been used to produce genetic maps of barley, rapeseed, rice, wheat, and pepper. DH populations {{played a major role in}} facilitating the generation of the molecular marker maps in eight crop species.|$|E
25|$|A {{perceived}} {{weakness of}} his administration was the situation in handling migrant workers' protection, a very major issue in the Philippines, as {{there are millions of}} Filipinos abroad throughout the world serving as workers in foreign countries, and their remittances to relatives at home <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the Filipino economy. On the eve of his 67th birthday on March 17, 1995, Ramos was on a foreign trip when Flor Contemplación was hanged in Singapore. His last-minute effort to negotiate with Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong never succeeded and Ramos' return home was marred with protests after his arrival in Manila. The protests also caused the resignation of Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo and Labor Secretary Nieves Confesor from the cabinet. He immediately recalled Philippine ambassador to Singapore Alicia Ramos and suspended diplomatic relations with Singapore. He created a special commission to look into the case, which was in part an effort to try to rescue his sagging popularity. The commission was led by retired Supreme Court Justice Emilio Gancayco.|$|E

Executive producer Alvaro Longoria, attended to accept the award when Del Toro couldn't because of filming for The Wolf Man.

500|$|Like other ABC shows, Quantico has a racially-diverse cast (allowing {{viewers to}} relate {{to at least one}} character) as FBI {{recruits}} who deal with their individual problems. Safran had wanted the show to be diverse from the beginning, saying: [...] "You’re not just watching people who have struggled to achieve places of power and they’re there. This show is about the struggle to achieve that. Their politics and their racial makeup and their religious backgrounds <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> their characterizations and who they are. I really am interested in looking at how every culture handles stress — and in particular, how people from all these different backgrounds find their place in the FBI, an agency that has historically fraught relationships with gay people and people of color." [...] The first actor cast in the series was Tate Ellington, as FBI trainee Simon Asher. Graham Rogers was then cast as another FBI trainee, Caleb Hass. It was announced that Aunjanue Ellis had signed to play Miranda Shaw, assistant director and training supervisor of the academy. Dougray Scott was then cast as Liam O'Connor, Miranda's former partner and current subordinate.|$|E
