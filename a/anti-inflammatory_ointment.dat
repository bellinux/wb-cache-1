40|$|Natural vitamin E is {{suggested}} {{to have an}} antioxidant function. However, the synthetic form of vitamin E, DL-tocopherol, which has been widely used in topical ointments, may cause allergic contact dermatitis. Here, we report a case of allergic contact dermatitis with erythema multiforme-like eruption caused by a topical ointment. Patch testing indicated a positive allergic reaction to an <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>ointment</b> the patient had been using and its ingredient, DL-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E). In addition, a positive reaction to glycyrrhetinic acid was observed. Both vitamin E and glycyrrhetinic acid are useful ingredients of topical applications. However, the possibility that both can cause contact dermatitis, albeit rarely, should be considered...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to analyze nursing care in the {{prevention}} and treatment of complications of peripheral venipuncture in newborns hospitalized in Neonatal Intensive Care Units. It is a descriptive exploratory study, with qualitative approach conducted with nurses who cared for newborns in hospitals in Cuiaba, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews and analyzed according to thematic analysis’ technique. Preventive measures for complications mentioned by respondents were: appropriate choice of vein puncture, observation of the infusion, careful administration of medications and access withdrawal. To treat complications the professionals use warm and cold compresses with sodium bicarbonate, venous access removing, <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>ointment,</b> papain and bandage on the puncture area. The results showed that many nursing professionals perform preventive and treatment care without scientific basis. As a consequence, the results are ineffective. The data {{suggest the need for}} improvement of the nursing staff concerning intravenous therapy. ...|$|E
40|$|The red {{pigments}} {{from the}} roots of Lithospermum ery-throrhizon SIEBOLD et ZUCCARINI (Boraginaceae) {{have been used in}} Asia since ancient times as dyestuffs for fabrics, cos-metics, and food and as crude drugs for <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>ointment.</b> 1) The pigments were naphthoquinone natural prod-ucts, shikonin (1) 2) and its ester derivatives. In many previous studies, various shikonin derivatives, such as those of b-hy-droxyisovalerylshikonin (2), 3) acetylshikonin (3), 4) propionyl-shikonin (4), 5) isobutyrylshikonin (5), 6) b,b-dimethylacryl-oylshikonin (6), 6) isovalerylshikonin (7), 7) and a-methylbu-tyrylshikonin (8), 7) were reported from {{the roots of}} L. ery-throrhizon (Fig. 1). Shikonin derivatives have several biologi-cal activities such as anti-inflammatory, 8) antiviral, 9) antibac-terial, 7, 10) antifungal, 9) and antitumor activities, 11) and recent studies showed that the level of these activities were affected by the structures of the derivatives. 12) Therefore, the evalua-tion of various natural and synthetic shikonin analogues as new drug candidates has been eagerly reported. 1, 8, 13 — 15) In our continuous study to secure safe for the natural food additives, the commercial root extract of L. erythrorhizon used as food colorant (Shikon color) was analyzed using liq-uid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrome-try (LC/ESI-MS). In addition to shikonin (1) and its ester derivatives (2 — 8), we found a new shikonin derivative, tigloylshikonin (9), as a minor pigment. Here we report {{for the first time the}} isolation and structural elucidation of 9 with mass spectrometry and NMR techniques. Results and Discussion The commercial root extract of L. erythrorhizon, “Shikon color, ” was diluted with MeOH and subjected to reversed-phase LC/ESI-MS analysis. The chromatogram detected at 515 nm indicated some pigment peaks (Fig. 2), and the posi-tive-mode ESI-MS analysis of each peak showed ion peaks a...|$|E
40|$|Indirect {{action of}} sun {{together}} with different exogenous agents (systemic medications and topically applied compounds) sometimes {{may result in}} phototoxicic and photoallergic reactions. Drug-induced photosensitivity reactions refer {{to the development of}} cutaneous disease {{as a result of the}} combined effects of a drug and light (mostly spectrum within the UVA and visible light range or UVB range). The aim of the review was to show the prominent features of phototoxic and photoallergic reactions, which occur in sun-exposed areas, including face, neck, hands and forearms. Phototoxic reactions are significantly more common than photoallergic reactions and mosty resemble to exaggerated sunburn. Photoallergic reactions appear only in a minority of individuals and resemble allergic contact dermatitis on sun-exposed areas, although sometimes may extend into covered areas. Generally, the physical examination and a positive patient’s history of photosensitivity reactions on substances are of great importance for the diagnostics. The treatment of these reactions includes identification and avoidance of offending agent and application of <b>anti-inflammatory</b> dressings, <b>ointments</b> and corticosteroids...|$|R
