Isaac was overthrown in 1475 by his brother Alexander due to his pro-Ottoman stance. His reign was brief, as the Ottoman Empire laid siege and conquered Theodoro itself in December. Alexander {{and his family were}} taken captive to Constantinople, where the prince was beheaded, his son was forcibly converted to Islam, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> daughters became part of the Sultan's harem.|$|E

Razafindrahety's lineage, as niece to Queen Ranavalona II and great-grand{{daughter of}} King Andrianampoinimerina, qualified her to potentially inherit the throne of the Kingdom of Madagascar. Her parents assigned the care of the infant Razafindrahety to a slave who served the family.|$|E

5|$|Blaine <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> daughters sailed for Europe in June 1887, visiting England, Ireland, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, {{and finally}} Scotland, where they {{stayed at the}} summer home of Andrew Carnegie. While in France, Blaine {{wrote a letter to}} the New-York Tribune criticizing Cleveland’s plans to reduce the tariff, saying that free trade with Europe would {{impoverish}} American workers and farmers. The family returned to the United States in August 1887. His letter in the Tribune had raised his political profile even higher, and by 1888 Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, both former opponents, urged Blaine to run against Cleveland again. Opinion within the party was overwhelmingly in favor of renominating Blaine.|$|E
5|$|In June 1816, the French frigate Méduse {{departed}} from Rochefort, {{bound for the}} Senegalese port of Saint-Louis. She headed a convoy of three other ships: the storeship Loire, the brig Argus and the corvette Écho. Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumereys had been appointed captain of the frigate despite having scarcely sailed in 20years. After the wreck, public outrage mistakenly attributed responsibility for his appointment to Louis XVIII, though his was a routine naval appointment made within the Ministry of the Navy and far outside {{the concerns of the}} monarch. The frigate's mission was to accept the British return of Senegal under the terms of France's acceptance of the Peace of Paris. The appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel Julien-Désiré Schmaltz, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> daughter were among the passengers.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how much support there was for {{persecution}} within the aristocracy. After Gallienus's peace, Christians reached high ranks in Roman government. Diocletian appointed several Christians to those positions himself, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> daughter {{may have been}} sympathetic to the church. There were many individuals willing to be martyrs, and many provincials willing to ignore any persecutory edicts from the emperors as well. Even Constantius was known to have disapproved of persecutory policies. The lower classes demonstrated little of the enthusiasm they had shown for earlier persecutions. They no longer believed the slanderous accusations that were popular in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Perhaps, as the historian Timothy Barnes has suggested, the long-established Church had become another accepted part of their lives.|$|E
25|$|In 1852, Bishop guided Nathaniel Parker Willis to Echo River.

5|$|Soraya {{is a young}} Afghan {{woman whom}} Amir meets and marries in the United States. Hosseini {{originally}} scripted the character as an American woman, but he later agreed to rewrite her as an Afghan immigrant after his editor did not find her background believable {{for her role in}} the story. The change contributed towards an extensive revision of Part III. In the final draft, Soraya lives with her parents, Afghan general Taheri <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> wants to become an English teacher. Before meeting Amir, she ran away with an Afghan boyfriend in Virginia, which, according to Afghan tradition, made her unsuitable for marriage. Because Amir also had his own regrets, he loves and marries her anyway.|$|E
5|$|Stuart {{left his}} family deeply in debt, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> daughters {{were unable to}} {{purchase}} a grave site. He was, therefore, buried in an unmarked grave which was purchased cheaply from Benjamin Howland, a local carpenter. His family recovered from their financial troubles roughly ten years later, and they planned to move his body to a family cemetery in Newport. However, they could not remember {{the exact location of}} his body, and it was never moved. There is a monument for Stuart, his wife, and their children at the Common Burying Ground in Newport.|$|E
5|$|The decree {{was issued}} during a {{turbulent}} period in Egyptian history. PtolemyV Epiphanes reigned from 204 to 181 BC, {{the son of}} PtolemyIV Philopator <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> sister Arsinoe. He had become ruler {{at the age of}} five after the sudden death of both of his parents, who were murdered in a conspiracy that involved PtolemyIV's mistress Agathoclea, according to contemporary sources. The conspirators effectively ruled Egypt as PtolemyV's guardians until a revolt broke out two years later under general Tlepolemus, when Agathoclea and her family were lynched by a mob in Alexandria. Tlepolemus, in turn, was replaced as guardian in 201 BC by Aristomenes of Alyzia, who was chief minister {{at the time of the}} Memphis decree.|$|E

5|$|The front entry {{leads into}} the living room where {{polished}} wood is found throughout as well as 19th century furnishings. The front room is part of the original building which consisted of one room. The room acted as the Deere's kitchen, living room, bedrooms, essentially everything. Deere eventually added onto the house, including a bedroom and an upstairs loft. The first floor bedroom would have been used for John <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> possibly a couple of the children while the upstairs room would was used {{for the rest of the}} children. The Deeres left the home in 1847 when they moved to Moline, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{two months}} in Batna with Ehnni, the French ordered her to leave North Africa without explanation; as an immigrant, {{she had no choice}} but to comply. Ehnni requested permission from his military superiors to marry Eberhardt (which would have enabled her to stay), but his request was denied. She traveled to France in early May 1901, staying with Augustin <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> daughter in Marseille. In mid-June she was summoned back to Constantine to give evidence at the trial of her attacker, who maintained his statement that God had ordered him to kill Eberhardt, though expressed remorse towards her. Eberhardt said that she bore no grudge against Abdallah, forgave him, and hoped that he would not be punished. Abdallah received life imprisonment although the prosecutor had asked for the death penalty. When the trial ended, Eberhardt was again ordered to leave the country. She returned to live with Augustin, working with him (disguised as a man) as a dock labourer. Eberhardt and Augustin's family lived in appalling poverty. Eberhardt's health deteriorated, and she repeatedly suffered from fevers. She attempted suicide while in Marseille, one of several unsuccessful attempts she would make over the course of her life. Eberhardt continued to write during this time, working on several projects including her novel Trimardeur.|$|E
5|$|An unnamed narrator, while gazing {{upon his}} pet cat, begins to reminisce about {{a law in}} the town of Ulthar which forbids the killing of cats and relates the story of how this law came to be. The tale begins with the {{introduction}} of an old cotter and his wife who delight in trapping and violently killing any cats who venture onto their property. The people of the town are too afraid of the couple to speak against these acts, so they instead focus their efforts on keeping their felines from approaching the cotter's house. One night a caravan of travelers from a distant land arrives and passes through the village. They bring with them an orphan named Menes who, having lost his family to a plague, has only a small, black kitten to keep him company. After being unable to find his kitten on the third day of his stay, Menes hears the stories of the old cotter <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> decides to take action.|$|E
