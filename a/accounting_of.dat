5|$|In 1903, Henry Fairfield Osborn named {{a second}} genus of small {{theropod}} from the Morrison Formation, Ornitholestes. This genus {{was based on}} a partial skeleton from Bone Cabin Quarry, north of Como Bluff. Ornitholestes became intertwined with Coelurus in 1920, when Charles Gilmore, in his influential study of theropod dinosaurs, concluded that the two were synonyms. This was followed in the literature for decades. The two genera were not formally compared, however, nor was there a full <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> what actually belonged to Coelurus, until John Ostrom's study in 1980.|$|E
5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> the fixed cost {{of fixed assets}} like rolling stock and {{infrastructure}} (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss {{in the first year of}} operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, the third year of operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E
5|$|From its foundation, the Court of Chancery could {{administer}} estates, {{due to its}} {{jurisdiction over}} trusts. While the main burden in the 16th century fell on the ecclesiastical courts, their powers over administrators and executors was limited, regularly necessitating the Court of Chancery's involvement. Before the Statute of Wills, many people used feoffees to dispose of their land, something that fell {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Lord Chancellor anyway. In addition, in relation to the discovery and <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> assets, the process used by the Court of Chancery was far superior to the ecclesiastical one; as a result, the Court of Chancery was regularly used by beneficiaries. The common law courts also had jurisdiction over some estates matters, but their remedies for problems were far more limited.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I draw on {{a recent}} <b>account</b> <b>of</b> perceptual {{knowledge}} according to which knowledge is contrastive.

Along the way, I develop a contrastive <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the propositional attitudes (beliefs, desires, regrets and so on) and suggest that a contrastive <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the propositional attitudes implies an anti-individualist <b>account</b> <b>of</b> propositional attitude concepts (the concepts of belief, desire, regret, and so on) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{can call}} any reductive <b>account</b> <b>of</b> {{knowledge}} {{that appeals to}} both safety and ability conditions a mixed <b>account</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. Examples <b>of</b> mixed <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> knowledge include Pritchard’s (2012) Anti-Luck Virtue Epistemology, Kelp’s (2013) Safe-Apt <b>account</b> <b>of</b> knowledge, and Turri’s (2011) Ample belief <b>account</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. Mixed <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> knowledge are motivated by well-known counterexamples to pure safety and pure ability <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. It is thought that by combining both safety and ability conditions we can give an extensionally adequate reductive <b>account</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. In this paper I argue that the putative counterexamples to pure safety and pure ability <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> knowledge fail to motivate mixed <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. In particular, I argue that if the putative counterexamples are problematic for safety accounts they are problematic for ability accounts and vice-versa. The reason for this, I argue, is that the safety condition and ability condition should be understood as alternative expressions of the same intuition — that knowledge must come from a reliable source...|$|R

5|$|In 2007, Guinness World Records {{recognized}} Folding@home as {{the most}} powerful distributed computing network. As of September 30, 2014, the project has 107,708 active CPU cores and 63,977 active GPUs for a total of 40.190 x86 petaFLOPS (19.282 native petaFLOPS). At the same time, the combined efforts of all distributed computing projects under BOINC totals 7.924 petaFLOPS. In November 2012, Folding@home updated its <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> FLOPS, especially for GPUs, and now reports the number of active processor cores and physical processors. Using the Markov state model method, Folding@home achieves strong scaling across its user base and gains a linear speedup for every added processor. This network allows Folding@home to do work that was formerly impractical computationally.|$|E
5|$|In early 1947, France, Britain and the United States unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to reach an}} agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets. In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union. Under the plan, which President Harry S. Truman signed on 3 April 1948, the US government gave to Western European countries over $13 billion (equivalent to $189.39 billion in 2016) to rebuild the economy of Europe. Later, the program {{led to the creation of}} the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.|$|E
5|$|Other {{pressures}} on O'Neill's colonization plan were {{the high cost}} of access to Earth orbit and the declining cost of energy. Building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when energy prices spiked during the 1979 oil crisis. When prices dropped in the early 1980s, funding for space solar power research dried up. His plan had also been based on NASA's estimates for the flight rate and launch cost of the Space Shuttle, numbers that turned out to have been wildly optimistic. His 1977 book quoted a Space Shuttle launch cost of $10 million, but in 1981 the subsidized price given to commercial customers started at $38 million. Eventual <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> the full cost of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as $180 million per flight.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} attested {{examples of}} mathematical calculations {{date to the}} predynastic Naqada period, and show a fully developed numeral system. The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> land, labor, and grain. Texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—use fractions, compute the volumes of boxes and pyramids, and calculate the surface areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles. They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry, and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary source}} of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a poll tax and a tax on their land, {{construed}} as a tax on its produce or productive capacity. Supplemental forms could be filed by those eligible for certain exemptions; for example, Egyptian farmers could register fields as fallow and tax-exempt depending on flood patterns of the Nile. Tax obligations were determined by the census, which required each head of household {{to appear before the}} presiding official and provide a head count of his household, as well as an <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> property he owned that was suitable for agriculture or habitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between {{external and internal}} environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration {{of cause and effect}} between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics, for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or holocoenotic system as it was once called. This is known as the dialectical approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or umwelt). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.|$|E
