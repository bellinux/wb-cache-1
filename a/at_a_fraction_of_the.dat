The development of torpedo cruisers in Italy in the mid-1880s represented a shift away from the emphasis on large capital ships that had been built for the previous decade and toward the ideas of the Jeune École, which emphasized small, fast, torpedo-armed vessels that could damage or destroy the much larger battleships <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cost.

Furthermore, the engine weight and engine power may be reduced by half because a smaller engine is needed for takeoff.

40|$|Medium {{optimization}} for 5 ’-phosphodiesterase {{production from}} Penicillium citrinum was studied by applying one-factor-at-a-time method, orthogonal array method and re-sponse surface methodology in this paper. The one-factor-at-a-time method {{was used to}} {{study the effects of}} carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and metal ion sources on 5 ’-phosphodi-esterase production. Among various carbon and nitrogen sources used, glucose and pep-tone were the most suitable substances for 5 ’-phosphodiesterase production, respectively. Subsequently, the concentrations of glucose, peptone, groundnut meal, Zn 2 + and KH 2 PO 4 were optimized using the orthogonal array method. Response surface methodology was also applied for medium optimization. Glucose concentration (X 1), peptone concentration (X 2) and groundnut meal (X 3) were selected as the independent variables. Results showed that the regression models adequately explained the data variation and represented the ac-tual relationships between the parameters and responses. The optimum conditions were glucose <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> 6. 5 %, peptone <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> 0. 45 % and groundnut meal <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> 1. 0 %. Maximum enzyme activity was 353 U/mL under the optimum condi-tions. Maximum 5 ’-phosphodiesterase activity in media optimized by orthogonal method and response surface methodology was about 1. 286 and 1. 456 times, respectively, greater than in the medium optimized by one-factor-at-a-time method.
