5|$|Barbera's {{desk was}} {{opposite}} that of William Hanna. The two quickly realized {{they would make}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team.</b> By 1939, they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Barbera and Hanna worked alongside animator Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM.|$|E
5|$|Hanna {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to direct his first cartoon in 1936; the result was To Spring, part of the Harman-Ising Happy Harmonies series. The following year, MGM decided to terminate their partnership with Harman-Ising and bring production in-house. Hanna was among the first people MGM hired away from Harman-Ising to their new cartoon studio. During 1938–1939, he served as a senior director on MGM's Captain and the Kids series, based upon the comic strip of the same name (an alternate version of the Katzenjammer Kids that had resulted from a 1914 lawsuit). The series did not do well; consequently, Hanna was demoted to a story man and the series was canceled. Hanna's desk at MGM was opposite that of Joseph Barbera, who had previously worked at Terrytoons. The two quickly realized they would make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team.</b> By 1939 they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Hanna and Barbera worked alongside animation director Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM.|$|E

The running backs and tight ends have {{my good friend}} Woodrow McCorvey's fingerprints all over them. He is a tough guy.|$|R
50|$|The LCA girls {{team won}} the 2010 and 2012 All A state tournament. They were runners-up in the 2010 all schools state tournament. They are <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>team</b> year after year.|$|R

5|$|Tennessee had {{a three-game}} road trip up next, {{starting}} with the Bulldogs in Athens. Tennessee started the game strong, grabbing the lead, and finished the half on a 13–0 run. However, Georgia came back, cutting the lead down to nine with seven minutes remaining in the game. It {{was at this point}} that Semeka Randall scored thirteen points, sealing a 96–71 victory. This is the largest margin of victory in the Lady Bulldogs-Lady Vols series. Tennessee had 19 steals in the game, while shooting over 50%, and Holdsclaw and Catchings both scored over 20. The next game, against Kentucky, also had Tennessee making a late first half run, giving them a 19-point lead at the break. This lead was never given up, as the Lady Vols won by twenty-eight. The final game of the road trip was against DePaul, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team</b> who was, however, missing their two best players. Without these players, it was not much of a game, as Summitt's team started the game with twenty-one straight points and ended the game with a 125–46 victory, giving the team a 20–0 record. The team's 125 points were the second most {{in the history of the}} program.|$|E
25|$|Who {{was fired}} (1st): Orla P, {{for not being}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team</b> player, and for lack of {{attention}} to detail.|$|E
25|$|For the 1999–00 season, Jokerit had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team.</b> The team {{featured}} {{good players}} like German international Jan Benda, Russian Dmitri Kvartalnov, Czech Miroslav Hlinka, longtime Jokerit alumni Petri Varis, Finnish top players Antti-Jussi Niemi, Tom Koivisto and Pasi Nurminen on goal. The team was soon joined by former NHL'ers Tuomas Grönman and the 5 time Stanley Cup champion Esa Tikkanen. The team {{was strong and}} reached the finals but lost to TPS.|$|E
50|$|City Stars have fine {{reputation}} as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> cup <b>team,</b> {{especially in the}} Finnish Cup (Suomen Cup). In the 2009 competition they battled their way through to quarter finals before losing 0-3 to FC Honka.|$|R
50|$|In 1977, Holy Cross {{defeated}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> Providence <b>team</b> {{twice on}} last-second shots by forward Chris Potter and led top-ranked Michigan {{at the half}} {{in the first round}} of the NCAA tournament before being defeated.|$|R

25|$|Ewbank {{moved back}} to Oxford in {{retirement}} and wrote a book in 1977 called Football Greats. He {{was inducted into the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that he was glad to be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team</b> was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent.|$|E
25|$|Claudio Ranieri {{was brought}} in as coach for the 1993–94 season, and that year, Fiorentina {{dominated}} Serie B, Italy's second division. Upon their return to Serie A, Ranieri put together <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team</b> centred around new top scorer Batistuta, signing the young talent Rui Costa from Benfica and the new world champion Brazilian defender Márcio Santos. The former became an idol to Fiorentina fans, while the second disappointed and was sold after only a season. The Viola finished the season in tenth place.|$|E
25|$|The Lincoln Stars (also {{known as}} the Lincoln Stars of New York or the New York Lincoln Stars) were a Negro league {{baseball}} team that played in New York City from 1914 to 1917. Their home stadium was the Lenox Oval, located at Lenox Avenue and 145th Street in Manhattan. Although they lasted less than four years, they were <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team</b> that featured three players who would later be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame—Oscar Charleston, John Henry Lloyd, and Louis Santop.|$|E
50|$|At {{its best}} moment, Greece {{narrowly}} missed qualifying for the 1970 FIFA World Cup, despite <b>a</b> <b>good</b> quality <b>team,</b> {{including some of}} the greatest-ever Greek players, such as Mimis Domazos, Giorgos Sideris, Giorgos Koudas and Mimis Papaioannou.|$|R

2500|$|Carnegie Tech coach Walter Steffen said of Strong's performance: [...] "This is {{the first}} time in my career that one man was good enough to run over and {{completely}} wreck <b>an</b> exceptionally <b>good</b> <b>team.</b> I can tell you he is better than Heston or Thorpe." ...|$|R
25|$|The purge of Haig’s staff continued, {{with the}} {{appointment}} on 22 January of Herbert Lawrence as BEF Chief of Staff, {{in place of}} Lt-Gen Launcelot Kiggell. Lawrence was a much stronger character than Kiggell, and having made money in business and having no plans {{to stay in the}} Army after the War, was not beholden to Haig - actually in time the two men made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team.</b> Haig also lost the Deputy Chief of General Staff, Maxwell (QuarterMaster General), the engineer in chief and the director-general of medical services. Even Terraine admits the changes strengthened the BEF.|$|E
25|$|From {{this point}} up to 1925, Derbyshire were perennially among the weakest counties, losing every single match in 1920 {{despite the efforts}} of Sam Cadman and Arthur Morton, persevering professionals. From 1926, the nucleus of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team</b> emerged around some doughty batting from Denis Smith, Stan Worthington and George Pope. Pope's bowling and that of his brother Alf, leg spinner Tom Mitchell and seam bowler Bill Copson took the team to their one and so far only Championship victory in 1936. They won 13 of their 28 matches {{outright}} and five on first innings. Worthington, Les Townsend, Smith and Alderman all passed 1,000 runs and Copson and Mitchell took over 100 wickets, with Alf Pope taking 94. Charlie Elliott, who later became a Test umpire and selector, was another member of this team which was captained by AW Richardson.|$|E
25|$|The 1970-71 Australians lost 2-0 to the touring England {{team in the}} 1970-71 Ashes series. Australia had {{not lost}} a home Test series since 1954-55, but had {{suffered}} a heavy 4-0 defeat in South Africa in 1969-70 which had affected their confidence. On paper they should have had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team,</b> and E.W. Swanton reckoned they were favourites {{to hold on to}} The Ashes, but Rod Marsh, Dennis Lillee and Greg Chappell had yet to mature and Bill Lawry, Garth McKenzie and John Gleeson were {{at the end of their}} careers. In more fortunate circumstances the senior players could have eased the newcomers into the team, but Ray Illingworth was a captain who exploited every weakness and they did not get the chance. Their cause was not helped by the selectors Sir Donald Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey who chose nineteen different players in the series, nine of them debutants, and continuously chopped and changed the team which did not allow it to settle.|$|E
5000|$|The British {{were the}} leading {{force in the}} long-{{distance}} running in early 1900s. Although the most celebrated long distance runner Alfred Shrubb had turned to professional just before the 1906 [...] "intercalated" [...] Olympics of, the Britons sent <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>team</b> to Athens.|$|R
5000|$|The RPI formula {{also has}} many flaws. Due {{to the heavy}} {{weighting}} of opponents winning percentage, beating a team with a bad RPI may actually hurt your RPI. In addition,losing to <b>a</b> <b>good</b> RPI <b>team</b> can help your RPI.|$|R
50|$|Curling {{is a game}} of {{strategy}}, {{tactics and}} skill. The strategy depends on the team's skill, the opponent's skill, {{the conditions of the}} ice, the score of the game, how many ends remain and whether the team has last-stone advantage (the hammer). A team may play an end aggressively or defensively. Aggressive playing will put a lot of stones in play by throwing mostly draws; this makes for an exciting game and is very risky but the reward can be very great. Defensive playing will throw a lot of hits preventing a lot of stones in play; this tends to be less exciting and less risky. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> drawing <b>team</b> will usually opt to play aggressively, while <b>a</b> <b>good</b> hitting <b>team</b> will opt to play defensively.|$|R
25|$|The eighteenth {{stage was}} an {{individual}} time trial, with a finish on the Mont Ventoux. It was won {{with a great}} margin by Jean-François Bernard, who became the new leader of the general classification, and the new hope of the French cycling fans. Bernard was a good climber and a good time-trialist, and {{had the support of}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team,</b> so he could be able to stay leader {{until the end of the}} race. But already in the next stage, Bernard lost considerable time. He had a flat tire just before the top of a climb, and lost contact with the other riders while he had to wait for repairs, and had to spend energy to get back. His rivals Mottet and Roche had made a plan to attack in the feed zone, where cyclists could get their lunch. Mottet and Roche had packed extra food at the start of the stage, and attacked while Bernard was at the back of the peloton. Bernard chased them, but was not able to get back to them, and lost four minutes in that stage, which made Roche the new leader, closely followed by Mottet and Delgado.|$|E
500|$|On December 21, Sidney Crosby {{surpassed the}} record for most All-Star Game votes at 1,020,736, set by Jaromir Jagr, then with the Penguins, in 2000. Crosby broke the record with 13days {{remaining}} in voting. Defenceman Ryan Whitney made his first appearance of the season on December 23, after missing 33games with a foot injury. On December 26, Marc-Andre Fleury made 37saves in Pittsburgh's first shutout of the season, defeating the New Jersey Devils, 1–0. After concluding the month with a 5–8–1 record, the team held a players-only meeting on December 30. [...] "The attitude is a little off right now," [...] said Brooks Orpik, [...] "It's easy to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team</b> when you're winning games. When you're going through rough batches like this, it's what tests guys' character." ...|$|E
500|$|On the Town starred Kelly, Sinatra, Munshin, Ann Miller, Betty Garrett and Vera-Ellen. Kelly, Sinatra and Munshin play three sailors on a 24-hour shore {{leave in}} New York whose romantic ambitions get {{them more than}} they bargained for. The film was a success both financially and critically. It won the Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture and screenwriters Comden and Green won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. Like Orson Welles, Donen made his directorial debut at 25. Donen stated that Kelly was [...] "responsible {{for most of the}} dance movements. I was behind the camera in the {{dramatic}} and musical sequences." [...] Kelly believed that he and Donen [...] "were <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team.</b> I thought we complemented each other very well." ...|$|E

500|$|The semi-final of the Birmingham Charity Cup {{provided}} {{a break from}} League action. Mobley opened the scoring, but Wolverhampton Wanderers shot against the woodwork on several occasions and the visitors were [...] "singularly fortunate" [...] in restricting the home side to one goal, and that a penalty kick. With the scores level, {{a decision was made}} not to play extra time, and the replay was arranged for two weeks later at Coventry Road. In their penultimate match of the Football League season, Small Heath produced <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team</b> performance to win 4–1 at Woolwich Arsenal and reach 100 League goals for the season. The forwards played a characteristic [...] "beautifully combined" [...] game, the half-backs, particularly Jenkyns, were too strong for the home forwards, Purves looked set to be the full-back the team had needed for some time, and Charsley [...] "kept goal exceedingly well".|$|E
500|$|Heading {{into the}} new season, co-defending World Endurance {{champion}} Mark Webber stated Porsche's performance advantage over their two main rivals could possibly disappear at Silverstone but felt the team could successfully retain the drivers' and manufacturers' titles. He said his team's expectations were ambitious. Although Webber {{was aware of the}} tight opposition he was confident that Porsche could fight well: [...] "We have a very stable concept, let’s say, so it’s very well known for us. We of course want to aim for another win at Le Mans and win the championships, so the goals are very, very high." [...] Audi No. 8 co-driver Lucas di Grassi believed that Toyota's new chassis, the TS050 Hybrid, would allow its drivers to run {{at the front of the}} field after they experienced a difficult 2015 season: [...] "I expect them to make a big step, because they have changed the engine and the hybrid system. They are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team,</b> they won the championship in 2014. They will be strong." ...|$|E
500|$|By mid-2008, Roth and Luftig were {{in discussions}} with a {{potential}} director, Jerry Mitchell, but they still had not found writers. When Roth sent Mitchell the DVD of the film, he was enthusiastic about it. Roth and Luftig hired Mitchell to direct and Harvey Fierstein to write the book. Mitchell knew that Fierstein and Cyndi Lauper were friends, and he thought they would make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>team</b> to create the musical. Fierstein agreed and eventually approached Lauper to write the songs because he [...] "saw in the adaptation an {{opportunity to work with}} someone with a big musical range, 'somebody who could write club music,' ... along with show tunes." [...] Lauper joined the creative team in June 2010. Lauper's last project before Kinky Boots had been the album Memphis Blues, while Fierstein was working on Newsies when he began Kinky Boots. The work marked Lauper's debut as a musical theatre songwriter, although she had some theatrical experience, having performed on Broadway in the 2006 Roundabout Theatre Company production of The Threepenny Opera. Among Fierstein's prior experiences were works about drag queens: La Cage aux Folles and Torch Song Trilogy. Lauper has said that she identifies with drag queens.|$|E
