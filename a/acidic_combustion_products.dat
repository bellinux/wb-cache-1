Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in 1966, during the Gemini/Apollo Programs, with the {{evaluation}} of long-term anti-corrosion coatings for carbon steel structures. NASAIKSC's Atmospheric Exposure Test Site was established at that time on the beach near the launch pad. In the years that followed, numerous studies at the site have identified materials, coatings, and maintenance procedures for launch hardware and equipment exposed to the highly corrosive environment at the launch pad. The atmosphere at the launch pad is highly corrosive due to {{the proximity of the}} Atlantic Ocean, high heat from rocket exhaust, and since the introduction of the Space Shuttle, the <b>acidic</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> of the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs). Currently, NASAIKSC maintains about $ 2 billion worth of unique equipment and facilities, not including the orbiters, each valued at about $ 1. 8 billion. Among the items: two launch complexes, two crawler transporters, three mobile launch platforms, and specialized testing equipment. Atmospheric exposure provides very valuable data but {{it takes a long time}} and relies on human visual inspection. NASA Technical Standard for Protective Coatings requires 18 months of good performance at the Atmospheric Exposure Test Site for preliminary approval and continued good performance for 5 years for final approval of a coating system. The use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was introduced at KSC in 1989 as a supplement to the traditional dc electrochemical techniques and atmospheric exposure studies. This paper presents and overview of several projects in which EIS was used in order to select materials and coatings to be used at NASA's launch facilities [1 - 2]...|$|E

40|$|One likely {{cause of}} polymer {{ignition}} in a high-pressure oxygen system is adiabatic-compression heating of polymers caused by pneumatic impact. Oxidative _ pyrolysis or combustion of polymers in a high-pressure oxygen system could generate toxic gases. This paper reports the preliminary results of toxic <b>combustion</b> <b>product</b> testing of selected polymers in a pneumatic-impact test system. Five polymers {{commonly used in}} high-pressure oxygen systems, Nylon 6 / 6, polychlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), fluoroelastomer (Viton(TradeMark) A), and nitrile rubber (Buna N), were tested in a pneumatic-impact test system at 2500 - or 3500 -psia oxygen pressure. The polymers were ignited and burned, then <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> were collected in a stainless-steel sample bottle and analyzed by GC/MS/IRD, GC/FID, and GC/Methanizer/FID.

5000|$|When {{the fuel}} in a flame combusts, the energy {{released}} by the combustion process is deposited in <b>combustion</b> <b>products,</b> usually molecular fragments called free radicals. The <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> are excited to a very high temperature called the adiabatic flame temperature (that is, the temperature before any heat has been transferred away from the <b>combustion</b> <b>products).</b> This temperature is usually {{much higher than the}} temperature of the air in the flame or which an object inserted into the flame can reach. When the <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> lose this energy by radiative emission, the radiation can thus be more intense than that of a lower temperature blackbody which has merely been inserted into the flame. The exact emission process involved varies with the material, the type of fuels and oxidizers, and the type of flame, though in many cases it is well established that the free radicals undergo radiative recombination. This energetic light emitted directly from the <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> may be observed directly (as with a blue gas flame), depending on the wavelength, or it may then cause fluorescence in the candoluminescent material. Some free radical recombinations emit ultraviolet light, which is only observable through fluorescence.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{considers}} the two approach-based techniques for calculating the non-stationary intra-chamber processes in solid-propellant rocket engine (SPRE). The first approach {{assumes that the}} <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> are a mechanical mix while the other one supposes {{it to be the}} mix, which is in chemical equilibrium. To enhance reliability of solution of the intra ballistic tasks, which assume a chemical equilibrium of <b>combustion</b> <b>products,</b> the computing algorithms to calculate a structure of the <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> are changed. The algorithm for solving a system of the nonlinear equations of chemical equilibrium, when determining the iterative amendments, uses the orthogonal QR method instead of a method of Gauss. Besides, a possibility to apply genetic algorithms in a task about a structure of <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> is considered. It is shown that in the tasks concerning the prediction of non-stationary intra ballistic characteristics in a solid propellant rocket engine, application of models of mechanical mix and chemically equilibrium structure of <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> leads to qualitatively and quantitatively coinciding results.
