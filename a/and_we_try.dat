25|$|Consecration to the Blessed Virgin Mary: Our members consecrate {{themselves}} to the Blessed Virgin Mary every year on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, December 8th. We have a yearly novena to our Lady under this title, {{and this is a}} solemnity proper to our Congregation. The original Constitutions drawn up by Father Rauzan affirmed the belief that one goes surely to Jesus through Mary. Placing ourselves under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we profess our Final/Perpetual Vows on August 15th, the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to schedule all of our Ordinations on a Marian feast day.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Jacqui {{embarked}} on a [...] "surprise" [...] relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is going {{to fall in love}} again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, 2009 the album's {{title was}} {{announced}} as This Addiction, {{which is also}} the title of its opening track. Of the eleven tracks selected for the album, eight were written by Skiba and three by Andriano ("Dine, Dine My Darling", [...] "Off the Map", and [...] "Fine"). Skiba explained that both [...] members came up with an equal number of songs during the writing process, but that [...] "it was pretty easy to pick out the ones we wanted to use. There are three of us that have equal say in the creative process, so you gotta leave your ego at the door. Dan and I are best friends and we're not competitive with each other at all. We're partners <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> [...] do everything for the better of the band and for the better of the record." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{differences}} amongst theaters in Chicago and Under the Gun's ensemble, the theater's artistic director explained: [...] "I think what makes us different is our ensemble. Our idea of the ensemble is {{we are going to}} bring in a large group of people that we like, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to empower them to do the best work they can do. And we give them plenty of chances to fail with the only consequence of failing being that the show closes and they get to try another show...That’s a very different mindset than other theaters. I have to have the mindset of if a person is struggling in the show, is there anyway I can help them perform better? Because I am stuck with them. Unless I can trick them into punching me in the face, I can’t cut them." ...|$|E
2500|$|So {{what can}} it mean when America {{says it will}} now protect its friends? It can only mean {{prejudice}} against Iraq. This stance plus maneuvers and statements which have been made has encouraged the UAE and Kuwait to disregard Iraqi rights. ... If you use pressure, we will deploy pressure and force. We {{know that you can}} harm us although we do not threaten you. But we too can harm you. Everyone can cause harm according to their ability and their size. We cannot come all the way to you in the United States, but individual Arabs may reach you. ... We do not place America among the enemies. We place it where we want our friends to be <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to be friends. But repeated American statements last year made it apparent that America did not regard us as friends.|$|E

Indeed they do much more than their duty to us, for they are wonderfully mindful of us in many ways.|$|E
60|$|The paradox lies in wait here, as in {{most other}} human affairs, to {{confound}} us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to baffle it, in this way and in that. We talk, for instance, of poetry for poets, and we fondly imagine that this is different from talking of cookery for cooks. Poetry is not made for poets; they have enough poetry of their own, but it is made {{for people who are}} not poets. If it does not please these, it may still be poetry, but it is poetry which has failed of its truest office. It is none the less its truest office because some very wretched verse seems often to do it.|$|E
5000|$|... "Baker Street" [...] {{featured}} a distinctive saxophone solo played by Raphael Ravenscroft, although {{the origins of}} the solo have been disputed. As the singer recalled in a 1988 interview with Colin Irwin: [...] "When I wrote the song I saw that bit as an instrumental part but I didn't know what. <b>We</b> <b>tried</b> electric guitar but it sounded weak, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> other things <b>and</b> I think it was Hugh Murphy's suggestion that <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> saxophone." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There are now no {{cities in}} Altruria, in your meaning, {{but there are}} capitals, {{one for each of}} the regions of our country and one for the whole commonwealth. These capitals are for the {{transaction}} of public affairs, in which every citizen of Altruria is schooled, and they are the residences of the administrative officials, who are alternated every year, from the highest to the lowest. A public employment with us is of no greater honor or profit than any other, for with our absolute economic equality there can be no ambition, and there is no opportunity for one citizen to outshine another. But as the capitals are the centres of all the arts, which we consider the chief of our public affairs, they are oftenest frequented by poets, actors, painters, sculptors, musicians, and architects. We regard all artists, who are in a sort creators, as the human type which is likest the divine, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to conform our whole industrial life to the artistic temperament. Even in the labors of the field and shop, which are obligatory upon all, we study the inspiration of this temperament, and in the voluntary pursuits we allow it full control. Each, in these, follows his fancy as to what he shall do, and when he shall do it, or whether he shall do anything at all. In the capitals are the universities, theatres, galleries, museums, cathedrals, laboratories and conservatories, and the appliances of every art and science, as well as the administration buildings; and beauty as well as use is studied in every edifice. Our capitals are as clean and quiet and healthful as the country, and these advantages are secured simply by the elimination of the horse, an animal which we should be as much surprised to find in the streets of a town as the plesiosaurus or the pterodactyl. All transportation in the capitals, whether for pleasure or business, is by electricity, and swift electrical expresses connect the capital of each region with the villages which radiate from it to the cardinal points. These expresses run at the rate of a hundred and fifty miles an hour, and they enable the artist, the scientist, the literary man, of the remotest hamlet, to visit the capital (when he is not actually resident there in some public use) every day, after the hours of the obligatory industries; or, if he likes, he may remain there a whole week or fortnight, giving six hours a day instead of three to the obligatories, until the time is made up. In case of very evident merit, or for the purpose of allowing him to complete some work requiring continuous application, a vote of the local agents may release him from the obligatories indefinitely. Generally, however, our artists prefer not to ask this, but avail themselves of the stated means we have of allowing them to work at the obligatories, and get the needed exercise and variety of occupation in the immediate vicinity of the capital.|$|E

50|$|For Lucas-style {{tests on}} a number N, we work in the multiplicative group of a {{quadratic}} extension of the integers modulo N; if N is prime, the order of this multiplicative group is N2 − 1, it has a subgroup of order N + 1, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to find a generator for that subgroup.|$|E

30|$|A non-controversial use {{of student}} {{experiments}} {{is to use}} them to test experimental design and initial hypotheses, before conducting experiments with professionals, as recommended by (Sjoberg et al. 2002). According to (Carver et al. 2010), it can make sense to use students for initial experiments, to see whether the experiment design works. We agree with these arguments <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> to mitigate confounding factors by performing a careful experiment in which <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> to use an appropriate assessment criterion.|$|R
