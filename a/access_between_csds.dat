The match ended in a draw 2-2 (being 3-3 the global score), so there was the need to define the championship on penalty series. At that time he scored a goal, however his team lost dramatically the penalty series (3-4) and he retired being a national Second Place.|$|R
40|$|The {{distinction}} between continuous sedation until death (CSD) and physician-assisted death (PAD) {{has become a}} topic of medical ethical debate. We conducted 6 focus groups to examine how nursing home clinicians perceive this distinction. For some, the difference is clear whereas others consider CSD a form of euthanasia. Another group situates <b>CSD</b> <b>between</b> pain relief and ending life. Arguments for these perspectives refer to the following themes: intention, dosage of sedative drugs, unconsciousness, and {{the pace of the}} dying process. Generally, CSD is considered emotionally easier to deal with since it entails a gradual dying process. Nursing home clinicians have diverging perceptions of the relation <b>between</b> <b>CSD</b> and PAD; some consider CSD {{to be more than a}} purely palliative measure, that is, also as a means to hasten death...|$|R

40|$|Background: Congenital sensorineural {{deafness}} (CSD) occurs in Border Collies, but its prevalence and inheritance are unknown. This study estimated {{the prevalence of}} CSD in Border Collies and investigated its association with phenotypic attributes linked to the merle gene, including coat pigmentation and iris color. Hypothesis: Deafness in Border Collies is associated with pigmentation patterns linked to the merle gene. Animals: A total of 2597 Border Collies from the United Kingdom. Methods: A retrospective study of Border Collies tested, during 1994 – 2002, by using brainstem auditory evoked responses. Associations between deafness and phenotypic attributes were assessed by using generalized logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of CSD in puppies was estimated as 2. 8 %. The corresponding rates of unilateral and bilateral CSD were 2. 3 and 0. 5 %, respectively. Adjustment for clustering of hearing status by litter reduced the overall prevalence estimate to 1. 6 %. There was no association <b>between</b> <b>CSD</b> and sex (P 5. 2). Deaf Border Collies had higher rates of merle coat pigmentation, blue iris pigment, and excess white on the head than normal hearing Border Collies (all P,. 001). The odds of deafness were increased {{by a factor of}} 14 for Border Collies with deaf dams, relative to the odds for dogs with normal dams (P 5. 007), after adjustment for phenotypic attributes. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Associations <b>between</b> <b>CSD</b> and pigmentation patterns linked to the merle gene were demonstrated for Border Collies. Evidence for an inherited component to CSD in Border Collies supports selective breeding from only tested and normal parents to reduce the prevalence of this disease...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{splits the}} idea of competitor-specific human capital into two types: competitor-specific-direct (CSD) human capital and competitor-specific-indirect (CSI) human capital, and inspects how {{these two types of}} human capital held by IPO Top Management Team (TMT) members are associated with IPO performance. Furthermore, by utilizing research on human capital, competitive dynamics, and knowledge-based view of the firm, this dissertation identifies important antecedents that result in higher degree of impact of such human capital on the IPO firm, and IPO firm 2 ̆ 7 s capabilities absorb such knowledge that results in higher valuations at IPO. By employing a multi-year panel data of new IPOs between 1995 - 2010 within the context of U. S. semiconductor industry, the first chapter shows that the prevalence of CSD and CSI knowledge in the TMT of IPO firms leads to higher market valuations of the IPO firm. Moreover, the results show that the prior employment characteristics such as tenure and the position held at competitor firms, and the complexity of the competitor source firm (the product-market diversity and the learning emphasis) moderate the relationship <b>between</b> <b>CSD</b> and CSI human capital and IPO performance. The second chapter explores internal characteristics of the IPO firm that facilitate its ability to exploit the CSD and CSI human capital. I argue that in the context of new ventures, TMT intellectual capital plays an integral role in churning information into useful knowledge of one 2 ̆ 7 s competitors or group of competitors. Additionally, results indicate that TMT 2 ̆ 7 s potential absorptive capacity, shared team-specific experience, and CEO 2 ̆ 7 s functional background influence the relationship <b>between</b> <b>CSD</b> and CSI human capital and IPO performance...|$|R
