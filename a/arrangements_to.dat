In order to activate that nucleophile, they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a catalytic triad.

5|$|Bad weather {{prevented}} {{this action}} and on 24 December, Jhangar, a strategically advantageous {{position in the}} Naushahra Sector, was captured by the Pakistanis which gave them control over the communication lines between Mirpur and Poonch and provided a starting point from which attacks could be made on Naushahra. The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces. Brigadier Mohammad Usman, the commanding officer of the 50th Para Brigade, had made necessary <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> counter the expected attack. Soldiers were deployed in small groups on possible enemy approaches.|$|E

5|$|During Princess Elizabeth's 1950 tour of Canada, she {{was promised}} a Dominion gift of trumpeter swans, the <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> {{be made by}} Peter Scott. Canadian {{officials}} discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake in British Columbia {{as they had been}} fed for decades by conservationist Ralph Edwards. In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy, five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although in the 19th century swans had been brought by ship to European zoos). One unfortunately died, but the remaining four thrived at WWT Slimbridge for many years.|$|E
5|$|During the Vietnam War, Clinton {{received}} educational draft deferments {{while he}} was in England in 1968 and 1969. He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and was aware that he might lose his draft deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force, and he then made <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Early on May 6, three Royal Navy ships sailed into Quebec Harbour.

General John Thomas, then in command of the American forces, had already been making <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> retreat, but the British arrival threw his troops into a panic. He led a disorganized retreat that eventually reached Sorel on about May 18.|$|E

5|$|Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos {{originally}} intended to create a progressive metal supergroup while Fates Warning went on hiatus. He recruited Cynic & Gordian Knot Fretless Bass and Chapman Stickist Sean Malone and then-Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy {{to work on the}} project. Matheos then asked Chroma Key and ex-Dream Theater keyboardist Kevin Moore to contribute by adding keyboard <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> the music he had written. Moore instead heavily edited the music, changing the song structures and adding vocals. Matheos decided to pursue this new direction, sounding closer to Chroma Key than standard progressive metal, over his and Portnoy's original idea.|$|E
5|$|Goldsmith scored The Motion Picture over {{a period}} of three to four months, a {{relatively}} relaxed schedule compared to typical production, but time pressures resulted in Goldsmith bringing on colleagues to assist in the work. Alexander Courage, composer of the original Star Trek theme, provided <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> accompany Kirk's log entries, while Fred Steiner wrote eleven cues of additional music, notably the music to accompany the Enterprise achieving warp speed and first meeting V'Ger. The rush to finish the rest of the film impacted the score. The final recording session finished at 2:00 am on December 1, only five days before the film's release.|$|E

The candidacy of former president Didier Ratsiraka was also permitted; the candidature of all three prominent politicians {{was rejected by the}} international community. At the time that Rajoelina submitted his candidacy, he would have run against forty other candidates in total, of whom seven were affiliated with his own political movement.|$|E

He was assigned a defense counsel, LCDR Charles D.

5|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} the 25th, French, German, and British {{soldiers}} crossed trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and talk. In some areas, men from both sides ventured into no man's land on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to mingle and exchange food and souvenirs. There were joint burial ceremonies and prisoner swaps, while several meetings ended in carol-singing. Men played games of football (soccer) with one another, giving {{one of the most memorable}} images of the truce. Peaceful behavior was not ubiquitous; fighting continued in some sectors, while in others the sides settled on little more than <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> recover bodies.|$|E

5|$|She {{reunited with}} Eguchi {{to create the}} soundtrack to Final Fantasy X-2 in 2003, with Matsueda {{contributing}} most of the setting themes. Having replaced Final Fantasys regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu to create a work entirely different from the predecessor Final Fantasy X, their score {{has become one of}} the most criticized soundtracks in the series. However, despite the negative response and a low budget, it was commercially successful. The following year, she worked on Final Fantasy X-2s international version Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission and provided three <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> the Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection album. The Piano Collections album was her last credited work, and she has since left Square Enix along with Eguchi.|$|E
5|$|Song of Innocence is an {{instrumental}} jazz fusion record that incorporates elements of classical, rock, funk, pop, and theatre music. It {{is arranged for}} bass, drums, and string instruments, written in the rock idiom with tempos centered on rock-based patterns by Palmer. Axelrod used contrast in his orchestral compositions and interspersed the album's euphoric psychedelic R form with dramatic, harrowing <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> reflect the supernatural themes found in Blake's poems. The music's reverent, psychedelic overtones evoke their themes of innocence and spirituality.|$|E
5|$|Stone Rollin is {{the fourth}} studio album by American R singer, songwriter, and {{producer}} Raphael Saadiq. It was released on March 25, 2011, by Columbia Records. Inspired by the loud, raw sound of his live performances, Saadiq worked with recording engineer and long-time collaborator Charles Brungardt to produce a grittier, more aggressive sound than on his previous records. Most of the instruments played on the album were performed by Saadiq, {{and with the help}} of arranger Paul Riser and engineer Gerry Brown, he incorporated string and orchestral <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> the songs.|$|E

5|$|The NDH {{government}} struck {{upon the}} idea of trying to re-educate these children to become something akin to an UstaÅ¡e version of the Hitler Youth, thereby turning them against their Serb parents. The regime saw this as a more effective way of placing pressure on the Yugoslav Partisan movement than killing the children outright. However, the NDH regime had not made any <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> implement this idea, so {{the establishment of a}} children's camp was done in haste, especially as there was strong pressure to do something for the children. NDH regime propaganda advanced the idea that the children were being liberated from slavery {{at the hands of the}} Partisans.|$|E
5|$|The band {{first became}} {{involved}} with Sarajevo in 1993 on their Zoo TV Tour; approached by aid worker Bill Carter about bringing attention to the Siege of Sarajevo, the band conducted nightly satellite transmissions with Bosnians during their shows. These link-ups were the subject of criticism from journalists for mixing entertainment with human tragedy. Although the war made it impractical for U2 to visit Sarajevo at the time, they vowed to eventually play a concert in the city. After the conflict ended in November 1995, they made <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> visit Sarajevo, and with help from United Nations ambassadors and peacekeeping troops, they scheduled and played the concert in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Wagner's role at Ludwig's court became controversial; in particular, Ludwig's {{habit of}} {{referring}} Wagner's policy ideas to his ministers alarmed the court. When Wagner demanded the sacking both of Ludwig's cabinet secretary {{and of his}} prime minister, there was a public outcry, and in December 1865 Ludwig reluctantly told Wagner to leave Bavaria. The king did not, however, withdraw his patronage or financial support. After a few months' wandering, in March 1866 Wagner arrived in Geneva, where Cosima joined him. They travelled together to Lucerne where they found a large lakeside house, the Villa Tribschen. Wagner made immediate <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> rent the house, at the king's expense, and by 15 April was installed in his new home.|$|E
