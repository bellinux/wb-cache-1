5|$|Hergé's assistant, Bob de Moor, was {{responsible}} for making many of the alterations. De Moor {{was sent to the}} port at Antwerp to sketch a 1939 oil tanker that would provide a basis for <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> appears in the story, the Speedol Star.|$|E
5|$|Six days later, Cooley led a large {{expedition}} {{to free the}} Gil Blas, <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> had beached the previous year. The scale of the operation required all of the settlement's able men. On the next day, January 4, 1836, the Indians attacked the settlement.|$|E
5|$|The 1936 Second London Naval Treaty, while {{superseding}} the 1922 agreement, nonetheless kept many of {{the same}} requirements, though it restricted gun size on new warships to 14-inch. These treaties heavily influenced the design of the North Carolina class, as can be attested to in the long quest to find <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> incorporated everything considered necessary while remaining under 35,000long tons.|$|E

5|$|The ethical {{requirements}} of senators were significant. Senators could {{not engage in}} banking or any form of public contract. They could not own <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> was large enough to participate in foreign commerce, and they could not leave Italy without permission from the Senate. In addition, since they were not paid, individuals usually sought to become a senator only if they were independently wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Meeker's first {{employment}} in the Pacific Northwest was unloading <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> had docked at Portland. He moved to {{the nearby town of}} St. Helens, where construction of a wharf in competition with Portland's was under way—Oliver rented a house to lodge workers in, and Ezra went to help his brother. By this time, Ezra Meeker and his wife were determined to fulfill their original plan to farm, and when work was abandoned on the wharf, he went to find land which could be cultivated.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1794, Thomson {{spoke with}} <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> was sailing for Botany Bay. The ship had {{encountered}} a French privateer, of 14 guns, which the British ship managed to drive off after an engagement that lasted almost two hours. Reportedly, Prince of Wales {{went on to}} recapture a British brig that a French 74-gun ship of the line had captured. Prince of Wales sent the brig into Oporto. However, {{this may have been}} Best. Lastly, in early 1974, Prince of Wales captured and brought in Flugen, of Malmö, which had been carrying wine, brandy, and bale goods from Bordeaux to Saint-Domingue.|$|E

5|$|To this end, {{a crew of}} 12 {{prepared}} <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> {{had been}} seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make it look more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder {{were placed in the}} ship and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the naval}} bureaus, however, {{there was still}} much resistance. In mid-to-late 1904, Poundstone {{continued}} to lobby the General Board while C protested that the final determinant in a naval battle would be the light guns—and in any case such a large uniform battery was not feasible. Poundstone replied with a design of his own creation, which he called USS Possible and fit twelve 11-inch guns on <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> displaced 19,330 long tons. With support from Lieutenant Commander William Sims, {{who was able to}} cite the increasingly accurate long-gunnery of the Navy, and interest shown in the project by President Roosevelt, the bureaucratic stalling ended.|$|E
5|$|After Bunker Hill, Lafayette went to Maine and Vermont, thus visiting {{all of the}} states. He {{met again}} with John Adams, {{then went back to}} New York and then to its rival city, Brooklyn, where he laid the {{cornerstone}} for its public library. Lafayette celebrated his 68th birthday on 6 September at a reception with President John Quincy Adams at the White House, and departed the next day. He took with him, besides the soil to be placed on his grave, other gifts. Congress, at Monroe's request, had voted him $200,000 in gratitude for his services to the country, and a large tract of public lands in Florida. The passage back to France was aboard <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> was originally called the Susquehanna, but was renamed the USS Brandywine in honor of the battle where the Marquis de Lafayette shed his blood for the United States.|$|E

5|$|D'Ávila {{had plans}} to {{establish}} a settlement in Montejo's name near Puerto de Caballos, but knew it fell within the jurisdiction of Honduras, and that Cerezeda would never support such a move. In any case, the situation in Trujillo was too precarious for Cerezeda to support a major expedition. D'Ávila became embroiled in the factional politics of the town, taking the part of Diego Díaz de Herrera. After a time, he decided to leave Honduras, and took passage {{with the majority of}} his men on <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> stopped at Trujillo, which took them back to Yucatán. A few of D'Ávila's men stayed and settled in Trujillo, where the situation continued to deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|Design work on Kaiserin Augusta {{began in}} 1887; {{budgetary}} restrictions forced the German Navy to design <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> could serve in both colonial and fleet scout roles. During the design process, {{it was determined}} a three-shaft arrangement of the machinery {{would be necessary to}} attain the high speed requirement. This resulted in the first warship of the German Navy to use three screws. This was a relatively novel development; at the time of Kaiserin Augustas construction, only a handful of French and American ships had experimented with the arrangement, and had not yet been to sea for a thorough evaluation of the design. Kaiserin Augusta was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in 1890. She was launched on 15 January 1892 and commissioned into the fleet {{less than a year later}} on 17 November 1892.|$|E
5|$|Hoste also {{remained}} at sea, cruising in the battered Amphion beyond {{the range of}} the shore batteries on Lesina. Hoste was furious at the behaviour of Flore's officers and sent a note into Lesina demanding that they give up the ship as indicated by its earlier surrender. In surrendering and then escaping, the officers of Flore had breached an informal rule of naval conflict under which <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> voluntarily struck its flag submitted to an opponent in order to prevent continued loss of life among its crew. Flore had been able to pass unmolested through the British squadron only because she was recognised to have surrendered, and to abuse this custom in this way was considered, in the Royal Navy especially, to be a dishonourable act. The French at Lesina did not respond to Hoste's note, and the British squadron was eventually forced to return to Lissa to effect repairs.|$|E

5|$|This {{desertion}} further discouraged Bardanes, and, {{reluctant to}} face the loyalist army in battle, he opted for a negotiated surrender through the mediation of Joseph, the hegumenos of the Kathara monastery who had officiated at Constantine VI's second marriage. Bardanes received a letter signed by the Patriarch Tarasios and several leading senators which guaranteed that {{neither he nor his}} subordinates would be punished if they surrendered. As a further guarantee of good faith, Nikephoros sent his own gold cross along with the letter. Satisfied by these assurances, on 8 September Bardanes left his army and, through Nicaea, sought refuge in the monastery of Herakleios at Cius. From there, he embarked on <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> took him to the island of Prote. Taking the monastic name Sabbas, Bardanes then entered a monastery that he had founded there in the past.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{resisted}} Kenney's {{proposals that}} the bombers conduct attacks from low level using bombs armed with instantaneous fuses. Kenney ordered Walker {{to try the}} fuses {{for a couple of}} months, so that data could be gained about their effectiveness; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued their use. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck, but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. A few weeks later, Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul, an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night.|$|E
5|$|The Prince {{begins his}} quest alone, but is later {{joined by two}} cousins: the Prince of Cannock and the Princess of Moonbrooke. After finding the Prince of Cannock, who began a similar journey {{at the same time}} as the Prince of Midenhall, they save the Princess of Moonbrooke from Hargon's assault on Moonbrooke Castle, which is reduced to ruins. As the trio quest to find and defeat Hargon, they secure <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> allows them to travel across oceans to reach new continents, {{including}} Alefgard, which is where Dragon Quest took place. There they meet the grandson of Dragonlord, the villain from the previous game, who gives the party valuable information. He tells them that by collecting the five crests hidden around the world, the party can create the Charm of Rubiss, allowing them to defeat Hargon and his illusions. After obtaining the Charm of Rubiss, the party travels to Hargon's castle in the ice-covered plateau of Rhone and confronts Hargon in his throne room. Hargon is defeated, but he offers himself to Malroth and the demon emerges to destroy the heroes. Together, the three heroes slay Malroth and return to Midenhall, where the Prince is named the new king.|$|E
