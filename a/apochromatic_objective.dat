By 1870, Abbe invented the Abbe condenser, used for microscope illumination. In 1871, he designed the first refractometer, which he described in a booklet published in 1874. [...] He developed the laws of image of non-luminous objects by 1872. Zeiss Optical Works began selling his improved microscopes in 1872, by 1877 they were selling microscopes with homogenous immersion objective, and in 1886 his <b>apochromatic</b> <b>objective</b> microscopes were being sold. He created the Abbe number, a measure of any transparent material's variation of refractive index with wavelength and Abbe's criterion, which tests the hypothesis, that a systematic trend exists {{in a set of}} observations (in terms of resolving power this criterion stipulates that an angular separation cannot be less than the ratio of the wavelength to the aperture diameter, see angular resolution). Already a professor in Jena, he was hired by Carl Zeiss to improve the manufacturing process of optical instruments, which back then was largely based on trial and error.|$|E

We have decided to use off-axis unobstructed Maksutov telescope,which is able to meet our demands for constant solar image scale in wavelenght within 380 to 760 nm. This telescope provides good image contrast similar to <b>apochromatic</b> <b>objective</b> lens uses only classical materials. Diameter of the telescope is 140 mm,focal length is 2000 mm...|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} {{publications}} announcing the Schott glassworks line of products, Zeiss {{announced a new}} set of objectives, based on Abbe’s work, corrected to a higher standard than any existing lenses.  The <b>apochromatic</b> <b>objectives</b> represented the success of collaborations lasting almost two decades.|$|R
50|$|In December of 1885 Zeiss {{suffered}} a mild stroke, {{from which he}} fully recovered.  The grand duke enrolled him in the Order of the White Falcon for his 70th birthday in 1886, the same year the <b>apochromatic</b> <b>objectives</b> appeared on the market.  These represented the final realization of the grand design for the theoretical design of objectives inspired by and made possible by Zeiss and realized by Abbe; they delivered previously unknown image quality.  The members {{of the congress of}} Russian physicians were so inspired by the new objectives that they made Zeiss an honorary member.|$|R
50|$|The eyepiece, or ocular lens, is a {{cylinder}} containing {{two or more}} lenses; its function is to bring the image into focus for the eye. The eyepiece is inserted into the top end of the body tube. Eyepieces are interchangeable and many different eyepieces can be inserted with different degrees of magnification. Typical magnification values for eyepieces include 5×, 10× (the most common), 15X and 20×. In some high performance microscopes, the optical configuration of the objective lens and eyepiece are matched to give the best possible optical performance. This occurs most commonly with <b>apochromatic</b> <b>objectives.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} is {{the phenomenon}} of different colors focusing at different distances from a lens. In photography, chromatic aberration produces soft overall images, and color fringing at high-contrast edges, like an edge between black and white. Astronomers face similar problems, particularly with telescopes that use lenses rather than mirrors. Achromatic lenses are corrected to bring two wavelengths (typically red and blue) into focus in the same plane. Apochromatic lenses are designed to bring three wavelengths (typically red, green, and blue) into focus in the same plane. The residual color error (secondary spectrum) can be up to {{an order of magnitude}} less than for an achromatic lens of equivalent aperture and focal length. Apochromats are also corrected for spherical aberration at two wavelengths, rather than one as in an achromat.Telescope objective lenses for wide-band digital imaging in astronomy must have apochromatic correction, as the optical sensitivity of typical CCD imaging arrays can extend from the ultraviolet through the visible spectrum and into the near infrared wavelength range. Apochromatic lenses for astrophotography in the 60-150 mm aperture range have been developed and marketed by several different firms, with focal ratios ranging from [...] to 7. Focused and guided properly during the exposure, these <b>apochromatic</b> <b>objectives</b> are capable of producing the sharpest wide-field astrophotographs optically possible for the given aperture sizes.|$|R
40|$|Subject of Research. Existing {{adjustment}} {{methods of}} lens objectives in two mechanical designs have been analyzed, the main ways of centering error compensation have been considered. The algorithm of automated search of optical elements {{position has been}} developed based on the existing methods of centering for compensation of residual decentering. The methods of joint application of this algorithm and centering machine “Trioptics Opticentric” have been suggested. Method. Centering errors of the objective lens components are measured on the centering machine. Aberrations of optical system are calculated by using the received data of centering errors entered to the objective mathematical model. For the calculation of aberration compensation, iteration algorithm of searching of optical elements optimal position is used. The image quality is analyzed for each obtained realization of the optical system. The result of program performance is data matrix about optical components location such that compensation of residual aberrations occurs. Based on the obtained information the system assembling is carried out {{with the use of}} centering machine “Trioptics Opticentric”. Main Results. Computer modeling of centering errors for 100 lens <b>apochromatic</b> <b>objectives</b> of drop-in mountings lens design has been carried out. The coma of object axial point image has been chosen as quality estimation criterion. The developed algorithm has been applied for the worst realization of the optical system. In this case the value of integral coma of object axial point image has been decreased by two orders and reduced practically to zero. It is noted that the modeling of adjustment process via using the algorithm of automated search enables to predict the possibility of objective assembly with required quality parameters. Practical Relevance. The received results can be applied on the lines of automated assembly of modern lens objectives...|$|R
50|$|<b>Apochromatic</b> {{refractors}} have <b>objectives</b> {{built with}} special, extra-low dispersion materials. They {{are designed to}} bring three wavelengths (typically red, green, and blue) into focus in the same plane. The residual color error (tertiary spectrum) can be up to {{an order of magnitude}} less than that of an achromatic lens. Such telescopes contain elements of fluorite or special, extra-low dispersion (ED) glass in the objective and produce a very crisp image that is virtually free of chromatic aberration. Due to the special materials needed in the fabrication, apochromatic refractors are usually more expensive than telescopes of other types with a comparable aperture.|$|R

Beam modulation was realized by transparent metal masks or by rotating form screens after an extension error analysis on masks and screens. The range of potential method applications in the optical industry has been demonstrated by several examples: (i) Improving the roughness of a CaF_ 2 lens (103 mm diameter) from 3. 38 to 0. 49, (ii) correcting the surface error at a completely mounted interferometer objective, (iii) correcting the defect of polish at a flourspar lens (70 mm diameter) from a peak to valley value of 120 nm to 47 nm, (iv) etching the pattern of a micro lenses array with refractive individual lenses (3 #mu#m diameter) into quark, and (v) constructing the prototype of an <b>apochromatic</b> telescope <b>objective</b> with short focal length.

40|$|A general {{method of}} {{designing}} an apochromatic lens {{by using a}} triplet of special glasses, in which the buried surfaces concept is used, can be outlined. First, one initially chooses a starting point which is already achromatic. Second, a thick plate or shell {{is added to the}} design, where the plate or shell has an index of refraction 1. 62, which is similar to the special glass triplet average index of refraction (for example: PSK 53 A, KZFS 1 and TIF 6). Third, the lens is then reoptimized to an achromatic design. Fourth, the single element is replace by the special glass triplet. Fifth, only the internal surfaces of the triplet are varied to correct all three wavelengths. Although this step will produce little improvement, it does serve to stabilize further optimization. Sixth and finally, all potential variables are used to fully optimize the <b>apochromatic</b> lens. Microscope <b>objectives,</b> for example, could be designed using this technique. The important concept to apply is the use of multiple buried surfaces in which each interface involves a special glass, after an achromatic design has been achieved. This extension relieves the restriction that all special glasses have a common index of refraction and allows a wider variety of special glasses to be used. However, it is still desirable to use glasses which form a large triangle on the P versus V diagram...|$|R
