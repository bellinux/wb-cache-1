5|$|People from Birmingham {{are called}} Brummies, a term {{derived from the}} city's {{nickname}} of Brum.

There is a distinctive Brummie <b>accent</b> <b>and</b> dialect.|$|E
5|$|Several highly {{acclaimed}} {{editions of}} Schubert's last sonatas are available, namely those of Bärenreiter, Henle, Universal, and Oxford University Press. These editions have, however, occasionally received some criticism {{for the wrong}} interpretation or notation of Schubert's intentions, {{on issues such as}} deciphering the correct pitches from the manuscript, notating tremoli, discriminating between <b>accent</b> <b>and</b> decrescendo markings, and reconstructing missing bars.|$|E

5|$|The Piedmont {{region is}} known for its dialect's strong {{influence}} on Southern American English. While a more homogenized American English is found in urban areas, various accents are also used, including the Tidewater accent, the Old Virginia <b>accent,</b> <b>and</b> the anachronistic Elizabethan of Tangier Island.|$|E

5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with them about {{the success of their}} {{performance}} that night. As Crozier took down the information, a car pulled up and another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English <b>accent</b> <b>and</b> immediately took charge, ordering a man who appeared to have been the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{animation}} required for Deadpool's mask and Colossus, Reese and Wernick had more freedom than usual to keep adjusting the script during post-production. Reynolds recorded new lines of dialogue using his iPhone, and then re-recorded {{the lines in}} an additional dialogue recording session once the film was finalized. Lines added after filming included Reynolds doing an impression of Wolverine star Hugh Jackman's natural Australian <b>accent,</b> <b>and</b> another where Deadpool asks whether the character Professor X is being portrayed by James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart {{at that point in}} the X-Men timeline, which became a favorite line in the film for many audience members.|$|E
5|$|Corman had initial {{trouble finding}} {{distribution}} for the film, as some distributors, including American International Pictures (AIP), felt that the film would be interpreted as anti-Semitic, citing the characters of Gravis Mushnick and Siddie Shiva. Welles, who is Jewish, stated that he gave his character a Turkish Jewish <b>accent</b> <b>and</b> mannerisms, and that he saw the humor of the film as playful, and felt there was no intent to defame any ethnic group. The film was finally released by its production company, The Filmgroup, nine months after it had been completed.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many girls}} of her time, Barney had a {{haphazard}} education. Her {{interest in the}} French language began with a governess who read Jules Verne stories aloud to her so {{she would have to}} learn quickly to understand them. Later she and her younger sister Laura Clifford Barney attended Les Ruches, a French boarding school in Fontainebleau, France, founded by feminist Marie Souvestre, who also founded Allenswood, in Wimbledon, outside London, which was attended by such notables as Eleanor Roosevelt. As an adult she spoke French fluently without an <b>accent</b> <b>and</b> made her home in Paris. Nearly all her published works were written in French.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate. Manning had come out to two friends in Oklahoma as gay, but was not open about it at school in Wales. The students would imitate her <b>accent,</b> <b>and</b> apparently abandoned her once during a camping trip; her aunt told The Washington Post that Manning awoke to an empty camp site one morning, after everyone else had packed up their tents and left without her.|$|E
5|$|Paul Newman as Ben Quick. Newman met {{director}} Martin Ritt as {{a student}} at the Actors Studio, where Ritt was a teacher-assistant for Elia Kazan. Newman, who was under a contract with Warner Brothers, was loaned to 20th Century Fox for a fee of US$75,000. Meanwhile, his contract earned him US$17,500 for each ten-week shot. He travelled to Clinton, Louisiana, before the start of filming to study the mannerisms, <b>accent</b> <b>and</b> speech of the Southern men {{in order to create a}} proper characterization.|$|E

5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{thought that}} the {{character}} would be a perfect role for Rudd, stating that he would perform it in a British <b>accent</b> <b>and</b> had high expectations for the comedy of the episode because it was being written by Enbom. However, Thomas did not release any details about Rudd's plot line in the episode before its airing. Rudd compared his character to Andrew Ridgeley and Peter O'Toole. In the scene in which Veronica meets Desmond, the film of camera angles while Kristen Bell was speaking were inadvertently destroyed, leading to these camera angles being filmed nearly six weeks later. Bell had to speak her lines without Rudd present.|$|E
5|$|The Coatbridge accent {{has been}} {{categorised}} as making less {{use of the}} Scots tongue and exhibiting a tendency to stress the 'a' vowel differently from general Scots usage. Examples of this are seen the pronunciation of the words stair (sterr), hair (herr), fair (ferr) and chair (cherr). This different enunciation {{has been attributed to}} the impact of successive influxes of Ulster Catholic immigrants into Coatbridge. However, the distinctiveness of the Coatbridge <b>accent</b> <b>and</b> pronunciation has diminished as the various surrounding populations (especially Glasgow) have mingled with that of Coatbridge.|$|E
5|$|After the Norse occupation, the {{toponymy}} of Orkney {{became almost}} wholly West Norse. The Norse language changed {{into the local}} Norn, which lingered {{until the end of}} the 18th century, when it finally died out. Norn was replaced by the Orcadian dialect of Insular Scots. This dialect is at a low ebb due to the pervasive influences of television, education, and the large number of incomers. However, attempts are being made by some writers and radio presenters to revitalise its use and the distinctive sing-song <b>accent</b> <b>and</b> many dialect words of Norse origin remain in use. The Orcadian word most frequently encountered by visitors is peedie, meaning small, which may be derived from the French petit.|$|E
