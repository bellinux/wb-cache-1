40|$|Abstract: Recently, studies {{conducted}} by our research group, revealed {{the possibility for}} reducing BSFC, NOx and PM emissions to meet the Euro 4 & 5 legislations. The main objective {{of the present study}} is to get better fuel economy in commercial vehicles by considering real driving conditions.

Secondly, it is performed to make the engine dynometer test to optimize the fuel consumption by reflecting on the representative driving modes, based on the Korea 2008 emission legislation equal to the Euro 4. The engine components such as engine calibration, combustion chamber, turbocharger and <b>ancilliaries</b> were modified to optimize vehicle fuel economy over a typical customer drive cycle whilst still meeting the exhaust emission restrictions. Finally, these results were confirmed by field testing of vehicle equipped with the updated calibration engine. It was placed the two vehicles together traveling the same route and accomplishing the same amount of stops(back to back), in order to evaluate the fuel consumption in comparison to the current vehicle.

40|$|Fishery {{management}} policies need to {{be based}} on historical summaries of stock status which are well correlated with the size of the group of individuals who will be affected by any harvest. This paper is motivated by the problem of managing stocks of Atlantic salmon, which can be accurately monitored during the riverine stages of their life-history, but which spend a lengthy period at sea before returning to spawn. We begin by formulating a minimal stochastic model of stock-recruitment driven population dynamics, which linearises to a standard ARMA form. We investigate the relation between maturity dispersion and the auto-covariance of stock fluctuations driven by process noise in the recruitment process and/or random variability in survival from recruitment to spawning. We demonstrate that significant reductions in fluctuation intensity and/or increases in long-run average yield can be achieved by controlling harvesting in response to the value of a historical summary focussed on lags at which the uncontrolled population dynamics produce strong correlations. We apply our minimal model to two well-characterised Atlantic salmon populations, and find poor agreement between predicted and observed stock fluctuation ACF. Re-examination of the <b>ancilliary</b> data available for one of our two exemplary systems leads us to propose an extended model which also linearises to ARMA form, and which predicts a fluctuation ACF more closely in agreement with that observed, and could thus form a satisfactory vehicle for policy discussion...|$|E
40|$|Non-ribosomal peptide {{synthesis}} in fungi {{requires a}} ready supply of proteogenic and non-proteogenic amino acids which are subsequently {{incorporated into the}} nascent non-ribosomal peptide via a thiotemplate mechanism catalysed by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. Substrate amino acids can be modified prior to or during incorporation into the non-ribosomal peptide, or following incorporation into an early stage amino acid-containing biosynthetic intermediate. These post-incorporation modifications involve a range of additional enzymatic activities including but not exclusively, monooxygenases, methyltransferases, epimerases, oxidoreductases and glutathione transferases which are essential to effect biosynthesis of the final non-ribosomal peptide. Likewise, polyketide biosynthesis is directly by polyketide synthase megaenzymes and cluster-encoded <b>ancilliary</b> decorating enzymes. Additionally, a suite of additional primary metabolites, for example: CoA, acetyl CoA, S-adenosylmethionine, glutathione, NADPH, malonyl CoA and molecular oxygen, amongst others are required for non-ribosomal peptide and polyketide synthesis. Clearly these processes must involve exquisite orchestration to facilitate the simultaneous biosynthesis {{of different types of}} non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, and related metabolites requiring identical or similar biosynthetic precursors or co-factors. Moreover, the near identical structures of many natural products within a given family (e. g., ergot alkaloids), along with localization to similar regions within fungi (e. g., conidia) suggests that cross-talk may exist, in terms of biosynthesis and functionality. Finally, we speculate if certain biosynthetic steps involved in non-ribosomal peptide and polyketide synthesis play a role in cellular protection or environmental adaptation, and wonder if these enzymatic reactions are of equivalent importance to the actual biosynthesis of the final metabolite...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—As {{the initial}} {{stage of a}} {{supervised}} classification, the quality of training has {{a significant effect on}} the entire classification process and its accuracy. In hyperspectral data analysis, a judicious selection of training samples can be tremendously difficult due to the presence of subpixel targets and mixed pixels, in particular, when no prior knowledge about the data is available. For instance, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network can provide very accurate nonlinear estimations of fractional abundances, provided that the training set contains all possible mixture conditions. However, the requirement of large volumes of training data is a serious limitation in remote sensing because, even if classes concurring to a per-pixel cover class mixture are known, proportions of these classes are very difficult to be estimated a priori. This paper investigates, explores and further proposes solutions to resolve the issues above. Specifically, we develop a nonlinear neural network-based mixture model, coupled with unsupervised algorithms for automated generation of semi-labeled samples that can be effectively used for mixed pixel classification. These unsupervised algorithms, intended for situations where <b>ancilliary</b> information is difficult to be collected prior to data analysis, rely on the principle that patterns that lie close to the location of decision boundaries in feature space are more informative than patterns drawn from the class cores. Computer simulations and real experiments are conducted for performance analysis of nonlinear unmixing techniques based on training samples.

Experiments on the behaviour of brittle materials, particularly quartz, {{during the}} initial period of loading, {{at the onset of}} fracture and during the stage of rapid crack propagation, have been performed in order to gain an insight into some of the fundamental processes of brittle fracture which might prove useful in the solution of practical problems in mining and process operations. Studies have also been conducted into the nature of the damage produced by a diamond stylus sliding on a quartz surface. The results of these studies have been correlated with <b>ancilliary</b> experiments in which the effects of the deformation produced by a sharp indenter and sliding diamond polishing particles on quartz were examined. The geometry of cracks in glass and quartz during the loading stage has been observed by scanning electron microscopy and was found to be approximately elliptical. By making some simple assumptions, an equation has been derived that enables the fracture surface energy to be deduced from shape of the crack and the loading conditions. The brittleness of a material is indicated by the difference between the fracture surface energy and the thermodynamic surface energy of the material. In a perfectly brittle body they are equal. In order to make an accurate comparison with the true surface energy in quartz as calculated from atomic bond energy data, anisotropic elastic theory was used in the evaluation of the fracture surface energy...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} numerically {{the momentum}} density and phase maps -in coordinate and momentum space- of a two dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) excited by a moving red-detuned laser potential. The BEC is confined in a harmonic trap cutoff by hard walls. The system and excitation scheme are {{as in our}} previous work (Roger R. Sakhel et al. to appear in J. Low Temp. Phys. (2013)); but with {{twice the number of}} particles and interaction strength. We solve the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically using the split-step Crank-Nicolson method in real time. It is demonstrated that the red-detuned laser has a phase-imprinting effect like a repulsive potential barrier. Signatures of excitations are extracted from the dynamics of the momentum densities and phase maps. Further, a new phase is defined in momentum space, which is used to reveal excitations. Therefore, phase maps in coordinate space and momentum space are compared for different BEC evolution times. We argue, that this momentum-space phase is especially important with regard to the studies of BEC momentum distributions. In addition, this work presents a new method of BEC interferometry and should contribute to the ongoing research in that field. One of our significant findings is the presence of substantial differences betwteen the momentum density obtained by a Fourier transform (FT) of the spatial density distribution and the one obtained from the modulus of the wavefunction in momentum space; the latter is obtained by a FT of the spatial wavefunction.

A wide variety of M–O and M–N bonds {{have been shown to}} activate CO₂, however to date there are no examples with cadmium. A range of novel cadmium amide and alkoxide complexes have been synthesised, using the β-diketiminato ligand (BDI) as an <b>ancilliary</b> ligand. Initial reactivity studies have suggested CO₂ activation may be possible, although no products were isolated. Homonuclear metallic bonding (M–M) has been explored since the 1950 ’s and complexes containing M–M bonds are known for almost all transition and main group metals. There are only two reported Cd–Cd bonds, both using sterically bulky monoanionic ligands, like the β-diketiminato ligand. A novel β-diketiminato-cadmium chloride complex was synthesised and treated with a range of different reducing agents to generate a Cd–Cd bond. Different reactivities were observed for the reducing agents, however evidence of a Cd–Cd bond was not obtained. Group 14 - 16 materials, such as lead selenide, are p-type semi-conductors and have the potential to replacing silicon as a photon acceptor in solar cells. Lead selenide nanoparticles display quantum confinement effects, which allows one to tailor the band gap energies to maximise their absorbance of solar energy. The synthesis of PbSe nanoparticles is described in this study from the reaction between selenium and the lead complex [(BDIph) ₂Pb], {{as well as from the}} decomposition of [(BDIdipp) PbSeP{Se}Cy₂]. Differences in the size and shapes of the nanoparticles was observed, highlighting the need for controlled nucleation and growth conditions...|$|E
