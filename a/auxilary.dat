It is estimated that at that point forces from at least 10 Legions participated in Severus' campaign in Judea, including Legio X Fretensis, Legio VI Ferrata, Legio III Gallica, Legio III Cyrenaica, Legio II Traiana Fortis, Legio X Gemina, cohorts of Legio V Macedonica, cohorts of Legio XI Claudia, cohorts of Legio XII Fulminata and cohorts of Legio IV Flavia Felix and 30-50 <b>auxilary</b> units with a total force of 60,000–120,000 Roman soldiers facing Bar-Kokhba's rebels. Legio XXII Deiotariana was likely entirely lost during an earlier stage of the revolt. It is plausible that Legio IX Hispana also arrived in Judea and its demise occurred during the decisive campaign of Sextus Julius Severus, as Legio IX Hispana's disappearance during the second century is often attributed to this war.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} and syntheses of the {{pyrrolizidine alkaloids}} from 1976 to March 1988 is reviewed, and a stereoselective total synthesis of swazinecic acid dilactone was attempted. One approach involved an asymmetric {{synthesis of the}} allylic α-hydroxy acid 2 -hydroxy- 2, 3 -dimethyl- 3 -butenoic acid employing oxazolines as chiral <b>auxilaries.</b> The oxazoline, (4 S, 5 S) - 2 -(1 -bromoethyl) - 4 -methoxymethyl- 5 -phenyl- 2 -oxazoline, was obtained by direct halogenation of the 2 -ethyl oxazoline analogue. This was condensed with acetone in a Darzens type reaction and the resultant epoxy oxazoline rearranged to an allylic α-hydroxy oxazoline which was then hydrolysed to the chiral hydroxy acid in low enantiomeric excess. The hydroxy acid, as the O-silylated ethyl ester, was elaborated by allylic diethyl malonate to bromination and condensation with diethyl 5 -carboethoxy- 2 -methyl- 3 - methylene- 2 - 0 -tert-butyldimethylsilylhexanedioate.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} stereoselective syntheses of four amino acids, {{three of}} which are C-glycosidic analogues of glycosylated amino acids. The overall goal {{of the project was}} to probe the interactions between MHC molecules, glycopeptide antigens and T cell receptors, that are essential for development of collagen induced arthritis. Collagen induced arthritis is a frequently used mouse model for rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that attacks joint cartilage and leads to a painful and eventually crippling condition. The thesis is based on four studies. The first study describes the synthesis of hydroxylysine, an amino acid that is found in collagen and is an important constituent of the glycopeptide proposed as an antigen in collagen induced arthritis. During the synthesis of hydroxylysine some new insight into the mechanism of the reductive opening of p-methoxybenzylidene acetals was obtained. The remaining three studies deals with the synthesis of C-glycosidic analogues of glycosylated amino acids, hydroxy norvaline, threonine and hydroxylysine. The synthesis of each amino acid required control of several stereogenic centra and utilizes a variety of approaches such as use of stereoselective reactions, chiral <b>auxilaries,</b> chiral templates and asymmetric catalysis. The C-glycosidic analogues of galactosylated hydroxynorvaline and hydroxylysine were incorporated in glycopeptides from type II collagen and evaluated in T cell response assays. It was found that the T cells were stimulated by the C-glycopeptides, but that higher concentrations were required than for the native O-glycopeptid...|$|R
40|$|As {{substitutes}} for chlorinated hydrocarbons water and hydrocarbon solvents are investigated. The application {{of water and}} detergents in special machines is defined as wet cleaning. The research work included fibre protection agents, impact of mechanical action of the wet cleaning machines on the dimension stability of the fabrics {{and the removal of}} dirt. In a classification system the properties of fibres, fabrics and combinations of different materials are defined. The limits of the applicability of wet cleaning processes depend mainly on the properties of the garments. In order to extend the amount of wet cleanable textiles, a new care labelling symbol was proposed (W) and after a period of discussions accepted by the European care labelling authority. Hydrocarbon solvent was investigated in two directions: firstly as a solvent for cleaning garments and secondly for cleaning apparel of industrial workers. The cleaning efficiency of hydrocarbon solvents in addition with detergents and water below than 2 % is lower than of perchloroethylene with adequate <b>auxilaries.</b> By introducing prespotting procedures the cleaning efficiency of hydrocarbon solvents can be improved dramatically up to about 95 % of perchloroethylene. By improving the distillation equipment, it is possible to separate entirely the water, dirt, auxiliaries from hydrocarbon solvents. Cleaning of apparel in hydrocarbon solvents with addition of water above 10 % a good to very good soil removal was achieved. Separation of the different components as water, dirt, auxiliaries and hydrocarbon solvent was realized by fractional distillation/condensation. Transfer of research results into the industry was already done during the research period. (orig.)

The Stemona alkaloids are an important family of natural products which have received attention due to their unique chemical structure and important biological properties. The stemona family members contain the 4 -azaazulene substructure (1) : stenine[,] stemoamide[,] croomine[,] stemonamide[,] parvistemoline[], [...] The importance of the 4 -azaazulene ring system has attracted the attention of many synthetic groups in recent years. We have developed a concise approach to functionalized azaazulene systems which employs an intramolecular asymmetric Heck reaction (AHR) of an endocyclic enamide as the key bond-forming step. The enamide Heck precursors are prepared by in situ acylation of the corresponding 7 -membered imine with (Z) - 3 -bromopropenoyl chloride. Imines of this type are generated by deprotection of readily available N-formyl enamides with Grignard reagents. [] [...] Stenine {{is a member of the}} stenine group of Stemona alkaloids which has been of interest to synthetic chemists in recent years. To date, three total syntheses have been completed by Chen, Wipf and Morimoto. Our synthetic strategy involves a Diels-Alder cyclization between a fumarate ester and a diene of type 2. Model studies were conducted and it was found that for R = H and Pr a single isomer (3) was obtained in moderate to good yield (51 - 87 %). This route also allows for the possibility of an asymmetric synthesis with the use of chiral <b>auxilaries</b> (R? = R*). Diels-Alder cyclization of diene 2 (R = H) with N-phenylmaleimide, unexpectedly led to the exo product, which may be the result of thermodynamic equilibration via epimerization. []-...|$|R
