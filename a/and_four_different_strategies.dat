Problems of contribution quality, credit for contributions, project coordination, funding, and mission-creep are ever-present. Of these, long-term funding and project coordination can interact to form a particularly difficult problem for open-source projects in an academic environment. BioPerl was chosen {{as an example of}} a successful academic open-source project. Several of the roadblocks and hurdles encountered and overcome in the development of BioPerl are examined through the telling of the history of the project. Along the way, key points of open-source law are explained, such as license choice and copyright. The BioPerl project current status is then analyzed, <b>and</b> <b>four</b> <b>different</b> <b>strategies</b> typically employed by traditional open-source projects at this stage are analyzed as future directions. Strategies such as soliciting donations, securing grants, providing dual-licenses to enhance commercial interest, and the paid provision of support have all been employed in various traditional open-source projects with success, but each has drawbacks when applied to the academy. Finally, the construction of a successful long-term strategy for BioPerl, and other academic open-source projects, is proposed so that such projects can navigate the difficulties.

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} <b>and</b> compare <b>four</b> <b>different</b> <b>strategies</b> to {{simulate}} the fluid model for streamer propagation in one-dimension (1 D) and quasi two-dimension (2 D), which consists of a Poisson's equation for particle velocity and two continuity equations for particle transport.

The numerical methods for Poisson's equation include finite volume method, discontinuous Galerkin methods, mixed finite element method and least-squared finite element method. The numerical method for continuity equations is chosen from the family of discontinuous Galerkin methods. The accuracy tests and comparisons show that all of these four strategies are suitable and competitive in streamer simulations from the aspects of accuracy and efficiency. Results show these methods are compatible. By applying any strategy in real simulations, we can study the dynamics of streamer propagations in both 1 D and quasi 2 D models...|$|R
40|$|The {{weighting}} of gradient sample {{arguments for}} the creation of descriptors of image regions is studied. The descriptors are interpreted as binned and weighted argument kernel density estimates and thereby their defining attributes are identified as the binning rules and the weighting. The weighting is further studied <b>and</b> <b>four</b> <b>different</b> weighting <b>strategies</b> are analyzed. The naive constant weighting is argued to have a poor robustness to image perturbations. As an answer to this, the customary gradient magnitude weighting is motivated. However, the short-comings of this approach are pointed out and two novel weighting strategies are suggested. The first suggested weighting gives a system parameter determining a distinctiveness to robustness trade-off with the customary magnitude weighting being a special case of it. The second suggested weighting gives a similar robustness as the first one, but at a lower computational cost. Finally, the effects of the <b>different</b> weighting <b>strategies</b> are demonstrated with real imagery data and synthetic perturbations. QC 20130422 </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a generic {{methodology}} for the automated generation of fuzzy models. The methodology is realized in three stages. Initially, a crisp model is created and in the second stage it is transformed to a fuzzy one. In the third stage, all parameters entering the fuzzy model are optimized. The proposed methodology is novel and generic since it can integrate alternative techniques in each of its stages. A specific realization of this methodology is implemented, using decision trees for the creation of the crisp model, the sigmoid function, the min–max operators and the maximum defuzzifier, for the transformation of the crisp model into a fuzzy one, <b>and</b> <b>four</b> <b>different</b> optimization <b>strategies,</b> including global and local optimization techniques, as well as, hybrid approaches.

Several existing complex network models as well as real-world networks of scientific collaborations and Internet traffic are numerically investigated, and the network performance is quantitatively measured by the average inverse geodesic length {{and the size of}} the largest connected subgraph. For each case of attacks on vertices <b>and</b> edges, <b>four</b> <b>different</b> attacking <b>strategies</b> are used: removals by the descending order of the degree and the betweenness centrality, calculated for either the initial network or the current network during the removal procedure.

Furthermore, the correlation between the betweenness centrality and the degree in complex networks is studied. Comment: To appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

Over the last decade, mobile networks have become a critical infrastructure. Private individuals, governments and businesses rely on mobile networks to provide stable and robust services, both in everyday life and in crisis. There is also an increasing demand for capacity as new and more mobile broadband challenging services are being used. The society will rely on the mobile networks to provide higher capacity, more coverage and increased robustness in the future to come.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to model the {{extraction}} unit operation of the cassava starch manufacturing process and to propose a realistic recycling simulation in order to reduce the volumes of effluents. The model was developed from reactors which are commonly used for cassava starch extraction at a household scale in Vietnam. The reactors were tested using inflow starch as a marker at the beginning of the batch process. The experimental residence time distribution (RTDexp) was calculated by the outflow of the starch concentration. Using Matlab®, the RTDexp was compared to the theoretical residence time distribution (RTDth). The dynamic model obtained was built up on Simulink® <b>and</b> tested with <b>four</b> <b>different</b> <b>strategies</b> of recycling methods. Sedimented starch was collected from the different types of processes; the pH value and the titratable acidity of starch were then measured. The results showed a good correlation between RTDexp and RTDth. The reactors were described by a model of two mixed tanks in series. The simulation of the recycling process revealed a reduction in quantity of water used up to 43 %; however, the recycling process increased significantly the titratable acidity of starch up to 6. 48 ± 0. 11 mequiv.

Acacia mangium and Mimosa caesalpiniifolia were planted above the gully head. A nearby 20 -year secondary forest remnant {{was used as a}} reference site. Ten pitfall traps were used for the sampling of epigeous fauna at each one of the five areas (MOLDENKE, 1994). Sampling was performe in May 2000, June 2006, and April 2008.

40|$|Background: In the Netherlands, {{the first}} 5 years of {{follow-up}} after treatment {{for breast cancer}} are carried out in hospital with yearly mammography. After this, for patients aged over 60 years who have undergone mastectomy, there is a shift of care to the National Screening Programme (NSP) for mammography every 2 years. After breast-conserving therapy follow-up is perfomed by the general practitioner (GP), with mammography every second year and physical examination annually. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the clinical effects <b>and</b> costs of <b>four</b> <b>different</b> <b>strategies</b> for follow-up after breast cancer treatment. Methods: An extended and validated simulation model for breast cancer follow-up was used. The current guidelines for follow-up (baseline strategy) and three less intensive follow-up strategies were evaluated. The main outcome measure was the detection rate of small tumours (2 cm or smaller) and associated costs for each strategy. Results: Shortening the follow-up time in hospital by shifting care to the NSP or GP after 2 years instead of 5 years of hospital follow-up, lowering the age of referral to the NSP or GP from 60 to 50 years, and termination of annual physical examination by the GP after hospital follow-up did not decrease the detection of small tumours. In addition, a substantial decrease in costs was observed with simplified follow-up. Conclusion: Decreasing hospital follow-up time, lowering the age of referral to the NSP or GP, and termination of annual physical examinations would lead to a substantial reduction in costs while maintaining the possibility of detecting small breast cancers.

40|$|HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition) {{combustion}} {{takes place}} in homogeneous mixtures once that spontaneous combustion temperature and latency time are exceeded. However, differently from simultaneous combustion, the reactions take place gradually, since lean mixture is used and thanks to suitable solutions, commonly consisting in high levels of charge dilution by exhaust gas. The most important advantage of HCCI combustion in respect to the diffusive one {{is the possibility of}} minimizing soot and NOx emissions. This occurs because HCCI combustion avoids the presence, in combustion chamber, both of excessively fuel-rich zones and of local temperature peaks, responsible of soot and NOx formation respectively. However, this combustion strategy still does not cover the whole engine operating field, thus the engine must be built to operate basically as a conventional engine in transient operations and with high engine loads. The homogeneous charge formation represents a critical factor for the obtaining of HCCI combustion. Another limitation is that, being triggered by homogenous charge spontaneous ignition during compression, HCCI combustion timing control and optimization are not easy. The research activity can be divided in three sections, in which possible solutions to HCCI combustion limitations have been analyzed. In the first section a numerical and experimental analysis of gasoline HCCI and PCCI (partially Premixed Charge Compression Ignition) combustion has been made, to understand the influence of some operating parameter on combustion behavior and emission production. After a first spray model validation, CFD simulations of HCCI and PCCI combustion have been performed with various engine speed, injection timings and equivalence ratios. Two combustion models (Shell-CTC and CHEMKIN) have been adopted to evaluate the importance of detailed chemical kinetics on low temperature combustions. From the results it emerges that increasing the in-cylinder in-homogeneity at ignition time the combustion efficiency improves. However, due to the higher temperatures, NOx emissions increase as well. In the second section of this activity a numerical analysis of dual fuel combustion through advanced combustion models has been performed, to avoid ignition phasing control uncertainties of gasoline HCCI. A small amount of diesel fuel is injected as a pilot injection to ignite a pre-mixture of gasoline (or other high-octane fuel) and air. Several injection timings and mixture compositions have been evaluated in two engine operating points using two <b>different</b> injectors <b>and</b> <b>four</b> <b>different</b> combustion <b>strategies.</b> Initially a validation for a newly proposed combustion strategy was necessary. From the results it emerges that even a very small injection of diesel fuel plays a successful role as an ignition source for the pre-mixed gasoline, and the combustion initially takes place by a flame propagation mechanism. Then, due to the high in-cylinder pressure and temperature conditions, auto-ignition spreads in the whole combustion chamber. In the last part of this research activity a preliminary study of an innovative concept to control HCCI combustion in diesel-fuelled engines is proposed. The main purpose of the research is the obtaining of diesel HCCI combustion also with high mean effective pressures rendering the combustion behavior more controllable as well. The concept consists in forming a pre-compressed homogenous charge outside the cylinder and in gradually admitting it into the cylinder during the combustion process. In this way, combustion can be controlled by the flow rate transfer and high pressure gradients, typical of common HCCI combustion, can be limited as well. A first analysis has been done, only to test the validity of the concept then constructive two <b>and</b> <b>four</b> stroke solutions have been proposed. Results have been compared with a conventional diesel application in terms of pressure, temperature, heat release rate and emissions. Finally an injection process optimization has been performed. From the results it emerges the validity of the concept even though successive mixture formation process optimizations are recommended...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Currently {{decitabine}} (trade name Dacogen®) is only {{approved for}} {{acute myeloid leukemia}} in old patients and is administered via intra-venous (IV) route once a day for five days, every four weeks. It’s a painful treatment with difficulties due to IV administration: pain, risk of infectious, nursing, hospitalization. Decitabine oral bioavailability is limited to 3. 9 to 14 % mainly due to the quick hydrolyse of the molecule in acidic conditions. The aim of our study was to design new formulations to administer decitabine orally. Material <b>and</b> methods: <b>Four</b> <b>different</b> nano-object <b>strategies,</b> already published, have been adapted for decitabine encapsulation: lipid nanocapsules (LNC) with a Transcutol® HP core (1), lipid drug conjugate (LDC) (2), polymeric nanoparticles (NP) (3), and LNC loaded with reverse micelles (LNC-RM) (4). For each strategy, size, polydispersity index (PdI), and Zeta potential were monitored by dynamic light scattering on a Zetasizer® Nano series DTS 1060. Encapsulation efficiency and encapsulation yield were determined after an ultra-centrifugation of the formulation or by filtration associated to centrifugation depending on the nanoparticles formulated. An UPLC-UV method was developed to quantify decitabine. Results and discussion: Very different sizes of nanoparticles were obtained: 27. 4 ± 1. 6 nm for LNC-RM, 38. 7 ± 7. 0 nm for LNC, 34. 3 ± 4. 5 nm for LDC and 145. 2 ± 0. 9 for NP. PdI were found inferior to 0. 2 for all the encapsulation strategies used. Encapsulation efficiency was not sufficient for LNC, LDC and NP (1. 20 ± 2. 00 %, 25. 00 ± 1. 94 % and 2. 81 ± 3. 10 % respectively) but promising for the LNC-RM (48. 76 ± 14. 18 %), corresponding to an encapsulation yield of 244. 6 ± 74. 9 μg/mL. Conclusion: All formulations were prepared with only GRAS excipients and without class 1 and 2 solvents. Analytical method were designed and validated {{in accordance with the}} international conference on harmonization. An interesting formulation based on LNC and reverse micelle were obtained. The stability of this formulation in simulated fluids and in vitro permeability across a caco- 2 cells culture model are in progress.
