Meanwhile, Sonny is given a pardon and is free to raise Avery and Kiki decides against {{fighting}} for custody. Morgan and Kiki side with Sonny when Michael decides he wants to raise Avery believing he is only taking custody of Avery to punish Sonny. Michael wins the custody battle and banns everyone, including Kiki from visiting Avery. Furious when Michael hires Sabrina Santiago (Teresa Castillo) -- the woman who caused Ava to go into premature labor—as Avery's nanny, Kiki goes along with Morgan's plan to drug Michael {{to get him to}} act out in public so he will lose custody of Avery. Just before they go back to court, baby Avery is kidnapped. Meanwhile, Morgan and Kiki bond and rekindle their romance as she forms a connection with the mysterious Denise DeMuccio—claiming to be her mother's identical twin. As Kiki bonds with Denise, Silas is very weary of their growing connection. Kiki is devastated when she finds Silas murdered in July 2015 and believes Franco is responsible. During Franco's trial, Kiki is shocked to learn that Denise is <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> much alive Ava. Kiki is devastated when Franco suddenly admits that Ava and Morgan have been sleeping together behind her back.|$|E
500|$|Two new roles– Garrett and Castillo– {{needed to}} be filled for the production. The actors {{selected}} were both Star Trek fans. Christopher McDonald was picked for Castillo. [...] "What impressed me about [...] ", Carson remembers, [...] "was that he wasn't just your romantic leading man; he was <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> impressive actor." [...] Tricia O'Neil was cast for similar reasons; the actress was not the normal Star Trek commander type. Carson was also pleased to work with Crosby and Goldberg. The main cast enjoyed {{the opportunity to play}} their characters differently. The unusual degree of friction between characters provoked some concern with the producers. Berman, for example, was afraid that the episode was pushing the alternate timeline too far.|$|E

The threat to push b2–b4 must be taken seriously by Black, who typically answers 6...a5. But in the 1980s {{it was discovered that}} the push a7–a5 was <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> useful one for Black, as it allows the Ra8 to be developed along the sixth rank. Meanwhile, the push a2–a3 is less useful for White, as he {{will not be able to}} easily push b2–b4. As Tseitlin puts it, [...] "the point is that 6...a5 fits into the plan of attacking White's kingside, whereas 6.a3 does little in the way of defending it". Thus if White does not find a clear way to make good use of his move a2–a3, it may turn out to be a critical waste of tempo.|$|E

Makoto has a mischievous side and constantly plays pranks on Yuichi. She has an affinity towards the spring and once wished that it would stay spring forever.Translated quote: [...] "If only spring would come and stay forever." [...] Yuichi coincidentally runs into Shiori Misaka, another heroine and first-year high school student suffering from an unexplained illness since birth. Her affliction has caused her to become very physically weak, and she is almost always absent from school because of it. She tries to be strong in the face of her condition, and gets along well with others, even though she does not know very many people her age due to her condition. The fifth and final heroine in Kanon is Mai Kawasumi, a third-year student of the same high school that Yuichi attends. She has a cold attitude towards almost everyone, but despite this, she is <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> kind and caring person; she [...] "punishes" [...] someone who makes a playful joke about her by giving them a light karate chop to the head.|$|E

[...] A pre-release review from NME regarded Neighborhoods the band's best album, calling it [...] "bravely progressive" [...] and noting the dark lyricism and random experimentation. Mike Diver of BBC Music described the album as [...] "unexpectedly great," [...] and while agreeing the recording process gave some tracks a [...] "dislocated feel," [...] {{he concluded that}} [...] "Neighborhoods {{could easily have been}} a disaster – that it’s not, and <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> successful endeavour, is worthy of substantial praise." [...] Chad Grischow of IGN called Neighborhoods a [...] "startlingly great rock album" [...] in which the band [...] "hits an artistic growth spurt", summarizing it as [...] "the most mature, rewarding, and best album of their career." [...] James Montgomery of MTV News called the [...] "long-awaited, decidedly dark comeback album" [...] a new transition for the band, calling Neighborhoods a [...] "deep, dark, downright auto-biographical effort." [...] AbsolutePunk staff writer Thomas Nassiff called Neighborhoods a [...] "great record" [...] while awarding a score of nine out of ten. He noted the album's [...] "bleak and dark" [...] lyricism, while describing the album's sound as containing elements of the trio's various side-projects, as well as a natural progression from their 2003 album. Nitsuh Abebe of New York Magazine deemed the record [...] "one of those albums on which a group reunites as professionals and equals, each having gone off and collected his own interests via side projects, and then negotiates a sound that brings it all to bear: no-nonsense modern rock, serious but unpretentious, ambitious but full of the same easy hooks as ever." ...|$|E

The Fiancée broke the Billboard 200it debuted at No.169, selling 6,800 copies and was well received in the Christian and secular markets. The group played a release tour with Misery Signals, I Am Ghost, and I Hate Sally, and then made a short run on the Warped Tour in summer. Another leg of The Fiancée Tour extended into spring 2008 with LoveHateHero, Alesana, Our Last Night, and Sky Eats Airplane. The lineup underwent another drastic change in mid-2008, as Jake Ryan, Dan Eaton and Jon Terry all decided to step down.

Ammolite mined from deeper deposits may be entirely smooth or with a rippled surface. Occasionally a complete ammonite shell is recovered with its structure well-preserved: fine, convoluted lines delineate the shell chambers, and the overall shape is suggestive of a nautilus. While these shells may be as large as 90 centimeters (35.5inches) in diameter, the iridescent ammonites (as opposed to the pyritized variety) are typically much smaller. Most fossilized shells have had their aragonite pseudomorphously replaced by calcite or pyrite, making the presence of ammolite particularly uncommon.|$|E

Similarly, Morrissey biographer David Bret described the singer as being [...] "quintessentially English", while Simpson termed him a Little Englander. During the 1980s, interviewer Paul Morley stated that Morrissey [...] "sets out to be a decent man and he succeeds because that is what he is."
