5|$|It was {{too dark}} to see <b>anything,</b> <b>so</b> we carried our tent and baggage near the only house on the island, and began to cook our suppers, in order to be {{prepared}} for the earliest dawn, and to enjoy that which, from the conversation of the gentlemen we had, now raised the highest expectations of.|$|E
5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean <b>anything</b> <b>so</b> precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
25|$|I {{never saw}} <b>anything</b> <b>so</b> blatant as Meckiff's action as, with the swell {{of the crowd}} in his ears, he came up that {{afternoon}} full pelt from the bottom end towards the pavillion...the English press camp were outspoken to a degree {{and at least one}} Australian, Jack Fingleton, writing in the Sunday Times, thought Meckiff should have been called... England had a grievance, without a doubt.|$|E
60|$|I had {{no reason}} to conceal <b>anything,</b> and <b>so</b> I told her the whole affair, from the very {{beginning}} to the end.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Peter {{looked as}} if she very much doubted it, but she didn't say <b>anything,</b> and <b>so</b> Peter went on with his story.|$|R
6000|$|Anthea {{dismissed}} {{the subject with}} perfect composure. [...] "Then there {{could not have been}} <b>anything</b> like <b>so</b> much water. Jimmy helped me over." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1948, Niven met Hjördis Paulina Tersmeden (née Genberg, 1919–1997), a {{divorced}} Swedish fashion model. He recounted their meeting:I {{had never seen}} <b>anything</b> <b>so</b> beautiful in my life—tall, slim, auburn hair, up-tilted nose, lovely mouth and the most enormous grey eyes I had ever seen. It really happened {{the way it does}} when written by the worst lady novelists... I goggled. I had difficulty swallowing and had champagne in my knees.|$|E
25|$|Jacqui then {{discovers that}} Rhys and Cindy {{had an affair}} and attacks Cindy causing {{her to go to}} hospital. Jacqui then drags Cindy to Rhys's grave where she attacks her and Cindy turns to Tony for comfort. Tony refuses to help Cindy, however, and makes it clear that he is on Jacqui's side. Jacqui is about to turn herself in to the police for the attack {{although}} Tony stops her. Tony and Jacqui then begin a relationship and Tony tells Cindy that if she reports Jacqui to the police then he will make her homeless. He then files for divorce. Jacqui then discovers that Tony knew about Rhys and Cindy's affair yet did not do <b>anything</b> <b>so</b> she breaks up with him. Jacqui becomes stressed when she is told to sell illegal vodka by her criminal boss, Trudy Ryan (Danniella Westbrook) and Tony helps her by standing up to Trudy. Tony and Jacqui then get back together and they destroy the vodka although they are shocked when they see that Trudy has robbed Tony's apartment. Tony makes sure that Jacqui gets extra security in case Trudy does the same to her.|$|E
500|$|Alice was {{too much}} puzzled to say <b>{{anything}},</b> <b>so</b> after a minute Humpty Dumpty began again. [...] "They've a temper, some of them—particularly verbs, they're the proudest—adjectives {{you can do anything}} with, but not verbs—however, I can manage the whole lot! Impenetrability! That's what I say!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ugh, I {{have lived}} {{most of my}} life in Sherborne Lane, and never saw <b>anything</b> half <b>so</b> pretty in it before. Confound this finger!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Sonata was performed... {{with such}} {{unattainable}} perfection, that I {{could not have}} stayed to listen to <b>anything</b> more, <b>so</b> I left the hall completely enraptured.|$|R
6000|$|The child flung {{her arms}} about her. [...] "You're so {{beautiful}} and wonderful," [...] she said. [...] "You can do <b>anything.</b> I'm <b>so</b> glad you came." ...|$|R
500|$|Another person {{planned to}} voice a {{character}} in the film was Janeane Garofalo, who was set to star alongside Farley as Princess Fiona. However, she was fired from the project with little explanation. Years later, Garofalo stated [...] "I was never told why [...] I assume because I sound like a man sometimes? I don't know why. Nobody told me... But, you know, the movie didn't do <b>anything,</b> <b>so</b> who cares?" ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 May 1945, Derrick {{took part}} in the landing at Tarakan; an island off the coast of Borneo. Under the cover of a naval and aerial bombardment, he led his men ashore in the initial waves of the landing, where they were {{initially}} posted at the boundary of the 2/48th Battalion and 2/24th Battalion's area of responsibility. The Japanese force on the island mounted a determined resistance, and Derrick was later quoted in the Sunday Sun as saying he had [...] "never struck <b>anything</b> <b>so</b> tough as the Japanese on Tarakan".|$|E
500|$|The ships {{set sail}} for Rio de Janeiro, {{arriving}} there on 10 September when the slaves {{were transferred to}} the hulk Crescent {{under the supervision of}} Sir Thomas Paisley. [...] Paisley said that he had [...] "never witnessed <b>anything</b> <b>so</b> shocking", particularly as most of the slaves were suffering from emaciation and sores and others were infected by smallpox and had to be quarantined aboard the Vincedora. [...] The slaves included parentless children, babies and a harem of women for the brigantine's crew. [...] Although the slaves continued to die over the next month, most recovered to be set free. [...] The event was recorded in the memoirs of Sir Astley Cooper Key.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not the slightest, Percy. It must be {{across the}} river, {{or not at}} all. The sentries will not be <b>anything</b> like <b>so</b> thick, upon that side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the only}} way I can get my living," [...] said the butterfly. [...] "Nobody ever gives me <b>anything,</b> and <b>so</b> I have to take what I want." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never said}} <b>anything</b> half <b>so</b> {{sensible}} as that. Jean {{said something like}} it once, I believe, but I forgot. Are you tired of doing nothing, at last, Gerald?" ...|$|R
500|$|As {{they would}} do with all their operas, Gilbert and Sullivan made cuts and {{alterations}} after the first performance. Two days after the opening, Sullivan wrote to his mother, [...] "I have rarely seen <b>anything</b> <b>so</b> beautiful put upon the stage. The first night I had a great reception, but the music went badly, and the singer sang half a tone sharp, so that the enthusiasm of the audience did not sustain itself towards me. Last night I cut out the song, the music went very well, and consequently I had a hearty call before the curtain {{at the end of}} Act II." [...] The piece eventually settled into a respectable state, and later critics were much more enthusiastic than those on opening night.|$|E
500|$|An anime {{adaptation}} by Sunrise debuted on TV Tokyo on April 4, 2006. The first ninety-nine episodes {{were initially}} directed by Shinji Takamatsu. Episodes 100 to 105 were directed by Takamatsu and Yoichi Fujita, while the following episodes are being directed only by Fujita. The subtitle for the Gintama anime could be loosely translated as [...] "The {{starting point is}} the utmost importance for <b>anything,</b> <b>so</b> trying to outdo oneself is just about right." [...] During January 2009, Fujita mentioned {{he was not going}} to work in the fourth season of the series starting in such year. However, in February 2009, it was confirmed that the anime would continue for a fourth year, once again directed by Fujita. The series ended on March 25, 2010 with a total of 201 episodes.|$|E
500|$|On 24 December 1809, Cavendish married Granville {{with her}} aunt's blessing. Though ageing, Granville {{maintained}} his handsome appearance and Cavendish {{was said to}} have [...] " [...] high degree the charm of voice and manner which belongs to the Cavendish family". Their marriage was happy; she loved him until her death, writing in September 1810 to her sister, [...] "I really think I am happier every hour. There never was <b>anything</b> <b>so</b> adorable as he is in every way". Their eldest child, Susan, was born in October 1810 in London. The couple would go on to have four further children, and his two illegitimate issue with Henrietta also flourished in the happy household. Granville was made a Viscount in 1815; an earldom awarded in 1833 led to Harriet becoming known as Countess Granville.|$|E
6000|$|... "They often vanish {{before the}} ceremony, and {{occasionally}} during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind <b>anything</b> quite <b>so</b> prompt as this. Pray {{let me have}} the details." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, child," [...] said Mrs. Clow, {{who never}} got excited over <b>anything,</b> and <b>so</b> had missed a {{tremendous}} amount of trouble and delight in her journey through life.|$|R
60|$|But poor Maria was too {{uncomfortable and}} {{disturbed}} {{to talk of}} <b>anything</b> else, <b>so</b> she collapsed into silence, and shortly after Mr. and Mrs. Bellamy and George made their adieux.|$|R
500|$|... "I {{brought it}} up at some point because the song that the title came from was 'Dusty', but my title for it was 'Down on the Upside', but Ben wrote the music and he called it 'Dusty'. So since we don't really like having song titles being {{the title of the}} record, 'cause it brings this weird, undue focus to the song, I thought it would be cool to call it Down on the Upside. We started {{thinking}} about all these other titles, and worrying about them describing the whole record without excluding <b>anything...</b> <b>So</b> it was the last minute and we were at a photo shoot for Spin and someone called and said, 'We need your title now so we can start doing the record package,' so Matt [...] brought up the title again, and everyone went, 'yeah, that's it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The play {{opened for}} tryouts in New Haven, Connecticut on March 22, 1945. [...] The first act was well-received; {{the second act}} was not. [...] Casto {{recalled}} that the second act finished about 1:30a.m. [...] The staff immediately sat down for a two-hour conference. [...] Five scenes, half the ballet, and two songs were cut from the show as the result. [...] John Fearnley commented, [...] "Now I see why these people have hits. [...] I never witnessed <b>anything</b> <b>so</b> brisk and brave in my life." [...] De Mille said of this conference, [...] "not three minutes had been wasted pleading for something cherished. [...] Nor was there any idle joking.... We cut and cut and cut {{and then we went}} to bed." [...] By the time the company left New Haven, de Mille's ballet was down to forty minutes.|$|E
500|$|While Malkmus {{was still}} abroad, Kannberg {{moved in with}} a friend and his roommate Jason Fawkes in Sacramento, California. Fawkes and Kannberg formed a new band called Pa, with Fawkes on drums. Kannberg said, [...] "I didn't know if Pavement {{was going to do}} <b>anything</b> <b>so</b> I just said, 'Let's start another band.'" [...] The duo {{frequently}} jammed, and considered a future release on Drag City. Pa recorded a series of instrumental demos, including new songs [...] "Two States", [...] "Forklift", and [...] "Collapse", at Young's Louder Than You Think studios during a trip to Stockton. After Kannberg and Fawkes had returned to Sacramento, Malkmus visited and the group decided to turn the Pa songs into a Pavement project. Malkmus wrote lyrics to [...] "Forklift" [...] and presented the band with [...] "two or three other songs" [...] he had previously written.|$|E
60|$|Seth {{knew that}} Adam always meant what he said, {{and was not}} to be persuaded into meaning <b>anything</b> else. <b>So</b> he turned, with rather a heavy heart, into the house-place.|$|R
60|$|Harris {{received}} a shock, too; but I {{do not think}} Harris’s shock could have been <b>anything</b> like <b>so</b> bad as the shock that George and I had over the business.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'd be the last, Pathfinder, to {{recommend}} <b>anything</b> against <b>so</b> brave a resolution, did I see {{the means of}} maintaining it. But ye'll remember that Master Cap has fallen." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Her Majesty" [...] was {{recorded}} by McCartney on 2 July {{when he arrived}} {{before the rest of}} the group at Abbey Road. It was included in a rough mix of the side two medley, appearing between [...] "Mean Mr. Mustard" [...] and [...] "Polythene Pam". McCartney disliked the way the medley sounded when it included [...] "Her Majesty", so he asked for it to be cut. The second engineer, John Kurlander, had been instructed not to throw out <b>anything,</b> <b>so</b> after McCartney left, he attached the track to the end of the master tape after 20seconds of silence. The tape box bore an instruction to leave [...] "Her Majesty" [...] off the final product, but the next day when mastering engineer Malcolm Davies received the tape, he (also trained not to throw anything away) cut a playback lacquer of the whole sequence, including [...] "Her Majesty". The Beatles liked this effect and included it on the album.|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Betsey Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times panned the [...] "overwhelmingly complicated, globe-hopping, enemies within, enemies without story line" [...] and 3D but noted that [...] "the humor, when it works, offers 'Retaliation' some redemption." [...] She ended with: [...] "It's convoluted. Frankly {{no one should}} {{have to think that}} hard {{to keep up with the}} Joes." [...] Another negative review came from Variety Magazines Justin Chang, who ridiculed the movie's large-scale destruction of foreign cities, writing: [...] "Audiences who thrilled to the sight of Paris under biochemical attack in Cobra will be pleased to watch London endure an even more horrific fate here, although the sequence is tossed off in quick, almost ho-hum fashion, with no time to dwell on <b>anything</b> <b>so</b> exquisitely crass as the spectacle of the Eiffel Tower collapsing." [...] He summarized the movie as [...] "a more straight-faced brand of idiocy than its cheerfully dumb 2009 predecessor." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1962 A Child of Our Time [...] {{received}} its Israel premiere in Tel Aviv. Tippett {{says that this}} performance was delayed because {{for a while there}} were local objections to the word [...] "Jesus" [...] in the text. When it came about, among the audience was Herschel Grynszpan's [...] father who, Tippett wrote, was [...] "manifestly touched by the work his son's precipitate action 25 years earlier had inspired." [...] The performance, by the Kol Yisrael Orchestra with the Tel Aviv Chamber Choir, was acclaimed by the audience of 3000, but received mixed reviews from the press. The Times report noted contrasting opinions from [...] two leading Israeli newspapers. The correspondent for Haaretz had expressed disappointment: [...] "Every tone is unoriginal, and the work repeats old effects in a most conventional manner". Conversely, according to the Times report, HaBokers critic had [...] "found that the composition had moved everyone to the depths of his soul ... no Jewish composer had ever written <b>anything</b> <b>so</b> sublime on the theme of the Holocaust." ...|$|E
25|$|Many {{names have}} been {{published}} in Cynomorium, but there are probably only two species. It is not closely related to <b>anything</b> else, <b>so</b> it is placed in the monogeneric family Cynomoriaceae.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not really}} hiding from the police, but {{from people who}} have better grounds for fearing them. I owe nobody <b>anything</b> and, <b>so</b> far as I know, have done nobody wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{last few}} weeks," [...] she answered, [...] "have {{been enough to}} change me toward any one. All the same, I wasn't {{conscious}} of <b>anything</b> particular <b>so</b> far as you are concerned." ...|$|R
