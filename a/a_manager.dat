40|$|In this paper, we are {{interested}} in the informational value of Major League Baseball (MLB) managerial compensation on a team’s performance. Using data on manager’s contracts, team performance, and team and manager characteristics, first, we determine the variables that influence <b>a</b> <b>manager's</b> salary. Then, we use a forecasting-type analysis to study the determinants of <b>a</b> <b>manager’s</b> performance, measured by winning percentage, attendance or playoff appearances. We find that <b>a</b> <b>manager's</b> past performance affects his current salary, but his current salary does not affect the team's performance. Our results support the lack of a competitive and efficient market for MLB managers. ...|$|R
