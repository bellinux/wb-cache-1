500|$|On December 21, 2008, LenDale White and Keith Bulluck of the Tennessee Titans {{stepped on}} a Terrible Towel after the Titans's 31–14 victory. Pittsburgh's Larry Foote responded, [...] "They {{deserved}} to do that, they whooped us, they deserve to celebrate and, hopefully, we'll see them again." [...] While Hines Ward said, [...] " [...] did kind {{of the same thing}} <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> where they went." [...] Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher, by this point working for CBS as an analyst on The NFL Today, mentioned on the program that such antics can come back to haunt teams. Tennessee was the top seed in the playoffs, however following the incident the Titans proceeded to lose eight consecutive games, including an '08 divisional playoff game and their '09 Week 1 game against the Steelers, 13-10. After the Titans' 8th consecutive loss—a 59-0 blowout to the New England Patriots, the Titans worst loss ever—Titans coach Jeff Fisher expressed regret for his team's behavior towards the Towel, and a number of Titans players autographed a Terrible Towel and mailed it to Allegheny Valley School – the Pittsburgh charity that now owns the trademark. The Titans won their next 5 games.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Want You" [...] was {{directed}} by Dave Meyers, who previously directed Jackson's music videos for [...] "All for You" [...] and [...] "Just a Little While". It debuted on March 16, 2004, on BET's Access Granted. Intended to resemble Brooklyn, New York, the video was shot in Los Angeles. It portrays Jackson traveling through the city at night to meet her boyfriend, interacting with the various people she encounters along the way. Jackson commented that the video was simple, {{and there was not}} a major production for wardrobe, hair and makeup. Explaining its concept, she stated [...] "I'm coming out of my apartment building and walking down the street, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> all the goings-on in the neighborhood." [...] Jackson praised Meyers as a director, saying [...] "I think he's a wonderful director and he's a good friend, we've been friends since the [...] "All for You" [...] video. He has a great eye." [...] Hollywood casting agents sought a wide variety of extras, ranging from teenage delinquents to mothers picking up her babies and children from day care, and other people commuting by bus to and from work. The video was desired to have an intimate [...] "community" [...] feel. Meyers stated: ...|$|E
500|$|For the film's look, the Coens {{wanted to}} avoid the usual retro 1960s clichés like lava lamps, Day-Glo posters, and Grateful Dead music and {{for it to be}} [...] "consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy", Joel said in an interview. For example, the star motif {{featured}} predominantly throughout the film, started with the film's production designer Richard Heinrichs' design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he [...] "came {{up with the idea of}} just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star thing on the interior". This carried over to the film's dream sequences. [...] "Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars", remembers Heinrichs. For Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn's beach party to be Inca-themed, with a [...] "very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So there's a very sacrificial quality to it." ...|$|E

500|$|The younger alternate-timeline Spock. Quinto {{expressed}} interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how [...] "he is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. I think those are all things {{that we as a}} society, and certainly the world, could implement." [...] He mentioned he heard about the new film and revealed his interest in the role in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; the article was widely circulated and he attracted Abrams' interest. For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at those pictures <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film." [...] Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.|$|E
500|$|Another {{challenge}} that the studio {{had to face}} was to deliver shots of heavy and deep snow that both interacted believably with characters and had a realistic sticky quality. According to principal software engineer Andrew Selle, [...] "'s not really a fluid. It’s not really a solid. It breaks apart. It can be compressed into snowballs. All of these different effects {{are very difficult to}} capture simultaneously." [...] In order to achieve this, software engineers used advanced mathematics (the material point method) and physics, with assistance from mathematics researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles to create a snow simulator software application called Matterhorn. The tool was capable of depicting realistic snow in a virtual environment and was used in at least 43 scenes in the film, including several key sequences. Software engineer Alexey Stomakhin referred to snow as [...] "an important character in the film," [...] therefore it attracted special attention from the filmmakers. [...] "When you stretch it, snow will break into chunks. Since snow doesn't have any connections, it doesn't have a mesh, it can break very easily. So that was an important property we took advantage of," [...] explained Selle. [...] "There you see [...] walking through and see his footprints breaking the snow into little pieces and chunk up <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> [...] being pulled out and the snow having packed together and broken into pieces. It's very organic how that happens. You don't see that they're pieces already– you see the snow as one thing and then breaking up." [...] The tool also proved to be particularly useful in scenes involving characters walking through deep snow, as it ensured that the snow reacted naturally to each step.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes <b>and</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E
