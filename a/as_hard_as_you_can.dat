500|$|After Robinson's hire as manager, Doby {{returned}} {{to work for the}} Expos. In 1976, Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team's batting coach. As a team, the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a [...]255 batting average, 586 runs scored and 73 home runs. By June 29, 1977, the team's average was [...]284, and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs. They finished the season second in team batting average (to the Yankees and Red Sox, each with a [...]281 average) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs scored as a team. After firing the White Sox's manager and former Doby teammate Bob Lemon, Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30, 1978. At age 53, Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson. [...] "It's so nice to work for a man like Bill Veeck. You just work <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and if the opportunity arises, you will certainly get the opportunity to fulfill your dreams", Doby said after being named White Sox manager.|$|E

6000|$|... "Besides, you {{can drive}} {{one of those big}} Siwash craft <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> this sloop; that is, so long as you keep the sea astern of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can," [...] said O'Hara to Trevor, as {{they faced}} one another, [...] "and hit <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like. It won't be any {{practice}} if you don't. I sha'n't mind being hit. It'll do me good for Aldershot. See?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Harry!" [...] the lad said cheerfully; [...] "hit me <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like, {{under the}} {{circumstances}} I feel that I cannot kick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get into my sleigh, {{and drive}} to Harper's <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can!" [...] he said. [...] "Curtis was there when I passed; bring him here at once!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want {{to watch}} that ranch," [...] he said. [...] "But I'd like one of you to ride to town <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> and take a message for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Row, Tony, <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can!</b> The launch {{has just}} passed that ship, and has changed her course. I expect the captain has called their {{attention}} to us. It's a race now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{board at}} the bow, Mr. Glover, I will make for her quarter. Now, lay out, lads, <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> the sooner you are there the less chance you have of being hit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then row <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can," [...] replied Captain Langless. He was at {{one pair}} of oars while Arnold Baxter was at another. Dan sat in the bow.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will go back}} {{further than}} that, if you {{continue}} to annoy me. It shall be nothing but plain 'sir,' <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please. <b>You</b> might <b>as</b> well let go my hand; you know that I do not take it away violently, because of your wound." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then supposing you leg it for camp just <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can," [...] {{continued}} the explorer. [...] "Tell the Esquimaux and Mr. Camdal {{to come as}} quickly as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then do {{your worst}} now, good Lord Scroope, [...] "And deal your blows <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can!</b> [...] "It shall be tried, within an hour, [...] "Which of us two {{is the better}} man." ...|$|E
60|$|LEVER. [Stepping up to JOY, and {{standing}} with his hands behind him-- in a low voice.] Now {{hit me in the}} face--hit me--hit me <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> Go on, Joy, it'll do you good.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Percy," [...] Ralph said, as cheerily as he could; {{though he}} felt, himself, that the intense cold was rapidly {{overcoming}} his strength. [...] "Keep up your heart. Strike <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> The more you exert yourself, the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There,' said Squeers, when he {{had quite}} done; 'rub away <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like, you won't rub that off in a hurry. Oh! you won't hold that noise, won't you? Put him out, Smike.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't prevent you, my dear fellow--only {{remember}} this: I {{will not}} permit you to assert, without contradicting you, that I am responsible for Clem's fortune. Now, go on, and explain away <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} no reason for complaint, that way, in the future, Aggie, I promise you. But how could I tell? The last time I saw <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> were flirting, <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> could, with someone else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a squall coming up, Mr. Bingham," [...] she said; [...] "you must paddle <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> I do {{not think}} we are more than two miles from Bryngelly, {{and if we are}} lucky we may get there before the weather breaks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, lads, we must retreat," [...] the {{lieutenant}} said. [...] "We have done very well. Now, across the village, {{and then make}} for the forest <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> It's not over five hundred yards. When you are once there, make a stand again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Arthur, you {{run down}} to the town <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> and tell the first officer you meet {{we have got a}} gang of plunderers here, and ask him to bring up a guard and capture them; we will stand sentry till you come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{you must}} be careful," [...] Mr. Purfleet said, [...] "because if it should get out, the {{consequences}} might be terrible. Now, then, four of you take the sticks, and all hit together, <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can--now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{let me stop}} you." [...] I was impudently suave. [...] "Kick <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please, and I'll {{still have}} enough face left with which to smile. In the meantime, while you are hesitating, suppose you accept my {{original}} proposition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, Polly Ann," [...] he answered; delighted at her raillery. [...] "But I've {{a word to}} say to you. If we come on to the redskins, you and Davy {{make for}} the cane <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> kin kilter. Keep out of sight." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{you see a}} bacilli, {{walk right}} up to it, and look it in the eye. If one flies into your room, strike at it with your hat or with a towel. Hit it <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> between the neck and the thorax. It will soon get sick of that.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he hurried}} back to the stables, and the horse said to him: 'There is one thing more you must do. In the cupboad {{you will find a}} looking-glass, a brush and a riding-whip.

6000|$|JOHNNY. All right, my lad, all right. Sling your mud <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please: it wont {{stick to}} me. What I {{want to know}} is this. How is it that your father, who I suppose is the strongest man England has {{produced}} in our time-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{if it is}} only to make Ned jealous, then I {{have nothing}} more to say: <b>you</b> may flirt away <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please. There's {{a knock at the}} door, just in time to prevent us from quarrelling. I know whose knock it is, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes, jest now; for there's nothin' else we can do. 'Cordin' to {{my way of}} thinkin', we've got to keep on workin' an' waitin' {{till the}} chance comes. Then we'll lay inter Skip <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like; but I don't see the sense of whinin' yet awhile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must ride {{straight}} forward," [...] he said; [...] "there is {{no other}} way out of it. There is level ground enough for a horse to pass round the left of the wagons. Ride for that point <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and when you are through keep straight forward for {{a quarter of a mile}} till we are together again. Now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have heard}} of me, I see. I will {{represent}} the official police until their arrival. Here, you!" [...] he shouted to a frightened groom, who had appeared {{at the edge of}} the glade. [...] "Come here. Take this note <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> ride to Farnham."

6000|$|... "All well," [...] Peter shouted back, {{waving his}} hand, and without further word the canoe passed on. [...] "There! {{do you hear}} that?" [...] Peter exclaimed. [...] "They're firing shots from the canoes to call their attention. The chances are they won't hear them, for the rattle of their oars and the talking and the row they're making are enough to drown {{the sound of a}} cannon. Now put it on again <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> Another hour will take us to the landing place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take it easy, lads, take it easy," [...] {{the colonel}} said, {{as he walked}} up and down the ranks. [...] "They are hardly in range yet, and you had better keep your {{ammunition}} until they get {{to the foot of the}} hill, then <b>you</b> can blaze away <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Be careful, men; paddle quietly {{until we}} are well beyond the rocks. Keep a sharp look out forward.” Another gun was fired from the ship as he spoke. “Steady, men, steady!” he said; “you can row <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like when we get outside, but it is of no use {{knocking}} a hole in her to start with.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've got as {{much out}} of it <b>as</b> I have. <b>You</b> talk about your gom' back. Ain't I been wantin' to go back myself? And ain't I kep' still 'cause I see it wa'n't no use?
