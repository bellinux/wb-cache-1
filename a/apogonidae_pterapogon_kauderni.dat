40|$|Understanding {{the reasons}} behind stable group {{formations}} has received considerable theoretical and empirical attention. Stable groups displaying homing behavior have been suggested to form as a result of, for instance, benefits from knowledge of the social or physical environment or through kin selection and the forming of kin groups. However, no one has disentangled preference for grouping in a familiar location from preference for grouping with familiar or related individuals. To investigate this, we {{conducted a series of}} field experiments and a group genetic analysis on the group-living Banggai cardinalfish (<b>Pterapogon</b> <b>kauderni).</b> We found homing behavior but no evidence for recognition of familiar group members. Instead, homing was based on the original location of their group rather than the individuals in that group. Moreover, we found no evidence for kin structures within these groups. We suggest that benefits from living in a known social environment drive homing behavior in this species and that homing behavior is not enough for the formation of kin group structures. Instead, our results suggest that kin recognition may be a prerequisite for the forming of kin groups. Copyright 2005. dispersal; group stability; kin selection; microsatellites; territory...|$|R
40|$|The unique endemic Banggai {{cardinalfish}} (<b>Pterapogon</b> <b>kauderni)</b> (BCF) {{is still}} {{among the top}} 10 imported species of marine aquarium fish in the US. The fish has been classified as an endangeredspecies due to concerns over its collection for the aquarium trade. The fish was only re-discovered in 1995, and only limited studies have been undertaken in the field. In an effort to complement thesestudies, surveys on the the distribution, population density, and current levels of trade of the BCF wereconducted from 2007 to 2012. Using the belt transect method, three classes of BCF (recruits, juveniles,and adults) encountered along each transect were counted, as well as BCF habitats including soft corals,hard corals, sea grasses, sea urchins and anemones. Some areas were surveyed more than once, andshowed a decline in population densities. The causes of these declines were most likely due tooverexploitation, habitat destruction and extensive removal of microhabitats and species for humanconsumption. A number of measures {{have been taken to}} prevent BCF populations from further declines,to ensure that they are being collected in a more sustainable manner. However, control and enforcementof these measures are still lacking in the field. An initiative to include the BCF in the protected species listunder Indonesian law has not yet been realized. There is a call for the aquarium industry to activelysupport the work in Indonesia by promoting and supporting the purchase of BCF from sustainablecollection areas and methods only...|$|R
40|$|Female {{reproductive}} {{decisions have}} been suggested to be highly influenced by mate quality. I have studied whether offspring quality may be adjusted by females to match the attractiveness of males and how strong control females have over their reproductive investment focusing on egg size. This {{was done in the}} Banggai cardinalfish (<b>Pterapogon</b> <b>kauderni),</b> a sex-role reversed obligate paternal mouthbrooder where males invest heavily into reproduction. As this species is suitable for both laboratory experiments and field studies it is an ideal candidate for the study of reproductive investment. Mating was size-assortative and both males and females benefited from pairing with large partners. However, male size determined the reproductive output of a pair. Females courted large males more intensively and produced larger, but not fewer eggs when mated to large males as compared to small males. Further, this matching of egg size to mate attractiveness may be fast. Female courtship behaviours contained honest information regarding both clutch weight and egg maturity, traits that may be highly important for male mate choice. Surprisingly, males played an important part in territory defence suggesting relatively equal sex-roles in this species. Also, this species showed stable group structures which may be important for the evolution of female plasticity in reproductive investment due to high variance in quality of available mates. This thesis suggest that females have a remarkable control over their reproductive investments and that male quality may be highly influential on reproductive decisions regarding offspring quality. Furthermore, it suggest that sexual selection may have strong effects on the evolution of egg size and parental care on a whole...|$|R

40|$|The {{trade of}} live marine animals for home and public aquaria {{has grown into}} a major global industry. Millions of marine fishes and {{invertebrates}} are removed from coral reefs and associated habitats each year. The majority are imported into the United States, with the remainder sent to Europe, Japan, {{and a handful of other}} countries. Despite the recent growth and diversification of the aquarium trade, to date, data collection is not mandatory, and hence comprehensive information on species volume and diversity is lacking. This lack of information makes it impossible to study trade pathways. Without species-specific volume and diversity data, it is unclear how importing and exporting governments can oversee this industry effectively or how sustainability should be encouraged. To expand our knowledge and understanding of the trade, and to effectively communicate this new understanding, we introduce the publically-available Marine Aquarium Biodiversity and Trade Flow online database ([URL] This tool was created to communicate the volume and diversity of marine fishes and/or invertebrates imported into the US over three complete years (2008, 2009, and 2011) and three partial years (2000, 2004, 2005). To create this tool, invoices pertaining to shipments of live marine fishes and invertebrates were scanned and analyzed for species name, species quantities, country of origin, port of entry, and city of import destination. Here we focus on the analysis of the later three years of data and also produce an estimate for the entirety of 2000, 2004, and 2005. The three-year aggregate totals (2008, 2009, 2011) indicate that just under 2, 300 fish and 725 invertebrate species were imported into the US cumulatively, although just under 1, 800 fish and 550 invertebrate species were traded annually. Overall, the total number of live marine animals decreased between 2008 and 2011. In 2008, 2009, and 2011, the total number of individual fish (8. 2, 7. 3, and 6. 9 million individuals) and invertebrates (4. 2, 3. 7, and 3. 6 million individuals) assessed by analyzing the invoice data are roughly 60 % of the total volumes recorded through the Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) dataset. Using these complete years, we back-calculated the number of individuals of both fishes and invertebrates imported in 2000, 2004, and 2005. These estimates (9. 3, 10. 8, and 11. 2 million individual fish per year) were consistent with the three years of complete data. We also use these data to understand the global trade in two species (Banggai cardinalfish, <b>Pterapogon</b> <b>kauderni,</b> and orange clownfish, Amphiprion ocellaris / percula) recently considered for Endangered Species Act listing. Aquariumtradedata. org can help create more effective management plans for the traded species, and ideally could be implemented at key trade ports to better assess the global trade of aquatic wildlife...|$|R
