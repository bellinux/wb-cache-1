5|$|There were {{initially}} no other major controversies for Dunstan, although the economy remained {{poor and the}} Redcliff complex was still in limbo as an agreement with Dow was still to be finalised. The financial difficulties forced <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> public sector expansion and hospital developments, and there were claims of theft and mismanagement in the health system, but the Liberals were in a disorganised state and unpopular, so {{they were not able}} to pressure Dunstan effectively.|$|E
5|$|German {{successes in}} Europe {{encouraged}} Japan to increase pressure on European governments in Southeast Asia. The Dutch government {{agreed to provide}} Japan some oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies, but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941. In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, United Kingdom and other Western governments reacted to this move with <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> Japanese assets and a total oil embargo. At the same time, Japan was planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East, intending to capitalize off the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late on November15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later. By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico. After Lenny made its closest {{approach to the}} island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office. Based on the coverage, the public was well informed of the hurricane's threat to the island. Before the storm {{and as a result}} of its impact, around 4,700people evacuated to 191shelters. This included 1,190residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27schools, as well as 584people in western Puerto Rico. Officials closed all schools, banned the sale of alcohol, and ordered <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> the price of emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated six medical assistance teams, three medical support teams, and two advance medical assessment units. The agency stored five days' worth of food in schools in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Before the hurricane's arrival, U.S. Virgin Islands governor Charles Wesley Turnbull declared a state of emergency. In St. Croix, 309people rode out the storm in shelters. Officials opened eight shelters in the British Virgin Islands. There, airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} of the Cruzado Plan was to eliminate inflation with a dramatic blow. Between 1980 and 1985, {{the rise in the}} CPI had escalated from 86.3% to 248.5% annually. Early in 1986, the situation became desperate, prodding the implementation of the plan. Its main measures were a general price freeze, a wage readjustment and freeze, readjustment and freeze on rents and mortgage payments, a ban on indexation, and <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> the exchange rate.|$|E
25|$|On {{her first}} rock, Jennifer Jones draws to the button behind cover to sit one. In {{an attempt to}} force Jones to a sole point, Amber Holland {{attempts}} <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> to the shot rock to narrow the scoring area. However, her stone corner freezes to shot rock, leaving it open, and giving Jones an intricate shot for two or three. Jones hits the Saskatchewan stone at the wrong angle, and only takes the one.|$|E

25|$|Leading up to, {{and during}} the same time period as the {{proposed}} merger with David Jones, slow economic growth in the company resulted in significant cut backs at Myer's Head Office base of operations. Staff of approximately 800, were sliced down to approximately 700, in order to consolidate the business. Further reductions in team member investment also resulted in <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> all employee salary increases of Myer Head Office for over two years, including entry-level employees, whose salaries slipped well behind industry average. The business went through a period where staff who resigned were not being replaced.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{government}} initially reacted {{favorably to}} the Cuban revolution, {{seeing it as}} part of a movement to bring democracy to Latin America. Castro's legalization of the Communist party and the hundreds of executions that followed caused a deterioration in {{the relationship between the two}} countries. The promulgation of the Agrarian Reform Law, expropriating thousands of acres of farmland (including from large U.S. landholders), further worsened relations. In response, between 1960 and 1964 the U.S imposed a range of sanctions, eventually including a total ban on trade between the countries and <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> all Cuban-owned assets in the U.S. In February 1960, Castro signed a commercial agreement with Soviet Vice-Premier Anastas Mikoyan.|$|E
25|$|In February 1974, {{four days}} of serious riots in Addis Ababa against a sudden {{economic}} inflation left five dead. The emperor responded by announcing on national television a reduction in petrol prices and <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> the cost of basic commodities. This calmed the public, but the promised 33% military wage hike was not substantial enough to pacify the army, which then mutinied, beginning in Asmara and spreading throughout the empire. This mutiny led to the resignation of Prime Minister Aklilu Habte-Wold on 27 February 1974. Haile Selassie again went on television {{to agree to the}} army's demands for still greater pay, and named Endelkachew Makonnen as his new Prime Minister. Despite Endalkatchew's many concessions, discontent continued in March with a four-day general strike that paralyzed the nation.|$|E

25|$|Charlie Company was {{the only}} {{complete}} company at Mary Ann due to operations south and east of the FSB near a location called Landing Zone (LZ) Mildred. Companies A and B, 1-46th Inf, {{were on the ground}} in that area of operations, and some of the artillery previously located at Mary Ann had been moved to LZ Mildred to support operations there (including the 81mm mortars assigned to both companies and the heavy 4.2-inch mortars normally part of Company E). Prior to the attack, the attention of the Battalion commander (LtCol Doyle) was focused more on operations near LZ Mildred. In fact, the Battalion command post was scheduled to move there on 28 March. This impending move led to <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> all new construction at Mary Ann, including fencing to block the roads leading out of the FSB.|$|E
25|$|When {{the station}} {{commenced}} its full schedule on September 18, KBTV had broadcast for only {{four hours of}} programming per day. It originally operated as a primary affiliate of the DuMont Television Network and a secondary affiliate of the short-lived Paramount Television Network; under the arrangement, through an agreement between Lacy-Potter and Paramount Pictures, the station agreed to air 4.75 hours of Paramount Television's programming each week during 1949. KBTV, NBC affiliate WBAP-TV and CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (channel 4, now Fox owned-and-operated station KDFW) – the latter of which was also licensed to Dallas and signed on three months later on December 3 – {{would be the only}} television stations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to sign on for the next six years as the FCC had instituted <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> new applications for television station licenses in November 1948, a moratorium that would last for four years.|$|E
25|$|Hanson {{was widely}} accused {{of trying to}} take Australia {{back to the days of}} the White Australia Policy, {{particularly}} through reference to Arthur Calwell, one of the policy's strongest supporters. In her maiden address to the Australian Parliament following the 1996 election, Hanson said:I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.Hanson's remarks generated wide interest in the media both nationally and internationally, but she herself did not retain her seat in Parliament at the 1998 election or subsequent 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Hanson also failed to win election in the 2003 and 2011 New South Wales state elections. In May 2007, Hanson, with her new Pauline's United Australia Party, continued her call for <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> immigration, arguing that African migrants carried disease into Australia.|$|E

25|$|Libya’s {{isolation}} {{became even}} more pronounced following the 1992 imposition of United Nations sanctions designed to force Gaddafi to hand over two suspects indicted for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The sanctions, imposed on 31 March 1992, initially banned sales of equipment for refining and transporting oil, but excluded oil production equipment. Sanctions were expanded on 11 November 1993, to include <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> Libya's overseas assets, excluding revenue from oil, natural gas, or agricultural products. Under these condition, NOC Chairman Abdallah al-Badri emphasized reducing new projects and upgrading domestic facilities. Joint ventures were initiated with Veba, Petrofina, North African Petroleum, the Petroleum Development Co. (Republic of Korea) and Lasmo. Foreign operators were encouraged to produce exclusively for export, limited to national oil companies with pre-sanctions equity in Libya. This policy {{was an attempt to}} contain the amount of crude offered on the spot market through third-party traders, and increase downstream investment. In 2000, NOC was reorganized by the General People's Congress after the Ministry of Energy was abolished, further consolidating control over the sector.|$|E
25|$|Funds for {{clearing}} Marshall Heights were deleted {{from the}} 1948 housing bill by the United States House of Representatives after protests by Marshall Heights residents and by John Ihlder, {{executive director of}} the National Capital Housing Authority. In 1949, President Harry S. Truman proposed spending $2 million to purchase land and raze all structures in Marshall Heights. The NCPC reported that just 30 percent of the homes in Marshall Heights had running water and sewer service, and that 86 percent of the homes in the neighborhood were so substandard that they should be razed. The agency proposed building 350 detached houses and 950 semi-detached houses, which would triple the number of people living in Marshall Heights to 6,000. Marshall Heights residents opposed the plan, arguing that they would be unable to afford the new homes being built for them. In early May, city officials approved the NCPC's redevelopment plan. In an attempt to support the redevelopment initiative, on May 17, 1949, the NCPC and the city both imposed <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> construction permits for the Marshall Heights area. No new construction, major improvements, or even repairs could be made by private or public entities to any structure in the neighborhood. Marshall Heights residents were outraged, and lobbied Congress {{for an end to the}} redevelopment program. On June 23, the House Appropriations Committee stripped money for the project from the housing bill. The Senate supported the House two weeks later. Marshall Heights residents had won their battle.|$|E
500|$|Khan's {{manifesto}} launch {{came early}} in the official campaign period, on 9 March. Focusing on housing, Khan promised for database of landlords who had been prosecuted for housing-related offences, {{as well as the}} creation of a Mayor-controlled non-for-profit letting agency. He pledged <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> rail fares [...] and a series of measures to tackle gender inequality, focusing on domestic and sexual violence, the gender wage gap and the cost of childcare. In early April, Berry and Pidgeon both released their manifestos, with both focused on housing. Goldsmith's manifesto {{was one of the last}} to be released, on 12 April. He focused on the economy, promising that his house and infrastructure building policies would help create 500,000 jobs. He also promised <b>a</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> mayoral council tax and increased police numbers. Green issues were also a core part of his agenda, [...] with new traffic regulations to encourage cleaner vehicles and the creation of new pocket parks.|$|E
