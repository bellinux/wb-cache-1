5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} prey for larger sharks, {{such as the}} silvertip shark. At Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia, great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) feed opportunistically on grey reef sharks that are {{exhausted}} from pursuing mates. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Huffmanela lata and several copepod species that <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> the sharks' skin, and juvenile stages of the isopods Gnathia trimaculata and G. grandilaris that <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> the gill filaments and septa (the dividers between each gill).|$|E
5|$|The {{semicircular canals}} are contracted, {{and they are}} highly curved. The semicircular system of MCCM-HUE-8741 shows also a basal morphology, because the semicircular canals do not <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> each other.|$|E
5|$|The spores are cylindrical, smooth, and hyaline (translucent), with {{dimensions}} of 3–4 by 1–2µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical, with {{dimensions of}} 20–25 by 3–4µm. They have eight sterigmata (slender extensions that <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> the spores), {{as well as}} a clamp at their base.|$|E

25|$|The {{mesentery}} becomes <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> {{the colon}} at the gastrointestinal margin and continues as the several mesenteries of the mesocolon, sometimes collectively called the mesenteric organ. The {{parts of the}} mesocolon take their names from {{the part of the}} colon <b>to</b> which they <b>attach.</b> These are the transverse mesocolon <b>attaching</b> <b>to</b> the transverse colon, the sigmoid mesocolon <b>attaching</b> <b>to</b> the sigmoid colon, the mesoappendix <b>attaching</b> <b>to</b> the appendix, and the mesorectum <b>attaching</b> <b>to</b> the upper third of the rectum.|$|R
5|$|Antibodies can {{continue}} {{to be an effective}} defence mechanism even after viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell. A protein that is in cells, called TRIM21, can <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> the antibodies {{on the surface of the}} virus particle. This primes the subsequent destruction of the virus by the enzymes of the cell's proteosome system.|$|E
5|$|Females vacate {{the nest}} after spawning, leaving the male behind {{to protect the}} eggs during the eight to ten days of incubation. A nest may contain 2,000 to 5,000 eggs, {{possibly}} more. Fecundity is usually related to size of the fish, so it isn't unusual for the roe of a large gravid female to contain over 55,000 eggs. Bowfin eggs are adhesive, and will <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> aquatic vegetation, roots, gravel, and sand. After hatching, larval bowfin do not swim actively in search of food. During the seven to nine days required for yolk-sac absorption, they <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> vegetation {{by means of an}} adhesive organ on their snout, and remain protected by the parent male bowfin. Bowfin aggressively protect their spawn from the first day of incubation to a month or so after the eggs have hatched. When the fry are able to swim and forage on their own, they will form a school and leave the nest accompanied by the parent male bowfin who slowly circles them to prevent separation.|$|E
5|$|In some colonial polyps, a chitinous {{periderm}} gives {{support and}} some protection to the connecting sections {{and to the}} lower parts of individual polyps. Stony corals secrete massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with sediment particles.|$|E

5|$|Many viruses, {{including}} HIV {{which needs}} CD4 and CXCR4, need a receptor to <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> and enter into host cells. The host prion, PrPc {{may be a}} receptor protein for an as yet undiscovered TSE virus, explaining why animals lacking host prion do not become infected with experimental prion disease.|$|E
5|$|Physically, some insects {{move their}} flight muscles {{directly}}, others indirectly. In insects with direct flight, the wing muscles directly {{attached to the}} wing base, so that a small downward movement of the wing base lifts the wing itself upward. Those insects with indirect flight have muscles that <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> and deform the thorax, causing the wings to move as well.|$|E
5|$|Reversible inhibitors <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> enzymes with non-covalent {{interactions}} such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic {{interactions and}} ionic bonds. Multiple weak bonds between the inhibitor and the active site combine to produce strong and specific binding. In contrast to substrates and irreversible inhibitors, reversible inhibitors {{generally do not}} undergo chemical reactions when bound to the enzyme and can be easily removed by dilution or dialysis.|$|E

5|$|The {{bacteria}} that cause urinary tract infections typically enter the bladder via the urethra. However, infection may also occur via the blood or lymph. It {{is believed that}} the bacteria are usually transmitted to the urethra from the bowel, with females at greater risk due to their anatomy. After gaining entry to the bladder, E. Coli are able to <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> the bladder wall and form a biofilm that resists the body's immune response.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{other members}} of this phylum, {{anthozoans}} {{do not have a}} medusa stage in their development. Instead, they release sperm and eggs into the water. After fertilisation, the planula larvae form part of the plankton. When fully developed, the larvae settle on the seabed and <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> the substrate, undergoing metamorphosis into polyps. Some anthozoans can also reproduce asexually through budding or by breaking in pieces. More than 6,100 species have been described.|$|E
5|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> plant {{cells and}} infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid {{is one of the}} main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation of genetically modified crops.|$|E
5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm. They are inamyloid, {{meaning that they}} will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> the spores) are 3–4µm long, and clamps are not found on the bases of basidia.|$|E

5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E
5|$|Ixodid ticks require three hosts, {{and their}} life cycle {{takes at least}} one year to complete. Up to 3,000 eggs are laid on the ground by an adult female tick. When the larvae emerge, they feed {{primarily}} on small mammals and birds. After feeding, they detach from their host and molt to nymphs on the ground, which then feed on larger hosts and molt to adults. Female adults <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> larger hosts, feed, and lay eggs, while males feed very little and occupy larger hosts primarily for mating.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E
