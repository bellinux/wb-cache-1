25|$|John Dean {{believed}} that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman {{could go to}} the prosecutors, tell the truth, and save the presidency. Dean wanted to protect the president and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president’s depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean felt that he was being recorded. He wondered if this was due to the way Nixon was speaking, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to prod attendees’ recollections of earlier conversations about fundraising. Dean mentioned this observation while testifying to the Senate Committee on Watergate, exposing the thread of what were taped conversations that would unravel the fabric of the conspiracy.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked for}} a minute <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to {{anticipate}} that day by the exercise of his reason.|$|E
60|$|Bream Mortimer looked embarrassed. He wriggled {{a little}} and moved his arms <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to flap them.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} the back of the seat, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{addressing}} himself to that; and softly played upon it with his hands, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> striking chords upon a dumb piano.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Grewgious {{said all}} this, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> reading it aloud; or, still more, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> repeating a lesson. So expressionless of any {{approach}} to spontaneity were {{his face and}} manner.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me, and his eyelids hung heavy {{over his eyes}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> drinking, or <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> tired.|$|R
60|$|Her {{companion}} sat {{looking at}} her with a gloomy stare, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to make up the deficiencies in her logic.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her; first <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to remember, then {{as if he}} might have been trying to forget. [...] "Nothing, I think--at that place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t {{altogether}} {{like that}} man’s movements, sir. He crawls about <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> {{to put away}} {{as much time as}} possible. The boy, too, has disappeared.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> smiled, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{laughing}} at her silently. She flushed.|$|R
60|$|I think, now, how odd it was, but how wonderfully like Mr. Micawber, that, when he {{went from}} London to Canterbury, he should have talked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> going to the {{farthest}} limits of the earth; and, {{when he went}} from England to Australia, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> going for a little trip across the channel.|$|R
60|$|Rollo did not answer, but <b>he</b> looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> not convinced.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I think I {{can keep}} awake," [...] stammered Bobby {{and opened his}} eyes very wide <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to stretch his eyelids {{so as to make}} them stay open.|$|E
60|$|He {{started off}} across the plain, and coming back too late for lunch, found Kemp on the veranda. Kemp looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to be philosophical, but found it hard.|$|E
60|$|His hat was {{off before}} {{he opened the}} door; his {{comforter}} too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to overtake nine o'clock.|$|E
60|$|But to Gerald {{it sounded}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> insistent rather than confident.|$|R
60|$|MRS. COADE. Just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> seeing amusing {{things in}} his sleep.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Konig was thunderstruck, {{staring at}} McCoy <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> a madman.|$|R
60|$|It {{appeared}} to be now my turn to frighten him. The color left his face. He passed his hand restlessly over his forehead, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to brush some delusion out of his brain.|$|E
6000|$|The Rogue had got {{the clue}} he wanted, though {{he held it}} with a clumsy hand. Looking perplexedly at the passionate face, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> {{to work out a}} sum in his mind, he slowly answered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] sighed Arthur, sinking {{back on the}} ground, [...] "that's {{the most}} {{wonderful}} thing that's ever happened to me." [...] He looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to put things seen in a dream beside real things.|$|E
5000|$|Clear quartz: {{allows the}} user to see <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> in another place.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned away}} to the window--suddenly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a little put out.|$|R
60|$|Subienkow {{played his}} game <b>as</b> coolly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{bartering}} for a foxskin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, certainly," [...] said Mr. Arbuton, {{and looked}} about {{him with an}} eye of cold, uncompassionate inspection, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> it by a {{standard}} of taste, and, on the whole, finding the poor little church vulgar.|$|E
6000|$|Mike {{looked hard}} at my guardian, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> {{to learn a}} lesson from his face, and slowly replied, [...] "Ayther to character, or to having been in his company and never left him all the night in question." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{subject of}} {{conversation}} {{happened to be}} very congenial to Cheenbuk's cast of mind. He remained thinking and gazing upwards {{for a minute or}} two, then he said meditatively, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to work out some mental problem-- ...|$|E
60|$|The King {{continued}} to stare at him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> a human curiosity.|$|R
60|$|The hunted peer looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{about to}} dive through the window.|$|R
60|$|Mak {{scratched}} his woolly pate, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> quite unable to explain himself.|$|R
60|$|The Frog {{looked at}} the door with his large dull eyes for a minute: then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> whether the paint would come off; then he looked at Alice.|$|E
6000|$|As Big Sam passed Black Paul {{he winked}} and whispered: [...] "The old fool is {{doing exactly what}} I would have done if he hadn't come aboard. This suits my plan <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> his best to please me." ...|$|E
60|$|Drummer looked up. There was Unc' Billy Possum's sharp {{little face}} {{sticking}} out of his doorway, and Unc' Billy looked very sleepy and very cross {{and at the same}} time <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> very hard to be polite and pleasant.|$|E
60|$|Still the Curate came not, and Alfred became grieved, feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> neglected.|$|R
60|$|The hotelkeeper {{pursed his}} lips and looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> solving a hard problem.|$|R
60|$|He {{advanced}} a few steps, {{slowly and}} painfully, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> sinking under fatigue.|$|R
