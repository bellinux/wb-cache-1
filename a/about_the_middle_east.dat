[...] He criticized the American military involvement in the Kosovo War (1998–99) as an imperial action; and described the Iraq Liberation Act (1998), promulgated during the Clinton Administration, as the political license that predisposed the U.S. to invade Iraq in 2003, which was authorised with the Iraq Resolution (2 October 2002); and the continual support of Israel by successive U.S. presidential governments, as actions meant to perpetuate regional political instability in the Middle East.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the essays}} [...] "Overstating the Arab State" [...] (2001), by Nazih Ayubi, and [...] "Is Jordan Palestine?" [...] (2003), by Raphael Israel, the authors {{deal with the}} psychologically {{fragmented}} postcolonial identity, {{as determined by the}} effects (political and social, cultural and economic) of Western colonialism in the Middle East. As such, the fragmented national identity remains a characteristic of such societies, consequence of the imperially convenient, but arbitrary, colonial boundaries (geographic and cultural) demarcated by the Europeans, with which they ignored the tribal and clan relations that determined the geographic borders of the Middle East countries, before the arrival of European imperialists. Hence, the postcolonial literature <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> examines and analizes the Western discourses about identity formation, the existence and inconsistent nature of a postcolonial national-identity among the peoples of the contemporary Middle East.|$|E

2500|$|The Washington Post {{review of}} the book noted, [...] "Prisoners is Jeffrey Goldberg’s sensitive, forthright and {{perceptive}} account of {{his years as a}} soldier and journalist in Israel—and of his long-running conversation with a Palestinian whom he once kept under lock and key. It is a forceful reminder of how rewarding, and how difficult, discourse between Israelis and Palestinians can be.” CBS News critic wrote, [...] "There is no shortage of histories, polemics and policy manuals <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> An honest but complex story, from what happens to be a personal perspective that many Americans can at least conjure, is a rarer opportunity for insight. And that is what Jeffrey Goldberg, a reporter for The New Yorker, delivers in Prisoners. To {{those of us who have}} followed Jeffrey Goldberg’s reporting on the Muslim world, the publication of his first book is cause for real pleasure...because his writing on the subject has always been exceptional: wise, unpretentious, and at times, unexpectedly funny.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Randall Adams of The Harvard Crimson writes that, in {{the spring}} of 2002, a {{petition}} within Harvard calling for Harvard and MIT to divest from Israeli and American companies that sell arms to Israel gathered over 600 signatures, including 74 from the Harvard faculty and 56 from the MIT faculty. Among the signatories was Harvard's Winthrop House Master Paul D. Hanson, in response to which Dershowitz staged a debate for 200 students in the Winthrop Junior Common Room.

40|$|Ignorance <b>about</b> Islam and <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> remains {{widespread}} in the United States, and while the role of mainstream media is regularly scrutinized, the role of formal education in dissolving common prejudice and enabling international understanding is normally overlooked. This paper considers the potential educational need posed by American ignorance <b>about</b> Islam and <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> focusing on three major interrelated questions. First, {{what is known about}} Islam by Americans today? Second, what factors - political, cultural, institutional, and so on - enable widespread ignorance <b>about</b> Islam and <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> on <b>the</b> part of average, educated American citizens? Third, how might formal education allow for greater cross-cultural/multi-cultural understanding of societies outside the United States? In answering these questions, the author considers various theories of cross-cultural interaction (from the "clash of civilizations" to Foucauldian knowledge/ power and Orientalism) as well as contemporary educational theories on multiculturalism and the politics of education. © Common Ground, Liz Jackson, All Rights Reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
