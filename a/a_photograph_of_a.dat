5|$|A {{number of}} {{countries}} expressed concern about unliveable conditions, with The Times of India reporting that the Scottish delegation apparently submitted <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dog defecating on a bed in the Games Village. Secretary general of the Organising Committee Lalit Bhanot countered the complaints of poor sanitation when he claimed that cultural differences accounted for differing standards of cleanliness in India and the western world. He was subsequently ridiculed by both the Indian and international media.|$|E

These synesthetes do not need to perform the actual movements of a corresponding swimming style. To activate the concurrent experiences, it is sufficient to activate the concept of a swimming style (e.g., by presenting <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> swimmer or simply talking about swimming).|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of Kansas Saloon Smashers was Edwin S. Porter, a projectionist {{who came to}} work for Edison as a cameraman in 1900. Eventually, Porter became the director responsible for all of Edison Studios' output. Porter based the set off of <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wrecked saloon {{which appeared in the}} Journal, while the characters and plot were based on editorial cartoons published in the paper. Porter frequently read the publication when he wanted inspiration on topics that filmgoers would be interested in.|$|E

After {{disagreements}} over the perceived colour of the dress in the photograph, the bride posted the image on Facebook, and her friends also disagreed over the colour; some saw it as white with gold lace, while others saw it as blue with black lace. For a week, the debate became well known in Colonsay, a small island community.|$|E

Bond {{locates the}} boatman, named Quarrel, whom he {{recognises}} {{as the driver}} of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, Felix Leiter, a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica, but has not determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, {{in stark contrast to}} the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost at the spot shows <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings {{had already been}} found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit {{is not likely to}} inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they can not be increased.|$|E

5|$|The album's cover was, like {{several other}} Pink Floyd albums, {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. It consists of <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man {{sitting in a}} tree which has {{been taken out of}} focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as The Dark Side of the Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.|$|E
5|$|Although to many she is {{best known}} for Demi's Birthday Suit, art aficionados {{consider}} her most famous work Disappearing Model. The work appeared on Ripley's Believe it or Not!. In the trompe l'oeil body painting, the face and body of the model are almost indistinguishable from the red and blue and yellow flowers of the wallpaper in the background. Her first body paintings was also memorable as she painted a moko on a female Ford Modeling Agency fashion model named Jana, which is a tabooed employment of a traditionally male ritual face mask. An example from Gair's website of her ability to trick the eye into seeing a three-dimensional subject blend with a two-dimensional background is seen in <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pregnant Elle Macpherson. Other examples of this technique include the cover of her first book (pictured below) and images from within this book.|$|E
5|$|On October 17, 2010, Kanye West {{revealed}} through Twitter that My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy {{had been}} rejected by certain stores because of the cover art. The artwork (a portrait by George Condo) shows West being straddled by an armless winged female (a phoenix). Both characters are depicted nude, and one nipple of the phoenix's breasts and her buttocks are visible. The artist later said that Kanye wanted a cover image that would be banned. The painting is centered with a thin yellow border on a red background. The artwork follows along the apparent theme of the album, as well as West's music film Runaway. This {{is one of five}} covers; all of them were included with its purchase. A second cover, with a painting of a ballerina by Condo, was posted on the Amazon.com pre-order page. It was intended to be the original artwork for Runaway, but West used <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ballerina instead.|$|E
