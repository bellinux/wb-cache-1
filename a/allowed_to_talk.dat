His last game for Chester had been during December; he played just 11times during his six months with Chester, scoring only once.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' flight to America Epstein was offered {{numerous}} samples of products by merchandisers who required a licence {{to be allowed}} to sell them such as clocks, pens, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games. Epstein rejected all of them; directing the merchandisers to Byrne instead, who was already in New York ensconced in The Drake Hotel on Park Avenue at 56th Street. Byrne rented expensive offices on Fifth Avenue, hiring two limousines (on 24-hour standby) and a helicopter to fly clients to and from the airport, insisting that only the presidents of merchandising companies were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> directly with him, or with his partner, Lord Eliot, who helped to promote the company name with use of his title. Eliot would later recall going to the Seltaeb office {{once or twice a week}} to draw $1,000 from petty cash.|$|E
5|$|As an {{unrestricted}} free {{agent in the}} summer of 2005, Niedermayer was in considerable demand; 14 teams contacted his agent on the first day they were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him. The Devils offered him a five-year contract that would have paid him $7.8 million per season, the maximum allowed under the new salary cap, but Niedermayer chose instead to sign a four-year contract worth $6.75 million per season with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He chose to take the shorter term and lower salary to play and try to win a Stanley Cup with his brother. The Ducks immediately named Scott the team's captain. In his first season in Anaheim, 2005–06, Niedermayer scored 63 points and was named a First Team All-Star for the second time. In the playoffs, the Ducks reached the Western Conference Final, but were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers.|$|E

Public opinion is highly critical of Myshkin's actions toward Aglaya, and the Yepanchins break off all relations with him. He tries to explain to Yevgeny Pavlovich that Nastassya Filippovna is a broken soul, that he must stay with her or she will probably die, and that Aglaya will understand if he is only <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to her. Yevgeny Pavlovich refuses to facilitate any contact between them and suspects that Myshkin himself is mad.|$|E

He made his competitive debut for Marseille on 11 August 2007, starting and eventually being substituted in a 0–0 stalemate with Rennes. At Marseille, Zenden struggled for regular football. In the 2008–09 Ligue 1 season, he featured 13 times (predominately as a substitute) scoring three goals.|$|E
25|$|As {{short as}} this {{agreement}} was, {{it gave the}} UAW instant legitimacy. The workers there also got a 5% increase in pay and were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> during lunch. The UAW capitalized on that opportunity, signing up 100,000 GM employees and building the union's strength through grievance strikes at GM plants throughout the country. Several participants in the strike, including Charles I. Krause, went on to greater prominence within the union. Other notable participants in the sit-down strike were future D-Day hero and Greco-Roman wrestling champion Dean Rockwell, labor leader and future UAW president Walter Reuther, and the uncle of documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, whose debut feature Roger & Me contains a clip from the strike.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, workers started {{organizing}} {{to improve}} labor conditions. This proved difficult. Charles Piaget, {{the son of}} a clockwork artisan, who began working at the factory in 1946 as a skilled worker, became a representative of the Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens (CFTC, French Confederation of Christian Workers) trade union. He later recalled that during national strikes, only 30 or 40 workers at LIP {{out of a total of}} 1200 would go on strike. Those who did strike were listed by the management and called in to explain themselves. Semi-skilled workers on the assembly line were not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> or move more than 25 centimeters (less than ten inches) during their shifts.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the ransoming process, the Cázares were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{with their}} {{remaining}} relatives in three occasions. In their first phone conversation, the victims {{talked about their}} concern for their wives and children. Their second conversation was a lot shorter and emotive for the Cázares, however. By July 27, the kidnappers said they needed a final cash deliver in order to release them. The Cázares sent the money to Matamoros from Texas and eagerly awaited at a disclosed location for a white van {{that was supposed to}} deliver their relatives. The van never came and the phone line that the family used to contact the kidnappers was out of service. Weeks after that, the family decided to contact law enforcement.|$|E

Briar Rose at first is frightened at his sudden appearance, as she is not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to strangers, but Philip soon puts her at ease. They instantly fall in love, unaware of being promised in marriage sixteen years ago. Briar Rose asks Phillip to come to her cottage that evening and meet her family.|$|E

25|$|The husband {{visited the}} tharavad {{at night and}} left the {{following}} morning {{and he had no}} legal obligation to his children which lay entirely with the karnavan. In Nair families, young men and women about the same age were not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to each other, unless the young man's sister was considerably older than him. The wife of karnavan had an unusual relationship in his tharavad as she belonged to a different one and her interests lay there. Panikkar wrote that Karnavan loved his sister's son more than his own and he believes it was due mainly to the instability of Nair marriages. Divorce rate was very high as both man and woman had equal right to terminate the marriage. Enangar was another family with which a tharavad remained closely related; a few such related families formed a social group whose members participated in all social activities. Nakane wrote in 1956 that tharavads as a functional unit had ceased to exist and large buildings that had once hosted large tharavads were occupied by just a few of its remnants.|$|E

[...] or [...] "Don't let him have a Rook!" [...] are common, {{and can lead to}} seemingly absurd sacrificial captures on the other board. Partners are not allowed to physically act on the other board.|$|E
500|$|The game {{featured}} three controversial officiating calls. Regarding {{the second}} quarter Tate touchdown, Fox NFL commentator Ronde Barber and Fox rules analyst Mike Pereira believed Tate had not controlled the ball while falling to the turf. On the contrary, NFL Vice President of Officiating Dean Blandino stated that Tate [...] "controlled the pass right at the goal line. This is not a receiver {{who is going to}} the ground. He is taking his third step, he had demonstrated possession, had become a runner." [...] Late in the fourth quarter, Pernell McPhee was penalized for roughing the passer when it appeared that he had been pushed into Stafford. During the Lions' game-winning drive in overtime, Willie Young was held, but no penalty was called. Due to the NFL's policies on criticizing officials, Cutler did not comment, while John Fox stated, [...] "We’re not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about officials." ...|$|E

500|$|Off the field, the {{throwing}} controversy {{was beginning to}} affect Meckiff adversely. In his 1961 autobiography, prophetically titled Thrown Out, he said the accusations took a deep personal toll on him and his family, and prompted him to shun the public. He became known by the derisive nickname [...] "Chucker" [...] and was credited on the front cover of his autobiography as [...] "Ian 'Chucker' Meckiff". Meckiff reported that from the Melbourne Test onwards, his son was verbally abused by classmates; Meckiff's parents were persistently told their son bowled illegally. He added that doctors believed his anxiety was contributing to stomach ailments. At the time, players were not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the media during the season, and Meckiff was upset {{because he could not}} rebut his accusers while they were free to attack him. He denied ever throwing, but admitted he may have been open to suspicion after bowling 15 to 20 overs in a day's play, as his body would begin to fall away in the delivery stride due to fatigue. He had a permanently bent bowling arm; he generated his pace from his wrist action, and asserted that his thin wrists gave the impression that his whole arm was bending.|$|E
