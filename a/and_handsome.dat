He {{inserted a}} self-portrait into one other work; the lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald, known through a tapestry copy in the Historical Museum of Bern.

5|$|According to Vid Gaković, who was {{a member}} of National Unity in 1914, Stojanović was an ambitious and talented young man. He was {{determined}} that his voice would be heard and he liked being the centre of attention. He was severe to younger members of the association, whom he sometimes sharply criticised. Nevertheless, younger students liked being around him. Gaković described him as a tall <b>and</b> <b>handsome</b> man who greatly cared about his appearance; he wore a bow tie and a broad-brimmed hat.|$|E

5|$|Piru Singh {{was born}} on 20 May 1918, in village Beri, Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. He {{was the son of}} Lal Singh. His family {{consisted}} of seven children—three brothers and four sisters—with Singh being the youngest son. As a young boy, Singh always hated school, as he was unable to cope with the restricted environment. One day, after being scolded by his class teacher for quarreling with one of his classmates, Singh ran away, and never returned to school. After that, Singh continued to help his parents in their farm, and grew up to be well-built <b>and</b> <b>handsome</b> youth. Shikar, a local Indian sport, was his favourite game. Though Singh wanted to join the army from his childhood, he was rejected twice, as he was too young, before he was accepted at the age of eighteen.|$|E

5|$|The {{last chapter}} {{of the body of}} the book – if Chapter 10 is {{considered}} more or less an epilogue – covers towns seen as part of the English landscape. Hoskins justifies this on the grounds that understanding towns brings pleasure. He describes in turn planned towns, the open-field town, and the market town. Towns were planned as early as Norman times, Abbot Baldwin planning Bury St Edmunds between 1066 and 1086; Stratford-on-Avon was laid out in 1196. Another burst of town planning came with the spa towns in the late 18th century, and of new industrial towns like Middlesbrough and Barrow-in-Furness in the mid 19th century. Open-field towns like Nottingham, Leicester, and Stamford grew naturally in their own open fields, but were trapped by pasture rights from growing in the 19th century, giving Nottingham slums, and Leicester a problem that it just managed to solve, growing across its fields: while Stamford stopped growing entirely, becoming fossilised as what Hoskins calls a museum piece of a beautiful 17th and 18th century town. Finally, the market towns like Marlborough grew up around their often large <b>and</b> <b>handsome</b> market places, which are however of any number of shapes.|$|E
5|$|These films {{took many}} liberties {{from the book}} series casting-wise. Red-haired Granville's {{portrayal}} of the then-blonde Nancy was portrayed to be ditzy, absent-minded, and more meddling that that of the ongoing book series. While the Carson Drew of the books was portrayed as older, feeble, {{and more of a}} hands-off parent, John Litel's Carson was young <b>and</b> <b>handsome,</b> much more athletically fit, and tried his best to restrain Nancy from getting into danger. Ned/Ted was even more drastically altered: instead of being Nancy's boyfriend in college who lives in a different town, he was now her next-door neighbor, who was a year older than her and their romance was very ambiguous and tumultuous. The recurring character of the older Hannah Gruen was replaced with Effie Schneider, a minor character in the books who was Hannah's teenage niece. Effie and Hannah's characteristics were merged, although Effie's fidgety, frightful nature retained prominence for comedic effect. In addition to these four, a new character Captain Tweedy was added, to portray the stereotypical bumbling, clueless cop that mirrored Steve McBride in the Torchy Blane series. Nancy's friends Bess and George did not appear in the film series, and never mentioned or referred to.|$|E
