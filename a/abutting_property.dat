25|$|The {{first major}} change {{was made in}} {{preparation}} for the North Freeway connection, when the directions of Calhoun Avenue and Jefferson Street were swapped so that they would alternate. A bridge, dated 1954, was built to carry traffic from Jefferson Street over traffic to Jefferson Street, and US 75 was moved to Calhoun Avenue northbound, soon crossing downtown on the one-way pair of Calhoun Avenue and Pierce Street to the new North Freeway. A median barrier was added in 1956 to prevent crossover accidents. Southeast of downtown Houston, the at-grade intersections proved dangerous, and only two had been replaced with interchanges by 1959, when the Texas Highway Department began a program to upgrade the road to full freeway standards. Frontage roads would be required along the entire highway, since the state had not purchased access rights, and so <b>abutting</b> <b>property</b> owners were able to build driveways to the road. To accomplish this, traffic was shifted to the newly built frontage roads so that the central main lanes could be reconstructed. This grade separation was completed from Houston to Almeda-Genoa Road (exit 34) in June 1959, Farm to Market Road 1959 (exit 30) in October 1964, Farm to Market Road 518 (exit 23) in December 1970, and Farm to Market Road 1764 (exit 15) in 1976. As the section beyond FM 1764 into Galveston had already been rebuilt, this marked the completion of the Gulf Freeway as an actual freeway.|$|E

50|$|Frontage roads {{provide access}} to homes and {{businesses}} which would otherwise be cut off by a limited-access road and connect these locations with roads which have {{direct access to the}} main roadway. Frontage roads give indirect access to <b>abutting</b> <b>property</b> along a freeway, either preventing the commercial disruption of an urban area that the freeway traverses or allowing commercial development of <b>abutting</b> <b>property.</b> At times, they add to the cost of building an expressway due to costs of land acquisition and the costs of paving and maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The land {{is often}} public property, with {{maintenance}} usually being a municipal responsibility. Some municipal authorities, however, require that <b>abutting</b> <b>property</b> owners maintain their respective verge areas, {{as well as}} the adjunct footpaths or sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|This highway {{served the}} low traffic {{volumes of the}} day, but {{as the number of}} {{vehicles}} increased over {{the first half of the}} 20thcentury, issues arose with the numerous private driveways along the route. To overcome this issue of <b>abutting</b> <b>properties</b> long-established on the old Highway16 corridor, the DHO began purchasing a new right-of-way between Highway401 and Century Road by late 1967 for a two-lane bypass of the original alignment, avoiding all the built-up areas that the original Highway16 encountered. This route was designed to easily accommodate the eventual upgrade to a freeway when traffic volumes necessitated.|$|R

On September 13, the MBTA announced that the station was planned to open in October 2012. The station did not open in October; on November 7, the MBTA announced the opening date. The station opened on schedule on November 12, 2012. In April 2013, a 6-foot fence on both platforms was erected in response to privacy concerns from residents of <b>abutting</b> <b>properties.</b> Ribbon-cutting ceremonies were held at Newmarket, Four Corners/Geneva Ave, and Talbot Ave on July 17, 2013.|$|R
50|$|Portland's Eastern Cemetery {{is located}} on the northeastern part of the city's peninsula, at the base of Munjoy Hill, occupying a roughly {{triangular}} lot bounded on the north by Congress Street, the east by Mountfort Street, and the south by Federal Street. The sloping lot is only at street level along Congress and part of Mountfort Street, the rest supported by a stone retaining wall. Its street-facing sides are ringed by iron fencing, with the main entrance on Congress Street, marked by pairs of granite posts. Chain-link fencing runs along the southwestern boundary with <b>abutting</b> <b>properties.</b> The cemetery is mostly grass, with occasional trees that are generally volunteer growth.|$|R
5000|$|The word freeway {{was first}} used in February 1930 by Edward M. Bassett. Bassett argued that roads should be {{classified}} into three basic types: highways, parkways, and freeways. [...] In Bassett's zoning and property law-based system, <b>abutting</b> <b>property</b> owners have the rights of light, air and access to highways, but not parkways and freeways; the latter two are distinguished in {{that the purpose of}} a parkway is recreation, while the purpose of a freeway is movement. [...] Thus, as originally conceived, a freeway is simply a strip of public land devoted to movement to which <b>abutting</b> <b>property</b> owners do not have rights of light, air or access.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{reservoir}} is {{the water supply}} for Boston, not all areas around it {{are open to the}} public. Regulations designed to ensure pure water include the prohibiting of boats, ice fishing, wading, swimming, overnight camping, alcoholic beverages, littering, animals, bikes, and motor vehicles from {{the reservoir}} and <b>abutting</b> <b>property.</b> These regulations are controversial to recreation and fishing proponents, who argue the rules are not needed to protect water quality.

50|$|The {{historic}} district consists of Currier Park {{and all of}} the buildings facing it on East, North, Park, and Academy Streets. It extends a bit further from the park along Park, East, and Academy, and also includes <b>abutting</b> <b>properties</b> on the adjacent Averill, Cliff, and Mount Streets. The district directly abuts the Barre Downtown Historic District, which lies to the west and south. The majority of main buildings in the district are in a vernacular Italianate style, although a large minority of the 38 buildings are Queen Anne in style. There are four Colonial Revival houses in the district, built in the early 20th century. The park is rectangular in shape, with a star-shaped path layout and grassy areas dotted with trees.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Connecticut Forest and Park Association (hiking) and the Ragged Mountain Foundation (rock climbing) {{have noted}} that issues with parking and access to certain cliff faces have {{historically}} resulted in conflicts with land owners and <b>abutting</b> <b>property</b> owners; in response, they have encouraged visitors to check website updates to verify trail access, parking, and rock face closures (see external links). As of 2007, Ragged Mountain had one trailhead, located on West Lane, located off Connecticut Route 71A in Berlin, 2.75 mi south of downtown New Britain.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the urging}} of county governments, the state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) took steps to acquire the eastern 10 mi of the {{designated}} rail. However citizens owning abutting private property started a bidding war {{in an attempt to}} stop the creation of the trail. Money given by the Minnesota Parks Foundation allowed the state to purchase the property in auction, but the citizens then brought a suit against the state arguing that [...] "the right-of-way reverted to <b>abutting</b> <b>property</b> owners once it ceased to be operated for railroad purposes. In a landmark decision, the Minnesota Supreme Court held that no such reversion takes place as long as the right-of-way continues to be used for public travel purposes even as a recreational trail." ...|$|E
5000|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, {{the land was}} used as a [...] "pauper's cemetery" [...] until 1857 when city {{encroachment}} on the neighborhood made it unsuitable for such uses. Serious complaints from <b>abutting</b> <b>property</b> owners forced the [...] "Pest House" [...] to be relocated outside of the city limits. On January 29, 1859, the city converted the property into a park known as Elm Street Park and the land and buildings were used for exposition purposes until 1876 when it was turned over to the Music Hall Association. Music Hall would be built on the original location of the [...] "Pest House" [...] which earlier served as the Orphan Asylum. Since the graves were not marked, Music Hall was simply built over them.|$|E

5000|$|The {{west end}} of Route 4 is at exit 33 of I-85; local traffic can {{continue}} north on the short Mulberry Church Road. This part of Route 4 is named Billy Graham Parkway, after evangelist Billy Graham, and is a limited-access road, meaning that <b>abutting</b> <b>property</b> owners cannot construct driveways. After crossing Scott Futrell Drive, the south frontage road of I-85, the parkway crosses over Wilkinson Boulevard (US 29/US 74); access between the two roads is indirect, via Boyer Street, Morris Field Drive or another piece of Mulberry Church Road. The few intersections on Billy Graham Parkway include a trumpet interchange with Josh Birmingham Parkway, the main access to Charlotte/Douglas International Airport, an intersection with West Boulevard (NC 160), and a partial cloverleaf interchange with Tyvola Road near Paul Buck Boulevard. Billy Graham Parkway ends at South Tryon Street (NC 49), where Route 4 continues east on Woodlawn Road. Woodlawn Road crosses Bill Lee Freeway (I-77/US 21).|$|E

50|$|Many {{properties}} {{have considerable}} problems {{with regard to}} improper bounding or miscalculations in past surveys, titles, easements, and wildlife crossings. Also, many properties are created from multiple divisions of a larger piece {{over the course of}} years, and with every additional division the risk of miscalculation increases. The result can be <b>abutting</b> <b>properties</b> not coinciding with adjacent parcels, resulting in hiatuses (gaps) and overlaps. Many times a surveyor must solve a puzzle using pieces that do not exactly fit together. In these cases, the solution is based upon the surveyor's research and interpretation, along with established procedures for resolving discrepancies. This is essentially a process of continual error correction and update, where official recordation documents countermand the previous and sometime erroneous survey documents recorded by older monuments and older survey methods.|$|R

40|$|The present article considers, and rejects, four {{arguments}} against {{the privatization of}} roads, and in favor of our present system of road socialism. They are 1. Eminent domain is cheap, efficient, and necessary, but only government can avail itself of their “benefits. ” 2. Roads are not perfectly competitive, but rather, necessarily, are characterized by monopolistic elements, which only the state can address. 3. Roads are different then everything else; people impose waiting costs on others without taking them into account; this externalities problem is a market failure that, again, only government can solve. 4. Road privatization is unfair to <b>abutting</b> <b>property</b> owners. In section 3, the paper deals with five objections to, or difficulties with, street and highway privatization: 1. The government has violated “Non-Compete” clauses to protect private investors in roadways. 2. Private industry would find it impossible to discern rational prices for its services. 3. Should public roads be commercialized before being privatized? That is, should the state first charge a price for these services and then privatize, or do the opposite? 4. Road privatization would be a public relations nightmare. How should this be dealt with...|$|E
