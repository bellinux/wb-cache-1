In North Carolina and Virginia, Irene produced heavy rainfall of over 10inches (255mm), adding more flooding after previous Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd.

5|$|After {{affecting}} the Philippines, Soudelor moved {{into an area}} of low wind shear and with favorable outflow. It became a typhoon on June17, and quickly developed an eye while rapidly intensifying. The storm struck the Japanese island of Iriomote-jima, where wind gusts reached 204km/h (127mph). It also affected Taiwan, where floods covered highways <b>and</b> <b>caused</b> mudslides. Early on June18, Soudelor reached peak 10â€‘minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph). Subsequently, an increase in shear and {{the passage of a}} trough weakened the typhoon <b>and</b> <b>caused</b> it to turn to the northeast. Soudelor weakened to a tropical storm on June19, and subsequently it passed between Japan and South Korea. It became an extratropical cyclone that day, dissipating on June24. In Japan, the storm caused widespread power outages, although damage was minimal, and there were 21injuries. In South Korea, there was $12.1million in damage and two deaths.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, the American Red Cross brought {{supplies}} to areas {{affected by the}} hurricane, requesting as much as $10,000 in relief work. Several other local relief committees also brought {{supplies to}} affected areas. An estimated $2million in damages from the storm were attributed to crop damage alone, especially rice and cotton. The storm was estimated to have killed 40people <b>and</b> <b>caused</b> $7.5million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{losses were}} heavy. In Florida, the second-largest {{producer}} of oranges in the world, {{damage to the}} citrus crop was estimated at $200million, <b>and</b> <b>caused</b> a 50% increase {{in the price of}} grapefruit juice. Charley, along with the other storms that hit Florida during 2004, caused a total agricultural loss of $2.2billion. Other crops, nurseries, buildings, and agricultural equipment also suffered.|$|E

High winds knocked down trees <b>and</b> <b>caused</b> minor structural damage. In Zihuatanejo, a ship with nine people was rescued after being reported as lost, {{which may have}} been a result of high seas generated by Aletta.
