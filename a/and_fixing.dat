5|$|In 1961, some 1,500 {{soldiers}} from the 100th were activated and sent to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, {{in order to provide}} support during the Berlin Crisis. During their time on active duty, the 100th successfully trained some 32,000 soldiers after thoroughly rebuilding <b>and</b> <b>fixing</b> the old Army base. The unit was returned to reserve status again in August 1962. In 1968, the division received its distinctive unit insignia, which alluded to its history in World War II and as a Kentucky-based unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequent}} crashes of {{the retail}} Windows versions infuriated many reviewers; Game Revolution censured Interplay for focusing on censoring the game for marketing purposes instead of testing for <b>and</b> <b>fixing</b> the software bugs before release. Several reviewers could not connect to multiplayer games due to failed connections or bugs. The reviewers who managed to play online, commented the games were fun, although they were occasionally disconnected or lagged. GamesFirst lamented the lack of dedicated low ping servers, and several reviewers declared that the computer versions of the game was flawed for not implementing an in-game save feature.|$|E
5|$|Within a few days, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{identified}} primary {{concerns for}} the small island, including fixing the water supply, distributing water, clearing roads, <b>and</b> <b>fixing</b> damaged shelters. On the island, the water supply was rapidly diminishing; more than 80% of the islanders were without clean water, and {{the water from the}} treatment plant needed to be boiled for extended periods of time. Health issues included dehydration, sickness, and gastrointestinal problems. Without running water, several people bathed in the oil-contaminated harbor where many boats sunk, which caused skin irritations.|$|E

5|$|The Littleport riot {{broke out}} {{when a group}} of {{residents}} met at The Globe Inn. Fuelled by alcohol, they left the inn and began intimidating wealthier Littleport residents, demanding money and destroying property. The riot spread to Ely where magistrates attempted to calm the protests by ordering poor relief <b>and</b> <b>fixing</b> a minimum wage; see printed bill (reproduced at right). The following day, encouraged by Lord Liverpool's government, a militia of the citizens of Ely, led by Sir Henry Bate Dudley and backed by the 1st The Royal Dragoons, rounded up the rioters. In the ensuing altercation at The George and Dragon in Littleport, a trooper was injured, one rioter was killed, and at least one went on the run.|$|E
5|$|The Tu-70 was {{completed}} in October 1946, but did not make its first flight until 27 November. It began manufacturer's trials in October, but an engine fire on the fourth flight caused it to make a crash-landing. This was traced to a design defect in the American-built supercharger-control system, but identifying the problem <b>and</b> <b>fixing</b> it prolonged the manufacturer's trials through October 1947. It was redesignated as the Tu-70 when it went through the State acceptance trials which ended on 14 December. It met all the design goals, but was not accepted for production as all the factories were already committed to building aircraft with a higher priority and Aeroflot had no requirement for the type, being fully satisfied with its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 airliners.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the extra-gradient methods for solving split {{feasibility}} <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> point problems involved in pseudo-contractive mappings in real Hilbert spaces. We propose an Ishikawa-type extra-gradient iterative algorithm for finding a solution of the split feasibility <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> point problems involved in pseudo-contractive mappings with Lipschitz assumption. Moreover, we also suggest a Mann-type extra-gradient iterative algorithm for finding a solution of the split feasibility <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> point problems involved in pseudo-contractive mappings without Lipschitz assumption. It is proven that under suitable conditions, the sequences generated by the proposed iterative algorithms converge weakly to a solution of the split feasibility <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> point problems. The results presented in this paper extend and improve some corresponding ones in the literature.|$|R
40|$|Substitutability between mobile <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> phones is an {{important}} consequence of India's telecom sector's deregulation since 1991. This paper tests for substitutability between mobile <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> phones, based on a binary logit model and using the household sample survey data from the Karnataka State in South India. Estimated cross price elasticity offers empirical evidence for substitutability rather than complementarity between <b>fixed</b> <b>and</b> mobile phone services. This evidence is symmetric in mobile <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> phone models. The empirical results have implications for on-going policy discussion on subsidization by the Access Deficit Charge and for changing the bases for Universal Service Obligation. ...|$|R
