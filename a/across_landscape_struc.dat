40|$|Network {{analysis}} {{is on the}} rise across scientific disciplines because of its ability to reveal complex, and often emergent, patterns and dynamics. Nonetheless, a growing concern in network {{analysis is}} the use of limited data for constructing networks. This concern is strikingly relevant to ecology and conservation biology, where network analysis is used to infer connectivity <b>across</b> <b>landscapes.</b> In this context, movement among patches is the crucial parameter for interpreting connectivity but because of the difficulty of collecting reliable movement data, most network analysis proceeds with only indirect information on movement <b>across</b> <b>landscapes</b> rather than using observed movement to construct networks. Statistical models developed for social networks provide promising alternatives for landscape network construction because they can leverage limited movement information to predict linkages. Using two mark-recapture datasets on individual movement and connectivity <b>across</b> <b>landscapes,</b> we test whether commonly used network constructions for interpreting connectivity can predict actual linkages and network structure, and we contrast these approaches to social network models. We find that currently applied network constructions for assessing connectivity consistently, and substantially, overpredict actual connectivity, resulting in considerable overestimation of metapopulation lifetime. Furthermore, social network models provide accurate predictions of network structure, and can do so with remarkably limited data on movement. Social network models offer a flexible and powerful way for not only understanding the factors influencing connectivity but also for providing more reliable estimates of connectivity and metapopulation persistence in the face of limited data...|$|R

West Nile virus (WNV), the world’s most widespread arbovirus, invaded the United States in 1999 and rapidly spread across the county. Although the ecology of vectors and hosts are key determinants of WNV prevalence <b>across</b> <b>landscapes,</b> the factors shaping local vector and host populations remain unclear. Here, we used spatially-explicit models to evaluate how three land-use types (orchards, vegetable/forage crops, natural) and two climatic variables (temperature, precipitation) influence the prevalence of WNV infections and vector/host distributions at landscape and local spatial scales. <b>Across</b> <b>landscapes,</b> we show that orchard habitats were associated with greater prevalence of WNV infections in reservoirs (birds) and incidental hosts (horses), while increased precipitation was associated with fewer infections. At local scales, orchard habitats increased the prevalence of WNV infections in vectors (mosquitoes) and the abundance of mosquitoes and two key reservoir species, the American robin and the house sparrow. Thus, orchard habitats benefitted WNV vectors and reservoir hosts locally, creatin...|$|R
40|$|Crop {{pollination}} by bees {{has long}} been recognized as an ecosystem service of huge economic value; {{a large number of}} food crops depend upon pollination. Features <b>across</b> <b>landscapes</b> that are important for pollination delivery include: nesting habitats, floral resource availability at foraging distance, and climate. The conditions for presence/absence of pollinators are therefore complex and rely upon a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. To date there has been no easily available method for landowners to determine the potential of pollination delivery across the land effectively and rapidly. In this paper we develop a method that uses freely available datasets to remotely estimate the relative provision of pollination service delivery provided by bees across Europe at a 300 m-pixel resolution. We then identify the potential pollination delivery and efficiency across Europe at country and regional level. This study illustrates an approach that obtains a first approximation for land managers to identify potential areas <b>across</b> <b>landscapes</b> to protect in order to enhance pollination service delivery...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavioral}} and physical traits of adults can be {{strongly influenced by}} conditions experienced during development. Consequently, variation in natal habitat quality <b>across</b> a <b>landscape</b> and through time {{can also lead to}} differences in the traits of adults. When individuals move <b>across</b> the <b>landscape,</b> this could create carry-over effects where differences in the natal habitat quality of colonizers influence population dynamics and species interactions in new habitats. I studied how these carry-over effects, which are known to alter individual traits and population dynamics, scale up to larger effects on community and metacommunity (multiple communities <b>across</b> a <b>landscape</b> connected by dispersing individuals) dynamics. I tested these questions on carry-over effects in a spatial context using a Tribolium spp. flour beetle system with habitat patches of flour. I generated carry-over effects by using flour types which predictably alter the traits of flour beetles who develop in them. The first chapter identified that carry-over effects which alter population dynamics occur in this system. It also discovered novel and powerful mechanisms for carry-over effects to influence population dynamics. The second chapter shows how carry-over effects and population density interact to affect dispersal decisions, which is important for understanding how carry-over effects will propagate <b>across</b> <b>landscapes.</b> The third chapter shows that carry-over effects can decisively alter competitive dynamics and outcomes, but that how may not be immediately predictable from their influence on single population dynamics. Finally, my fourth chapter manipulated whether carry-over effects occurred <b>across</b> multi-patch <b>landscapes</b> to test whether they influence species dynamics across a metacommunity. This final chapter shows that at the landscape scale, carry-over effects can have even more strong emergent effects. For example, carry-over effects increased population sizes <b>across</b> <b>landscapes</b> by ~ 10 % while dramatically promoting different species under different conditions of dispersal and habitat arrangement. Thus, the influences of carry-over effects on population and community dynamics at the landscape level may be strong, but context dependent on other spatial processes. Further work to understand how landscape habitat patterns and dispersal shape the influence of carry-over effects on metacommunity dynamics could improve understanding of natural population and community dynamics...|$|R

40|$|A key {{challenge}} of ecosystem management is determining {{how to manage}} multiple ecosystem services <b>across</b> <b>landscapes.</b> Enhancing important provisioning ecosystem services, such as food and timber, often leads to tradeoffs between regulating and cultural ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling, flood protection, and tourism. We developed a framework for analyzing the provision of multiple ecosystem services <b>across</b> <b>landscapes</b> and present an empirical demonstration of ecosystem service bundles, sets of services that appear together repeatedly. Ecosystem service bundles were identified by analyzing the spatial patterns of 12 ecosystem services in a mixed-use landscape consisting of 137 municipalities in Quebec, Canada. We identified six types of ecosystem service bundles {{and were able to}} link these bundles to areas on the landscape characterized by distinct social–ecological dynamics. Our results show landscape-scale tradeoffs between provisioning and almost all regulating and cultural ecosystem services, and they show that a greater diversity of ecosystem services is positively correlated with the provision of regulating ecosystem services. Ecosystem service-bundle analysis can identify areas on a landscape where ecosystem management has produced exceptionally desirable or undesirable sets of ecosystem services...|$|R
40|$|Change is {{recognized}} as being intrinsic to ecosystems, but is also the essence of instability and the outgrowth of situations that lack sustainability. Change {{is arguably the most}} fundamental symptom for onset of abnormality in ecosystem function, and change in change cannot be detected without sufficient monitoring to determine spatial and temporal aspects of characteristic change regimes <b>across</b> <b>landscapes.</b> It must also be recognized that change can be associated with either restoration or degradation. A suite of recent developments in change detection using compressed multiband image data provides increased flexibility and practicality for systematic change detection on a regional basis. Combining such capability with conceptual extensions of spatial pattern analysis through echelons can provide a methodology for systematically monitoring spatial structure of spectral change <b>across</b> <b>landscapes</b> in order to profile characteristic broad scale regimes of change and to indicate trends in those regimes. Implementing these analytical scenarios with new generations of computers and remote sensors could lend a further dimension to tracking of ecosystem status over major regions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Human {{land use}} practices, altered climates, and {{shifting}} forest and fire management policies {{have increased the}} frequency of largewildfires several-fold. Mitigation of potential fire behaviour and fire severity have increasingly been attempted through pre-fire alteration of wildland fuels using mechanical treatments and prescribed fires. Despite annual treatment {{of more than a}} million hectares of land, quantitative assessments of the effectiveness of existing fuel treatments at reducing the size of actual wildfires or how they might alter the risk of burning <b>across</b> <b>landscapes</b> are currently lacking. Here, we present a method for estimating spatial probabilities of burning as a function of extant fuels treatments for any wildland fire-affected landscape. We examined the landscape effects of more than 72 000 ha of wildland fuel treatments involved in 14 large wildfires that burned 314 000 ha of forests in nine US states between 2002 and 2010. Fuels treatments altered the probability of fire occurrence both positively and negatively <b>across</b> <b>landscapes,</b> effectively redistributing fire risk by changing surface fire spread rates and reducing the likelihood of crowning behaviour. Trade offs are created between formation of large areas with low probabilities of increased burning and smaller, well-defined regions with reduced fire risk...|$|R
40|$|Aphids are a {{major concern}} in {{agricultural}} crops worldwide, and control by natural enemies is {{an essential component of}} the ecological intensification of agriculture. Although the complexity of agricultural landscapes is known to influence natural enemies of pests, few studies have measured the degree of pest control by different enemy guilds <b>across</b> gradients in <b>landscape</b> complexity. Here, we use multiple natural-enemy exclosures replicated in 18 fields across a gradient in landscape complexity to investigate (1) the strength of natural pest control <b>across</b> <b>landscapes,</b> measured as the difference between pest pressure in the presence {{and in the absence of}} natural enemies; (2) the differential contributions of natural enemy guilds to pest control, and the nature of their interactions <b>across</b> <b>landscapes.</b> We show that natural pest control of aphids increased up to six-fold from simple to complex landscapes. In the absence of pest control, aphid population growth was higher in complex than simple landscapes, but was reduced by natural enemies to similar growth rates <b>across</b> all <b>landscapes.</b> The effects of enemy guilds were landscape-dependent. Particularly in complex landscapes, total pest control was supplied by the combined contribution of flying insects and ground-dwellers. Birds had little overall impact on aphid control. Despite evidence for intraguild predation of flying insects by ground-dwellers and birds, the overall effect of enemy guilds on aphid control was complementary. Understanding pest control services at large spatial scales is critical to increase the success of ecological intensification schemes. Our results suggest that, where aphids are the main pest of concern, interactions between natural enemies are largely complementary and lead to a strongly positive effect of landscape complexity on pest control. Increasing the availability of seminatural habitats in agricultural landscapes may thus benefit not only natural enemies, but also the effectiveness of aphid natural pest control...|$|R
