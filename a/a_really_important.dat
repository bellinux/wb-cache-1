The couple first collaborated on the script of an adaptation of William Faulkner's novel The Hamlet in 1957 (released as The Long, Hot Summer), although Frank later said, [...] "...in the end, we created mostly new material, so it wasn't really a true adaptation".|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|Season two {{is set in}} 1947, {{approximately}} {{six months}} to a year following the events of the first, with the time jump made to show [...] "people are in a little bit different positions, and things have happened between these seasons that we maybe don't know about." [...] Fazekas noted that [...] "the challenge" [...] for the season was to find a way to reunite Carter with Edwin Jarvis since he is [...] "not an agent....that's <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> relationship, how do we keep them together?...The nice thing about Peggy this season is she's not having to hide her agenda from the SSR. [...] is helping her out, just in a different way." [...] Elaborating on the SSR's role in the season, Fazekas explained that when Markus and McFeely created the organisation for [...] it was inspired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was [...] "somewhat disbanded after the war, because it was created because of World War II. So now that the war is over, things are changing. And in real history, the OSS sort of became the CIA and some of its other functions went under other departments. There's a little bit of change going on within SSR and so Thompson [...] has a boss [...] that's going to be saying, [...] "Look, things are changing, and you need to look out for yourself."" [...] The season also sees Daniel Sousa promoted to the chief of the Los Angeles SSR office.|$|E

5000|$|The move, {{which was}} {{followed}} by Rand Paul endorsing McConnell's re-election, began a political alliance between the two Republican Senators from Kentucky.

Benton views his working with McConnell {{as part of a}} goal to unite different factions of Republicans, saying that [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>really,</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> mission to bring all Republicans and conservatives together." [...] Benton helped Rand Paul gain McConnell's approval of Paul's noted filibuster of future CIA Director John O. Brennan, in which Paul criticized the Obama Administration's use of combat drones.|$|R

[...] "There was a big, giant search for Lois," [...] Snyder said. [...] "For us, it was a big thing and obviously <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> role. We did a lot of auditioning, but we had this meeting with Amy Adams and after that I just felt she was perfect for it." [...] Adams auditioned for the role three times: once for the unproduced Superman: Flyby, and the second time for Superman Returns before landing the current role. Adams was confirmed to play Lois Lane in March 2011. While announcing the role, Snyder said in a statement, [...] "We are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams, one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today. Amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful." [...] On portraying Lois Lane, Adams stated that the film would feature a Lois Lane who is an [...] "independent, feisty woman ... but set in a more identifiable world." [...] Adams said that [...] "She has become more of a free-ranging journalist, someone who likes to be hands-on. The nature of the newspaper business has changed so much. There is so much more pressure." ...|$|E

[...] Dave Rawlings states: [...] "I've always thought that <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> thing that the Old Crow Medicine Show brought to the table was new songs—some reinterpreted old ones, some really nicely written and brand new—with the old flavor, but also with that vitality." ...|$|E

It's <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> record; it's the best thing I've ever done.

And I know it's gonna fuck a lot of people up. I want to make sure it gets done the right way, so we're being real careful with it.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the band's official website Feederweb, Grant explained that [...] "Feeling a Moment", was played back with the intro playing backwards, in which he explained: [...] "This {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album.

The song was written at home, as soon as I had that intro, the vocal “woo who” bitwhat ever you want to call itthat was <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> hook for the song." [...] In a DVD packaged with limited quantities of the album, Grant is seen playing a piano during the recording sessions, and once said that [...] " [...] don't [...] rate himself as a piano player". He also stated that Feeder are a band, and even though he writes all the songs, he makes sure drummer Mark Richardson and bass player Taka Hirose have their say in the process of their creation.|$|E
2500|$|Kelly wrote Southland Tales {{shortly before}} the September 11 attacks. The {{original}} script involved blackmail, a porn star, and two cops. After the attacks, Kelly revised the script.

[...] He described the film as a [...] "tapestry of ideas all related {{to some of the}} biggest issues that I think we're facing right now [...] [...] [...] alternative fuel or the increasing obsession with celebrity and how celebrity now intertwines with politics".

60|$|Simon Wheeler backed me into {{a corner}} and {{blockaded}} me there with his chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle flowing key to which he tuned his initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> matter, and admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in 'finesse.'

60|$|At ten {{and twelve}} Susy wrote plays, {{and she and}} Daisy Warner and Clara played them in the library or up-stairs in the school-room, with only {{themselves}} and the servants for audience. They were of a tragic and tremendous sort, and were performed with great energy and earnestness. They were dramatized (freely) from English history, and in them Mary Queen of Scots and Elizabeth had few holidays. The clothes were borrowed from the mother's wardrobe and the gowns were longer than necessary, {{but that was not}} regarded as a defect. In one of these plays Jean (three years old, perhaps) was Sir Francis Bacon. She was not dressed for the part, and did not have to say anything, but sat silent and decorous at a tiny table and was kept busy signing death-warrants. It was <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> office, for few entered those plays and got out of them alive.|$|E
