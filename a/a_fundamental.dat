5|$|Other vocalisations {{of wolves}} are usually {{divided into three}} categories: growls, barks and whines. Barking has <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> {{frequency}} between 320–904Hz, and is usually emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do, but bark {{a few times and}} retreat from perceived danger. Growling has <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> frequency of 380–450Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack. Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.|$|E

Friedländer's initial work introduced the Gram stain, <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> laboratory test still used today to identify and categorize bacteria.

5|$|Franklin Pierce (November 23, 1804October 8, 1869) was the 14th President of the United States (1853–57).

His polarizing actions in championing and signing the Kansas–Nebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act alienated anti-slavery groups while failing to stem conflict between North and South setting the stage for Southern secession and the American Civil War.
