25|$|Other {{interesting}} candidate pathways {{that may}} be important in the regulation of radiation-induced degenerative CNS changes are signal transduction pathways that are regulated by Cdk5. Cdk5 is a kinase that {{plays a key role}} in neural development; its <b>aberrant</b> <b>expression</b> and activation are associated with neurodegenerative processes, including Alzheimer’s disease. This kinase is up-regulated in neural cells following ionizing radiation exposure.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of the {{regulation}} of gene expression through chemical, non-mutational changes in DNA structure. The theory of epigenetics in cancer pathogenesis is that non-mutational changes to DNA can lead to alterations in gene expression. Normally, oncogenes are silent, for example, because of DNA methylation. Loss of that methylation can induce the <b>aberrant</b> <b>expression</b> of oncogenes, leading to cancer pathogenesis. Known mechanisms of epigenetic change include DNA methylation, and methylation or acetylation of histone proteins bound to chromosomal DNA at specific locations. Classes of medications, known as HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, can re-regulate the epigenetic signaling in the cancer cell.|$|E

30|$|As we {{discussed}} above, CAMs, which connect neurons with each other, {{play a key}} role in synapse formation and synaptic plasticity. Mounting evidence now connects several neurological disorders with CAMs, as many mutations or <b>aberrant</b> <b>expressions</b> of CAMs are associated with neurological disorders. For example, mutations in Nrxs and NLs are found in ASD patients (Südhof, 2008) and Eph receptor alterations are highly related with AD (Chen et al., 2012). Therefore, research on CAM function will help to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying pathogenic neurological disorders.|$|R

However, to date, limited evidence is available regarding whether using circulating free tumor mRNA to identify <b>aberrant</b> ALK <b>expression</b> is possible, and its feasibility remains to be clearly addressed. The present study evaluated ALK expression by a one-step reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay on the circulating free tumor mRNA from  12  lung adenocarcinoma patients. Additionally, the present study tested for ALK rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry. A molecular genetic characterization was performed on tumor tissues and plasma samples. <b>Aberrant</b> ALK <b>expression</b> was detected in  2 / 12  patients using mRNA purified from plasma specimens and the results agreed with the FISH and immunohistochemistry findings of solid biopsy samples. The detection of <b>aberrant</b> ALK <b>expression</b> on circulating free tumor RNA may be feasible using a one‑step real‑time PCR assay and may be particularly helpful when a solid biopsy sample is not available...|$|R

50|$|STAT5 {{has been}} found to be constitutively {{phosphorylated}} in cancer cells, implying that the protein is always present in its active form. This constant activation is brought about either by mutations or by <b>aberrant</b> <b>expressions</b> of cell signalling, resulting in poor regulation, or complete lack of control, of the activation of transcription for genes influenced by STAT5. This leads to constant and increased expression of these genes. For example, mutations may lead to increased expression of anti-apoptotic genes, the products of which actively prevent cell death. The constant presence of these products preserve the cell in spite of it having become cancerous, causing the cell to eventually become malignant.|$|R

30|$|It is {{estimated}} that approximately 30 % of the protein-coding genes are for integral membrane proteins (IMPs) in human (Overington et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2012).

50|$|While many {{association}} {{studies have}} identified unusual expression of long ncRNAs in disease states, {{there is little}} understanding of their role in causing disease. Expression analyses that compare tumor cells and normal cells have revealed changes in the expression of ncRNAs in several forms of cancer. For example, in prostate tumours, PCGEM1 (one of two overexpressed ncRNAs) is correlated with increased proliferation and colony formation suggesting an involvement in regulating cell growth. MALAT1 (also known as NEAT2) was originally identified as an abundantly expressed ncRNA that is upregulated during metastasis of early-stage {{non-small cell lung cancer}} and its overexpression is an early prognostic marker for poor patient survival rates. More recently, the highly conserved mouse homologue of MALAT1 was found to be highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. Intronic antisense ncRNAs with expression correlated to the degree of tumor differentiation in prostate cancer samples have also been reported. Despite a number of long ncRNAs having <b>aberrant</b> <b>expression</b> in cancer, their function and potential role in tumourogenesis is relatively unknown. For example, the ncRNAs HIS-1 and BIC have been implicated in cancer development and growth control, but their function in normal cells is unknown. In addition to cancer, ncRNAs also exhibit <b>aberrant</b> <b>expression</b> in other disease states. Overexpression of PRINS is associated with psoriasis susceptibility, with PRINS expression being elevated in the uninvolved epidermis of psoriatic patients compared with both psoriatic lesions and healthy epidermis.|$|E
40|$|Activation-induced {{cytidine}} deaminase (AID) induces somatic {{mutations in}} various host genes of non-lymphoid tissues, thereby contributing to carcinogenesis. We recently demonstrated that Helicobacter pylori infection and/or proinflammatory cytokine stimulation triggers <b>aberrant</b> AID <b>expression</b> in gastric epithelial cells, causing mutations in the tumour-suppressor TP 53 gene. The {{findings of the}} present study provide evidence of ectopic AID expression in Barrett's oesophagus and Barrett's oesophageal adenocarcinoma, a cancer that develops under chronic inflammatory conditions. Immunoreactivity for endogenous AID was observed in 24 of 28 (85. 7 %) specimens of the columnar cell-lined Barrett's oesophagus and in 20 of 22 (90. 9 %) of Barrett's adenocarcinoma, whereas weak or no AID protein expression was detectable in normal squamous epithelial cells of the oesophagus. We validated these results by analysing tissue specimens from another cohort comprising 16 cases with Barrett's oesophagus and four cases with Barrett's adenocarcinoma. In vitro treatment of human non-neoplastic oesophageal squamous-derived cells with sodium salt deoxycholic acid induced ectopic AID expression via the nuclear factor-kappaB activation pathway. These findings suggest that <b>aberrant</b> AID <b>expression</b> occurs in a substantial proportion of Barrett's epithelium, at least in part due to bile acid stimulation.

40|$|Cyclins {{are prime}} cell cycle {{regulators}} and {{are central to}} the control of major check points in eukaryotic cells. The <b>aberrant</b> <b>expressions</b> of two cyclins (i. e., cyclins A and D 1) have been observed in some cancers, suggesting they may be involved in loss of growth control. However, in spite of these occasional changes involving only two cyclins, there are no clear connections between general derangements of other cyclins or their dependent kinases in a single tumor type. We detected general cyclin overexpression in 3 of 3 breast tumor tissue samples. In addition, using proliferating normal vs. human tumor breast cells as a model system, we observed a number of alterations in cyclin expression: (i) an 8 -fold amplification of cyclin E gene in one tumor line, a 64 -fold overexpression of its mRNA, and altered expression of its protein; (ii) deranged expression of cyclin E protein in all (10 of 10) tumor cell lines studied; (iii) increased cyclin mRNA stability, resulting in (iv) general overexpression of RNAs and proteins for cyclins A and B and CDC 2 in 9 of 10 tumor lines and (v) deranged order of appearance of cyclins in synchronized tumor vs. normal cells, with mitotic cyclins appearing prior to G 1 cyclins.
