5|$|A thick {{regolith}} {{layer on}} the lower slopes of the mountains and a thin cover of debris on the upper slopes <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> by the relative absence of large boulders {{on the lower}} mountain flanks.|$|E
5|$|Because the A82 is a main through route, {{tourists}} <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> to use {{the older}} Military Road instead, {{so as to avoid}} the coach and HGV traffic. Cyclists and walkers can use the Great Glen Way between Fort Wiilam and Inverness. This is part of National Cycle Route 78 (The Caledonia Way) from Campbeltown to Inverness.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, when Cibber first rose to be Rich's right-hand man at Drury Lane, his perceived opportunism and brash, thick-skinned personality gave rise to many barbs in print, especially against his patchwork plays. The early attacks were mostly anonymous, but Daniel Defoe and Tom Brown <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> as potential authors. Later, Jonathan Swift, John Dennis and Henry Fielding all lambasted Cibber in print. The most famous conflict Cibber had was with Alexander Pope.|$|E

5000|$|Coniine from hemlock {{consumed}} by quail has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as the cause, though quail resist eating hemlock. Hellebore has also <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{as the source}} of the toxin. [...] It has also been asserted that this evidence points to the seeds of the annual woundwort (Stachys annua) being the causal agent. It has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that Galeopsis ladanum seeds are not responsible.|$|R
5|$|It {{was long}} {{believed}} that ceratopsians like Styracosaurus used their frills and horns in defence against the large predatory dinosaurs of the time. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on ceratopsid skulls are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study {{found no evidence}} for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, {{there is no evidence}} of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> as causes.|$|E
5|$|For acute {{cases in}} the leg, the ACCP {{recommended}} a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) {{for at least five}} days and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age.|$|E
5|$|In various recipes, other substitutions and {{additions}} <b>are</b> <b>suggested.</b> The Hairy Bikers (Dave Myers and Si King) suggest Welsh cheddar as {{an alternative}} to Caerphilly and propose that it should be served with a red onion and chilli pepper relish. An Australian recipe suggests Lancashire cheese {{as an alternative}} ingredient. Regarding the breadcrumbs, chef Bobby Freeman suggests using half brown and half white breadcrumbs, while the cookbook for the London-based restaurant Canteen proposes using a combination of boiled potatoes and breadcrumbs for the coating of the sausage.|$|E
50|$|Alauna <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> to <b>be</b> the Camelon that is {{near and}} {{to the west of}} Falkirk, or at Stirling, or Kier (about 4 mi NNW of Stirling, on the Allan Water), or the island of Inchkeith.

50|$|Brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor regulates {{the expression of}} DARPP-32. The Akt and CDK5/p35 intracelular pathway <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> to <b>be</b> involved on this regulation. Also, neuronal calcium sensor-1 <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> to modulate the expression of DARPP-32.|$|R
25|$|Hydrocarbon {{fracturing}} of oil-bearing formations is {{a potentially}} interesting and large-scale application. Nanocellulose has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{for use in}} oil recovery applications as a fracturing fluid. Drilling muds based on nanocellulose have also <b>been</b> <b>suggested.</b>|$|R
5|$|Inferior vena cava filters (IVC filters) {{are used}} on the {{presumption}} that they reduce PE, although their effectiveness and safety profile are not well established. In general, they are only recommended in some high risk scenarios. The ACCP recommended them for those with a contraindication to anticoagulant treatment but not in addition to anticoagulation, unless an individual with an IVC filter but without a risk for bleeding develops acute proximal DVT. In this case, both anticoagulation and an IVC filter <b>are</b> <b>suggested.</b> NICE recommends caval filters in settings where someone with an acute proximal DVT or PE cannot receive anticoagulation, and that the filter is removed when anticoagulation can be safely started. While IVC filters themselves {{are associated with a}} long-term risk of DVT, they are not reason enough to maintain extended anticoagulation.|$|E
5|$|The ACCP {{recommended}} {{treatment for}} three months in those with proximal DVT provoked by surgery. A three-month course is also recommended for those with proximal DVT provoked by a transient risk factor, and three months is suggested over lengthened treatment when bleeding risk is low to moderate. Unprovoked DVT patients {{should have at least}} three months of anticoagulation and be considered for extended treatment. Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked proximal DVT <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> for anticoagulation longer than three months unless there is a high risk of bleeding. In that case, three months is sufficient. Those with a second unprovoked VTE are recommended for extended treatment when bleeding risk is low, suggested for extended treatment when bleeding risk is moderate, and suggested {{for three months}} of anticoagulation in high-risk scenarios.|$|E
5|$|The Mitchell Freeway {{is planned}} to {{continue}} {{north to the}} Metropolitan Region Scheme's boundary, beyond Yanchep and Two Rocks. The state government announced in March 2012 {{the formation of the}} Mitchell Freeway Extension Community Working Group. The group worked with Main Roads Western Australia to investigate options for relieving congestion, with a focus on the next freeway extension. Several options were considered, before the group released a strategic business case in November 2012. The report recommends a staged approach, starting with intersection improvements between 2013 and 2015. This would be followed by a freeway extension to Hester Avenue, by 2017 and then an expressway standard extension to Romeo Road, Alkimos by 2021. Half-diamond interchanges <b>are</b> <b>suggested</b> for Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue.|$|E
50|$|Several {{theories}} <b>were</b> <b>suggested</b> surrounding their disappearance. At the time, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} Lonergans might have staged their disappearance. However, the Lonergans' bank accounts were never touched and their insurance policies were not claimed.|$|R
50|$|Based on morphology, Meyna has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{as likely}} {{candidate}} {{for inclusion in}} Canthium subgenus Canthium. In 2004, a molecular phylogenetic study showed that Meyna tetraphylla is related to Canthium and the transfer to Canthium <b>was</b> <b>suggested.</b>|$|R

As a result, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> that sense of security obtained through sharing of experiences of school refusal or hikikomori is factor and motivation in their relationship. Also, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> that their sensitivities to hurting others and other’s pain mediate their relationship. As regards the function of this community, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> that members of the community can share their experiential knowledge through the information magazines.
