6000|$|... "By jinks! {{but that}} was a narrow shave!" [...] gasped Dick, when they were safe. [...] "A little more and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> have been under the ice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother, I am glad; but, {{you see my}} state. It is for the child's sake I weep, {{that now}} never will be born. Had it won life even for an hour <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> have dwelt {{together}} in bliss until eternity. But it cannot be--it cannot be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' you're gettin' out of {{this part}} of the trouble mighty easy, if Amos insists you shall be left alone," [...] Jim added angrily. [...] "If I had my way, <b>all</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> take a turn at thumpin' you, an' then the account between us wouldn't be square." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{people ever}} {{made such a}} sacrifice. What, burn the city they {{consider}} sacred!--the old capital every Russian thinks of with pride! It never can be, but if they should do so, all I can say is, God help <b>us</b> <b>all.</b> Few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> ever go back to France." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we are friendly! <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us!</b> My father <b>would</b> do {{them any}} service in his power, {{consistent}} with his duty to--to--his business associates." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{thing is}} certain," [...] replied her great-uncle: [...] "that you shall {{not go out}} to seek him, nor must you tell him of your hiding-place, since soon or late this might mean that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> be destroyed, if only {{for the sake of}} the food which we have hoarded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] said Tibble, [...] "I {{could tell}} {{of one who}} would be true and {{faithful}} to your worship, and a loving husband to Mistress Dennet, ay, and would be a master that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> gladly cleave to. For he is godly after his lights, and sound-hearted, and wots what good work be, and can do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sweating {{like a house}} afire is good!" [...] murmured Giant, with a grin. [...] "Now if you {{had only}} said sweat like a stone, {{or a piece of}} iron, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> have known what you meant. As it is---" [...] And then he stopped and ducked, to escape the piece of dried mud Whopper playfully shied at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cadj, the High Priest," [...] he announced, [...] "would {{sacrifice}} {{you both}} to the Flaming God; but <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> except Cadj <b>would</b> gladly return to Opar with our queen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{should not}} speak so," [...] sighed Rachel. [...] "But, dear, I {{know it is}} because you love me, and I wish to die as easily as may be and to join my husband. Only if the child could have lived, as I think, <b>all</b> three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> have dwelt {{together}} eternally. Nay, not all three, all four, for you are well-nigh as dear to me, Nou, as husband or as child." ...|$|R
30|$|During the cogen session, Tang Wee {{explained}} to Tim and Nicky {{that the purpose}} of the cogen was to hear from them their views of the science lessons (authenticity) and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> involved <b>would</b> learn something from one another. Hence, they were encouraged to be constructive about the suggestions, be willing to share, and respectful so that no one was emotionally hurt. Changes, based upon their plausible suggestions, would be made to the science lessons (tacticity). Kenny also encouraged Tim and Nicky to speak up their minds.|$|R
60|$|I believe of a verity {{that had}} it not been for Hiram Griffin some, if not <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> have fallen into the hands of the lobster backs, for it is true that we were sadly confused--frightened if you choose to put it in such words, and had so far lost mastery of {{ourselves}} that but for his holding us up sharply to the work we would have come to grief.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, my lads, {{although}} I {{would not}} for the world terrify the dear child uselessly, by telling her {{that we are in}} danger, it must be clear to you that if a gale springs up and our raft should be broken up, it's not likely that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> be saved. Yet Polly might escape, and some of you also. We are all in the Lord's hands, however, and have nothing to fear if we are His followers." ...|$|E
6000|$|She had a {{very pretty}} way of saying Timothy, so David and I went into another room to leave her alone with the {{manuscript}} of this poor little book, and when we returned she had the greatest surprise of the day for me. She was both laughing and crying, which was no surprise, for <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> laugh and cry over a book about such an interesting subject as ourselves, but said she, [...] "How wrong you are in thinking this book is about me and mine, it {{is really all about}} Timothy." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the night}} of 14 September 1944, , , and , parachuted into Slovakia; the jump was dubbed [...] "Operation Amsterdam". Reik had planned to join the jump but British {{authorities}} refused to allow her to—they knew the Germans had copies of their standing orders prohibiting female soldiers to cross enemy lines, so they thought if she were captured she would almost certainly be executed as a spy rather than taken prisoner as a soldier. Haim Hermesh later remembered that Reik burst into tears and said, [...] "what will become of me? ... We promised that <b>all</b> four <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> go together!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} will find the berth a {{pleasant}} one. Of course, I don't know what arrangements will be made, or whether you would permanently live on board one of the boats. If so, I think you would be envied by <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> as you <b>would</b> get away from the dust, and <b>all</b> the discomforts <b>of</b> the encampment." ...|$|R
2500|$|... : President Benigno Aquino III said [...] "On a more {{personal}} note, I recall with gratitude and humility the kind words he told me {{during his visit to}} the Philippines when I was still a Representative. He told me then, 'You chose your parents well. My mother admired him; like <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> she <b>would</b> have been deeply saddened by his passing'. On behalf of the entire Filipino people, I extend our deepest condolences to the family of Mr. Mandela, the people of South Africa, and all men and women of peace and goodwill who mourn the passing of a truly great man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Baas, I {{think the}} old baas is kransick and not safe. He {{looks like one}} {{who is going to}} harm someone. Now, baas, suppose I let my gun off by accident; you know we {{coloured}} people are very careless with guns! The Heer Marais would never be troubled with any more fancies, and you and the Missie Marie and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> be safer. Also, you could not be blamed, nor could I, for who can help an accident? Guns will go off sometimes, baas, when you don't want them to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, Guy, it {{was under}} your {{direction}} that all things were done. It is to the leader who directs that the first praise is due {{rather than to the}} strongest and bravest of his men-at-arms. It was, too, owing to your interference on behalf of Count Charles d'Estournel that we owe it that succour came to us; it was his friendship for you that prompted him to gather his friends to come to our aid; and it was the warning, short though it was, sent us by that strange Italian that enabled you to send to the count for aid. I must see his daughter and thank her personally for the part she played in the matter. No, Guy, {{had it not been for}} you this house would now have been an empty shell, and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> have been lying under its ruins. I have been thinking during the night that you must be most careful when you go abroad; you know that the son of that monster Caboche, the leader of the skinners, and doubtless many leaders of the butchers, among them Legoix, were killed, and their friends are certain to endeavour to take vengeance on you. They saw you at the window, they will know that you are my esquire, and will doubtless put down their defeat entirely to you. You cannot be too careful, and, above all, you must not venture out at night save on grave occasion. Agnes," [...] she broke off as the girl entered the room, [...] "you too must thank our brave esquire for having so stoutly defended us." ...|$|E
6000|$|Viewed {{simply as}} an {{institution}} for a Christian and mature mind, {{nothing could be more}} perfect than the Puritan Sabbath: if it had any failing, it was in the want of adaptation to children, and to those not interested in its peculiar duties. If you had been in the dwelling of my uncle of a Sabbath morning, you must have found the unbroken stillness delightful; the calm and quiet must have soothed and disposed you for contemplation, and the evident appearance of single-hearted devotion to the duties of the day in the elder part of the family must have been a striking addition to the picture. But, then, if your eye had watched attentively the motions of us juveniles, you might have seen that what was so very invigorating to the disciplined Christian was a weariness to young flesh and bones. Then there was not, as now, the intellectual relaxation afforded by the Sunday school, with its various forms of religious exercise, its thousand modes of interesting and useful information. Our whole stock in this line was the Bible and Primer, and these were our main dependence for whiling away the tedious hours between our early breakfast and the signal for meeting. How often was our invention stretched to find wherewithal to keep up our stock of excitement in a line with the duties of the day! For the first half hour, perhaps, a story in the Bible answered our purpose very well; but, having despatched the history of Joseph, or the story of the ten plagues, we then took to the Primer: and then there was, first, the looking over the system of theological and ethical teaching, commencing, [...] "In Adam's fall we sinned all," [...] and extending through three or four pages of pictorial and poetic embellishment. Next was the death of John Rogers, who was burned at Smithfield; and for a while we could entertain ourselves with counting all his [...] "nine children and one at the breast," [...] as in the picture they stand in a regular row, like a pair of stairs. These being done, came miscellaneous exercises of our own invention, such as counting all the psalms in the psalm book, backward and forward, to and from the Doxology, or numbering the books in the Bible, or some other such device as we deemed within the pale of religious employments. When all these failed, and it still wanted an hour of meeting time, we looked up at the ceiling, and down at the floor, and all around into every corner, to see what we could do next; and happy was he who could spy a pin gleaming in some distant crack, and forthwith muster an occasion for getting down to pick it up. Then there was the infallible recollection that we wanted a drink of water, as an excuse to get out to the well; or else we heard some strange noise among the chickens, and insisted that it was essential that we should see what was the matter; or else pussy would jump on to the table, when <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> spring to drive her down; while there was a most assiduous watching of the clock to see when the first bell would ring. Happy was it for us, in the interim, if we did not begin to {{look at each other and}} make up faces, or slyly slip off and on our shoes, or some other incipient attempts at roguery, which would gradually so undermine our gravity that there would be some sudden explosion of merriment, whereat Uncle Phineas would look up and say, [...] "Tut, tut," [...] and Aunt Kezzy would make a speech about wicked children breaking the Sabbath day. I remember once how my cousin Bill got into deep disgrace one Sunday by a roguish trick. He was just about to close his Bible with all sobriety, when snap came a grasshopper through an open window, and alighted in the middle of the page. Bill instantly kidnapped the intruder, for so important an auxiliary in the way of employment was not to be despised. Presently we children looked towards Bill, and there he sat, very demurely reading his Bible, with the grasshopper hanging by one leg from the corner of his mouth, kicking and sprawling, without in the least disturbing Master William's gravity. We all burst into an uproarious laugh. But it came to be rather a serious affair for Bill, as his good father was in the practice of enforcing truth and duty by certain modes of moral suasion much recommended by Solomon, though fallen into disrepute at the present day.|$|E
2500|$|The {{neighborhood}} {{was also the}} home of other famous jazz clubs, including Club Alabam (next door), the Last Word (across the street), and the Downbeat (nearby). Even local musicians who were playing at other Central Avenue clubs would gather at the Dunbar.

5000|$|Discussing public {{reception}} of her character, Mealing states that: [...] "The {{response has been}} amazing - from men, women and children.

I think there's a little in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that <b>would</b> like to say what we really feel, the way Connie does". Mealing has received several award nominations for the role; ranking seventh 'Best Actress' in the 2004 BBC Drama Awards, being nominated 'Best Actress' in the 2005 TV Quick Awards, and 'Best Newcomer' in the 2005 National TV Awards.|$|R

5000|$|In 2003, McLaughlin {{was quoted}} about his happenstance {{of being a}} politician, saying he entered [...] "politics quite by accident... I don't {{particularly}} like politics, and I have no ego for it, quite frankly... I guess <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> say it's disproportionately influenced by money.

60|$|We unbent. Our inhibitions and taciturnities vanished. We were {{as if we}} {{had known}} each other for years and years, and we pledged {{ourselves}} to years of future voyagings together. The harpooner told of misadventures and secret shames. Scotty wept over his poor old mother in Edinburgh--a lady, he insisted, gently born--who was in reduced circumstances, who had pinched herself to pay the lump sum to the ship-owners for his apprenticeship, whose sacrificing dream had been to see him a merchantman officer and a gentleman, and who was heartbroken because he had deserted his ship in Australia and joined another as a common sailor before the mast. And Scotty proved it. He drew her last sad letter from his pocket and wept over it as he read it aloud. The harpooner and I wept with him, and swore that <b>all</b> three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> ship on the whaleship Bonanza, win a big pay-day, and, still together, make a pilgrimage to Edinburgh and lay our store of money in the dear lady's lap.|$|R
