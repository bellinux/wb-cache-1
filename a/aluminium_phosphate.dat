Later glass and enamel were also used, and in modern times more sophisticated porcelain, plastics, and various assembled, pressed, bonded, and sintered products (composed of various copper and aluminium compounds) have been developed: examples of the latter include [...] "Viennese turquoise", made from precipitated <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphate</b> coloured by copper oleate; and [...] "neolith", a mixture of bayerite and copper phosphate. Most of these products differ markedly from natural turquoise in both physical and chemical properties, but in 1972 Pierre Gilson introduced one fairly close to a true synthetic (it does differ in chemical composition owing to a binder used, meaning it is best described as a simulant rather than a synthetic).

40|$|SUMMARY. Compositions of nine hydrous <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphates</b> are {{considered}} {{with respect to}} the AI, P, and H contents per 8 oxygens, and it is suggested that when the ratio (A 1. P) /H is less than oq 1 (or (A 1. P 2) /H zis less than oo 0 such compositions do not crystallize. Examples are bolivarite and evansite. I X is realized, of course, that the tendency to crystallize is thermodynamically depen-dent upon the crystal energy in accordance with the Born-Haber elations, but this tendency may be overwhelmed by kinetic considerations, more often than not. Geologically speaking this means: the time during which the crystal was exposed to a particular temperature and pressure, the magnitude of temperature and pressure, and their rates of change [...] given a particular composition. Little is known about such factors in connection with the series of hydrous <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphates</b> under con-sideration; we know merely that they are secondary minerals. Here, the tendency to crystallize will be shown {{to be related to the}} compositions through empiricism.

50|$|This immensely long {{weathering}} time {{means that}} nutrient levels in Northern Australian soils are exceptionally low because practically all soluble minerals {{have long been}} weathered out.

40|$|L. Pr 6 v 6 t & R. Trompette SUMMARY: Samples from {{different}} occurrences (trenches or borings) of late Precambrian phosphate deposits in Upper Volta were studied. At Kodjari, the phosphorites are fine-grained and clayey; in cores they are calcareous {{in the lower}} part but siliceous above. At Arly the phosphorites are coarse and the grains are frequently rimmed by fibrous apatite and recrystal-lized. The phosphate mineral is a fluorapatite with a low CO, content, generally < l %, but with an excess of Ca and F. 3 trace elements are present in notable quantity: Sr, Ba and Mn. The primary deposit was formed in a carbonaceous environment with abundant biological activity. Recrystallization is probably due to deep diagenesis. At the surface, weathering produces <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphates.</b> The occurrence of Precambrian phosphorites in the Volta Basin has been described, including a review of their structure and stratigraphy, by Trompette et al.

40|$|The wet air {{oxidation}} (WAO) process generates residual solids {{that can}} be landfilled without additional treatment. This practical advantage stems from the intrinsic leaching-resistant behaviour of the solids, which {{is linked to the}} treatment conditions in water at high temperature and to the composition of the solids. X-ray analysis confirmed that the fine powder (diameter 2 - 6 mu m) mainly comprises <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphates,</b> kaolin, quartz, calcite and an amorphous fraction which immobilises heavy metals in the form of hydroxides, carbonates and insoluble phosphates. The residual solids contain a low amount of organic matter (1 - 2 wt. % TOC, depending on the process parameters).

40|$|Several {{different}} varieties of sedimentary phosphatic deposits of Neogene age {{occur on the}} southern and western continental margins of southern Africa.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 223 - 232. Alkylphenols are {{intermediates}} used in {{the synthesis}} of many important substances. The most signiﬁcant of the commercially important lower alkylphenols are cresols (methyl phenols) and xylenols (dimethyl phenols). The main markets for alkylphenol products are nonionic detergents, phenolic resins, polymer additives and agrochemicals. Of the western world cresol market, 55 % originates from synthetic cresols whereas 45 % originates from so-called “natural” cresols obtained from coal tars and reﬁnery caustics. The methylation of phenol is the only process speciﬁcally developed to produce cresols and xylenols. There are three cresol isomers, namely ortho, para and meta. It is possible to produce a high selectivity to o-cresol by alkylation of phenol with methanol over a basic or a Al 2 O 3 catalyst or a Fe/V catalyst. A mixture of the cresol isomers can be obtained over aluminium oxides with strong acid sites, silica alumina, zeolites, <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphates</b> and phosphoric acid-Kieselguhr catalysts. However, direct synthesis of high purity m-cresol and p-cresol is desirable due to {{the high costs of}} separating these two isomers. Thus to synthesize p-cresol, a m-cresol free or very low m-cresol concentration in the product is desirable for puriﬁcation reasons and a high p/o-cresol ratio is also desirable in the product for yield reasons since separation of the p- and the o-cresols is economically possible...|$|R

40|$|Septic tanks with {{subsequent}} soil treatment systems (STS) {{are a common}} treatment technique for domestic wastewater in rural areas. Phosphorus (P) leakage from such systems may pose a risk to water quality (especially if they are located relatively close to surface waters). In this study, six STS in Sweden (11 - 28 years old) were examined. Samples taken from the unsaturated subsoil beneath the distribution pipes were investigated by means of batch and column experiments, and accumulated phosphorus were characterized through X-ray absorption near edge structure () CANES) analysis. At all sites the wastewater had clearly influenced the soil. This was observed through decreased pH, increased amounts of oxalate extractable metals and at some sites altered P sorption properties. The amount of accumulated P in the STS {{were found to be}} between 0. 32 and 0. 87 kg m(- 3), which in most cases was just a fraction of the estimated P load (< 30 %). Column studies revealed that high P concentrations (up to 6 mg L- 1) were leached from the material when deionized water was applied. However, the response to deionized water varied between the sites. As evidenced by XANES analysis, <b>aluminium</b> <b>phosphates</b> or P adsorbed to aluminium (hydr) oxides, as well as organically bound P, were important sinks for P. Generally soils with a high content of oxalate-extractable Al were also less vulnerable to P leakage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
