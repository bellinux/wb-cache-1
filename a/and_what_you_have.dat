Diamond was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997 and died in March 2001, aged 47. One of his last messages to Lawson was, [...] "How proud I am of you <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> become. The great thing about us is that we have made us who we are." [...] His death occurred during the filming of Nigella Bites; [...] "I took a fortnight off. But I'm not a great believer in breaks", Lawson explained; she suffered a bout of depression following the funeral. After Diamond's death, Lawson kept all of the press clippings in what she called her [...] "Morbidobox".|$|E

2500|$|Connolly credits one of John Bradshaw's {{publications}} {{with helping}} him {{deal with his}} past demons. [...] "He reckons that if this trauma happened {{to you when you}} were five or six then, emotionally, that part of you remains five or six. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do is carry that five- or six-year-old around with you and try and emotionally help that other part of you. It sounds a bit airy-fairy, but I think he's something of a genius, Mr. Bradshaw." ...|$|E

'Did I?' said Squeers; 'well, it {{was rather}} a startling thing for a {{stranger}} to come and recommend himself by saying that he knew all about <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> your name was, and why you were living so quiet here, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> boned, <b>and</b> who you boned it from, wasn't it?' ...|$|R

2500|$|IGN's Staci Krause {{scored the}} game 7.8 out of 10, writing [...] "It is rare that a PC game, {{especially}} a point and click adventure, {{can give you}} that edge of your seat feel. Dark Fall: The Journal, definitely does this. Although it's not the most technologically advanced of games, it has a gripping story coupled with subtle nuances that add a dimension of fear to the experience. Add in some puzzles {{and a lot of}} investigating <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> is a pretty decent game." ...|$|E
2500|$|... ”You say: ‘We worship {{stones and}} walls and boards.’ But {{it is not}} so, O Emperor; but they serve us for remembrance and encouragement, lifting our slow spirits upwards, by those whose names the {{pictures}} bear and whose representations they are. And we worship them not as God, as you maintain, God forbid!... Even the little children mock at you. Go into one of their schools, {{say that you are}} the enemy of images, and straightway they will throw their little tablets at your head, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> failed to learn from the wise you may pick up from the foolish... In virtue of the power which has come down to us from St. Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, we might inflict a punishment upon you, but since you have invoked one on yourself, have that, you and the counsellors you have chosen... though you have so excellent a high priest, our brother Germanus, whom you ought to have taken into your counsels as father and teacher[...] [...] [...] The dogmas of the Church are not a matter for the emperor, but for the bishops.” ...|$|E
