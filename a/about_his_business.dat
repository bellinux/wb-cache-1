Meanwhile, Dwight, Jim, and Harry rush to the company in an attempt to win the client, only to hear that the company has gone with Andy. After Andy wins the client, he calls Robert and offers him the client if Robert will re-hire him. Robert is furious at his attempt to blackmail him, and hangs up on Andy.

This piques David's interest, who allows Andy to come into his home and talk to him <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>business</b> proposal.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about the real nature of Gryce's retreat from jazz, as this period is {{characterized}} by a great deal of misunderstanding and rumor. Gryce revealed very little <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>business</b> hardships, but what is known is that his publishing business encountered financial troubles in the early 1960s, with many musicians withdrawing from Melotone and Totem. Many of his colleagues believe that powerful interests considered Gryce's publishing activities a threat, and were forcing him out of business. Rumors circulated about intimidation and threats to his family. While these rumors have not been confirmed, Gryce's behavior became extremely introverted and erratic during this time. He dissolved his publishing companies in 1963 and gave up his music career, thereafter adopting his Islamic name entirely, Basheer Quisim.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{problems}} have arisen {{when attempting to}} establish where detours and leave from duty take an employee out of {{the course of his}} employment. One idea which is used in this area is that an employer will only be found liable where an employee is going <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>business</b> in a standard way. For example, a minor detour would not take an employee out of the course of his employment, but a 'frolic of his own', which did not at all involve his duties, would. Journeys to and from work, and whether these are regarded as in the course of employment, were considered in Smith v Stages, where Lord Lowry established several factors for determining liability. Ordinarily, employees will not be in the course of employment travelling to and from work, unless their transport is provided by their employer. However, travelling to an alternative place of work or to a workplace, during the employer's time, will be in the course of employment. Where course of employment generally begins with travelling to work has been established in the case of Compton v McClure. Here, an employer was found liable for the negligent driving of an employee, who, in an effort to clock in on time, injured another employee at the place of employment. It was stated that the 'least artificial place' to establish employment began was at the gates of the employer's factory, where they established speed limits, and supervised conduct.|$|E

ESPN included Butler's 2012 recruiting class among its top recruiting classes from teams in non-BCS conferences, noting Dunham was listed as an ESPN Top 100 recruit and is [...] "a sniper to run off screens and create movement in the halfcourt sets {{for the next four}} years." [...] In ESPN's scouting report, Dunham was listed as the 78th best overall player, {{due in large part to}} the fact that what he [...] "does really well is shoot the basketball. [...] How he goes <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>business</b> is akin to a master craftsman applying his trade. Dunham is in constant motion, working to get himself in position to score and he's typically shot-ready." [...] Rivals listed him as the best shooter among all recruits of non-BCS teams.

500|$|Hoffman {{was long}} {{regarded}} as one of the great teammates in baseball. He was known as a leader in the clubhouse and a tutor to younger players. He mentored his successor in San Diego, Heath Bell, and the pitcher who supplanted him in Milwaukee, John Axford. [...] "Just watching him go <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>business</b> was a big thing to me", Bell said. In his first game pitching setup to Axford after losing his closer role, Hoffman stayed in the dugout to watch Axford finish. Many relievers retire back to the clubhouse after being removed from a game. Hoffman's teammates noticed that he stayed supporting Axford through a bases-loaded jam. Axford [...] spent the season absorbing Hoffman's advice, and the two bonded. [...] "He took young players under his wing, especially relief pitchers", said former Padres teammate Brad Ausmus. Hoffman regularly organized team dinners on the road or had team family gatherings at his home, whether it was with the Padres or the Brewers. [...] "It's very unusual for a pitcher, especially a relief pitcher, to be the team leader", Padres first baseman Phil Nevin said in 2002, [...] "but everybody here looks to Trevor. This is his team." ...|$|E
500|$|Hallie Rubenhold's 2005 book The Covent Garden Ladies {{sets out}} her {{interpretation}} of the story behind Harris's List. [...] She claims that John Harrison—otherwise known as Jack Harris, a savvy businessman and pimp {{who worked at the}} Shakespear's Head Tavern in Covent Garden—was the list's originator. [...] Born perhaps around 1720–1730, Harris apparently had expert knowledge of prostitutes working in Covent Garden and beyond, as well as access to rented rooms and premises for his clients' use. [...] He kept a record of the women he pimped and the properties he had access to, possibly {{in the form of a}} small ledger or notebook. [...] Derrick, having previously authored The Memoirs of the Shakespear's Head, and possibly also its companion piece, The Memoirs of the Bedford Coffee House, was probably familiar with the Shakespear's Head. [...] The former book details [...] "Jack, a waiter... who presides over the Venereal Pleasures of this Dome", and its author likely studied Harris as he went <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>business.</b> [...] Which of the two men first thought to produce Harris's List is unknown, but probably for a one-off payment Harris allowed his name to be attached to it. [...] With his detailed knowledge of Covent Garden, and with help from various associates, Derrick was therefore able to write the first edition of Harris's List in 1757. [...] As an aspiring author and social climber he preferred not to associate himself publicly with such questionable material, and his name therefore does not appear on any editions.|$|E

2500|$|Randel wrote {{afterwards}} that in {{the course}} of his work he [...] "was arrested by the Sheriff, on numerous suits instituted ... for trespass and damage by ... workmen, in passing over grounds, cutting off branches of trees. , to make surveys under instructions from the Commissioners." [...] In August 1808, Randel was sued by a landowner in 1808 for trespass and causing damage to the landowner's property, such as cutting down trees and trampling on crops; $5000 was requested in damages, but the landowner received only $109.63, just enough to cover his court costs. Nonetheless, the potential for future problems was real. Gouverneur Morris asked the Common Council for a means of protecting the necessary actions of the surveyors, but, for political reasons, the council could not agree on a solution, and passed the buck, again, to the state legislature. With the Commissioners threatening to resign if something wasn't done about the [...] "vexatious interruptions", the legislature acted in 1809 with a law providing that if the needed actions to perform the survey could not be performed [...] "without cuting trees or doing damages ... reasonable notice" [...] was to be provided by the Commission or the surveyors to the landowner, and they were to view the property together to assess the situation. [...] The landowner was to present a bill for [...] "reasonable damages", which the city was to pay within 30 days; any disagreement among the parties as to what was reasonable would, of course, end up in court. [...] The new law did not completely stop lawsuits, but it cut down their number, and allowed Randel to go <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>business</b> with a degree of immunity from legal entanglements.|$|E
