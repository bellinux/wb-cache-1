25|$|Not much {{is known}} about the ancient Celtic lyre, only that it was used by Celtic bards since the 8th century BC and that it was later well known in Rome, where it was called lyra. Its {{resonator}} was made from wood, while only few components were made from bones. The instrument's strings were made from <b>animal</b> <b>intestine.</b> The Gauls and other Celtic peoples regarded the crwth as a symbol of their independent musical culture, although they had probably received it from the Ancient Greeks. The Goths invoked their tribal gods with prayers and chants, which they accompanied by lyre play. By the time of the Barbarian Invasions in the 5th century AD the lyre had become the most important stringed instrument of the Germanic tribes and was a six-stringed wooden lyre with hollow ledger arms and wooden vortices in the ledger rod. The original Celtic lyre however came with different numbers of strings, as the Lyre of Paule, which is depicted on a statue from Côtes d'Armor in Brittany, apparently had seven strings.|$|E

50|$|Classical guitar strings are strings {{manufactured}} {{for use on}} classical guitars. While steel-string {{acoustic guitar}} strings and electric guitar strings are made of metal, modern classical guitar strings are made of nylon and nylon wound with wire, which produces a different sound to the metal strings. Classical guitar strings were originally made with <b>animal</b> <b>intestine</b> and silk wound with <b>animal</b> <b>intestine</b> up until World War II, when war restrictions led Albert Augustine Ltd. to develop nylon strings. Nylon guitar strings were put into production in 1948. Strings made from Fluorocarbon polymers have since been developed and are the main alternative to nylon strings.|$|E

50|$|During {{the medieval}} era, {{instrument}} development varied {{from country to}} country. Middle Eastern rebecs represented breakthroughs in terms of shape and strings, with a half a pear shape using three strings. Early versions of the violin and fiddle, by comparison, emerged in Europe through instruments such as the gittern, a four stringed precursor to the guitar, and basic lutes. These instruments typically used catgut (<b>animal</b> <b>intestine)</b> and other materials, including silk, for their strings.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{originates}} {{from the}} word sale (salt) with a termination (ame) that in Italian indicates a collective noun. Thus, it originally meant [...] "all kinds of salted (meats)". The Italian tradition of cured meats includes several styles, and the word salame soon specifically meant only the most popular kind—a salted and spiced meat, ground and extruded into an elongated, thin casing (usually cleaned <b>animal</b> <b>intestine),</b> then left to undergo natural fermentation for days, months, or even years.|$|E

Upon creating a cellulose casing, using the [...] "viscose" [...] process (also used in rayon) he realized the product stuffed well, linked, {{and was able to}} withstand the smokehouse. Quite by accident, he discovered that when the casing was removed from the product the sausages retained their shape and were firm. This {{was the beginning of the}} skinless frankfurter or hot dog.|$|E
50|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>intestine</b> is {{the most}} {{resilient}} material used to make tennis strings. It has better tension retention than any other material, and also is softer than any other material used for tennis strings. It provides the most energy return, meaning it {{is the most}} efficient string. It remains soft at high tensions while other materials tend to stiffen dramatically. This allows gut string to enable players to string rather tightly to improve ball control without losing much rebound efficiency (power) and without greatly increasing impact shock, which can hurt the elbow and other joints.|$|E
50|$|Eskimos used open boats called umiaks, and {{the smaller}} kayaks, to hunt large sea mammals. Both vessels were made of a {{driftwood}} frame, covered with tightly sewn seal skins. Sleds and dog teams were used for winter travel, and during the summer, dogs were used as pack animals. Women were skilled in basketry and sewing. They stitched and fitted waterproof garments made of <b>animal</b> <b>intestine</b> and fish skins. The Eskimos' everyday clothing of trousers, boots, and coats was sewn from skins and fur, sometimes in complex geometric designs. The coats, which were called parkas, featured an attached hood and a ruff of wolf or bear fur.|$|E
50|$|Catgut {{is a type}} of cord that is {{prepared}} from the natural fibre found in the walls of <b>animal</b> <b>intestines.</b> Catgut makers usually use sheep or goat intestines, but occasionally use the intestines of cattle, hogs, horses, mules, or donkeys. Despite the name, catgut manufacturers do not use cat intestines.|$|R
50|$|Goldbeater's skin is a {{sheet of}} tissue {{traditionally}} used {{in the process of}} making gold leaf by goldbeating. The skin consists of the processed outer membrane of an <b>animal's</b> <b>intestine,</b> typically an ox, and is interleaved with gold stock to facilitate batch production of many leaves at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|Anaerobes—these are obligate anaerobes that cannot {{tolerate}} oxygen even if {{they are}} not fixing nitrogen. They live in habitats low in oxygen, such as soils and decaying vegetable matter. Clostridium is an example. Sulphate-reducing bacteria are important in ocean sediments (e.g. Desulfovibrio), and some Archean methanogens, like Methanococcus, fix nitrogen in muds and <b>animal</b> <b>intestines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{frame of}} rackets for all sports was {{traditionally}} made of laminated wood and {{the strings of}} <b>animal</b> <b>intestine</b> known as catgut. The traditional racket size was limited by the strength and weight of the wooden frame {{which had to be}} strong enough to hold the strings and stiff enough to hit the ball or shuttle. Manufacturers started adding non-wood laminates to wood rackets to improve stiffness. Non-wood rackets were made first of steel, then of aluminium, and then carbon fiber composites. Wood is still used for real tennis, rackets, and xare. Most rackets are now made of composite materials including carbon fibre or fiberglass, metals such as titanium alloys, or ceramics.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pitch of}} a string can also be varied by {{changing}} the linear density (mass per unit length) of the string. In practical applications, such as with double bass strings or bass piano strings, extra weight is added to strings by winding them with metal. A string with a heavier metal winding produces a lower pitch than a string of equal length without a metal winding. This {{can be seen on}} a 2016-era set of gut strings for double bass. The higher-pitched G string is often made of synthetic material, or sometimes <b>animal</b> <b>intestine,</b> with no metal wrapping. To enable the low E string to produce a much lower pitch with a string of the same length, it is wrapped with many wrappings of thin metal wire. This adds to its mass without making it too stiff. The frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the linear density: ...|$|E
5000|$|Induction of {{secretion}} {{by external}} cues other than contact with host cells also {{takes place in}} vivo, in infected organisms. The bacteria sense such cues as temperature, pH, osmolarity and oxygen levels, {{and use them to}} [...] "decide" [...] whether to activate their T3SS. For instance, Salmonella can replicate and invade better in the ileum rather than in the cecum of <b>animal</b> <b>intestine.</b> The bacteria are able to know where they are thanks to the different ions present in these regions; the ileum contains formate and acetate, while the cecum does not. The bacteria sense these molecules, determine that they are at the ileum and activate their secretion machinery. Molecules present in the cecum, such as propionate and butyrate, provide a negative cue to the bacteria and inhibit secretion. Cholesterol, a lipid found in most eukaryotic cell membranes, is able to induce secretion in Shigella.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>intestines</b> have {{multiple}} uses. [...] From each species of livestock {{that is a}} source of milk, a corresponding rennet is obtained from the intestines of milk-fed [...] [...] Pig and calf intestines are eaten, and pig intestines are used as sausage casings. Calf intestines supply calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP), and are used to make goldbeater's skin.|$|R
500|$|Crickets {{have many}} natural enemies and {{are subject to}} various {{pathogens}} and parasites.
