40|$|One of {{the core}} {{responsibilities}} of any government to its citizens is financial accountability and transparency. This is to re-assure the stakeholders {{that the government is}} people oriented and enables the stakeholders to hold the government in power accountable to its electoral promises. In Nigeria therefore, financial dealings of the government and its parastatals has been shrouded in secrecy. It will be worthy to note that, the remuneration of national assembly members and many state governors are not made known to the public. And when this is rarely done, full details of their financial transactions are not disclosed. Unlike in the private sector, where financial disclosures are made known to owners of the business (Shareholders) at the Annual General Meetings (AGM), the public sector in Nigeria has not emulated this. However, pockets of state governors in Nigeria have attempted to do this manually by engaging in ‘town hall’ meetings to discuss their revenue and expenditure, this does not have far reaching impact on the citizens in this information technology age. Therefore, egovernance platform is imperative for government to reach a wider audience in term of impact and delivery. The question therefore is that, is Nigerian government both at the federal, state and local government engaging this platform to disclose their financial transactions? And rarely when they do, are they making full disclosures of the financial activities? A government that discloses its financial activities would enable stakeholders analyzes its performance and asks questions on the financial prudency of the state and this would prevent corruption and theft of peoples’ collective/common wealth. This study analyzed the contents of various government parastatals website to determine whether these agencies make financial disclosure {{and the extent to which}} those disclosures are made. In addition, the study will also consider whether stakeholders are allowed to contribute or suggest alternative(s) in form of feedback to the government. It is therefore recommended that the audited financial report/statement which is a stewardship report showing how the common wealth allocated has been utilized. As such, the Financial Reporting Council and other government regulatory bodies should endeavor to mandate Ministries to place on their various websites a copy of the <b>audited</b> <b>account</b> of the Ministries and perhaps a copy of such report sent to appropriate quarters to ensure complianc...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the effect of analytical review results on auditors' effort of <b>auditing</b> <b>accounting</b> estimates. Other objectives involve examining the moderating effect of personality traits (optimism), patterns-for-coping (vigilance), and level of experience on auditors' effort of <b>auditing</b> <b>accounting</b> estimates. In examining the effects of optimism and vigilance on <b>auditing</b> <b>accounting</b> estimates, the study makes a significant original contribution to the extant literature in audit judgement. The subjects were public accountants at different levels from both Big Six as well as non-Big Six firms. The findings of the study indicate that auditors' perceptions to extend tests of details related to the balances of the accounting estimates, according to the audit hours allocated to the budgeted time plan, did vary significantly across treatment groups. The analytical review results and the two dimensions of the individual psychological differences influenced their confidence in their assignment of the audit effort. Analytical review results were found to affect the <b>audit</b> plan for <b>accounting</b> estimates when these results signaled fluctuations. However, the conservatism tendency found by previous studies {{was found to be}} valid in this study. Optimism dimension was significant in moderating auditors' judgement yet vigilance and experience level were inconclusive in their influence...|$|R
