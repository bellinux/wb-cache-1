5|$|More recently, June Schlueter {{has found}} {{evidence}} that Martin the Elder was in London when the engraver of the First Folio portrait {{was known to be}} in Madrid. Although she began her archival research hoping to prove Edmond's <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> elder Martin was the Shakespeare engraver, Schlueter concludes that the newly discovered evidence actually supports the younger.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{publications}} have repeated Doyle's unsupported <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wartime photograph inspired Miller's poster, Westinghouse historian Charles A. Ruch, a Pittsburgh {{resident who}} had been friends with J. Howard Miller, said that Miller {{was not in the}} habit of working from photographs, but rather live models. Penny Coleman, the author of Rosie the Riveter: Women working on the home front in World War II, said that she and Ruch could not determine whether the wartime photo had appeared in any of the periodicals that Miller would have seen.|$|E
5|$|Browning, Gyles' attorney, cited a case {{which had}} also {{appeared}} before Hardwicke, that of Read v Hodges. In that case, a publisher attempted {{to circumvent the}} rights of the author of Czar Peter the Great by including all three volumes in one and cutting several pages. Hardwicke rejected the argument, however, declaring that the former case had been decided merely on a motion, and that he had given his decision and statements without the thought he would have given a normal hearing. Hardwicke further took contention with the Attorney General for England and Wales' <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Statute of Anne provided a publishing monopoly, instead interpreting the act as one meant to promote public education and the public good.|$|E

5|$|In 1887 Michelson {{proposed}} {{the use of}} optical interferometers for the measurement of length, work which contributed to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1907. In 1952 the CIPM {{proposed the}} use of wavelength of a specific light source as the standard for defining length, and in 1960 the CGPM accepted this proposal using radiation corresponding to a transition between specified energy levels of the krypton 86 atom as the new standard for the metre. By 1975, when the second had been {{defined in terms of}} a physical phenomenon rather than the earth's rotation and Einstein's <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> speed of light was constant, the CGPM authorised the CIPM to investigate the use of the speed of light {{as the basis for the}} definition of the metre. This proposal was accepted in 1983.|$|E
5|$|To {{support its}} <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sultan of Johor {{did not have}} {{sovereignty}} over Pedra Branca, Singapore contended that the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory. Thus, the only reliable way {{to determine whether a}} particular territory belonged to a ruler was to find out whether the inhabitants pledged allegiance to that ruler. This was difficult to do with respect to Pedra Branca since it was isolated and uninhabited, and Malaysia had not provided clear evidence of a direct claim to or actual exercise of sovereign authority over the island.|$|E
5|$|When the {{announcer}} {{at the ball}} asks {{if there is a}} doctor in the house, Mac puts his hand up, to Caroline's embarrassment. Things get more embarrassing when Guy also volunteers, and asks why Caroline is sitting next to Mac when she is Guy's fiancée. A unconscious patient lies on an operating table. Guy touches her breasts, takes pictures of her naked body under the blanket, and kisses her. Caroline alleges that the patient is transgender, which repels Guy. Sue White then appears in a tutu, claiming that the patient is stalking Mac, and repeating the <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> patient is transgender.|$|E
5000|$|Criticisms of <b>the</b> format include <b>assertions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "cinematic look" [...] is {{lost with}} the use of high frame rates. Film critics have noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> much sharper image looks akin to video games, HDTV, live theater or a cheap home movie.|$|R
50|$|Several {{people have}} criticized {{critical}} vocabularies as tools of alienation or obfuscation. Also {{there have been}} <b>assertions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relatively recent proliferation of critical vocabularies has resulted in redundancy of both terms and ideas. See the Pitfalls section under jargon.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, some {{candidates}} for the 2016 presidential election advocated for a gold standard, based on concern <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Federal Reserve’s attempts to increase economic growth may create inflation. Economic historians {{did not agree with}} candidate's <b>assertions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gold standard would benefit the US economy.|$|R
5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration, in United States trademark law, {{is a federal}} trademark registration of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a registration is achieved by filing a {{concurrent use}} application (or by converting an existing application to a concurrent use application) and then prevailing in a concurrent use proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). A concurrent use application may be filed {{with respect to a}} trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may be allowed to go forward based on the <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> existing use can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E
5|$|Several {{different}} {{estimates for the}} size of the Persian fleet are given. Thucydides says that there was a fleet of 200 Phoenician ships, and is generally considered the most reliable source. Plutarch gives numbers of 350 from Ephorus and 600 from Phanodemus. Furthermore, Plutarch says that the Persian fleet was awaiting 80 Phoenician ships sailing from Cyprus. Although Thucydides's account is generally to be favoured, there may an element of truth in Plutarch's <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Persians were awaiting further reinforcements; this would explain why Cimon was able to launch a pre-emptive assault on them. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for {{the size of the}} Persian land army. However, the number of Persian marines accompanying the fleet was presumably in the same range as the number of Greek marines (c. 5,000), since the Persian ships carried the same complement of troops. Plutarch quotes Ephorus as saying that Tithraustes was commander of the royal fleet, and Pherendatis of the infantry, but says that Callisthenes named Ariomandes as overall commander.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} reviewed by critics, but {{contained within the}} reviews were often criticism on {{the execution of the}} story and plot. A review in the The Moving Picture World was positive to the moral lesson the film asserted and found the acting to be satisfactory. Walton of the The Moving Picture News criticized the type of film as invoking sudden and unnatural changes in character {{for the sake of a}} moral lesson. The child's influence and ability to bring sense to her father was seen as cheap theatrics, but ended with the <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film was not second rate for employing such theatrics. The New York Dramatic Mirror was positive, but said that the scene upon which the little girl follows her father was not believable because she was unaware of her father's intentions to kill himself. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
50|$|With Howe, {{the group}} {{released}} their third studio album, Blessing in Disguise, in 1989. Critics responded favorably, including some <b>assertions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> record was the group's strongest effort. After {{being replaced by}} Heretic's former singer, Wayne recruited the remaining members of Heretic to form Reverend.|$|R
25|$|Liberal MP {{and former}} Minister of Health, Ujjal Dosanjh {{noted that a}} poll held prior to the {{election}} showed less than 20 per cent of residents in the riding knew Emerson by name, lending credence to <b>the</b> <b>assertions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Liberal banner played a large part in his election and re-election.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013, the U.S., UK and French {{officials}} accused Syria's Assad regime of using chemical weapons against its opponents.

25|$|The <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Cubist {{depiction}} of space, mass, time, and volume supports (rather than contradicts) the flatness {{of the canvas}} was made by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler as early as 1920, but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s, especially by Clement Greenberg.|$|E
25|$|That {{time the}} {{political}} commissar of the 2nd Shock Army admitted {{the failure to}} break through the defense. He explained it by stating the artillery fire was running late.

25|$|One {{aspect of}} Ashley-Cooper's {{analysis}} {{that must be}} questioned is his <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> performances of Grace in a certain match {{should be regarded as}} first-class but that performances by other players should not. Clearly, if a match is first-class, then all players taking part must have the game included in their own first-class records.|$|E
50|$|Sinclair {{approaches}} G'Kar {{with his}} discovery from the raiders' base: a Narn officer, supplied along with weapons {{sold to the}} raiders by the Narn.

5000|$|There was {{an attempt}} by Staten Island {{to break away from}} New York City in the late 1980s and early 1990s, leading to a 1993 referendum, in which 65% voted to secede.

25|$|Many {{reference}} {{sources in}} the past century or so have repeated the <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chironomidae do not feed as adults, but an increasing body of evidence contradicts this view.

25|$|In 2007, {{the same}} group that {{authored}} the Lancet study extended its study of the lethal-injection process through a critical examination of the pharmacology of the barbiturate thiopental. This study – published in the online journal PloS Medicine – confirmed and extended the conclusions made in the article and goes further to disprove the <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lethal-injection process is painless.|$|E
25|$|Ecological {{economics}} is distinguishable from neoclassical economics primarily by its <b>assertion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology {{deals with the}} energy and matter transactions {{of life and the}} Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that neoclassical economics has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Assertions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Solway Firth {{preserves}} {{the name of}} the Selgovae are without foundation. 'Solway' is Anglo-Saxon from the thirteenth century (sol = 'mud', wæth = 'ford'), and this was {{the name of the}} main crossing at Eskmouth at <b>that</b> time. <b>The</b> firth has been known by various names in the past, and this one happened to be the survivor.|$|R
2500|$|Nearly all {{independent}} commentators saw {{the agreement}} as a losing proposition for International Harvester.
