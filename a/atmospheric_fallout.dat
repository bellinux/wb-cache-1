This work provides an original combination of physical and chemical methods to determine the main sources of airborne particles impacting inhabited zones. Raman microspectrometry (RMS), X-ray diffraction (DRX), morphology analyses by microscopy and chemical composition were assessed. Geochemical analysis allowed the identification of target and source areas; XRD and RMS analysis identified the main mineral phases in association with their metal content and speciation. The characterization of the dominant minerals was combined with particle morphology analysis to identify fallout sources. The complete description of dust morphologies permitted the successful determination of a fingerprint of each source site. The analysis of these chemical and morphological fingerprints allowed identification of the mine area as the main contributor of metal-rich particles impacting the inhabited zone.

After 43 days of exposure, the thoroughly washed leaves contained 335 ± 50 mg Pb kg− 1 (dry weight). Micro-X-ray fluorescence mappings evidenced Pb-rich spots of a few hundreds of micrometers in diameter located in necrotic zones. These spots were more abundant {{at the base of}} the central nervure. Environmental scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis showed that smaller particles (a few micrometers in diameter) were also present in other regions of the leaves, often located beneath the leaf surface. In addition, submicrometric particles were observed inside stomatal openings. Raman microspectrometry analyses of the leaves identified smelter-originated Pb minerals but also secondary phases likely resulting from the weathering of original particles. On the basis of these observations, several pathways for foliar lead uptake are discussed.

The study began by investigating concentrations within urban sources. In addition to the more commonly studied wastewater treatment plant effluent, wet weather urban sources (including combined sewer overflows, urban runoff, and total <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fallout)</b> were considered. The initial results highlight a significant contamination of all urban sources (from a few nanograms per liter in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fallout</b> to several micrograms per liter in the other sources) with clearly distinguishable distribution patterns.

While the concentrations of BPA and nonylphenoxy acetic acid (NP(1) EC) increase substantially due to urban sources, the 4 -nonylphenol concentrations remain homogeneous along the Seine. These results suggest a broad dissemination of 4 -nonylphenol at the scale of the Seine River basin.

40|$|International audienceThe wet, dry {{and total}} {{atmospheric}} depositions of some metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Na, Pb and Zn) were sampled at two sites and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fallout</b> fluxes were determined for these locations. This work, led by two different research groups, allowed to reach two main goals: {{to define a}} simple analytical procedure to secure accurate shipboard sampling and analysis of atmospheric deposition, and to assess anthropogenic impacts of heavy metals to the environment. The first step about the validation step showed that the prevalent deposition type was dry deposition which represents 40, 60 and 80 % for Cd, Cu and Pb, respectively. This prevalence of dry deposition in total <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fallout</b> supported the necessity of funnel wall rinsing which contains 30, 50 and 40 % of collected Cd, Cu and Pb, respectively. Moreover, the reproducibility of atmospheric deposition collection was determined. The second step was performed by comparing two sampling sites. A rural sampling site, situated in Morvan's regional park (250 km south-east of Paris), was chosen for its isolation from any local and regional contamination sources. Fluxes obtained in this area were compared with those obtained at an urban site (Creteil, suburb of Paris) allowing comparison between {{urban and rural areas}} and demonstrating the impact of anthropogenic activities on atmospheric deposition of Cr, Cu and Pb...|$|E
40|$|Presents {{the results}} of a {{radiological}} survey of the territory of the Karaganda region. The data obtained on contamination of isotopes of plutonium (239 + 240), assessed the impact of nuclear testing on Semipalatinsk testing nuclear polygon. Currently, the pollution of the examined areas of technogenic radionuclides in most places, does not exceed the background level of global fallout, and only at some points noted in the reading background of global fallout. However, there are local areas of contamination, which could be formed as a result of testing of BRV, or other <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fallout</b> from nuclear testing...|$|E
40|$|In urban areaswith high {{fallout of}} {{airborne}} particles,metal uptake by plantsmainly occurs by foliar pathways and can strongly impact crop quality. However, {{there is a}} lack of knowledge on metal localization and speciation in plants after pollution exposure, especially in the case of foliar uptake. In this study, two contrasting crops, lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and rye-grass (Lolium perenne L.), were exposed to Pb-rich particles emitted by a Pb-recycling factory via either atmospheric or soil application. Pb accumulation in plant leaves was observed for both ways of exposure. The mechanisms involved in Pb uptake were investigated using a combination of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques (electron microscopy, laser ablation, Raman microspectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy). The results showthat Pb localization and speciation are strongly influenced by the type of exposure (root or shoot pathway) and the plant species. Foliar exposure is the main pathway of uptake, involving the highest concentrations in plant tissues. Under <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fallouts,</b> Pb-rich particles were strongly adsorbed on the leaf surface of both plant species. In lettuce, stomata contained Pb-rich particles in their apertures, with some deformations of guard cells. In addition to PbO and PbSO 4, chemical forms that were also observed in pristine particles, newspecies were identified: organic compounds (minimum 20 %) and hexagonal platy crystals of PbCO 3. In rye-grass, the changes in Pb speciation were even more egregious: Pb–cell wall and Pb–organic acid complexes were the major species observed. For root exposure, identified here as a minor pathway of Pb transfer compared to foliar uptake, another secondary species, pyromorphite, was identified in rye-grass leaves. Finally, combining bulk and spatially resolved spectroscopic techniques permitted both the overall speciation and the minor but possibly highly reactive lead species to be determined in order to better assess the health risks involved...|$|R
50|$|Preliminary {{results of}} the Baby Tooth Survey were {{published}} in the November 24, 1961, edition of the journal Science, and showed that levels of strontium 90 had risen steadily in children born in the 1950s, with those born later showing the most pronounced increases. The results of a more comprehensive study of the elements found in the teeth collected showed that children born after 1963 had levels of strontium 90 in their baby teeth that was 50 times higher than that found in children born before large-scale atomic testing began. The findings helped convince U.S. President John F. Kennedy to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union, which ended the above-ground nuclear weapons testing that created the greatest amounts of <b>atmospheric</b> nuclear <b>fallout.</b>|$|R
40|$|Global {{correlations}} of the regions in which three Martian wind streak types (bright, dark, splotch-related) {{vary according to}} latitude, elevation, albedo, color, and predawn residual temperature provide constraints on models of streak formation and modification. Bright streaks are relatively stable and occur {{over a wide range}} of geographical surfaces. They are elevation-independent, suggesting that their formation is due to <b>atmospheric</b> dust <b>fallout.</b> Dark streaks appear variable from 20 to 40 deg S and at elevations between 3 and 7 km. They are associated with dark surfaces, having high thermal inertias. Splotch-related streaks occur at elevations between 0 and 6 km and at areas of either low or high thermal inertias, which is the cause of its modifying surface winds. Data are graphically presented, and the methods of data collection are fully explained. Regional studies of various types of streaks in Syrtis Major, Syria Planum, Oxia Palus, Mesogea and Pettit Craters, and Noachis confirm that the correlations found at the global level also occur at regional scales...|$|R
