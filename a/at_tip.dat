500|$|The {{spore print}} is white. The spores are [...] {{typically}} 9–12 by 8–10.5µm, spherical to , and thin-walled. They are hyaline (translucent), and amyloid—meaning they will stain bluish-black to black in Melzer's reagent. The basidia are 43.5–76.5 by 10.5–17µm, mostly four-spored, and clamped at their bases. There are abundant spherical, elliptic or club-shaped hyaline cells on the gill edges, measuring 16–39.5 by 10.5–27.5µm. The cap cuticle is 220–270µm wide, {{consisting of a}} gelatinised suprapellis (upper layer) and non-gelatinised subpellis (lower layer). The volval remnants on the cap consist of abundant spherical, club-shaped, or [...] cells, measuring 10–86 by 9–85µm. These cells are umber in colour, and arranged in chains perpendicular to the cap surface, becoming smaller and paler <b>at</b> <b>tip</b> of the wart, subtended by moderately abundant hyphae that are 4–10µm wide. Clamp connections are abundant in the hyphae.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided, with a conventional rounded decking running forward {{as far as}} the engine cowling. [...] It tapered to the rear, more in plan than elevation and carried a tailplane with a sharply swept leading edge mounted on top of the fuselage and externally braced from below. [...] The elevators were more rounded, and well separated to allow rudder movement. The fin and horn balanced rudder together were almost triangular, with the latter rounded <b>at</b> <b>tip</b> and base. [...] The rear cockpit was over the trailing edge of the wing and the front cockpit at the leading edge. [...] The Trainer was powered by a 90hp (67kW) Blackburn Cirrus Minor four cylinder inverted in-line engine, driving a two-bladed propeller.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} is {{proposed}} a dislocation emission mechanism for microcrack initi-ation <b>at</b> the <b>tip</b> of a finite rigid conducting line in a piezoelectric solid. When a finite rigid conducting line is embedded in a piezoelectric matrix, because of the highly concentrated stress and electric displacement fields <b>at</b> its <b>tips,</b> dislocations of one sign are driven away from the tip, while the stationary dislocations of the opposite sign are left behind. As a result, a micro Zener–Stroh crack is initiated <b>at</b> each <b>tip</b> for the in-plane case, and two microcracks <b>at</b> each <b>tip</b> for the anti-plane case. We obtain analytical solutions of both in-plane and anti-plane exten-sion forces for microcracks initiated <b>at</b> the <b>tip</b> of a finite rigid conducting line. By obtaining the stress and electric displacement fields <b>at</b> the <b>tip</b> under nonzero net Burgers vectors, we observe two critical crack lengths. We find that the in-plane and anti-plane critical extension forces for a finite rigid conducting line are related to those for a conventional crack in the same piezoelectric materials. 1...|$|R

50|$|Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics yields {{reliable}} {{results in}} the field of ductile materials like steel. Most of the experiments and theories in fracture mechanics are formulated taking ductile materials as object of interest. But if we compare the salient features in LEFM with results derived from the testing of concrete, we may find it irrelevant and sometimes trivial. For example, LEFM permits infinite stress <b>at</b> crack <b>tip.</b> This makes no sense in real analysis of concrete where the stress <b>at</b> crack <b>tip</b> is fixed. And LEFM fails to calculate stress <b>at</b> crack <b>tip</b> precisely. So we need some other ways to find out what is stress <b>at</b> crack <b>tip</b> and distribution stress near crack tip.|$|R
