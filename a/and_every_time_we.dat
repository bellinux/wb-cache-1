2500|$|Technology, Davidson argues, re-shapes the way {{we learn}} and process new {{information}} in some fundamental ways. We surf hundreds of news feeds, immediately discriminating between the ones we need to read and the ones we don't. In our work environments, {{we are forced to}} focus, divide, and re-focus our attention as we are dealing with multiple tasks at the same time. Within this multitasking that the new workplace requires, Davidson urges her readers to re-imagine the concept of distraction. We are cultured to imagine that shopping online while finishing a report or answering personal emails and simultaneously working on a project are distractions which are detrimental to our productivity <b>and</b> efficiency. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. [...] "When we feel distracted, something’s up. Distraction is really another word for saying that something is new, strange or different. We should pay attention to that feeling… Distraction {{is one of the best}} tools for innovation we have at our disposal—for changing patterns of attention and beginning the process of learning new patterns" ...|$|R
30|$|If artist Trevor Paglen {{analyzes}} the manipulative {{power and the}} effects in society of “invisible images,” defined by him as “images made by machines for other machines, with humans rarely in the loop” (Paglen, 2016, p. 1), it seems that, on the contrary, the category of images of resistance are of those addressed to human eyes and that generate—intentionally or not—a form of participation. Therefore, if an image whether still or moving can be considered activist, the first condition to be satisfied {{is that it is}} made for and addresses the human gaze. If “an image, like every image, is an invitation to look” (Sontag, 2003, p. 45), aren’t we, while watching, also accepting the call to activate the image based on our experience of all the other millions of images that we have seen, shared, remembered, or temporarily forgotten over our lifetime?

During the analysis phase of web application development web model of the web application is created. This web model represents all {{the components of the}} web application that are to be tested. After generating the web model the very next step that is taken for testing the web application is to generate test cases. Web testing deals with this issue and during this testing we generate test cases. This testing is followed up by regression testing if we bring any feasible change in the web model. The regression testing verify whether previous model functionality will regress or fail by marking which previous test cases are valid or discarded in the updated model [12]. The updated web model is then used to generate the new test cases. Each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> when <b>we</b> added a new module in the existing model then we have to check the effect of test cases generated earlier for existing modules because the new module added to the system may interact with the existing modules. In this paper we proposed an automatic {{way to deal with the}} modification part of the test cases existing for the already mentioned modules in the web model...|$|R

40|$|Though {{ray tracing}} has {{recently}} become interactive, its high precomputation time for building spatial indices usually limits its applications to walkthroughs of static scenes. This {{is a major}} limitation, as most applications demand support for dynamically animated models. In this paper, we present {{a new approach to}} ray trace a special but important class of dynamic scenes, namely models whose connectivity does not change over time and for which the space of all possible poses is known in advance. We support these kinds of models by introducing two new concepts: primary motion decomposition, and fuzzy kd-trees. We analyze the space of poses and break the model down into submeshes with similar motion. For each of these submeshes <b>and</b> for <b>every</b> <b>time</b> step, <b>we</b> calculate a best affine transformation through a least square approach. Any residual motion is then captured in a single "fuzzy kd-tree" for the entire animation. Together, these techniques allow for ray tracing animations without rebuilding the spatial index structures for the submeshes, resulting in interactive frame rates of 5 to 15 fps even on a single CPU...|$|R
