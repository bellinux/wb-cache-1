50|$|<b>A</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> {{is similar}} to a blender. The primary {{difference}} is that <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> use interchangeable blades and disks (attachments) rather than a fixed blade. Also, their bowls are wider and shorter, a more proper shape for the solid or semi-solid foods usually worked in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b>|$|R

50|$|Traditional Yemenite cooks prepare sahawiq {{using two}} stones: a large stone {{used as a}} work surface and a smaller one for {{crushing}} the ingredients. Other alternatives are {{a mortar and pestle}} or <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ingredients}} are ground in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> or with <b>a</b> mortar and pestle, or {{in a large}} earthenware basin with a wooden stick. The mix should {{be reduced to a}} powder that resembles fine cornmeal.|$|R
50|$|Bacon jam is a bacon-based relish, {{similar to}} the Austrian starter Verhackert. It is made {{through a process of}} slow cooking the bacon, along with onions, vinegar, brown sugar and spices, before mixing in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bisque is also {{commonly}} used, although incorrectly, {{to refer}} to cream-based soups that do not contain seafood, in which the sometimes pre-cooked ingredients are pureed or processed in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> or <b>a</b> <b>food</b> mill. Common varieties include squash, tomato, mushroom, popcorn, and red pepper.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> is <b>a</b> kitchen {{appliance}} used {{to facilitate}} repetitive tasks {{in the preparation}} of food. Today, the term almost always refers to an electric-motor-driven appliance, although there are some manual devices also referred to as [...] "food processors".|$|R
50|$|Proximates {{are used}} in the {{analysis}} of biological materials as a decomposition of a human-consumable good into its major constituents. They are a good approximation of the contents of packaged comestible goods and serve as a cheap and easy verification of nutritional panels i.e. testing can be used to verify lots, but {{can not be used to}} validate <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> or <b>food</b> processing facility: <b>a</b> nutritional assay must be conducted on the product to qualify said producers. Nutritional panels in the United States are regulated by the FDA and must undergo rigorous testing to ensure the exact and precise content of nutrients in order to prevent <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> from making unfounded claims to the public.|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} juicers can also {{function}} as <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> Most {{of the twin}} gear and horizontal masticating juicers have attachments for crushing herbs and spices, extruding pasta, noodles or bread sticks, making baby food and nut butter, grinding coffee, making nut milk, etc.|$|R
50|$|<b>Food</b> <b>processors</b> {{are similar}} to blenders in many forms. The primary {{difference}} is that <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> use interchangeable blades and disks (attachments) rather than a fixed blade. Also, their bowls are wider and shorter, a more proper shape for the solid or semi-solid foods usually worked in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> Usually, little or no liquid is required {{in the operation of}} the <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> unlike <b>a</b> blender, which requires a certain amount of liquid for the particles to move around the blade.|$|R
50|$|Harrison's {{most famous}} design, which {{incorporated}} this philosophy, was the Cuisinart <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> Harrison redesigned the <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> with large and easily pressed buttons, large and easily grasped handles, and a bold readable typeface. The new design was a success. By designing <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> {{that could be}} used by consumers with arthritis and/or poor eyesight, Harrison had created a product that was accessible to people {{with a wide range of}} abilities. The Cuisinart <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> was extremely popular with the general public.|$|R

50|$|Graters produce shreds {{that are}} thinner {{at the ends}} than the middle. This allows the grated {{material}} to melt or cook in a different manner than the shreds of mostly uniform thickness produced by the grating blade of <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> Hand-grated potatoes, for example, melt together more easily in a potato pancake than food-processed potato shreds.|$|R

50|$|Dry {{breadcrumbs}} {{are made}} from dry breads which have been baked or toasted to remove most remaining moisture, and may have a sandy or even powdery texture. Bread crumbs are most easily produced by pulverizing slices of bread in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> using <b>a</b> steel blade to make coarse crumbs, or a grating blade to make fine crumbs. A grater or similar tool will also do.|$|R
5000|$|The Italian salsa verde {{is a cold}} rustic sauce, and {{includes}} parsley, vinegar, capers, garlic, onion, anchovies, olive oil, and possibly mustard. The ingredients are coarsely chopped, formerly by hand, now often in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> In some regions, cubed bread is soaked in vinegar and blended with the other ingredients, which creates an emulsion somewhat similar to a vinaigrette. In other regions, there is no bread.|$|R

The sauce is prepared by mixing the ingredients using <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> or blender and then heating {{them until the}} sauce reduces and thickens. [...] It may be prepared to have a smooth or chunky texture. Straining the sauce using a sieve to remove particulate matter creates a smooth texture. It can be preserved by freezing for later use.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{alternatives}} to using a pastry blender. One {{is to work}} the fat into the flour with the fingertips, though this requires having a good [...] "touch" [...] and knowing just how lightly to work the fat into the flour without melting it. [...] Another is to use two table knives {{like a pair of}} scissors, one knife in each hand. A third is to use <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b>|$|R
25|$|Storer, Holmen and Pedersen {{describes}} a netchain built around <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> The <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> uses {{the output of}} a meat and a vegetable <b>processor</b> and sells <b>food</b> to restaurants. The meat and vegetable processors are using the output of primary producers, whereas the restaurants serve consumers and {{are connected to the}} vegetable processor and the meat processor as well. Moreover, primary producers also share information with the <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> The main purpose of the entire food chain/network is to serve consumer needs and they need to cooperate to achieve this. As a result, a strongly connected system is formed, which can be described as a netchain.|$|R

50|$|In both sweetcrust and shortcrust pastry, {{care must}} be taken to ensure that fat and flour are blended {{thoroughly}} before liquid is added. This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and are less likely to develop gluten and may be achieved with the use of <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> <b>a</b> specialized kitchen utensil called a pastry blender, or through various alternatives, like a pair of table knives held in one hand.|$|R
5000|$|Caster sugar (also {{referred}} to as superfine or baker's sugar) has a larger particle size than powdered sugar, approximately half that of granulated sugar. It is commonly used in baking and cold mixed drinks because it dissolves faster than granulated white sugar. Caster sugar can be easily prepared at home by grinding white sugar in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> to make it finer. The most common food caster sugar is used in is meringue.|$|R
