50|$|The {{isomeric}} shift (also called isomer shift) is {{the shift}} on <b>atomic</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>lines</b> and gamma <b>spectral</b> <b>lines,</b> which occurs {{as a consequence}} of replacement of one nuclear isomer by another.

If the spectra have also hyperfine structure the shift refers to the center of gravity of the spectra. The isomeric shift provides important information about the nuclear structure and the physical, chemical or biological environment of atoms.More recently the effect has also been proposed as a tool in the search for the time variation of fundamental constants of nature.|$|R

40|$|Laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) {{has been}} used to study the surface hardness of special aluminum alloys containing zeolite. The aluminum alloy has acquired pronounced changes in its metallurgical properties due to the zeolite inclusion. The surface hardness of the samples under investigation is determined by measuring the spectral intensity ratios of the ionic to atomic spectral lines in the LIBS spectra of samples having different surface hardness values that have been conventionally measured before for comparison. The presence of aluminum silicate mineral in the studied alloys enabled material volume to expand under compression. This feature gave new results in the measurement of hardness via LIBS.

40|$|Plasma-related non-spectroscopic matrix {{effects of}} 31 {{elements}} in {{inductively coupled plasma}} (ICP) -atomic emission spectrometry were investigated using both laser ablation and solution nebulization as sample introduction techniques. Matrix effects were studied by monitoring the excitation conditions of the plasma using the ionic to <b>atomic</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> intensity ratios of zinc and magnesium. A new kind of matrix interference {{was found in the}} ICP that appears to be related to matrices with elements of low second ionization potential. The matrix effects do not correlate with the first ionization potential of the element. Only those matrix elements with low second ionization potential showed severe matrix effects. Increasing the forward power of the ICP or replacing the carrier gas with a 50 %/ 50 % argon-helium mixture did not significantly reduce this matrix effect. However, using 100 % helium as the carrier gas greatly reduced the extent of this matrix effect, suggesting that argon is involved in the interference mechanism. The interference mechanism may involve interactions between doubly-charged matrix ions and argon species. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Matrix {{effects of}} calcium in inductively coupled plasma-atomic {{emission}} spectrometry were investigated. Matrix effects were studied by monitoring the excitation {{conditions of the}} plasma using Zn ionic to <b>atomic</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> intensity ratios. Dry and wet inductively coupled plasmas with robust and non-robust conditions were compared. Laser ablation and solution nebulization sample introduction were used to produce the dry and wet plasma conditions, respectively. Low (0. 6 l/min) and high (1. 0 l/min) carrier gas flow rates were used to produce the robust and non-robust conditions, respectively. No differences in the trend of matrix effects for dry and wet plasmas were observed at vertical positions above normal observation height (> 8 mm height above load coil) for low and high carrier gas flow rates. However, matrix effects in {{the lower part of}} the plasma (< 8 mm height above load coil) were significantly different between dry and wet plasmas when a high carrier gas flow was used. The differences are likely due to the desolvation process. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{sample matrix}} can {{influence}} the temperature, electron number density, and other excitation characteristics in the inductively coupled plasma (ICP). These ICP characteristics were investigated by measurements of the ionic to <b>atomic</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>line</b> intensity ratio of a test element (e. g. Mg and Zn). The effect of matrices of calcium (CaCO 3 and CaF 2), strontium (SrCO 3), lithium (Li 2 O, Li 2 CO 3 and LiF), magnesium (pure Mg and MgO), and aluminum metal on plasma conditions was studied using laser ablation sampling. Two Nd:YAG lasers were used to ablate the test element and the matrix simultaneously. Different amounts of matrix were ablated by varying one laser irradiance; the laser irradiance for the ablation of the test element was kept constant. Strontium, calcium, and magnesium had a more pronounced matrix effect than the easily ionizable elements (Li, Na and K). The matrix effect was independent of the anion. Experimental {{results suggest that the}} matrix effects may be due to a mechanism that involves the second ionization level of the elements (Sr, Ca and Mg). link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
