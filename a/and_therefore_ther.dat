Initially, we should {{bear in mind that}} the term “guidelines ” describes such initiatives far more accurately than does the formerly used term “consensus”. Experience shows that a well-written text often hides heated discussions and conflicting views, as well as disputes that are settled by a small margin of votes.

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of personal computing devices users are creating a variety of digitized personal informa-tion, from personal contact databases and multimedia con-tent to context data such as location, activity and mood. Pre-venting unintended disclosure of such information is a key motivator for developing privacy management frameworks. It is equally critical that protecting privacy does not prevent users from completing essential tasks. For example, whilst a user does not generally make his location available, he may want to disclose it to the taxi company with which he has booked a journey. It is impractical for the user to al-ways specify his preferences in advance and {{it is impossible to}} forecast every possible scenario. Furthermore, conflicts may arise due to apparently conflicting requirements or due to the diversity of situations encountered. <b>Therefore</b> <b>ther...</b>|$|R

It concludes that there is a prima facie case for using reference models across industries to advantage provided there are generic similarities between the two industries. Keywords: Reference models, Internet-based business, technology transfer, technology diffusion Introduction Internet-based business is relatively new.

40|$|The {{existence}} of vendors (PKL) informal sector community is an urban economic reality and needs adequate {{consideration in the}} development process. In Surakarta city, vendors are organized, by relocating the Banjarsari street sellers into the market traders in “Pasar Klithikan Notoharjo”. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>ther</b> should be an attempt/ a strategy to enable the street sellers community adapting well in facing such change/movement so that such community will be empowered, escaped from the marginalization and proverty. The research method employed in this research was action research. The aspirations and obstacles the street sellers faces, particularly after the movement into the market trader, was collected through in-depth interview and Focused Group Discussion (FGD). Then, the information collected {{was used as the}} material for developing a model of street seller empowerment, particularly in adapting the street seller (informal sector) into market trader community (formal sector).

40|$|Figure 1 : A {{real-time}} tracking method {{based on a}} sparse 3 D map is estimating in real-time a consumer RGB-D camera’s motion with respect to an unknown environment (left). At the same time, the method is reconstructing the environment as a dense textured mesh (center). The parallel tracking and meshing opens the way to unprecedented possibilities for several AR applications as the camera motion is accurately estimated and the augmentations are seamlessly integrated in the surrounding environment thanks to convincing occlusions (right). Compared to standard color cameras, RGB-D cameras are designed to additionally provide the depth of imaged pixels which in turn results in a dense colored 3 D point cloud representing the envi-ronment from a certain viewpoint. We present a real-time track-ing method that performs motion estimation of a consumer RGB-D camera with respect to an unknown environment {{while at the same}} time reconstructing this environment as a dense textured mesh. Unlike parallel tracking and mapping performed with a standard color or grey scale camera, tracking with an RGB-D camera al-lows a correctly scaled camera motion estimation. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>ther...</b>|$|R
