Father Julian de Santa Ana, from the Recollects, served as the second parish priest. In 1794 and 1880, the towns of Cortes and Antequera {{established}} their own parish, separate from Maribojoc. The first church was constructed in a muddy area of the town proper from 1798 and was finished after 18 years under forced labor (polos y servicios) in 1816. To build the church, parishioners were instructed to bring not less than 4 pounds of rock from the sea every time they attended.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the chief}} {{measures}} by which Ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by the ordeal of tangena. A poison was extracted from the nut of the native tangena (Tanghinia venenifera) shrub and ingested, with the outcome determining innocence or guilt. If nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal, the poison was typically <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison's effects, while {{among members of the}} slave class (andevo), the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves. The accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin: if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared, but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated guilt. According to 19th-century Malagasy historian Raombana, {{in the eyes of the}} greater populace, the tangena ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith, even to the point of accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery.|$|E

25|$|Pre-term {{babies who}} are unable to {{manufacture}} surfactant have lungs that tend to collapse each time they breathe out. Unless treated, this condition, called respiratory distress syndrome, is fatal. Basic scientific experiments, carried out using cells from chicken lungs, support the potential for using steroids as a means of furthering development of type II alveolar cells. In fact, once a premature birth is threatened, every effort is made to delay the birth, and a series of steroid injections is frequently <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mother during this delay in an effort to promote lung maturation.|$|E
25|$|The {{intensity}} of medical management {{is dependent on}} the severity of the colic, its cause, and the financial capabilities of the owner. At the most basic level, analgesia and sedation is <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> horse. The most commonly used analgesics for colic pain in horses are NSAIDs, such as flunixin meglumine, although opioids such as butorphanol may be used if the pain is more severe. Butrophanol is often given with alpha-2 agonists such as xylazine and detomidine to prolong the analgesic effects of the opioid. Early colic signs may be masked with the use of NSAIDs, so some practitioners prefer to examine the horse before they are given by the owner.|$|E

Ferris gradually became delirious, although Berdella continued his physical and sexual assaults upon his victim until he noted in the log he kept upon Ferris: 'Unable to sit up more than 10–15 seconds.' This was followed by an entry reading, 'Very delayed breathing.' Shortly thereafter, Berdella wrote that his victim had died with a simple notation translating as 'Stop the project'.|$|E

25|$|Single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique using gamma rays. It {{may be used}} with any gamma-emitting isotope, including Tc-99m. In the use of technetium-99m, the radioisotope is <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patient and the escaping gamma rays are incident upon a moving gamma camera which computes and processes the image. To acquire SPECT images, the gamma camera is rotated around the patient. Projections are acquired at defined points during the rotation, typically every three to six degrees. In most cases, a full 360° rotation is used to obtain an optimal reconstruction. The time taken to obtain each projection is also variable, but 15–20 seconds are typical. This gives a total scan time of 15–20 minutes.|$|E

The siege lines around Coevorden was virtually complete except on the East part of city which was marshy and no siege work could be done. Engineers and pioneers were sent to the city moat so that a cover trench could be made on the fortress. Digging begun and soon the trench itself was four to five feet deep (about 1.5 meters) and twelve feet wide (approximately four meters). An attack by pioneers and soldiers on a village suburb was attempted whilst the siege lines got closer. However, the attack was repulsed by the garrison in the city but determined they attacked again the next day and managed to occupy the suburb.|$|E

In 1015, Canute led a Viking raid to the harbour and used Brownsea as a base to sack Wareham and Cerne Abbey.

Following his invasion of England, William the Conqueror gave Studland, which included Brownsea to his half-brother, Robert de Mortain. In 1154, King Henry II granted the Abbot of Cerne the right of wreck for the island and the Abbey continued to control the interests of Brownsea for the next 350 years.|$|E

25|$|After Kamehameha II {{inherited}} the throne in 1819, American Protestant missionaries to Hawaii converted many Hawaiians to Christianity. They used their influence to end many traditional {{practices of the}} people. During the reign of King Kamehameha III, Hawai'i turned into a Christian monarchy with {{the signing of the}} 1840 Constitution. Hiram Bingham I, a prominent Protestant missionary, was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period. Other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs, leading to conflicts between the monarchy and its restive American subjects. Catholic and Mormon missionaries were also active in the kingdom, but they converted a minority of the Native Hawaiian population. Missionaries from each major group <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> leper colony at Kalaupapa on Molokai, which was established in 1866 and operated well into the 20th century.

25|$|Menéndez at once began {{disembarking}} his troops, landing {{two hundred}} of them. On Friday, September 7, {{he sent his}} three smaller ships into the harbor, and three hundred more colonists were landed, along with the married men, their wives, and children, {{and most of the}} artillery and ammunition. On Saturday, the feast of Our Lady of Charity, the balance of the colonists, one hundred in number, and supplies were put ashore. Then the Adelantado himself landed amidst the waving of flags, the sounding of trumpets and other instruments, and the salutes of the artillery. The chaplain, Mendoza, who had gone ashore the previous day, advanced to meet him, chanting the Te Deum Laudamus and carrying a cross which Menéndez and those with him kissed, falling upon their knees. Then Menéndez took possession in the King's name. The mass of Our Lady was solemnly chanted, and the oath was <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> various officials {{in the presence of a}} large concourse of friendly Indians who imitated all of the postures of the Spaniards. The ceremony was concluded by the serving out of food to colonists and Indians alike.

25|$|Besides the {{administration}} of the oaths of office, there is no set formula for the swearing-in of a lieutenant governor-designate. Though there may therefore be variations to the following, the appointee will generally travel to the legislative assembly building in the provincial capital, where a guard of honour awaits to give a general salute. From there, the party is led by the speaker of the legislative assembly to the legislative chamber, wherein all justices of the province's superior court, members of the legislative assembly, and other guests are assembled. The governor general's commission for the lieutenant governor-designate is then read aloud, and the required oaths are <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> appointee by either the governor general or a delegate thereof; the three oaths are: the Oath of Allegiance, the Oath of Office as lieutenant governor, and the oath as keeper of the province's great seal. With the affixing of their signature to these three solemn promises, the individual is officially the lieutenant governor, and at that moment the Viceregal Salute is played and a 15- is conducted outside. The lieutenant governor then receives the insignia of the province's order or orders. Since the appointment in 1956 of John J. Bowlen as Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, newly installed lieutenant governors will, {{at some point in the}} first year of their mandate, be invited to a personal audience with the monarch.|$|E
