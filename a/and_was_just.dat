5|$|At the NCAA Outdoor Championships that year, he {{won three}} {{separate}} national titles, beating all {{opposition in the}} 100m, 200m, and 4×100 meter relay races. This achievement made him {{the first man to}} win the three races at an NCAA Championships since John Carlos did so in 1969. Dix's time of 9.93seconds in the 100m was a world-leader at that point of the season, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> 0.01 behind Ato Boldon's NCAA record. For these accomplishments, he was again named USATF's Athlete of the Week.|$|E

25|$|Cason was {{represented}} {{by one of the}} first female lawyers in Florida, Kate Walton.

25|$|When he met Capote in 1948, Dunphy {{had written}} a well-received novel, John Fury, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> getting over a painful divorce from McCracken. In 1950 the two writers settled in Taormina, Sicily, in a house where the author D. H. Lawrence had once lived. Ten years older than Capote, Dunphy {{was in many ways}} Capote’s opposite, as solitary as Capote was exuberantly social. Though they drifted more and more apart in the later years, the couple stayed {{together}} until Capote's death.|$|E

Karaev and Hari's matchup {{was one of}} two bouts {{to qualify}} for the first K-1 Heavyweight Title Match, {{scheduled}} on 28 April 2007 in Hawaii. Hari was knocked down in the second round <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> able to make it to his feet when Karaev intended to finish the fight with a swinging punch which Hari ducked, and landed a right cross to score a KO.|$|E

Fuchs' team reached the Pole from the {{opposite}} direction on 19 January 1958, where they met up with Hillary. Fuchs then continued overland, following the route that Hillary had laid and on 2 March succeeded in reaching Scott Base, completing the first overland crossing of the continent by land via the South Pole.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, the U.S. Steel company, {{which had}} lost $130 million from 1932 to 1934 <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> barely {{breaking}} even in 1935, approached Fairless with the offer {{to become president}} of its newly formed Carnegie-Illinois Steel subsidiary. According to Fairless, Girdler then offered Fairless the presidency of Republic Steel (one of his own positions; the other was {{chairman of the board of}} directors) at a higher salary than U.S. Steel was offering. Fairless later said he knew next to nothing about U.S. Steel's operations, corporate or manufacturing structure, or merchandising. But he resigned from Republic Steel effective September 15, 1935, to join U.S. Steel.|$|E
25|$|Brown showed {{great promise}} in 1937, playing mostly for the county's Second XI team. He became the regular first team opener in 1938 when he scored his maiden {{first-class}} century against Lancashire <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> short of 1,000 {{runs for the}} season, earning the award of his county cap. He struggled to find form in 1939 and then his career was interrupted by the Second World War. Brown joined the British Army and was posted to Aldershot Command where he was stationed from 1940 to 1944. He played in numerous wartime cricket matches, often for teams representing the Aldershot Command or District, many of them at Lord's. He did not play in 1945 due to military duties.|$|E

25|$|On August 10, 1566, the feast-day of Saint Lawrence, {{at the end}} of {{the pilgrimage}} from Hondschoote to Steenvoorde, the chapel of the Sint-Laurensklooster was defaced by a crowd who invaded the building. It has been {{suggested}} that the rioters connected the saint especially with Philip II, whose monastery palace of the Escorial near Madrid was dedicated to Lawrence, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> nearing completion in 1566. Iconoclastic attacks spread rapidly northwards and resulted in the destruction of not only images but all sorts of decoration and fittings in churches and other church or clergy property. However, there was relatively little loss of life, unlike similar outbreaks in France, where the clergy were often killed, and some iconoclasts too.|$|E
25|$|The race at {{the front}} was between Barrichello; Ralf Schumacher and the two McLarens of Räikkönen and David Coulthard. The two McLarens soon dropped out, both retirements were due to an engine failure. This left the Ferrari and the Williams to battle for the lead, albeit on {{different}} strategies, with Barrichello on two stops and Ralf on one-stop. Barrichello was 21 seconds ahead but rejoined 5 seconds behind after his second stop on lap 35. He then closed in on Ralf at a second a lap, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> 1.2 seconds behind when his engine failed on lap 39, leaving Ralf over 30 seconds ahead of the field with Jenson Button second, with Montoya and Schumacher third and fifth in their recovery drives, with Nick Heidfeld between them.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} vice {{president}} {{claiming to be}} part of a government was Mariano Trías, whose term started on March 22, 1897. He was elected during the elections of the Tejeros Convention, and was later elected vice president of the Supreme Council that oversaw negotiations for the Biak na Bato pact in 1897. This Supreme Council had no sovereignty, did not govern any state, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> used for bargaining with the Spanish. This council was replaced later, with no such position existing during the country's declaration of independence in 1898, which had a dictatorial government. Officially, the country's first actual republic was founded in 1899, and it too had no vice president. Trias instead served in the cabinets of Apolinario Mabini and Pedro Paterno, as finance minister and war minister, respectively. Trias is not considered a Philippine Vice President as the Supreme Council did not proclaim any sovereign state.|$|E

25|$|After {{the regular}} season, López signed a {{contract}} {{to play with the}} Elefantes de Cienfuegos in the 1940–1941 Cuban League tournament. He quickly became the best pitcher of the league, topping all pitchers with 12 victories and 16 complete games, playing in a highly competitive league that boasted such pitching stars as Martín Dihigo, Agapito Mayor, Gilberto Torres, Tomás de la Cruz and Luis Tiant, Sr., as well as noted hitters as Lázaro Salazar, Ray Dandridge, Sam Bankhead, Roberto Estalella, Alejandro Crespo and Santos Amaro. That season, López also was involved in the fastest game played in Cuban baseball history, as he won a complete-game pitching duel against René Monteagudo and the Leopardos de Santa Clara by a score of 2–1, which lasted one hour and nine minutes. Eventually, López played in the outfield corners during his lone season in Cuba, but was also notable as he made the All-Star team <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the second Venezuelan to play in the Cuban league after fellow pitcher Alejandro Carrasquel, a MVP Award winner in the 1938–1939 season.|$|E
