As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees {{the ruins of the}} public library in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) learns that he has <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the world to read them without interruption.|$|E

25|$|Due to his {{scientific}} reputation, Thunberg {{was given the}} opportunity in 1776 to accompany the Dutch ambassador M. Feith to the shogun's court in Edo, today's Tokyo. During that journey, the Swede was {{given the chance to}} collect a great number of specimen of plants and animals and likewise to talk to Japanese locals in the villages they traversed on their way. It is in this time that Thunberg wrote two of {{his scientific}} master pieces, the Flora Japonica (1784) and the Fauna Japonica (1833). The latter was completed by the German traveller Philipp Franz von Siebold who visited Japan between 1823 and 1829.

25|$|In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on {{the same}} page - just when Robin realizes she does want to marry him, Patrick has finally {{accepted}} the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking he has <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin {{is the only one who}} had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E

Several technical problems with the studio sent the band into [...] "semi-meltdown", according to Shields, who was rumoured to have been suffering from writer's block.

500|$|It {{is likely}} that Murasaki enjoyed writing in solitude.

But when they get to know me, they find to their extreme surprise that I am kind and gentle". Inge says that she was too outspoken to make friends at court, and Mulhern thinks Murasaki's court life was comparatively quiet compared to other court poets. Mulhern speculates that her remarks about Izumi were not so much directed at Izumi's poetry but at her behavior, lack of morality and her court liaisons, of which Murasaki disapproved.|$|E

Col Garnons Williams was in temporary command of the 12th Royal Fusiliers when on 25 September he led his battalion in an attack on German trenches. However, the flanks were exposed and on 27 September, Garnons Williams gave the order to retreat. He was at that moment shot in the head from a house nearby. The soldier who gave the account said: [...] "I was very sorry for him, as we could not have had a better, braver officer. He was with us <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the front trench, and looked after us as well as he could; no man could have done better. Nobody could get back to him." [...] The following evening, the battalion was relieved, Garnons Williams being declared officially wounded and missing in action, unofficially reported killed.|$|E

I thought, 'How wonderful of EastEnders to write a character that is realistic.'

25|$|In the Ismaili tariqah, the {{guardian}} of each Jamatkhana is called mukhi (in the South-Asian tradition) or Sheikh (in the Arab tradition) there are also other names that are applied based on the cultural context of the Jamat, mukhi is a word derived from mukhiya means foremost.

In the big jamat, the Mukhi was assisted by a caretaker called tha'nak. Later, the office of kamadia (from kamdar means accountant) was created. The Mukhi and Kamadia are the traditional titles {{going back to the}} pre-Aga Khan period when they enjoyed considerable local power. Their responsibilities include officiating over the daily rituals in the Jamatkhana, but they are primarily lay officials. Since the wholesale reorganizations undertaken by the Imams, the local committees are now tied into an elaborately hierarchical administrative structure of boards and councils.|$|R

He fell into a routine of copying paintings in Venetian collections by day, and attending the life class of the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts by night, producing around 50 oil paintings in total as well as numerous pencil sketches. He was extremely impressed with the high quality of the Venetian Academy; the instructors in their turn were extremely impressed {{with the quality of}} Etty's work, in particular his flesh tones. He acquired the nickname of [...] "Il Diavolo" [...] owing to the high speed at which he was able to paint, and watching him at work became something of a spectacle in its own right; luminaries including Gioachino Rossini and Ladislaus Pyrker (then Patriarch of Venice) came to watch him paint. So devoted was Etty to his studies in Venice that he exhibited no original work in 1823, writing to his brother that [...] "If one spent <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> painting originals, one might as well, nay better, be at home".

Such aberrant behavior is so obvious and physically harmful that catches caregivers’ and special educators’ attention <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> naturalistic settings (Durand & Crimmins, 1988).

Apart from money, Blofeld demands amnesty for all past crimes and to be recognised as Count de Bleuchamp. M tells 007 that the ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond then enlists Draco and his forces to attack Blofeld's headquarters, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsleigh, with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch and injures his neck. Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal, then drive away in Bond's Aston Martin. When Bond pulls over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car, Blofeld (wearing a neck brace) and Bunt open fire on the couple's car. Bond survives, but Tracy is killed in the attack. When a police officer arrives to help, a tearful Bond cradles Tracy's body and says: [...] "It's all right. It's quite all right, really. She's having a rest. We'll be going on soon.

Writing for Rolling Stone, Andy Greene says that [...] "James Bond title songs, as a rule, have {{the name of the}} movie in the chorus," [...] though he notes that this is not always the case. On Her Majesty's Secret Service has an entirely instrumental credit sequence, though the film features an alternate theme, [...] "We Have <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>in</b> the World", sung by Louis Armstrong. Until the Daniel Craig era, only Nobody Does It Better and All Time High served as an opening theme without sharing a title with the movie. John Barry provided the title song music on ten of the eleven films for which he composed the musical score. Several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song and become pop hits, including Paul McCartney's [...] "Live and Let Die", Carly Simon's [...] "Nobody Does It Better" [...] (for the film The Spy Who Loved Me), and Sheena Easton's [...] "For Your Eyes Only" [...] with Adele's [...] "Skyfall" [...] and Sam Smith's [...] "Writing's on the Wall" [...] eventually winning the award.|$|E
500|$|Conway {{continued}} McConnell's line {{of attack}} on Bevin's finances, specifically the issue of delinquent taxes. While McConnell's charges involved delinquent taxes against Bevin Brothers Manufacturing, Theo Keith of Louisville's WAVE reported in June that Bevin had been late at least 10 times paying property taxes on his vacation homes in Maine and Louisiana between 2002 and 2009. He further reported in July that Bevin's company, Integrity Holdings, also had multiple past delinquency issues. In total, Keith estimated that Bevin had paid about $1,800 in penalties for late tax payments. Bevin became irritated with Keith's reporting and refused to answer questions from him at subsequent press conferences; he did not buy ads on WAVE, despite running ads on Louisville's other three network broadcast stations. The Associated Press' Adam Beam eventually reported that Bevin had paid his taxes late on 30 different occasions. In an October interview with Beam, Bevin said, [...] "Sometimes you do pay it late and you pay interest on having paid it late. But you pay the taxes. ...
