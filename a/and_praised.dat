40|$|A crucial {{first step}} in {{teaching}} and training the retarded and autistic is to develop and maintain eye contact with the therapist. Functional movement training (an overcorrection procedure) plus edibles <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> were compared with edibles <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> alone {{as a method of}} developing eye contact in three such children. In both conditions, the child was given food <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> when eye contact occurred within 5 sec of the therapist's verbal prompt: "Look at me. " Functional movement training avoidance plus edibles <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> produced about 90 % attention for the three children, while edibles <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> alone were less effective (eye contact never exceeded 55 %). Functional movement training avoidance combined with edibles <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> appears to be an effective method of teaching eye contact and possibly other forms of instruction-following to behaviorally disordered children who are not always responsive to positive consequences...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{examines the}} claims that players are (1) susceptible to flattery <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> from a video game, (2) {{that the effects}} are similar to flattery <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> from humans <b>and</b> (3) that flattery <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> can impair a player's performance. In two play-sessions participants (N = 42) were asked to play a casual video game. Half {{of the participants were}} only exposed to the original game sounds and the other half were exposed to additional <b>praise</b> <b>and</b> flattery from a computer voice (juiciness). The additional audio was designed to blend in with the game sounds. Participants in the control condition scored significantly higher than participants who received additional <b>praise</b> <b>and</b> flattery, but they did not evaluate the game differently. These findings suggest that flattery <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> from a video game produce the same general effects as flattery <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> from a human, and that too much juiciness can actual impair game play. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Draft: Do not quote or cite without {{permission}} Abstract. The fact that God {{is worthy of}} thanks <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> for his good acts underwrites the rationality of our practice of offering prayers of thanksgiving <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> for those acts. Here, however, a puzzle arises: If God is essentially unsurpassably good, then {{he is unable to}} do something worse in place of his good acts, and if God is unable to do something worse in place of them, then he is not worthy of thanks <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> for performing them. So, if God is essentially unsurpassably good, then he is not worthy of <b>praise</b> <b>and</b> thanks for his good acts. In this paper, I argue that, given mundane incompatibilist assumptions, there is no solution to this puzzle. Thus, on those assumptions, our practice of offering prayers of thanksgiving <b>and</b> <b>praise</b> is rational only if God is not essentially unsurpassably good...|$|R
