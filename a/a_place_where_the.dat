5|$|Didsbury derives {{its name}} from the Anglo-Saxon Dyddi's burg, {{probably}} referring to a man known as Dyddi whose stronghold or township it was on a low cliff overlooking <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> River Mersey could be forded. In the 13th century Didsbury was variously referred to as Dydesbyre, Dydesbiri, Didsbury or Dodesbury.|$|E
5|$|Karadžić also {{mentions}} another Serbian {{method to}} obtain the raskovnik. He recorded a story {{from the town of}} Zemun about a merchant who desired to find the herb. The merchant locked an old woman into leg irons and let her wander in a field during the night; if the irons unlocked by themselves at a certain place, that would be <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> raskovnik grows.|$|E
5|$|Ethiopia has a long, {{historical}} {{reputation as}} <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> weapon dance {{plays an important}} cultural role. According to Lucian, a Greek writer from the 2nd century, “The Ethiopians dance also during the battle. The Ethiopian never shoots his arrow without dancing and making a menacing gesture beforehand. He wants to frighten the enemy by his dance beforehand.” The broad range of weapon dances includes the hota jumping dance of Amharic males; the attack dance of the Hailefo; the stick-dance of the Kullo; the Beroronsi Hama Haban, a dramatic dagger dance of the Esa; and the shire, the saber dance of the Tigrean nomadic shepherds.|$|E

5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position as <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> East and West meet. It was {{a radical departure from}} the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period.|$|E
5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E

Before she dies, Nanuk tells Kallik about <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> ice never melts. Hearing this, Kallik sets off to this place.|$|E

5|$|Dawn of Mana {{opens on}} the fictional island of Illusia, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> giant Mana Tree lies dormant. Much {{of the story}} takes place on Fa'Diel, a {{continent}} composed of the five nations of Jadd, Topple, Ishe, Wendell, and Lorimar. At {{the start of the}} game Ritzia, a Maiden in charge of tending to the Tree, and Keldric, her knight and the player-controlled character, have left their village to find Ritzia's missing pet. While they are out, Illusia is attacked by King Stroud of Lorimar. The pair rush to the Tree of Mana, thinking that Stroud intends to attack the legendary beast that lies sleeping underneath its roots. While searching for the beast, Keldric finds a seed of the Tree, which attaches to his arm and can transform into a slingshot, a whip, or a sword. They also find Faye, a spirit child, who can cast magic and joins them. When they reach the center of the labyrinth of roots, Stroud's men catch up to them; they had been searching for Ritzia, not the beast. Stroud intends to open a portal to Mavolia, a land of darkness sealed away for centuries, and believes Ritzia is part of the key as a Maiden had been a part of opening the portal before. Stroud leaves with Ritzia to find the rest of the key, and Keldric and Faye chase after them.|$|E

25|$|Positioned on {{the shores}} of a glacial lake {{at the end of the}} last Ice Age, Pickering was in an ideal place for early {{settlers}} to benefit from the multiple natural resources of the moorlands to the north, the wetlands to the south, running water in the beck and the forests all around. It had wood, stone, wildfowl, game, fish, fresh water and fertile easily worked soils. The east–west route from the coast passed along the foothills of the North York Moors through the site at <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> beck could be forded.|$|E

25|$|The {{arboretum}} (the large lawn area {{in front}} of Old Main) is a {{home to one of}} every type of tree in Arkansas (with a few exceptions, such as the umbrella magnolia, Magnolia tripetala) and once used to be a training ground for military officers when military tactics were taught at the University. It also served as <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> band would march and play. Today, the band practices in lot 56 (a parking lot on campus), and the arboretum is simply a green space where students can study, play games, or simply stroll through and enjoy.|$|E
25|$|The Cucuteni-Trypillia {{settlements}} {{were usually}} located on <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> geomorphology provided natural barriers {{to protect the}} site: most notably using high river terraces or canyon edges. The natural barriers were supplemented with fences, earthworks and ditches, or even more elaborate wooden and clay ramparts. The role of the fortifications found at these settlements was probably to protect the tribe's domestic animal herd from wild predators. Other hypotheses are that the fortifications were for protection against enemy attacks, or {{as a means to}} gather the community. The role of these fortifications, however, is still debated among scholars.|$|E
25|$|Near Paw Paw, the {{engineers}} had no good solutions. If {{they followed the}} river, {{they would have to}} cross over to West Virginia to avoid the cliffs, and an agreement with the B railroad was that the canal would avoid {{the south side of the}} river, unless it was <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> railroad would not need it. So they took the more expensive decision to build a tunnel through the mountain. The initial cost estimate of $33,500 proved far too low. The tunnel was completed for $616,478.65 Among the components of the project, a kiln was built to provide bricks to line the tunnel.|$|E

Its construction date also becomes more clear in face of this facts, art-historian Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida noted that by its medallions, the diamond-shaped openings and the layout of windows we can date the upper level {{by the end of the}} 13th century or beginning of the 14th century, in which its already archaic Romanesque architectural style can be explained with the need of a compromise with the pre-existent cistern.|$|E
25|$|Homfray {{believes}} that {{the first of the}} mines to be worked was at the village of Hattoreah Aytoorah, being <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> coal seam came to the surface. By September 1775 around 2500 maunds (91.5 imperial tons) of coal had been sent by river to Calcutta for testing. These tests were delayed, at least in part because the partners in the business were also engaged in their duties on behalf of the East India Company. Some prompting in 1777 caused the tests finally to be undertaken in January 1778. The results showed that the coal was of too poor a quality for use by the Company, producing 50% less heat than British coal.|$|E
25|$|The {{schedule}} of the Court's sittings is determined every {{year by the}} Chief Justice.

The Chief Justice also appoints the places where the Court sits. When the Supreme Court moved from the Old Supreme Court Building and City Hall Building at 1 and 3 Saint Andrew's Road respectively to the present Supreme Court Building at 1 Supreme Court Lane, the Chief Justice formally appointed the new building as <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Court of Appeal sits by way of a notification dated 20 June 2005.|$|E
