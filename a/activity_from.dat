5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS; {{also known}} as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease) describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression (i.e., during ascent), but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as emerging from a caisson, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at altitude, and extravehicular <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that Aldermaston was inhabited in the 12th century CE, possibly extending back to 1690 BCE. Radiocarbon dating on postholes and pits {{in the area}} show <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> 1690 to 1390, 1319 to 1214, and 977 to 899 BCE. Wheat and barley grains {{have been found in}} these excavations. Tests show that most of the barley was dehulled, but that absence of such debris may mean that the cereal was brought in from other areas.|$|E

5|$|In 1886, Woolwich munitions workers {{founded the}} club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed {{the city to}} Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, making them close {{neighbours}} of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby.

5|$|This {{larger scale}} {{building}} <b>activity,</b> <b>from</b> the mid-8th century on, was {{a manifestation of}} the emergence of tribal organisms, a new civilizational quality that represented rather efficient proto-political organizations and social structures on a new level.

The threat coming from the Avar state in Pannonia could have had provided the original motivation for the construction projects.|$|E
5|$|Activity {{after the}} caldera's {{formation}} created lava domes and rhyolitic lava flows along its ring faults. One flow was dated at 1,090,000 ± 110,000 years old, and the domes are 1.4 to 1.2 million years old. La Reforma eruption products were later partially buried by <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> El Aguajito, where volcanic activity had migrated to. Basaltic cones which erupted 600,000 {{years ago on}} the caldera's flanks despite their location {{are not part of the}} La Reforma volcano; like Isla Tortuga and Tres Virgenes, they are controlled by the tectonic processes that accompanied the rifting of the Sea of Cortez. Also, rivers deposited sediments inside the caldera itself. Seismic activity still occurs at Tres Virgenes volcano. La Reforma could still experience large scale explosive volcanism, especially in its southwestern part.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} {{indicated}} signs of <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> the palaeolithic period, with burial and occupation sites located principally {{to the south}} of the modern town, particularly in Hendford where a Bronze Age golden torc (twisted collar) was found. Yeovil is on the main Roman road from Dorchester to the Fosse Way at Ilchester. The route of the old road is aligned with the A37 from Dorchester, Hendford Hill, Rustywell, across the Westland site, to Larkhill Road and Vagg Lane, rejoining the A37 at the Halfway House pub on the Ilchester Road. The Westland site has evidence of a small Roman town. There were several Roman villas (estates) in the area, including finds at East Coker, West Coker and Lufton.|$|E

5|$|Excavations {{carried out}} before the {{flooding}} of Chew Valley Lake also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> {{the second half of}} the 1st century until the 3rd century AD. The finds included a moderately large villa at Chew Park, where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found. There is also evidence from the Pagans Hill Roman Temple at Chew Stoke. In October 2001 the West Bagborough Hoard of 4th century Roman silver was discovered in West Bagborough. The 681 coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century and 8 Miliarense and 671 Siliqua all dating to the period AD 337– 367. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including Arles and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany and Rome.|$|E
5|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. Although not {{necessarily}} mapped {{as part of the}} Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing {{at the edges of the}} lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent palaeogeography.|$|E
5|$|Jonah Bevan (Oliver Ferriman) {{is walking}} home across the Cardiff Bay Barrage when a mysterious bright light appears. He vanishes. Seven months later, at the {{instigation}} {{of her former}} police colleague Andy Davidson (Tom Price), Torchwood agent Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) is investigating Jonah's disappearance. After Jonah's mother Nikki (Ruth Jones) starts {{a support group for}} relatives of missing people in the Cardiff area, Gwen realises that there are more cases resembling Jonah's disappearance. Gwen collates a chart of the missing people and her colleague Toshiko (Naoko Mori) discovers that all the disappearances occurred during negative spikes of <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> the Cardiff space-time rift. The two women postulate the implications of this: that the rift can take people away and discard them elsewhere. Gwen confronts her boss Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) with her research but he informs her that nothing can be done and orders her to stop the investigation.|$|E

5|$|Neurophysiologists {{study the}} chemical, pharmacological, and {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases {{where there was a}} medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.|$|E
5|$|Oberon's {{accretion}} probably {{lasted for}} several thousand years. The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon's outer layer. The maximum temperature of around 230K was reached at {{the depth of}} about 60km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Oberon heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon's crust leading to cracking. The present-day system of canyons may {{be a result of}} this process, which lasted for about 200million years, implying that any endogenous <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> this cause ceased billions of years ago.|$|E

Data meanwhile finds a discrepancy in the Stargazers logs stating that the Ferengi were attacked under a flag of truce. Upon further investigation, Data and La Forge report to Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that the logs were certainly faked. Dr. Crusher and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) discuss the Captain, and Wesley shows them some unusual <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> the Ferengi ship. They head to inform Riker to alert him to the signals, who is informed by the Enterprise computer that Picard has transported to the Stargazer.|$|E
