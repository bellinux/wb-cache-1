5|$|When the allele {{frequency}} is very small, drift can also overpower selection even in large populations. For example, while disadvantageous mutations are usually eliminated quickly in large populations, new advantageous mutations <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> vulnerable to loss through genetic drift as are neutral mutations. Not until the {{allele frequency}} for the advantageous mutation reaches a certain threshold will genetic drift have no effect.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch after 53 to 60days of {{incubation}} by both parents. Chicks {{are born}} with their eyes open and sometimes {{can take up to}} a week to leave the shell completely. The young are covered with a grayish down until they <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> large as their parents. They are able to fly after five to six months, but continue to roost and forage with their parents until they are in their second year, at which point the parents typically turn their energies to a new nest. Ravens are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while golden eagles and bears are potential predators of condor offspring.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids are {{the most}} {{numerous}} family of tubenoses, and the most diverse. They {{range in size from}} the giant petrels, which <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> large as the albatrosses, to the prions, which are as small as the larger storm petrels. They feed on fish, squid and crustacea, with many also taking fisheries discards and carrion. All species are accomplished long-distance foragers, and many undertake long trans-equatorial migrations. They are colonial breeders, exhibiting long-term mate fidelity and site philopatry. In all species, each pair lays a single egg per breeding season. Their incubation times and chick-rearing periods are exceptionally long compared to other birds.|$|E

5|$|The {{young are}} covered with a grayish down until they <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> large as their parents. They are able to fly after six months, but {{continue}} to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large birds of prey and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take eggs or hatchlings. Predation is relatively uncommon, since the vigilant parents often aggressively displace birds of prey who come near and the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.|$|E
5|$|The long, falcate (sickle-shaped) {{pectoral}} fins taper to narrowly pointed tips. The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is tall and}} positioned slightly closer to the pectoral fins than the pelvic fins. The pelvic fins <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> large as the first dorsal fin and bear long, thin claspers in males. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny, with the former positioned ahead of the latter. There are crescent-shaped notches on the caudal peduncle at {{the upper and lower}} origins of the caudal fin. The upper caudal fin lobe is enormously elongated as is characteristic of threshers, measuring about as long {{as the rest of the}} shark; the thin, gently curving lobe is held at a steep upward angle and has a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids are small- to {{medium-sized}} seabirds. The largest, {{the giant}} petrels with a wingspan of , <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> large as albatrosses; the smallest, {{such as the}} fairy prion have a wingspan of , are slightly bigger than the diving petrels. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter. Like all Procellariiformes, the procellariids have a characteristic tubular nasal passage used for olfaction. This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate nesting colonies. The plumage of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, blues, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns (such as the Cape petrel).|$|E

5|$|The parish of Selborne lies in {{the extreme}} eastern corner of the county of Hampshire, {{bordering}} on the county of Sussex, and {{not far from the}} county of Surrey; is about fifty miles south-west of London, in latitude fifty-one, and near mid-way between the towns of Alton and Petersfield. Being very large and extensive, it abuts on twelve parishes, two of which are in Sussex—viz, Trotton and Rogate.... The soils of this district <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> various and diversified as the views and aspects. The high part of the south-west consists of a vast hill of chalk, rising three hundred feet above the village, and is divided into a sheep-down, the high wood and a long hanging wood, called The Hanger. The covert of this eminence is altogether beech, the most lovely of all forest trees, whether we consider its smooth rind or bark, its glossy foliage, or graceful pendulous boughs. The down, or sheepwalk, is a pleasing park-like spot, of about one mile by half that space, jutting out on the verge of the hill-country, where it begins to break down into the plains, and commanding a very engaging view, being an assemblage of hill, dale, wood-lands, heath, and water. The prospect is bounded to the south-east and east by the vast range of mountains called the Sussex Downs, by Guild-down near Guildford, and by the Downs round Dorking, and Ryegate in Surrey, to the north-east, which altogether, with the country beyond Alton and Farnham, form a noble and extensive outline.|$|E

25|$|For instance, Dodson {{cites the}} Meryre {{depiction}} to relegate {{him to a}} short lived coregent circa Year 15, with little firm evidence to argue against it.

Finally, Allen has used the wine docket and strong association of Neferneferuaten with Akhenaten in her epithets and on stelae to speculate that both may have succeeded Akhenaten, with one as a rival king. An Allen-Dodson hybrid could see Tutankhamun succeeding Akhenaten directly as rival to Neferneferuaten.

25|$|The {{final phase}} of {{accession}} involves bilateral negotiations between the applicant nation and other Working Party members regarding the concessions and commitments on tariff levels and market access for goods and services. These talks cover tariff rates and specific market access commitments, and other policies in goods and services. The new member's commitments are to apply equally to all WTO members under normal non-discrimination rules, {{even though they are}} negotiated bilaterally. In other words, the talks determine the benefits (in the form of export opportunities and guarantees) other WTO members can expect when the new member joins.

500|$|Early medieval {{treasure}} bindings with {{a structure}} in precious metal, and often containing gems, carved ivory panels or metal reliefs, are perhaps better known today than leather bindings, {{but these were}} for books used in church services or as [...] "book-icons" [...] rather than for use in libraries. [...] Of treasure bindings from this period, only the lower cover of the Lindau Gospels (750–800, Morgan Library) now survives complete, though there are several references to them, most famously {{to that of the}} Book of Kells, which was lost after a theft in 1007. [...] Various metal fragments of what were probably book-mounts have survived, usually adapted as jewellery by Vikings. [...] In the context of the cult of Cuthbert, the lavishly illuminated Lindisfarne Gospels were made at Lindisfarne, probably shortly after the St Cuthbert Gospel, with covers involving metalwork, perhaps entirely made in it, which are also now lost. [...] Plainer, very early bindings in leather <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> rare as treasure bindings, as the bindings of books in libraries usually wore out and needed to be renewed, and earlier collectors did not consider most historical bindings worth retaining.|$|E
500|$|The {{pectoral}} fins are medium-sized {{and broad}} with rounded tips. The large first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and is positioned {{closer to the}} pectoral than the pelvic fins. The second dorsal fin is about {{half the size of}} the first and originates over the rear tips of the pelvic fins. The pelvic fins <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> large as the first dorsal fin. The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin and positioned behind it. The caudal peduncle has a crescent-shaped notch at the dorsal origin of the caudal fin. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is short but distinct, while the upper lobe is long and has a deep notch in the trailing margin near the tip. The skin is covered by overlapping dermal denticles, each with three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is plain dark reddish brown to chocolate brown, sometimes with black trailing margins on the fins or a white-tipped first dorsal fin. The eyes are dark orange with vertically oval, green-tinted pupils. There are several black patches inside the mouth, such as around the jaws, {{on the floor of the}} mouth, and on the gill arches.
