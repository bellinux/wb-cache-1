25|$|While the Portuguese wine Port is {{similarly}} {{made with a}} mutage halting the fermentation, there are some distinct differences in how vin doux naturels like Maurys are made. For one, the fortifying spirits used in Port are of a lower <b>alcohol</b> <b>strength</b> (traditionally 77%) while those used for vin doux naturels are often 95%. The spirits are then added to the VdNs later in the fermentation process than with Port. More of the fortifying spirits are often used in Port production, representing up to a fifth (20%) of the finished volume of wine compared to the spirits accounting for around 15% of the finished volume of the VdNs. This means that most VdNs contain less water and alcohol than the typical Port wine.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{estimate}} the statistical interactions between <b>alcohol</b> policy <b>strength</b> and the person-related {{risk factors of}} sensation-seeking, antisocial personality disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder related to heavy alcohol use. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Young Swiss men living within 21 jurisdictions across Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5701 Swiss men (mean age 20 years) participating in the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF). MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measures were alcohol use disorder (AUD) as defined in the DSM- 5 and risky single-occasion drinking (RSOD). Independent variables were sensation-seeking, antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and an index of <b>alcohol</b> policy <b>strength.</b> FINDINGS: <b>Alcohol</b> policy <b>strength</b> was protective against RSOD [odds ratio (OR) [*]=[*] 0. 91 (0. 84 - 0. 99) ], while sensation-seeking and ASPD were risk factors for both RSOD [OR[*]=[*] 1. 90 (1. 77 - 2. 04); OR[*]=[*] 1. 69 (1. 44 - 1. 97) ] and AUD [OR[*]=[*] 1. 58 (1. 47 - 1. 71); OR[*]=[*] 2. 69 (2. 30 - 3. 14) ] and ADHD was {{a risk factor for}} AUD [OR[*]=[*] 1. 08 (1. 06 - 1. 10) ]. Significant interactions between <b>alcohol</b> policy <b>strength</b> and sensation-seeking were identified for RSOD [OR = 1. 06 (1. 01 - 1. 12) ] and AUD [OR = 1. 06 (1. 01 - 1. 12) ], as well as between <b>alcohol</b> policy <b>strength</b> and ASPD for both RSOD [OR = 1. 17 (1. 03 - 1. 31) ] and AUD [OR[*]=[*] 1. 15 (1. 02 - 1. 29) ]. These interactions indicated that the protective effects of <b>alcohol</b> policy <b>strength</b> on RSOD and AUD were lost in men with high levels of sensation-seeking or an ASPD. No interactions were detected between <b>alcohol</b> policy <b>strength</b> and ADHD. CONCLUSION: Stronger alcohol legislation protects against heavy alcohol use in young Swiss men, but this protective effect is lost in individuals with high levels of sensation-seeking or having an antisocial personality disorder...|$|R

500|$|Starting in 1922, the {{production}} of Grodziskie was continued by only one company, Zjednoczone Browary Grodziskie (United Grodzisk Breweries). [...] Between 1929 and 1993, this style had a regionally protected designation put {{in place by the}} cabinet of Poland. [...] Production continued under the German occupation of Poland during World War II, and the beer was distributed to German forces fighting in the war. [...] After the Second World War, the breweries were nationalized, and the beer began a period of decline. [...] The communist government in Poland emphasized the large-scale production of basic products like bread, milk, and sugar, and local culinary traditions were neglected. [...] In part, this was due to restrictions on individual businesses and the inability of brewers to profit from {{the production}} of small-scale, high-quality foods, and their inability to advertise local goods and specialties. [...] In the early 1980s, different variations of the style were created with different colors and <b>alcohol</b> <b>strengths.</b> [...] After the Communist period in Poland ended in 1989, production continued under the private ownership of Lech Browary Wielkopolski, but ended in 1993, when the brewery was closed due to lack of profitability, and because of the difficulty in finding workers who had experience producing the style. [...] Commercial production of this style ceased for several years, but since 2010, some breweries have produced seasonal or limited production runs of the style.|$|R

5000|$|Mixing two {{solutions}} of <b>alcohol</b> {{of different}} <b>strengths</b> usually {{causes a change}} in volume.

The phenomenon of volume changes due to mixing dissimilar solutions is called [...] "partial molar volume". Water and ethanol are both polar solvents. When water is added to ethanol, the smaller water molecules are attracted to the ethanol's hydroxyl group, and each molecule alters the polarity field of the other.

40|$|Abstract Objectives: Low alcohol {{labels are}} {{a set of}} labels that carry {{descriptors}} such as “low” or “lighter” to denote alcohol content in beverages. There is growing interest from policy makers and producers in lower <b>strength</b> <b>alcohol</b> products. However, {{there is a lack}} of evidence on how the general population perceives verbal descriptors of strength. The present research examines consumers’ perceptions of strength (%ABV) and appeal of alcohol products using low or high alcohol verbal descriptors. Design: A within-subjects experimental study in which participants rated the strength and appeal of 18 terms denoting low (nine terms), high (eight terms) and regular (one term) strengths for either (a) wine or (b) beer according to drinking preference. Methods: 1, 600 adults (796 wine and 804 beer drinkers) sampled from a nationally representative UK panel. Results: Low, Lower, Light, Lighter, and Reduced formed a cluster and were rated as denoting lower strength products than Regular, but higher strength than the cluster with intensifiers consisting of Extra Low, Super Low, Extra Light and Super Light. Similar clustering in perceived strength was observed amongst the high verbal descriptors. Regular was the most appealing strength descriptor, with the low and high verbal descriptors using intensifiers rated least appealing. Conclusions: The perceived strength and appeal of alcohol products diminished the more the verbal descriptors implied a deviation from Regular. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of policy implications for lower <b>strength</b> <b>alcohol</b> labelling and associated public health outcomes.
