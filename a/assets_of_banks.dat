In order achieve the objective of the study, a time series data was generated for 2000 to 2009 periods.

But it appears they will settle for the bank levy {{because they know that}} a tax on wholesale financial transactions is more ambitious and difficult to achieve. This is a pity, for the world needs both. And if only one is available, we need a financial transactions tax more. Puzzlingly, the Australian government seems to want neither. One of the challenges of discussing these options is that different people mean different things when they call for a “levy” on banks.

40|$|Stress {{testing is}} one of the main key {{quantitative}} tools for assessment of financial stability. In this process, the <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> are exposed to the stress of adverse effects of defined shocks derived from historical and hypothetical scenarios. The aim of stress testing is to verify the hypothetical whether the banking sector is sufficiently resistant to the potential effects of adverse shocks and whether it would not be a threat to financial stability in case of their realization. This article aims to present the current system of stress testing in the Czech Republic and to define the possible impact of selected scenarios for stress testing on the business of banks and capital adequacy. Banks stress testing may result in pro-cyclical behaviour of the banking sector, which under certain conditions may exhibit the reverse negative impact effect on the economy. In the article we use the basic methodology for calculating capital requirements for stress testing, adjusted by own scenarios of adverse shocks. Results of our research point to existing pro-cyclical relationship between regulatory rules and trading activities in the banking sector.

40|$|<b>Assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> {{located in}} France are mainly {{denominated}} in euro and in US dollar. Currency diversification, which measures {{how much of}} assets are denominated in US dollar, implies a credit risk diversification and a valuation effect on assets. As currency diversification affects directly the total converted value of assets, it changes banks’ debt capacity and their resilience to economic shocks. Thereby, currency diversification of assets should affect leverage responsiveness {{to the value of}} assets, namely the leverage procyclicality. Using innovative data on credit institutions located in France between 1999 and 2014, we examine whether US dollar diversification of assets is pertinent for the analysis of leverage procyclicality. Focusing on investment banks, our results suggest that the net effect of US dollar diversification is dominated by the valuation effect. After extracting the valuation effect of diversification, it also posits the importance of two opposite effects in leverage procyclicality. Additionally, our results confirms the theoretical prediction where currency mismatch does not affect leverage procyclicality. Implicitly it supports the idea that leverage procyclicality is only driven by assets. Finally, our conclusions support the idea that US dollar diversification is relevant to the analysis of leverage procyclicality especially for the post crisis period...|$|E
40|$|In a dual {{liquidity}} crisis, {{both the}} government and the banking sector are under severe funding stress. By nature, dual crises have the potential of being particularly disruptive and damaging. Thus, understanding their mechanics, how they unfold and how they can be addressed under various monetary and international financial regimes, is crucial. We capture the logic of a dual crisis through a new, rigorous approach. A closed system of financial accounts allows for a systematic comparative review of underlying liquidity shocks as well as built-in liquidity buffers, including their limits beyond which a credit crunch materializes. Based on this we are able to (i) make precise the otherwise vague interpretations of liquidity flows and policy options; (ii) compare capacities to absorb shocks under alternative international financial systems; (iii) explain how various constraints interact; (iv) draw lessons for achieving higher resilience against self-fulfilling confidence crises. Most importantly, we analyze the role of a number of potential constraints to an elastic central bank liquidity provision, namely the availability of central bank eligible assets, limits deliberately imposed on the central bank`s ability to lend to or purchase <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> and governments (including monetary financing prohibitions), and limits in a fixed exchange rate regime relating to the gold or foreign currency reserves of the central bank...|$|E
