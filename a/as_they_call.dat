Luhya are felt {{to be a threat}} to the Terik identity and intermarriage has drastically reduced. The {{expansion of}} the Luhya (especially the Logoli group) into Terik territory has been a cause of population pressure. This, along with dwindling agricultural potential in the area, has {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century motivated many of the Terik to move eastwards, into 'Nandiland' <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> it. Some Terik even claim that they abandoned their homeland because they were afraid of the Luhya.|$|E

500|$|... "Southern boobook" [...] {{has been}} {{designated}} the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). The common name comes from the two-tone call of the bird, and has also been transcribed as [...] "mopoke". English explorer George Caley had recorded the native name as buck-buck during {{the earliest days of}} the colony, and reporting that early settlers had called it cuckoo owl as its call was reminiscent of the common cuckoo. However, he added, [...] "The settlers in New South Wales are led away by the idea that everything is the reverse in that country to what it is in England; and the Cuckoo, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> this bird, singing by night, is one of the instances they point out." [...] Gould recorded local aboriginal names: Goor-goor-da (Western Australia), Mel-in-de-ye (Port Essington), and Koor-koo (South Australia). Alternative common names include spotted owl and brown owl. The Ngarluma people of the western Pilbara knew it as gurrgumarlu. In the Yuwaaliyaay dialect of the Gamilaraay language of southeastern Australia, the southern boobook is guurrguurr.|$|E

In the first episode, having {{defeated}} the Grand Intellect in Invasion of the Vorticons and saved the Earth, eight-year-old child genius Billy Blaze {{is building a}} faster-than-light communications radio. Upon completing it, he hears a transmission announcing that a race of aliens known as the Shikadi are planning to destroy the galaxy. Donning his helmet as Commander Keen, he takes off in his spaceship—first stunning his parents with his neural stunner gun <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> him in to dinner—for the planet of Gnosticus IV, home of the Oracle and the Gnosticenes that tend it, {{to find out who}} the Shikadi are and how they plan to destroy the galaxy. Upon arriving, he is met by a Council Page, who tells him that the council of immortal Gnosticenes have been kidnapped by the Shikadi and taken [...] "to the Shadowlands far to the west", leaving monsters and traps to guard them. Keen journeys through the outposts and temples of the Shadowlands, rescuing all of the Gnosticenes, and afterwards they turn on the Oracle machine. The Oracle tells Keen that the Shikadi are [...] "shadow beings from {{the far side of the}} galaxy" [...] who are building an Armageddon Machine at Korath III to blow up the galaxy and rebuild it as they wish afterwards. As the episode ends, Keen sets off to stop them.|$|E

The Master Chief leaves for the surface of Halo in a lifeboat; other soldiers, including a squad of shock troops led by Antonio Silva and his second-in-command, Melissa McKay, land by special drop pods, and take a strategic bluff from the Covenant {{to use as a}} base of operations. Captain Keyes is captured by the Covenant, and taken aboard the Covenant cruiser Truth and Reconciliation; the Master Chief and a squad of Marines board the Truth and Reconciliation, rescuing the captain.

Escaping from the Covenant cruiser, Keyes gives the Master Chief the mission of finding the Control Room of Halo before the Covenant. The Master Chief and Cortana discover the location of the Control Room, {{and with the help of}} some Marines, insert Cortana into Halo's computer network. However, Cortana realizes that the ring is not a weapon as they understood at all- but before the Chief can press her with questions, Cortana tells the Master Chief to find Captain Keyes.|$|E

2500|$|Several foreign {{travelers}} through Moldavia {{since the}} 16th century noted that locals called themselves [...] "Romanians" [...] and their language [...] "Romanian". They also mention {{the awareness of}} a common Roman origin among the inhabitants of Moldavia and neighbouring Wallachia and Transylvania [...] [...] (1495–1554), a Transylvanian Saxon, was the emissary of Ferdinand I of Habsburg in Wallachia and Moldavia. Reicherstorffer had traveled in 1527 and 1535 in the Principality of Moldavia and wrote his travel memoirs – Moldaviae quae olim Daciae pars, Chorographia (1541) and also Chorographia Transylvaniae(1550). Describing the geography of Moldavia he finds that [...] "besides this name it is also called Wallachia" [...] and then speaking about the Moldavian people he says that [...] "the Roman [...] language still endures in this nation...so the Wallachians [...] are an Italian nation, as they claim, from the old Romans". A chronicler and mercenary from Verona, Alessandro Guagnini (1538–1614), traveled twice in Moldavia and helped Despot Vodă (Ioan Iacob Heraclid) gain the throne in 1563. In his biography of the prince, [...] "Vita despothi Principis Moldaviae", he described {{to the people of}} Moldavia:"This nation of Wallachians refer to themselves as Romana and say that they originate from exiled Romans of Italy. Their language is a mixture of Latin and Italian languages, so that an Italian can easily understand a Wallachian". After a visit to Moldavia an anonymous traveler, probably an Italian Jesuit, wrote in 1587 [...] a description of the people and found that [...] "these people [...] belong to the Greek faith, they take kindly to everything that is Roman, maybe because of their corrupted language from Latin, or for the belief they have about their descent from the Romans, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> themselves Romans". Also, according to these sources, the Slav neighbours called Moldovans [...] "Vlachs" [...] or [...] "Volokhs", a term equally used to refer to all the Romance speakers from Wallachia, Transylvania, and the Balkan peninsula. Nicolaus Olahus (1493–1568), proeminent humanist, writes in Hungaria et Attila that the Moldavians have the same language, rituals and religion as the Wallachians and {{that the only way to}} distinguish them is by their clothes. He also mentions that the language of Moldavians and other Vlach peoples was once Roman (Latin), as they all were colonies of the Roman Empire.|$|E
