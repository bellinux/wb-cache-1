5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates the creation of <b>a</b> <b>world</b> government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of <b>a</b> <b>world</b> government should only be to ensure the avoidance {{of war and the}} pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E

5|$|Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as {{philosophers}} Antony Flew, {{have responded}} that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view {{of free will}} (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God could have created <b>a</b> <b>world</b> containing moral good but no moral evil.

The proposed five-stage improvement process was applied in case studies, which examined the Companywide Process, Cement Packing and Quality Control. The conclusion is that <b>a</b> First <b>World</b> improvement process, with only minor changes, can operate successfully in <b>a</b> Third <b>World</b> environment, provided management is truly committed to the concept of improvement.
