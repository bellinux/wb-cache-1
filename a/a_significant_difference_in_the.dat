5|$|By July 1923, The Advertiser {{newspaper}} was reporting that Leane's approach over his {{three years at}} the helm had made <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> administration of the South Australia Police, explaining that Leane had dispensed with seniority {{as the basis for}} promotion, by substituting merit and efficiency, as well as selecting candidates who displayed qualities of sympathy and tact in dealing with the public. In February 1925, Leane hosted a conference of commissioners of police from around Australia held in Adelaide. Leane actively supported commemorative activities such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, and attended unveilings of memorials. In April 1926, Leane relinquished command of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, and was placed on the unattached list. For his military service since 1905, he had also been awarded the Volunteer Officers' Decoration.|$|E

In this study, indicators included students’ perceptions of engineering, their self-efficacy in the area of mathematics, and their self-efficacy in the area of science. Using an independent t-test to determine a difference of statistical significance, inferential statistics were provided to answer the following research questions: (a) Is there <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> perceptions of engineering for students who participated in the NCETE/NSBE mentorship program when compared with non-mentored students?, (b) Is there <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> self-efficacy in the area of mathematics for students who participated in the NCETE/NSBE mentorship when compared with non-mentored students?, and (c) Is there <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> self-efficacy in the area of science for students who participated in the NCETE/NSBE mentorship when compared wit...|$|R

25|$|There is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{amount of}} TOTs {{experienced}} by monolinguals and bilinguals. Bilinguals seem {{to report the}} same amount of TOTs as monolinguals for proper names but significantly more TOTs for other words. Specifically, when adjusted for the degree of use of the dominant and less-dominant language, bilinguals have more TOTs with the less-dominant language. In a task of picture-naming, bilingual speakers were slower than monolinguals, even when they could use their first and dominant language. This could possibly be the result of bilinguals using the words less often than monolingual speakers.|$|E
25|$|Taxicab {{geometry}} {{can be used}} {{to assess}} the differences in discrete frequency distributions. For example, in RNA splicing positional distributions of hexamers, which plot the probability of each hexamer appearing at each given nucleotide near a splice site, can be compared with L1-distance. Each position distribution can be represented as a vector where each entry represents the likelihood of the hexamer starting at a certain nucleotide. A large L1-distance between the two vectors indicates <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nature of the distributions while a small distance denotes similarly shaped distributions. This is equivalent to measuring the area between the two distribution curves because the area of each segment is the absolute difference between the two curves' likelihoods at that point. When summed together for all segments, it provides the same measure as L1-distance.|$|E

25|$|A study, using 49 rats {{indicated}} {{the increase of}} sleep spindles during slow-wave sleep following learning. It gave evidence to the increase of spindle frequency during non-REM sleep following paired associate of motor-skill learning tasks. Using an EEG, sleep spindles were detected and showed to be present only during slow-wave sleep. Beginning with a preliminary study, rats underwent six hours of monitored sleep, {{after a period of}} learning. Results showed that during the first hour following learning, there was the most evident effect on learning-modulated sleep spindle density. However, this increase in spindle density was not dependent on the training condition. In other words, there was an increase in spindles regardless of how the rats were trained. EEG patterns showed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> density of sleep spindles compared to the density of a control group of rats, who did not undergo any training before their sleep spindles were measured. This effect of increased spindle density only lasted for the first hour into sleep following training, and then disappeared within the second hour into sleep.|$|E
500|$|Velodona togata capensis, the {{subspecies}} {{first described}} by Guy Coburn Robson in 1924, differs from Velodona togata togata in three areas that Robson considered significant. Where {{the mantle of}} Chun's specimen (Velodona togata togata) was significantly wider than it is long, the mantles of Robson's specimens had a much smaller difference between width and length, with one specimen having a mantle with identical width and length. The length of the membrane that links the octopus's arms [...] the umbrella [...] was shorter in Robson's specimens than in Chun's, and there were additional warts with papillates on his specimens that were not described in Chun's specimen. Robson also noted <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hectocotylus in Chun's specimen and those in his specimens. He noted that while two of his specimens appeared to be fully sexually developed, their hectocotyli looked comparatively underdeveloped. Owing to the difference in overall size between Chun's and Robson's specimens, however, Robson conjectured that the difference in hectocotyli {{may be due to}} the specimens' ages. Robson described the coloring of the specimens as [...] "a rather deep reddish brown (verging in a distinctly purple shade in one)" [...] for the males, with a [...] "darker brown" [...] for the female.|$|E
2500|$|Hesiod {{does not}} observe digamma {{as often as}} the others do. That result is a bit counter-intuitive since digamma was still {{a feature of the}} Boeotian dialect that Hesiod {{probably}} spoke, whereas it had already vanished from the Ionic vernacular of Homer. This anomaly {{can be explained by the}} fact that Hesiod made a conscious effort to compose like an Ionian epic poet [...] at a time when digamma was not heard in Ionian speech, while Homer tried to compose like an older generation of Ionian bards, when it was heard in Ionian speech. There is also <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> results for [...] Theogony and Works and Days, but that is merely due to the fact that the former includes a catalog of divinities and therefore it makes frequent use of the definite article associated with digamma, oἱ.|$|E

The typical pattern involves [...] "Solid premiere viewings followed by a slow but steady gain of momentum through to the finale. Historically, the finale episodes of each season have beaten the premiere for total number of viewers". However, this season showed a significant decline from 8 million viewers at the premiere to 5.4 million at the seventh episode, [...] "The Gift". Business Insider cites two likely reasons for the lower ratings: backlash over the rape scene in [...] "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken", one of many deviations from the novels throughout the season that [...] "have upset fans," [...] and increased online streaming through HBO Now. It also acknowledged a possible effect of the first four episodes leaking online before the season premiere and the decision to air on Memorial Day weekend in the United States (a weekend that had been skipped in previous seasons). Business Insider reached out to HBO for comment, HBO responded that it is seeing an increase in overall viewer numbers this season taking into account streaming services, which {{are not included in}} Nielsen ratings. The dip in ratings did not extend to the eighth and ninth episodes, [...] "Hardhome," [...] and [...] "The Dance of Dragons", which were both seen by over 7 million viewers. The season finale, [...] "Mother's Mercy" [...] was seen by 8.11 million people, setting a new record and making it the most watched episode of the series.|$|E
