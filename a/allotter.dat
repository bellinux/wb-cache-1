5000|$|In Greek mythology, the Moirai or Moerae [...] or [...] (Μοῖραι, [...] "apportioners"), often {{known in}} English as the Fates (Fatae), were the white-robed incarnations of destiny; their Roman {{equivalent}} was the Parcae (euphemistically the [...] "sparing ones"). Their number became fixed at three: Clotho (spinner), Lachesis (<b>allotter)</b> and Atropos (literally 'unturnable' but metaphorically 'inflexible' or 'inevitable' - i.e. death).|$|E
50|$|Zeus married seven wives. His {{first wife}} was the Oceanid Metis, whom he {{impregnated}} with Athena, then, {{on the advice}} of Gaia and Uranus, swallowed Metis so that no son of his by Metis would overthrow him, as had been foretold. Zeus' second wife was his aunt the Titan Themis, who bore the three Horae (Seasons): Eunomia (Order), Dikē (Justice), Eirene (Peace); and the three Moirai (Fates): Clotho (Spinner), Lachesis (<b>Allotter),</b> and Atropos (Unbending). Zeus then married his third wife, another Oceanid, Eurynome, who bore the three Charites (Graces): Aglaea (Splendor), whom Hephaestus married, Euphrosyne (Joy), and Thalia (Good Cheer).|$|E
40|$|An energy {{management}} {{system based on}} hierarchical fuzzy controller for the distributed hybrid wind-solar power system is designed. Based on hierarchical fuzzy control, the {{energy management}} system switches the mode of power supply and controls the load share according to the condition of wind power, solar radiation and load requirement. Through the suitable <b>allotter</b> of the generation ratio from wind power and photovoltaic cells, the distribution generation system, combined with battery bank, can provide user with reliable electric power. The energy management system is implemented from microprocessor and Data Acquisition System. This energy management system is applied in an experimental equipment. The hybrid generation system controlled by the fuzzy energy management system, at the appearance of random variation of wind speed and solar radiation, supplies with stable electric power.

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} the fuzzy logic based smart distributed system {{to utilize the}} available energy optimally. We study the power system with two distributed sources of renewable energy like wind and solar together with normal power grid supply. Through the suitable <b>allotter</b> of the generation ratio from power sources, the distribution generation system, combined with battery bank, can provide user with reliable and constant electric power. Therefore a smart energy distributor is useful to supply energy to consumers such that their demand is supplied optimally depending available energy and battery status. In this work, a new distributor system is tested with fuzzy logic theory to satisfy the load demand constantly {{at the same time}} to keep the charging state of the battery at a safe level. Simulation results are also presented to illustrate the potential benefits of the smart distributor by maximizing the usage of renewable energy and depending less on the supply grid...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this modern}} era, the {{technology}} is imposing its relevance on the people. Now a day having the car {{is going to be}} mainstream issue. Every day we come across the huge traffic and congestion problem in public places as well as in organizations. From an employee of organization to the student going to college is prevailingly having the cars. So managing the parking of these cars in big organizations or colleges where the traffic is congested needs the continuous manual intervention and it becomes the tedious job to keep the information about all cars which are checking-in and checking-out. By the proposed system drivers will not have to stop for long time and the whole process will become digitalized thereby eliminating human intervention. So to manage the cars in the parking we are developing an automated system for car parking. In the proposed system we are going to develop an Automated Parking <b>Allotter</b> system so that continuous human intervention in parking problems will get deprived and the parking of cars can be done in fast and efficiently. We are accomplishing this system by using the technologies called RFID i. e. Radio Frequency Identification, NFC i. e. Near Field Communication and OCR i. e. Optical Character Recognition. This system will also keep the track of allotted parking lots and available ones. So the advancement in the current system can chang...|$|E
