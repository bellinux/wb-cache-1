25|$|B-72 is a {{thermoplastic}} resin {{that was created}} by Rohm and Haas for use as <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> and {{as a vehicle for}} Flexographic ink. However B-72 is now being used more as an adhesive specifically for ceramic and glass. One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidate is that it is stronger and harder than polyvinyl acetate without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically-used adhesives and tolerates stress and strain on a join that most others can not. One major drawback to using B-72 is the difficulty of applying the acrylic resin as an adhesive, as is difficulty in manipulating the substance as a workable agent. The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone.|$|E

500|$|Observations {{from the}} SMARTS {{telescope}} {{show that in}} visible light Sedna {{is one of the}} reddest objects in the Solar System, nearly as red as Mars. Chad Trujillo and his colleagues suggest that Sedna's dark red colour is caused by <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> of hydrocarbon sludge, or tholin, formed from simpler organic compounds after long exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Its surface is homogeneous in colour and spectrum; this may be because Sedna, unlike objects nearer the Sun, is rarely impacted by other bodies, which would expose bright patches of fresh icy material like that on 8405 Asbolus. Sedna and two other very distant objects – [...] and [...] – share their color with outer classical Kuiper belt objects and the centaur 5145 Pholus, suggesting a similar region of origin.|$|E

40|$|Giardia lamblia {{undergoes}} surface antigenic variation. The ultrastructural {{location of}} antigens on four different variants was studied by label fracture and immunocytochemistry with four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), {{each of which}} recognized the predominant variant in a particular clone. Each Giardia clone and its reacting MAb showed similar findings. The entire surface of the organism was covered by <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> which contained the variant surface protein. The <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> was densely and uniformly labeled. Unreacting MAbs failed to label the surface. Label-fractured Giardia trophozoites exposed to reactive MAb revealed a planar distribution of reactivity with no discernible relationship to visualized intramembranous particles. Unexpectedly, some Giardia trophozoites lacked <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> and consequently failed to react with the appropriate MAb. The biological relevance of coatless Giardia trophozoites is unknown. These findings localize the variant antigens to the <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> of the parasite and identify {{a minority of the}} population which lacks <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> <b>coat...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thirty {{strains of}} six species of Candida {{isolated}} from patients were cultured for 60 h on Sabouraud agar, freeze-dried, and examined with a scanning electron microscope.

The morphology of individual microorganisms was examined at the margins and apex of those species which lacked <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> (C. pseudotropicalis, C. krusei, C. parakrusei, C. guilliermondii), and through cracks in the <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> of those which showed <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> (C. albicans, C. tropicalis). All species showed buds, bud scars, and interconnecting intercellular processes, but were generally spherical (C. albicans, C. tropicalis) or ovoid (C. pseudotropicalis, C. krusei, C. parakrusei, C. guilliermondii) in fixed preparations. In unfixed material, individual organisms were almost invariably indented. Fixation with 3 % glutaraldehyde and washing before freeze-drying caused partial removal of the <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> of colonies of C. albicans and C. tropicalis, which persisted only as irregular sheets or as a filamentous meshwork. This filamentous meshwork was also present among the organisms of colonies of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. pseudotropicalis.
