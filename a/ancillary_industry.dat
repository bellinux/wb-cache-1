50|$|Weaving was {{the most}} {{important}} industry. Spinning and weaving were widely practised crafts, next only to agriculture. In addition to being the full-time occupation of many people, weaving was practised part-time by the farmers in rural areas. Women spent their spare time spinning cotton threads and continued to spin during the night, by the faint light of a wick lamp. Madurai and Urayur were the important centers of the industry and were well known for their cotton textiles. The muslins carried very fine floral work of different colors and were compared to the slough of the cobra and the cloud of steam. Silk cloth was manufactured with its threads gathered in small knots at its ends. The art of embroidery was also known, with the nobles and aristocrats being the main customers for embroidered clothing. Dyeing was a widespread <b>ancillary</b> <b>industry</b> to weaving. The blue dye for the loin cloth was a favorite color among the masses. In addition to silk and cotton fabrics, cloth made of wood fibre called Sirai Maravuri and Naarmadi was used by the priestly class. Silk, wool and other fabrics are referred to as cloths of natural origin. In the markets of Madurai, woollen goods were sold alongside the cotton and silk goods. The cloth manufacturers wove long pieces of cloth at a time and delivered it to the dealers. The textile dealers then scissored off bits of required length, called aruvai or tuni, at the time of sale. The dealers themselves were called aruvai vanigar and the localities where they lived aruvai vidi. Stitched garments were worn by the people and there were tailors called tunnagarar in Madurai and other big towns. Weaving was not associated with the hilly regions, as the descriptions of life in such regions do not indicate any use of cotton garments.|$|E

40|$|By {{the end of}} 2009, 30 wind {{turbines}} were operating in Switzerland with a total rated power of 18 MW. These turbines produced 22. 5 GWh of electricity. Since 1 January 2009, a “Cost-covering feedin-tariff” (FIT) for renewable energy has been implemented in Switzerland (1). This change of politics in promoting wind energy led to a boost of new wind energy projects. By 16 March 2010, six turbines with a rated power of 2. 033 MW were installed under the energy policy framework of Switzerland (CRF) system. Financing was requested for 596 turbines with rated power of 1, 213 MW and an estimated energy yield of 2. 348 GWh/yr under this scheme. Based on the very slow development in the last years, the target for 2010 (100 GWh/yr) will likely not be achieved, yet the outlook for achieving the 2030 target (600 GWh) is very optimistic. In Switzerland, an <b>ancillary</b> <b>industry</b> for wind turbine manufacturers and planners has developed, which acts mainly on an international level, and the total turnover is about 1, 400 million €.

Since 1 January 2009, a cost-covering feed-in-tariff (FIT) for renewable energy has been implemented in Switzerland (1). This change of policy in promoting wind energy led to a boost of new wind energy projects. Financing was requested for additional 1, 938 MW under the FIT scheme. Due to various obstacles in the planning procedures and acceptance issues, only two new turbines with a rated power of 3. 2 MW were installed in 2011 (opening photo: Feldmoos turbines). In Switzerland, an <b>ancillary</b> <b>industry</b> for wind turbine manufacturers and planners has developed, which acts mainly on an international level.

During this time, {{we have tried to}} set a {{comprehensive}} agenda for the monographs, tackling issues in mental health, science, religion and public health. An Annual which compiled the first six monographs was published in October 2004, and released at the Annual Indian Psychiatric Society West Zone Conference in Oct 2004. It was dedicated to the memory of Dr. L. P. Shah, whose untimely demise robbed us of a dynamic torchbearer of mental health in India. In February 2005, we were allotted an ISSN number (ISSN 0973 - 1229). On March 15, 2005, we started the Mensanamonographs Group on the internet, which is an active discussion group tackling a wide array of topics. The Monograph: Resolution of the Polarisation of Ideologies and Approaches in Psychiatry (Nov 2004 -Feb 2005) has been listed in JAMA, May 18, 2005, 293, p 2417 - 2418, Books, Journals, New Media Received. A large number of senior clinicians and researchers in India look to the Monographs with expectations of making a difference where it matters. This present monograph series, which is an Academia-Industry Symposium, intends to study in some detail {{the pros and cons of}} the wide connections which academic and research institutions have with pharmaceutical and other medical <b>ancillary</b> <b>industry.</b> There is a great hope in this connect, and an equal measure of concern.
