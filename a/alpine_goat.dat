50|$|Known for its milk, the <b>Alpine</b> <b>goat</b> {{is famous}} for its rich dairy production. Alpine goats are {{extremely}} popular in the dairy industry for their docile temperament, high quality milk output and long lactation. Alpine milk has relatively low fat content, with an average fat percent of 3.4%. It is higher in sugars than cows' milk but balances itself in terms of the amount of protein. Alpine Goats' milk has 2.3g of protein per 250ml while Cow’s milk has 3.4. A higher protein count is not always good, since it packs more calories with an increased fat content. Compared to Saanen Goat Milk, it is higher in all nutritional aspects, except the fat content, making it a much healthier choice.|$|E

Dataset included records from 54 farms. Data for does born after 2002 have been obtained from the database of the National selection program for small ruminants, collected by the ICAR standards. The contribution of farm to phenotypic variance was estimated. Data was analyzed by MIXED procedure in SAS/STAT.

40|$|Deuterium oxide {{dilution}} space (DOS) determination {{is one of}} {{the most}} accurate methods for in vivo estimation of ruminant body composition. However, the time-consuming vacuum sublimation of blood preceding infrared spectroscopy analysis, which is traditionally used to determine deuterium oxide (DO) concentration, limits its current use. The use of isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) to determine the deuterium enrichment and thus quantify DO in plasma could counteract this limitation by reducing the sample preparation for plasma deproteinisation through centrifugal filters. The aim of this study was to validate the DOS technique using IRMS in growing goat kids to establish in vivo prediction equations of body composition. Seventeen weaned male <b>Alpine</b> <b>goat</b> kids (8. 6 wk old) received a hay-based diet supplemented with 2 types of concentrates providing medium (= 9) or high (= 8) energy levels. Kids were slaughtered at 14. 0 (= 1, medium-energy diet), 17. 2 (= 4, medium-energy diet, and = 4, high-energy diet), or 21. 2 wk of age (= 4, medium-energy diet, and = 4, high-energy diet). Two days before slaughter, DOS was determined after an intravenous injection of 0. 2 g DO/kg body mass (BM) and the resulting study of DO dilution kinetics from 4 plasma samples (+ 5, + 7, + 29, and + 31 h after injection). The deuterium enrichment was analyzed by IRMS. After slaughter, the gut contents were discarded, the empty body (EB) was minced, and EB water, lipid, protein, ash, and energy contents were measured by chemical analyses. Prediction equations for body components measured postmortem were computed from in vivo BM and DOS. The lack of postmortem variation of fat-free EB composition was confirmed (mean of 75. 3 % [SD 0. 6] of water), and the proportion of lipids in the EB tended (= 0. 06) to be greater for the high-energy diet (13. 1 %) than for the medium-energy diet (11. 1 %). There was a close negative relationship (residual CV [rCV] = 3. 9 %, = 0. 957) between EB water and lipid content, whereas DOS was closely related to total body water (rCV = 2. 9 %, = 0. 944) but DOS overestimated it by 5. 8 %. Adding DOS to BM improved the in vivo predictions of EB lipid and energy content (rCV = 13. 1 % and rCV = 7. 9 %, respectively) but not those of protein or ash. Accuracy of the obtained prediction equations was similar to those reported in studies determining DOS by infrared spectroscopy. Therefore, the use of IRMS to quantify DOS provides a highly accurate measure of the in vivo body composition in goat kids...|$|E

Sessenta e oito cabras foram distribuídas em três grupos, de acordo com o escore de condição corporal (baixo, entre 1, 00 e 2, 75; intermediário, entre 2, 75 e 3, 50; e alto, entre 3, 50 e 5, 00) e avaliadas do parto até a oitava semana de lactação. Realizaram-se o controle diário do consumo alimentar e da produção leiteira e avaliações semanais de peso corporal, escore da condição corporal e composição do leite. Os animais com escore corporal alto apresentaram menor consumo de matéria seca, fibra em detergente neutro e proteína bruta em comparação àqueles com escores corporais baixo e intermediário. O período médio de recuperação do consumo de matéria seca dos animais das três condições corporais foi de 16 dias (2, 3 semanas) do pós-parto, com estabilização até o final do experimento. Na sexta semana de lactação, o peso corporal dos animais com escore corporal baixo se igualou ao daqueles com escore corporal intermediário. Não houve efeito da condição corporal ao parto nas variações de ECC e da produção leiteira ao longo do período. O teor de gordura do leite dos animais com escore corporal alto foi menor nas duas primeiras semanas pós-parto em comparação ao dos animais com escores corporais baixo e intermediário. Elevada condição corporal ao parto influencia negativamente o consumo voluntário de cabras leiteiras no início da lactação, mas quando se utiliza dieta de alta qualidade e com altos níveis de energia, a influência da condição corporal ao parto inexiste para variações de peso, de escore da condição corporal e produção leiteira dos animais. The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the influence of body condition at birth on <b>Alpine</b> <b>goat</b> productive parameters in early lactation. Sixty-eight females were assigned to three groups according to the body condition score (BCS) - low (1. 00 - 2. 75); intermediate (2. 75 - 3. 50) and high (3. 50 - 5. 00) and evaluated from kidding to the eighth week of lactation. The feed intake and milk production were recorded on a daily basis and the body weight, body condition score and milk composition at weekly intervals. Animals with a high body condition score presented lower dry matter intake, neutral detergent fiber and crude protein compared to those with low and intermediate body condition scores. The average time for dry matter intake recovery of the animals with the three body condition scores was 16 days (2. 3 weeks) postpartum, and stabilization by the end of the experiment. In the sixth week of lactation, animals with low body condition score had the same body weight of animals with intermediate body condition score. There was no effect of the body condition at birth on the body condition score changes and milk production during the experiment. The milk fat content of animals with high body condition score was lower in the first two weeks postpartum compared to animals with low and intermediate body condition score.
