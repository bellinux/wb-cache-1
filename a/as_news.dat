5|$|Monmouth then marched {{overnight}} to Frome {{arriving on}} 28 June. The morale of Monmouth's forces started to collapse <b>as</b> <b>news</b> {{of the failure}} of the rebellion in Scotland arrived that day, while the makeshift army was camped in Frome. Argyll's small force had been involved in minor skirmishes at Greenock and Ellangreig. He took Ardkinglass castle, but after disagreements with key supporters about when and where to fight the royalists commanded by Rosse and William Cleland, his supporters dwindled away and the Scottish rebellion failed.|$|E
5|$|Reaction {{was swift}} on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Nintendo's shares went down 400 yen (almost 5%) the {{following}} morning to 12,200 yen <b>as</b> <b>news</b> of the incident spread.

Then-president of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi, said {{at a press conference}} the day after the episode had aired that the video game company was not responsible since the original Pokémon game for its Game Boy product was presented in black and white.|$|E

5|$|The new {{alignment}} of US-6 was opened on December 30, 1983. The dedication was {{planned for the}} next day, but lines of cars formed at the barricades as soon <b>as</b> <b>news</b> broke that the highway was complete. Some were residents anxious to see the area or visit relatives they had {{not seen since the}} slide; others were truck drivers frustrated by long detours. The Highway Patrol requested the ceremony be canceled and the highway opened early, as they were unable to disperse the crowds.|$|E

5|$|A mutant with {{a nearly}} indestructible layer of skin. In the film's early sequences, he is a {{formidable}} fighting man, but years later, due to a poor diet, has gained {{an enormous amount of}} weight. A fan of the X-Men movies, Durand contacted the producers for a role as soon <b>as</b> <b>news</b> of a new film came out. The suit went through six months of modifications, and had a tubing system inside to cool Durand down with ice water. David Harbour auditioned for the role, but was turned down for being too fat at the time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the police}} were sure murder had taken place, and {{that at least one}} of the four was guilty, they were {{uncertain}} whether they could secure a conviction. Police also suspected there had been other murders committed, but the lack of bodies hampered this line of enquiry. <b>As</b> <b>news</b> of the possibility of other murders came to the public's attention, newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of the crimes; speculative reports led members of the public to assume that all missing people had been victims. Janet Brown went to the police and identified her friend Mary Paterson's clothing, while a local baker informed them that Jamie Wilson's trousers were being worn by Constantine Burke's son. On 19 November a warrant for the murder of Jamie Wilson was made against the four suspects.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>news</b> of Gen. Robert E. Lee's {{surrender}} on April 9, 1865, {{reached the}} department, soldiers deserted the Confederacy in droves. On April 19, Smith consolidated the District of Arkansas with the District of West Louisiana; the combined district was put under Buckner's command. On May 9, Smith made Buckner {{his chief of}} staff. Rumors began to swirl in both Union and Confederate camps that Smith and Buckner would not surrender, but would fall back to Mexico with soldiers who remained loyal to the Confederacy. Though Smith did cross the Rio Grande, he learned on his arrival that Buckner had traveled to New Orleans on May 26 and arranged terms of surrender. Smith had instead instructed Buckner to move all the troops to Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>news</b> of an {{impending}} raid {{spread across the}} state, Governor Oliver P. Morton called out the state's militia force, the Indiana Legion, to defend against the threat. Unaware {{of the size of}} the invading army, four companies of the 6th and 8th Regiments of the Legion, totaling about one hundred men, attempted to prevent the Confederates from crossing the Ohio River into Indiana, but were overcome by superior artillery fire, killing two of the defenders. The units retreated northward where they met with the main body of the 6th Regiment under the command of Col. Lewis Jordan. Along with the townspeople, they constructed breastworks that formed a defensive line south of Corydon. Despite promises of reinforcements from regional Legion commanders in New Albany, only about 450 men (consisting almost entirely of locals) were defending the town.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>news</b> spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money. The {{interest rates on loans}} to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.|$|E

5|$|Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an {{interview}} {{in relation to the}} murder. Beforehand, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on the railing and falls to the pavement. At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation <b>as</b> <b>news</b> of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} {{capitulation}} of TSAM, {{the remnants of}} the 19th Mechanized Division surrendered to the Germans at Serres in the afternoon of 10 April, while {{the remnants of the}} Krousia Detachment did so near Thessaloniki. The division's commander, chief of staff, and a few other officers chose instead to withdraw to the area of Chalkidiki. Apart from sending detachments, 191st Regiment did not participate en masse in battle. As soon <b>as</b> <b>news</b> came of the fall of Thessaloniki, the regiment moved to Stavros, where it disintegrated, with its men dispersing across Chalkidiki. This signalled the end of the division and its major sub-units as coherent fighting forces.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} vital parts of the Indian trade route was through the Sunda Strait between the islands of Sumatra and Java in the Dutch East Indies, through {{which most of the}} China and East Indies trade passed on its journey to the Indian Ocean. French ships, both Navy {{warships}} and commercially owned privateers, operated along the Indian trade routes from their base at the isolated island of Île de France and recognised the strategic importance of the Sunda Straits. As soon <b>as</b> <b>news</b> of war arrived at Île de France French ships spread out into the Indian Ocean in search of British and Dutch merchant shipping, gathering in significant numbers off the Sunda Straits.|$|E

5|$|Still in Oriente, Castro was furious. Recognizing the {{establishment}} of a military junta, he ended the ceasefire and continued on the offensive. The MR-26-7 put together a plan to oust the Cantillo-Piedra junta, freeing the high-ranking military officer Colonel Ramón Barquín from the Isle of Pines prison (where he had been held captive for plotting to overthrow Batista), and commanding him to fly to Havana to arrest Cantillo. Accompanying widespread celebrations <b>as</b> <b>news</b> of Batista's downfall spread across Cuba on 1 January 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to take responsibility for policing the country, in order to prevent widespread looting and vandalism.|$|E
5|$|When {{the chaos}} {{began to shake}} the {{confidence}} of New York's banks, the city's most famous banker was out of town. J.P. Morgan, the eponymous president of J.P. Morgan & Co., was attending a church convention in Richmond, Virginia. Morgan {{was not only the}} city's wealthiest and most well-connected banker, but he had experience with other similar financial crises—he had helped rescue the U.S. Treasury during the Panic of 1893. <b>As</b> <b>news</b> of the crisis gathered, Morgan returned to Wall Street from his convention late on the night of Saturday, October 19. The following morning, the library of Morgan's brownstone at Madison Avenue and 36th St. had become a revolving door of New York City bank and trust company presidents arriving to share information about (and seek help surviving) the impending crisis.|$|E
5|$|A {{report that}} King Charles was very sick sent the Yorks back to England post-haste. They feared the King's eldest illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, and {{commander}} of England's armed forces, might usurp the crown if Charles died in their absence. The matter {{was compounded by}} the fact that Monmouth enjoyed the support of the Exclusionists, who held a majority in the House of Commons of England. Charles survived but, feeling the Yorks returned to court too soon, sent James and Mary to Edinburgh, where they stayed on-and-off for the next three years. Lodging in Holyrood Palace, the Yorks had to make do without Ladies Anne and Isabella, who stayed in London on Charles's orders. The Yorks were recalled to London in February 1680, only to return again to Edinburgh that autumn; this time they went on a more honourable footing: James was created King's Commissioner to Scotland. Separated from Lady Isabella once again, Mary sank into a state of sadness, exacerbated by the passing of the Exclusion bill in the Commons. Lady Isabella, thus far the only one of Mary's children to survive infancy, died in February 1681. Isabella's death plunged Mary into a religious mania, worrying her physician. At the same time <b>as</b> <b>news</b> reached Holyrood of Isabella's death, Mary's mother was falsely accused of offering £10,000 for the murder of the King. The accuser, a pamphleteer, was executed by order of the King.|$|E
