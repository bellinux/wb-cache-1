Producing silicon and semiconductors for modern electronic equipment is even more energy consuming: 230 to 235 MJ/Kg of silicon, and about 3,000 MJ/Kg of semiconductors.

Three Gorges uses Francis turbines. Turbine diameter is 9.7/10.4m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and rotation speed is 75revolutions per minute. This means {{that in order to}} generate power at 50Hz, the generator rotors have 80 poles per phase, for a total of 240 poles per rotor to generate 50Hz three-phase power. Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20kV. The electricity generated is then stepped-up to 500 kV for transmission at 50Hz. The outer diameter of the generator stator is 21.4/20.9m. The inner diameter is 18.5/18.8m. The stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3m in height. Bearing load is 5050/5500 tonnes. <b>Average</b> <b>efficiency</b> is over 94%, and reaches 96.5%.|$|E

The president responded, agreeing that [...] "...to go the whole way in one fell swoop would seriously impair the general <b>average</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the Navy," [...] but still felt that something could be worked out.

At this point he applied de Laval nozzles, which were generally used with steam turbine engines, and these greatly improved efficiency. (Of the several definitions of rocket efficiency, Goddard measured in his laboratory what is today called the internal efficiency of the engine: {{the ratio of the}} kinetic energy of the exhaust gases to the available thermal energy of combustion, expressed as a percentage.) By mid-summer of 1915, Goddard had obtained an <b>average</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 40 percent with a nozzle exit velocity of [...] Connecting a combustion chamber full of gunpowder to various converging-diverging expansion nozzles, Goddard was able in static tests to achieve engine efficiencies of more than 63% and exhaust velocities of over 7000 feet (2134 meters) per second. Few would recognize it at the time, but this little engine was a major breakthrough. These experiments suggested that rockets could be made powerful enough to escape Earth and travel into space. This engine, and subsequent experiments sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, were the beginning of modern rocketry and, ultimately, space exploration. Goddard realized, however, that it would take the more efficient liquid propellants to reach space.|$|E
