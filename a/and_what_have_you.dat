2500|$|The 1967 {{documentary}} The London Nobody Knows, {{based on}} the book of the same name by Geoffrey Scowcroft Fletcher and presented by James Mason, attempted to show some unfamiliar aspects of the city, as did Patrick Keiller's 1994 documentary London. [...] This approach has since been emulated by the Saint Etienne films Finisterre (2002) <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> Done Today, Mervyn Day? (2005).

2500|$|The idea to base {{the album}} around the {{folklore}} {{concept of the}} seventh son of a seventh son came to bassist Steve Harris after he read Orson Scott Card's Seventh Son. Harris states, [...] "It was our seventh studio album and I didn't have a title for it or any ideas at all. Then I read {{the story of the}} seventh son, this mystical figure that was supposed to have all these paranormal gifts, like second sight <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you,</b> and it was more, at first, that it was just a good title for the seventh album, you know? But then I rang [...] and started talking about it and the idea just grew." ...|$|E

2500|$|Explaining the {{decision}} to start the series with the teenagers as juniors, Schwahn said, [...] "Lucas and Nathan were important players on the [...] team, the most important, and I just couldn't see that happening to freshmen." [...] He also {{wanted to keep the}} characters in high school longer, saying, [...] "I know a lot of the shows that we started with, the kids are out of high school now and into college <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you,</b> and I always thought that there was a loss of energy when that happened. It's hard to have everyone go to the same college and everyone stay together for whatever reason, or you lose some of your principles." [...] Schwahn wanted to reinvigorate the show. [...] "The show in many ways has been refaced and reinvigorated. It's very much a twenty-something show now with some relevant adult characters, and I really like that energy for the show," [...] he said, and elaborated: ...|$|E
2500|$|... 21 August 2006 saw ZTT {{release a}} 4-CD Art of Noise box set, titled <b>And</b> <b>What</b> <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> Done with My Body, God?, which {{consisted}} of tracks exclusively from the 1983–85 ZTT era, from the initial tentative demos created by Gary Langan and J.J.

The set featured over 40 unreleased remixes, demos, and works in progress, as well as the complete vinyl version of Into Battle... – sourced from the original masters – for the first time on CD.
