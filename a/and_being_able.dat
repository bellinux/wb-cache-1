It originally had the ability to display information on callers, such as their latest social media posts, local weather at the caller's location and the identity of the caller. The ability for consumers to add themselves to the directory was added in the summer of 2009 <b>and</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to edit existing entries was added that October.|$|E
5|$|After the tender, 80 {{employees}} {{were transferred to}} the subsidiary, including the director, chartered engineer Arne Fosen. To the press {{he said that the}} increased efficiency in the organization was related to a small administration, <b>and</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to use uniform trains. Previously both locomotive-hauled trains, as well as Class 70 and Class 69 trains had been used. Following the PSO, NSB Anbud would operate nine Class 69g trains, which are somewhat smaller than the locomotive-hauled and Class 70 trains. These would be owned by NSB, but rented by the subsidiary. The ministry would pay for a NOK 40 million overhaul of the stock. Representatives from the labor union said they feared for the flexibility of NSB, since 80 {{employees were}} now bound up in serving only a single line. Margareth Nordby replaced Fosen as director in August.|$|E
5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies <b>and</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.|$|E

5|$|The player plays as Dante {{through seven}} missions, taking over {{halfway through the}} game. His {{gameplay}} {{is similar to that}} of Devil May Cry 3, with him having access to multiple melee and ranged weapons which he gains after boss battles, <b>and</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to cycle through them freely in combat, being no longer limited to equipping two weapons of each type as he was in the previous game. Dante also starts with his four styles, each of which grants him different abilities, but he may now switch them at will with buttons or pads on the controller, unlike in Devil May Cry 3. He also gains the Dark Slayer style near the end of his appearance, which only has one style level. Styles do not level up through experience as in the previous game, but must instead be upgraded like other skills in the shop screen in between missions or at statues. Dante can also enter Devil Trigger; in his Devil Trigger he gains most of the benefits that Nero's Devil Trigger has, though, as he does not have the Devil Bringer, he gets animation and property changes on some of his normal attacks instead.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, CIMS {{has also}} been {{recognised}} as best practice for implementing management structures for response and recovery.

25|$|Another {{advantage}} of group living {{can be an}} increased ability to forage for food. Group members may exchange information about food sources between one another, facilitating the process of resource location. Honeybees are a notable example of this, using the waggle dance to communicate the location of flowers {{to the rest of}} their hive. Predators also receive benefits from hunting in groups, through using better strategies <b>and</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to take down larger prey.|$|E
25|$|Private baths were {{advertised as}} having healing qualities <b>and</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to cure people of diabetes, gout and all skin diseases, amongst others. On 19 November 1844, {{it was decided}} that the working class members of society should have the {{opportunity}} to access baths, in an attempt to address the health problems of the public. On that day, a committee was formed and a fund was opened. Within a week, £4,000 had been donated to the fund.|$|E
25|$|J. B. Rhine's {{experiments}} with Zener cards were discredited {{due to the}} discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being {{able to read the}} symbols {{from the back of the}} cards <b>and</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues. Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects. Due to the methodological problems, parapsychologists no longer utilize card-guessing studies.|$|E

25|$|The {{inevitable}} {{combat and}} chase sequences in the James Bond theme are handled by Action Rounds, representing 3–5 seconds of time. All characters {{involved in a}} chase or combat declare their actions in reverse order of Speed (1-3, based on the sum of Perception and Dexterity), then executed in order of speed, giving faster characters the advantages of knowing what slower characters are going to do, <b>and</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to take their action earlier. Speed also affects how many attacks a character may make in a round.|$|E
25|$|BCG is very efficacious against tuberculous {{meningitis}} in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis {{appears to be}} variable. As of 2006, only a few countries do not use BCG for routine vaccination. Two countries that have never used it routinely are the USA and the Netherlands (in both countries, it is felt that having a reliable Mantoux test <b>and</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to accurately detect active disease is more beneficial to society than vaccinating against a condition that is now relatively rare there).|$|E
25|$|Sirius XM {{has also}} become a {{competitor}} in recent years due to online-only accounts <b>and</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to customize stations; their wide availability in both the new and used car market also gives it an advantage over Pandora. When acquiring XM Satellite Radio in 2007, Sirius actually accurately predicted {{that it would be}} competing against streaming services like Pandora in its argument with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over whether the merging of the only two satellite radio companies in North America would cause antitrust issues.|$|E
