50|$|Since {{the first}} {{pioneering}} efforts of Howard Florey and Chain in 1939, {{the importance of}} antibiotics, including <b>antibacterials,</b> to medicine has led to intense research into producing <b>antibacterials</b> at large scales. Following screening of <b>antibacterials</b> against {{a wide range of}} bacteria, production of the active compounds is carried out using fermentation, usually in strongly aerobic conditions.|$|R

5|$|Reflecting {{the basic}} {{properties}} of ZnO, fine particles of the oxide have deodorizing and <b>antibacterial</b> properties {{and for that}} reason are added into materials including cotton fabric, rubber, oral care products, and food packaging. Enhanced <b>antibacterial</b> action of fine particles compared to bulk material is not exclusive to ZnO and is observed for other materials, such as silver. This property results from the increased surface area of the fine particles.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 30 selected dogs with pyoderma (superficial and deep) to evaluate the therapeutic effect of <b>antibacterials</b> and their combination with immunomodulators (Immunol liquid at a dosage of 1 – 2 mL for small breeds and 2 – 3 mL for large breeds twice daily). Among these, 12 dogs were treated with <b>antibacterials</b> alone and 18 dogs were treated with a combination of <b>antibacterials</b> and immunomodulators (Immunol liquid). Of these 12 dogs with pyoderma, 8 (66. 66 %) were successfully cured with <b>antibacterials</b> alone. However, only 6 of them (50 %) stayed healthy after a period of 1. 5 months. Of the 18 dogs treated with a combination of <b>antibacterials</b> and immunomodulators, 14 (77. 77 %) regained health within the therapeutic period; among them, 12 (85. 71 %) remained completely cured after the completion of the therapy. Recurrence of pyoderma was more (25 %) in antibacterial-treated group compared to those treated with the combination drug (14. 28 %). Results of the study suggest that in dogs with pyoderma the combination therapy was more effective than <b>antibacterials</b> therapy alone...|$|R
50|$|<b>Anti{{bacterial}}s</b> {{are used}} to treat bacterial infections. The drug toxicity to humans and other animals from <b>antibacterials</b> is generally considered low.(depends) Prolonged use of certain <b>antibacterials</b> can decrease the number of gut flora, which may {{have a negative impact}} on health. Consumption of probiotics and reasonable eating can help to replace destroyed gut flora. Stool transplants may be considered for patients who are having difficulty recovering from prolonged antibiotic treatment, as for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections.|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{histidine}} kinases (HKs) {{are promising}} targets for novel <b>antibacterials.</b> Bacterial HKs {{are part of}} bacterial two-component systems (TCSs), the main signal transduction pathways in bacteria, regulating various processes including virulence, secretion systems and antibiotic resistance. In this review, we discuss the biological importance of TCSs and bacterial HKs for the discovery of novel <b>antibacterials,</b> as well as published TCS and HK inhibitors {{that can be used}} as a starting point for structure-based approaches to develop novel <b>antibacterials...</b>|$|R

5|$|Siddiqui was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to bring the anthelmintic, antifungal, <b>antibacterial,</b> and antiviral constituents of the Neem tree {{to the attention of}} natural products chemists. In 1942, he extracted three bitter compounds from neem oil, which he named as nimbin, nimbinin, and nimbidin respectively. The process involved extracting the water-insoluble components with ether, petrol ether, ethyl acetate and dilute alcohol. The provisional naming was nimbin (sulphur-free crystalline product with melting point at 205°C, empirical composition C7H10O2), nimbinin (with similar principle, melting at 192°C), and nimbidin (cream-coloured containing amorphous sulphur, melting at 90–100°C). Siddiqui identified nimbidin as the main active <b>antibacterial</b> ingredient, and the highest yielding bitter component in the neem oil. These compounds are stable and found in substantial quantities in the Neem. They also serve as natural insecticides.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{can enhance}} the <b>antibacterial</b> activity of ciprofloxacin. It {{has been shown that}} nano ZnO which has the average size between 20nm and 45nm {{can enhance the}} <b>antibacterial</b> activity of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro. The enhancing effect of this nanomaterial is concentration dependent against all test strains. This effect may be due to two reasons. First, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with NorA protein, which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the effluxing of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones from a cell. Second, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with Omf protein, which is responsible for the permeation of quinolone antibiotics into the cell.|$|E

5|$|A {{cervical}} mucus plug, called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy.

5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} and excreted by acetic acid bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and acetic acid {{is produced}} naturally as fruits and other foods spoil. Acetic acid {{is also a}} component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild <b>antibacterial</b> agent.|$|E

5|$|MFGM {{phospholipid}} components such as phosphatidylcholine {{are a key}} constituent of {{the intestinal}} mucus barrier, and therefore may contribute to intestinal defense against invasive pathogens. Sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, {{are present in the}} apical membrane of the gut epithelia, and are also important for maintaining membrane structure, modulating growth factor receptors, and serving competitive binding inhibitors for microorganisms, microbial toxins, and viruses. Gangliosides are also present in intestinal mucosa and may possibly contribute to improved gut microflora and <b>antibacterial</b> defense.|$|E
5|$|Metallic silver, like copper, is an <b>antibacterial</b> agent, {{which was}} known to the ancients and first scientifically {{investigated}} and named the oligodynamic effect by Carl Nägeli. Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0.01–0.1milligrams per litre; metallic silver has a similar effect due {{to the formation of}} silver oxide. This effect is lost in the presence of sulfur due to the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide.|$|E
5|$|Other {{metabolites}} {{isolated from}} different species include dibenzonaphtyridinone alkaloids, prenylated phenols, benzofurans, chromenes, natural rubber (polyisoprene), sterols, and the sugar alcohol volemitol. Among toxic substances, Lactarius turpis contains the mutagenic alkaloid necatorin, {{and the small}} compound cycloprop-2-ene carboxylic acid {{has been identified as}} the toxic agent in Russula subnigricans.
