Dissolution efficiency (DE%) was calculated for both formulations to evaluate their in vitro biopharmaceutical features. The oral bioequivalence study was performed in twenty-four healthy volunteers in a crossover design. Single oral dose (tablet containing 500 mg of cephalexin) of each product was administered with two weeks of washout period. Urinary concentrations of cephalexin were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method and pharmacokinetics parameters were estimated by urinary excretion data. The bioequivalence was determined by the following parameters: the cumulative amount of cephalexin excreted in the urine, the total amount of cephalexin excreted in the urine and the maximum urinary excretion rate of cephalexin. DE values of immediate-release cephalexin tablets (500 mg) were 68. 69 ± 4. 18 % for product A and 71. 03 ± 6. 63 % for product B. Regarding the dissolution test of the two brands (A and B) analysed, both were in compliance with the official pharmacopeial specifications, since the dissolution of both formulations was superior to 80 % of the <b>amount</b> <b>declared</b> in the label after 45 minutes of test (A= 92. 09 %± 1. 84; B= 92. 84 %± 1. 08).

In 2008, the crisis was obvious to our authorities, who before declared with nonchalance that our system is way back from Europe’s and the crisis will pass near us. This didn’t happened and here we are, in front of it. The financial crisis has reduced the state budget incomes in a drastic manner, making the authorities to do what they knew better – put more fiscal weight in taxpayer’s burden. In this paper we will approach the minimum income tax amount, tax amount which has been the cap for more than 25 % of the Romanian enterprises. The government took the easy way, more tax, no analysis on what the side effects of this tax over the economy will be on short-medium term. As you guessed, the only good that came from this measure was more money at the budget, but only {{for a couple of months}} because, as previously said, 25 % of the enterprises closed their activity, meaning no more income tax payments, no more social and health contributions, no more wages paid etc. The budget has got a big hole because now, beside the fact that it didn’t cashed in from the closed enterprises, has to pay unemployment help for those who worked in those firms. As the crisis goes deeper, the government removed at the end of 2010 the minimum income tax <b>amount,</b> <b>declaring</b> with “drums and trumpets” that these measures are in order to revive the economy and the enterprises activity.

The present article deals only with the questions concerning TV watching. Twenty six persons were observed during one month by 18 observers being their close relatives. Within {{four days after the}} observation period questionnaire interviews were conducted with the same 26 persons using closed and open-ended questions, relating to their self-evaluation of frequency and intensity of TV watching, by intensity being understood average amount of time devoted daily to television; one week later the same questions were asked in second interviews. Results obtained in the observation were compared with those obtained in the two subsequent interviews. The comparison has shown that the more detailed were frequency categories the less accordant with the observation results were the interview answers. In addition it turned out that a high degree (20 cases) of accordance (i. e. reliability) between the two interviews was not accompanied by a similar degree of accordance of the observation data with interviews, the conclusion being that the reliability of answers does not indicate their validity (truthfulness). As the six frequency categories used in this analysis were very detailed (everyday, six, five, four, three, and once/or twice a week), they were combined in three ways, to three categories, and further analysis was performed in order to see which way of reduction would yield the highest degree of accordance between the observation data and the interview answers. The most valid answers (i. e. most accordant with the observation) were those obtained with the following cafeteria: 1 — everyday or nearly everyday; 2 — several times a week; 3 — once or twice a week. Matrix analysis has revealed that with this cafeteria understatements and overstatements in respondents’ answers balanced each other. As regards the intensity of TV watching, the actual amount of time devoted daily to television was calculated by combining two kinds of information: observed acts of watching particular TV programms, and duration of these programms as recorded in press announcements. The comparison of the actual average amount of time devoted daily to TV, and the <b>amount</b> <b>declared</b> in interviews has shown that: 1 ° In both interviews the respondents strongly overstated their TV watching time which means that high interview reliability does not indicate the validity of the answers; 2 ° The correlation between actual intensity of TV watching and that declared in the first interviews was as low as 0, 31. Various measures aiming at the improvement of validity of the information obtained in interviews are discussed and proposed such as: mailed fill-in questionnaire, monitoring letters, concretization of the time periods of TV watching referred to in the questions asked...|$|R

For a prime ideal p in OK and a constant c ∈ (0, 1), the function |α | = c ordp(α) for α ∈ K × (and | 0 | = 0) defines a nonarchimedean absolute value on K. We call this a p-adic absolute value.

For two different primes p and q, a p-adic absolute value and q-adic absolute value are inequivalent: the Chinese remainder theorem lets us find α ∈ OK satisfying α ≡ 0 mod p and α ≡ 1 mod q, so the p-adic absolute value of α is less than 1 and the q-adic absolute value of α equals 1.
