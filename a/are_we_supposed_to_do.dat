In {{the first part}} of the article, I articulate an answer in terms of a re-interpretation of perception and testimony as data providers rather than full-blown cases of knowledge. Second, if perception and testimony are correctly understood as data providers, how <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> (<b>to</b> apply this analysis in order) to understand the semantic value of the data provided by such processes? In the second part of the article, I argue in favour of a constructionist hypothesis about how data may become meaningful for human cognitive agents through a process of repurposing of natural data/signals. The conclusion of the paper is that human agents are natural-born data hackers. © 2014 by Peeters Publishers. All rights reserved...|$|R

Thus, my position about the science of global climate change is one of resolute agnosticism. When it comes to climate change, the key issues are no longer about forcings, albedo, or the ideal concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Instead, the key question is about policy, namely: if we are going to agree that carbon dioxide is bad, what <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> And that question—as the Duke of Bilgewater memorably put it in Huckleberry Finn—'is the bare bodkin.” ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction What <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with these}} 'floods of data ?' A very small {{proportion}} of it will ever be seen by human eyes and even less will be analysed and understood. The data, that is and will be intelligently analysed and presented, would be a valuable resource and commercially {{could be used to}} a competitive advantage. The widespread exploitation of knowledge discovery has been synergistic with this realisation. Case-based reasoning represents part of Artificial Intelligence's scientific ambitions within problem solving and the search for efficient methods to define descriptive patterns and explanations within such 'a flood of data'. Theoretically it can be used when working with large amounts of historical data and in situations where {{there is a need to}} extract order from complex data. At a simplistic level case-based reasoning represents the ability to solve a given problem by remembering a previous similar situation and by reusing information and knowledge of...|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} of goodness in ethical thinking of Plato and Aristotle. The work aims to answer two research questions: How did Plato and Aristotle perceive the essence of goodness in human life? What <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in order to accomplish human well-being? The first chapter contains a brief summary of ethical ideas of both philosophers. In the following chapters their concepts of areté, soul and goodness are analysed and compared. The comparison supports the fact that both Plato and Aristotle basically agreed on the essence of human goodness. They consider it the sole criterion of human well-being, both of them connect it with moral values and argue that it can be only achived through life in accordance with the virtues. On the other hand, Plato and Aristotle differ from each other in the way how can be such human goodness and well-being achieved. Aristotle's views based on the ethical issues, however, can not be perceived as totally different from those of Plato, but rather as a further elaboration and supplement of his ideas and opinions...|$|E

40|$|Paper-ballot {{elections}} {{may be a}} bit cumbersome {{yet many}} people will agree that the procedures to be followed are sufficiently transparent to all parties involved. The principles for fair elections are clear, and common sense tells people what to look for to detect potential fraud. The process is trans-parent. For computerized elections the principles for fair elections are not all that obvious anymore. In particular, the internet {{turns out to be a}} highway fraught with accidents, where breaches of security and privacy have become all too common. News items reporting on such incidents get to the general public on an almost daily basis. For elections to be considered fair in such hostile environments, new rules and standards need to be set in order to compensate for the lack of transparency. It is helpful to start looking at one of the problems to be solved by any voting system. Namely, the fundamental problem of achieving accuracy and ballot secrecy at the same time-assuming it is agreed that ballot secrecy is an essential ingredient for achieving democracy. Accuracy of the final tally means that it corresponds exactly to the ballots cast by legitimate voters. For instance, when voting by hand-raising it is easy to convince everybody of the correctness of the tally, but then there is no privacy. A common way for internet-based elections these days is to put up a secure web server (plus database) for collecting the votes. Assuming the web server somehow ascertains the identity of voters and allows only one vote per voter, the idea is that the web server will honestly process each ballot by keeping a running total and forgetting who exactly voted what. At the end of the day, a final tally may then be produced. Now suppose someone is not happy with the result, or rather, suppose not everybody believes it is the correct result, and a re-count is demanded. What <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> We could show them the records representing the ballots again, and have them check the total. But these records need not have to do anything with the ballots cast by the legitimate voters: to protect the voters ’ privacy all identifying information has been removed. In fact, any audit trail for this type of system would violate ballot secrecy...|$|E

40|$|Eric Perl, in his provocatively titled book, Theophany: The Neo-Platonic Philosophy of Dionysius the Areopagite, argues {{not only}} that Dionysios’ thought is {{thoroughly}} Neo-Platonic and fully compatible with Christianity, but that “the Dionysian doctrine of cosmic and ecclesiastical hierarchy is not only consistent with but essential to holy tradition” and that “Dionysius represents precisely those doctrines which are most typical of [Eastern] Orthodoxy in distinction from the west. ” Like it or not, {{it is not that}} easy to ignore hierarchy in the sense the Areopagite had in mind in the Corpus Dionysiacum (CD). It is Dionysios who is credited with the first use of the word “hierarchy” as an abstract noun and the influence of this abstract notion of hierarchy has been far-reaching and is ubiquitous within society, not only within the Christian churches. Two related ideas continue to trouble me in the aftermath of reading Perl on Dionysios. The first is the thought that in our natural suspicion of hierarchy we may be sowing the very seeds that will keep us from ever being able to tap the wisdom of the CD. The second, is that if Perl – whose arguments are thorough, persuasive, and beautiful – is correct in both his understanding of neo-Platonic hierarchy and in his assertion that this is the thoroughgoing philosophical backdrop for the Areopagite, then hierarchy isn’t just a convenient construct dreamed up by churchmen that helps us get closer to God if we follow the rules of order, nor is it just a description of the functional workings of the mystical and sacramental life as understood within the Eastern ascetic tradition; though neither of those understandings would be wrong per se, both would be deficient. If Perl is right, Dionysios understood all creation to be Theophany, and hierarchy as the very structure of the entire created order, which reflects the life of God in existence. This hierarchy is not an “optional extra,” and opting out of participation – in so far as this is even possible – is, quite literally, to use the words of St. Paul (Rom 1 : 25), “exchanging the truth for a lie” and straightforwardly spells physical and spiritual death. For those of us with anarchist (or at least rebellious) tendencies – for those who have a developed sense of justice and despise hierarchical abuses – the news seems bad. If Perl is right, running away from Church structures won’t solve this problem because you can’t run away from the structure of existence itself. What exactly <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> St. Symeon the New Theologian’s solution was to argue that the true bishop is the person with a pure heart (he had monastics in mind); but Dionysios’s fiery 8 th Epistle to the monk Demophilos makes it more than clear that he does not see this as a possible solution for the very reason that hierarchical order is violated. Abolish the structure of reality we cannot. Nihilism doesn’t seem a very attractive option, so what are we left with...|$|E
