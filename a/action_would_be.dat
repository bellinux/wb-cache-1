Meanwhile, Gannon was left threatening police action over a strong challenge that left Stockport striker Matty McNeil unconscious and in hospital.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Soult {{was making}} his own plans. He knew that Blake {{intended}} to join forces with Beresford, but {{he thought that the}} Spanish divisions were still several days march away. Based on that erroneous premise, Soult decided that his best course of <b>action</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between the two parts of Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes <b>action</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored. The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) {{requested}} {{the intervention of}} the International Association of Athletics Federations and the IOC; the samples were jointly reexamined by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the IOC Sub-Commission on Doping and Biochemistry of Sport.

5|$|A {{separate}} {{criminal investigation}} {{focused on the}} illegal factory itself. Almost all factories and homes in the area were illegal and unauthorised, and do not follow building codes and sanctions. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said <b>action</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> taken against {{the owners of the}} factory and house, and Superintendent of Police of South 24 Parganas S. N. Gupta said that the owners of the building would be arrested. Investigation has shown that the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) issued notices to the building on three separate occasions, in 1988, 1989, and 1992, yet took no further action. It has been shown, however, that the KMC also approved trade licences for two businesses to operate from the building. The owner of the building, Khurshid Alam, has had a police complaint filed against him by the fire department for illegal construction charges. Mohammed Sagir Ahmed and Mohammed Asif, the owners of Tenex Exports, also face related charges. Both investigations are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the action}} the Tripolitanians had lost their three largest vessels and {{suffered}} heavy casualties, while the Sardinians only had two dead and five wounded. Later in the day while Sivori was making preparations for another attack on the city, a Dutch brig sailed out of port saluting him and signaling that it wished to communicate with him. Upon contacting the squadron, the brig's captain sent Sivori the congratulatory remarks of the British consul at Tripoli. The Sardinian commander sent the Dutch vessel back into port with a message to Karamanli that if he did not commence negotiations, further military <b>action</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> taken against the city. Rather than suffer continued action from the Sardinians, Karamanli acceded to the Sardinian requests and sent an envoy out to the Sardinian squadron.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes <b>action</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, on other occasions, the problem would simply be ignored. The royal eyres, courts which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for those lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against the major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. The power of royal sheriffs also declined during Henry's reign. They were now often lesser men appointed by the exchequer, rather than coming from important local families, and they focused on generating revenue for the King. Their robust attempts to enforce fines and collect debts generated much unpopularity among the lower classes. Unlike his father, Henry did not exploit the large debts that the barons frequently owed to the Crown, and was slow to collect any sums of money due to him.|$|E
5000|$|Comments from Iranian {{officials}} also supported this view. The Iranian state news agency quoted Iranian President Mohammad Khatami {{as saying that}} Miresmaeili's <b>actions</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> [...] "recorded {{in the history of}} Iranian glories," [...] and that the nation considered him to be [...] "the champion of the 2004 Olympic Games." ...|$|R

Meija’s electoral platform advocated for anti-imperialism, revolutionary agrarian reform, unionized workers, and democratic freedoms.|$|R
5|$|Domenicali insisted {{there were}} no team orders {{and that it was}} Massa who chose to allow Alonso past. Alonso reaffirmed Domenicalli's {{statement}} and admitted he was surprised when Massa slowed and claimed that he felt Massa had a gearbox issue. FIA reporter Lars Osterlind investigated the incident and sent a 160-page report to the World Motor Sport Council which concluded that Alonso should be given a five-second time penalty which would hand the victory to Massa. He also wanted a suspended penalty on the loss of Ferrari's Drivers' and Constructors' points scored in the event. At the World Motor Sport Council meeting held in Paris on 8 September, the tribunal elected to uphold the $100,000 fine imposed on Ferrari, decided that no further <b>action</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> taken against the team, and that Formula One's Sporting Working Group would review the rule that prohibited team orders. In December, the FIA announced the rule on team orders would be revoked because it was difficult to enforce. Parallels were made between the race and the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix where Barrichello was ordered by Ferrari to concede the event's victory to Schumacher on its final lap.|$|E

5|$|On 27 April Model {{met with}} Hitler {{to review and}} express his concern for {{reconnaissance}} information which showed the Red Army constructing very strong positions at {{the shoulders of the}} salient and having withdrawn their mobile forces from the area west of Kursk. He argued that the longer the preparation phase continued, the less the operation could be justified. He recommended completely abandoning Citadel, allowing the army to await and defeat the coming Soviet offensive, or radically revising the plan for Citadel. Though in mid-April Manstein had considered the Citadel offensive profitable, by May he shared Model's misgivings. He asserted that the best course of <b>action</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> for the German forces to take the strategic defensive, ceding ground to allow the anticipated Soviet forces to extend themselves and allow the German panzer forces to counterattack in the type of fluid mobile battle at which they excelled. Convinced that the Red Army would deliver its main effort against Army Group South, he proposed to keep the left wing of the army group strong while moving the right wing back in stages to the Dnieper River, followed by a counterattack against the flank of the Red Army advance. The counteroffensive would continue until the Sea of Azov was reached and the Soviet forces were cut off. Hitler rejected this idea; {{he did not want to}} give up so much terrain, even temporarily.|$|E

Seip later closed the investigation without recommending criminal charges against anyone involved.|$|R
5|$|Once his {{squadron}} {{arrived in}} Tripoli, Silvori sent the Tritone {{into the harbor}} under a flag of truce in order to begin negotiations with Karamanli's government. With assurances from the resident British consul {{that they would be}} safe, Silvori went ashore on the 26th and met the Tripolitanian envoy, General Haggi Mohammed. Although negotiations at first seemed to be going well, the next day Karamanli sent a note with suggested terms that essentially abrogated the peace treaty that British Admiral Edward Pellew had negotiated on Sardinia's behalf after the Bombardment of Algiers in 1816. Seeing that Karamanli had no intention of offering acceptable terms, Sivori decided his best course of <b>action</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to attack Tripoli. Before returning to his squadron Sivori managed to get the British consul to take under his protection what Sardinians remained in Tripoli. Salvori's force had a significant advantage over the Tripolitanian fleet, which only had a 12-gun brig and a pair of 6-gun schooners defending the harbor. Despite the disadvantage in naval power, Karamanli had significant forces ashore and several forts and shore batteries defending the harbor. Upon returning to his vessel, Salvori gave Karamanli a four-hour ultimatum that he would bombard the city unless better peace terms were offered by the Tripolitanians.|$|E
