5|$|Aleister Crowley {{was highly}} {{prolific}} and {{wrote on the}} subject of Thelema for over 35 years, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> books remain in print. During his time, there were several who wrote on the subject, including U.S. O.T.O. Grand Master Charles Stansfeld Jones, whose works on Qabalah are still in print, and Major-General J. F. C. Fuller.|$|E
5|$|Critics have derided {{the novel}} for being {{derivative}} of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Some have accused Brooks of lifting the entire plot <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> characters directly from Lord of the Rings; others have praised its execution {{despite the lack}} of originality.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} {{of the country was}} also influenced by American cinema, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> illustrations were based on cinematic imagery. Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier thought that Tintin's arrest of Smiles had been influenced by the Buffalo Bill stories, and that the idea of the gangsters taking Tintin away in their car came from Little Caesar.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} {{the results of}} a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> series, but discarded his sections. George's B.ser. Tetragonae was found to be monophyletic, and therefore retained; and their analysis of the relationships within the series supported the placement of B.aculeata alongside B.caleyi.|$|E
5|$|Josquin's {{earliest}} chansons {{were probably}} composed in northern Europe, {{under the influence}} of composers such as Ockeghem and Busnois. Unlike them, however, he never adhered strictly to the conventions of the formes fixes– the rigid and complex repetition patterns of the rondeau, virelai, and ballade– instead he often wrote his early chansons in strict imitation, a feature they shared with many of his sacred works. He {{was one of the first}} composers of chansons to make all voices equal parts of the texture; <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chansons contain points of imitation, in the manner of motets. However he did use melodic repetition, especially where the lines of text rhymed, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chansons had a lighter texture, as well as a faster tempo, than his motets.|$|E
5|$|The English artist Henry Stacy Marks (1829-1888) took {{a special}} {{interest}} in birds <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> paintings were based on birds in the London Zoo and a number of his works included depictions of greater adjutants. Some of his paintings that include adjutants are Convocation (1878), Science is Measurement (1879), Half hours at the Zoo and An Episcopal Visitation.|$|E

5|$|Bennett had a {{significant}} influence on English music, not solely as a composer {{but also as a}} teacher, as a promoter of standards of musical education and as an important figure in London concert life. In recent years, appreciation of Bennett's compositions has been rekindled and a number of his works, including a symphony, his piano concerti, some vocal music <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> piano compositions, have been recorded. In his bicentenary year of 2016, several concerts of his music and other related events took place.|$|E
5|$|During this period, 1st Airborne Division was {{composed}} of only two parachute battalions, of which only one (1st Parachute Battalion), was fully trained. Browning, wishing to keep 1st Parachute Battalion intact for any larger operation the division might be selected for, ordered 2nd Parachute Battalion to provide a company for the operation. 'C' Company commanded by Major John Frost was selected, but the company had been so recently formed that Frost <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men had not yet completed their parachute jumping course.|$|E
5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 1996, when Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published an}} arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics. They retained George's subgenera <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> series, but discarded his sections. Banksia ser. Abietinae {{was found to}} be very nearly monophyletic, and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries. Banksia sphaerocarpa appeared in the second of these, initially called the ' grossa clade' for its most basal member. As with George's classification, B.grossa and B.micrantha emerged as close relatives of B.sphaerocarpa.|$|E

5|$|In the Common Pleas, Blackstone {{operated}} under a civil jurisdiction {{rather than a}} mixed civil and criminal one. This played to his strengths, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> decisions are considered farsighted; the principle in Blaney v Hendricks, for example, that interest is due on an account where money was lent, which anticipated Section 3 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934. Blackstone's decision in Goldswain's Case was later repeated by Lord Denning in Falmouth Boat Construction Co v Howell in 1950.|$|E
5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that it was supernatural affairs and Paulinus' persuasion alone that caused Edwin to convert. The Northumbrian nobles {{seem to have been}} willing and the king also received letters from Pope Boniface V urging his conversion. Eventually convinced, Edwin <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> followers were baptised at York in 627. One story relates that during a stay with Edwin and Æthelburg at their palace in Yeavering, Paulinus spent 36days baptising new converts. Paulinus also was an active missionary in Lindsey, and his missionary activities help show the limits of Edwin's royal authority.|$|E
5|$|MacMillan {{died from}} a heart attack {{backstage}} at the Royal Opera House during a performance of Mayerling. Jeremy Isaacs, the general director of the Royal Opera House, announced the death from the stage after the performance and asked the audience to rise and bow their heads and leave the theatre in silence. On the same night the junior company was presenting MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet in Birmingham. MacMillan had nearly finished work on the dances for a new production of Carousel by the National Theatre, which opened at the Lyttelton Theatre six weeks later, with his family <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends in the audience.|$|E

After a high-speed chase, Sol <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.|$|E
5|$|The 1840s were a {{turbulent}} decade in the Church of England. Following the earlier German Higher Critics, who {{argued for a}} historical approach to religious texts, David Strauss published Leben Jesu or The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined which argued that {{the events of the}} New Testament were not historical but rather mythical. In 1846 George Eliot published an English translation of Leben Jesu which became a source of religious doubts for Froude <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contemporaries. Critics have also identified Thomas Carlyle's novel Sartor Resartus and Spinoza as sources of Sutherland's doubts, and those of many of his contemporaries.|$|E

5|$|The French {{authorities}} imprisoned Long <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> supporters, who openly admitted {{their aim}} of overthrowing French authorities at the trial. During the 1916 Cochinchina uprisings against French rule, many of Long's supporters attempted to break {{him out of}} jail. The French easily repelled {{the attack on the}} jail, decimating Long's movement. Following the attempted breakout, Long and his key supporters were put to death. Many of the remnants of his support base went on to join what later became the Cao Đài, a major religious sect in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The close {{relations}} with Byzantium, however, {{did not help}} Prince Vladimir. Samuel attacked Duklja in 1009 or 1010, {{as part of his}} campaign aimed at breaking up that pro-Byzantine bloc, which could have threatened him. Vladimir retreated with his army <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> people to his fortress on a hill named Oblik, close to the southeastern tip of Lake Skadar. According to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, he performed a miracle there: the hill was infested with venomous snakes, but when he offered up a prayer to the Lord, their bites became harmless.|$|E
