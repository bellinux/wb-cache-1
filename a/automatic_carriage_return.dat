5000|$|The Blick Electric was {{a revolutionary}} machine and was {{far ahead of}} its time when it was first {{introduced}} at the Pan-American Exhibition in Buffalo in 1901 following its patent in August 1900 (patent no.656,085). It had all the familiar characteristics of the manual models, plus a QWERTY or a DHIATENSOR keyboard and all the advantages of later electric typewriters, including a light key touch, even typing, and <b>automatic</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> and line spacing. The machine was powered by an Emerson electric motor mounted on the rear and switched on by turning a Yale key on the side.http://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/index.php3?machine=blickel&cat=ks The motor ran on 104 Volt 60 Hz AC electric current, which was not yet widely standard at the time.

40|$|A display {{processor}} used {{to interface}} a 21 -inch {{cathode-ray tube display}} with a small research computer is described. Inputs from an external 4 K memory, incremental and absolute shaft position encoders, and data/control switches are also provided. In addition to the point-plotting and single-character mode of the display, a line generator using incremental binary rate multiplier techniques is incorporated for drawing vectors, circles, and parabolas. A character sequencer allows 4 characters per 24 -bit word to be displayed, and also provides <b>automatic</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> and line feed for text displayed on the CRT screen.

50|$|Another {{problem is}} scripts {{containing}} a <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> character {{immediately after the}} shebang, perhaps {{as a result of}} being edited on a system that uses DOS line breaks, such as Microsoft Windows. Some systems interpret the <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> character as part of the interpreter command, resulting in an error message.|$|R

5000|$|Early {{mechanical}} printers {{were too}} slow to <b>return</b> the <b>carriage</b> {{in the time it}} took to process one character. Therefore, the time spent sending the line feed was not wasted (often several more characters had to be sent to ensure the <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> had happened before sending a printing character). This is why the <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> was always sent first.|$|R
50|$|Acorn MOS {{does provide}} two other OS calls that handle text output: OSNEWL and OSASCI. OSNEWL writes a line feed and <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> {{to the current}} output stream. OSASCI {{forwards}} all characters directly to OSWRCH except for <b>carriage</b> <b>return,</b> which triggers a call to OSNEWL instead. The precise code for OSASCI and OSNEWL five lines of 6502 assembler is documented in the BBC Micro User Guide.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{computer}} programs use the <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> character, {{alone or with}} a line feed, to signal {{the end of a}} line of text, but other characters are also used for this function (see newline); others use it only for a paragraph break (a [...] "hard return"). Some standards which introduce their own representations for line and paragraph control (for example HTML) and many programming languages treat <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> and line feed as whitespace.|$|R

These characters {{are based on}} printer commands: The line feed indicated that one line of paper should feed out of the printer thus instructed the printer to advance the paper one line, and a <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> indicated that the printer <b>carriage</b> should <b>return</b> {{to the beginning of}} the current line. Some rare systems, such as QNX before version 4, used the ASCII [...] (record separator, , 30 in decimal) character as the newline character.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{contemporary}} graphical word processors Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.org, users {{are expected to}} type a <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> (...) between each paragraph.

50|$|Many daisy wheel {{machines}} offer a {{bold type}} facility, accomplished by double- or triple-striking the specified character(s); servo-based printers advance the carriage fractionally for a wider (and therefore blacker) character, while cheaper machines perform a <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> without a line feed {{to return to}} the beginning of the line, space through all non-bold text, and restrike each bolded character. The inherent imprecision in attempting to restrike on exactly the same spot after a <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> provides the same effect as the more expensive servo-based printers, with the unique side effect that as the printer ages and wears, bold text becomes bolder.|$|R
