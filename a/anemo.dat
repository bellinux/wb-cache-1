He argued that the disorder would gain their side an advantage, but his idea was ultimately rejected.|$|E

If the ants are experimentally deprived of their polarization compass system, but have access simultaneously to both their sun compass and their wind compass, they steer intermediate courses. The intermediate courses shift the more towards the wind compass course, the higher the elevation of the sun is in the sky...|$|E

40|$|International audienceShort-term {{wind power}} {{prediction}} {{is a primary}} requirement for efficient large-scale integration of wind generation in power systems and electricity markets. The choice of an appropriate prediction model among the numerous available models is not trivial, {{and has to be}} based on an objective evaluation of model performance. This paper proposes a standardized protocol for the evaluation of short-term wind-power prediction systems. A number of reference prediction models are also described, and their use for performance comparison is analysed. The use of the protocol is demonstrated, using results from both on-shore and offshore wind farms. The work was developed in the frame of the <b>Anemos</b> project (EU R&D project) where the protocol has been used to evaluate more than 10 prediction systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Accurate {{forecasting}} of {{wind farms}} power produc-tion {{up to two}} days ahead is recognized as a major contribution for reliable large-scale wind power integration. Especially, in a liberalized electricity market, prediction tools enhance the posi-tion of wind energy compared {{to other forms of}} dispatchable gen-eration. As wind integration increases, the requirements for wind power forecasting diversify depending on the end-user and the context. In the frame of the EU project <b>Anemos</b> multidisciplinary research has been carried out in wind forecasting by a number of research organizations and end-users with wide experience in the field. Advanced statistical, physical and combined modeling ap-proaches were developed including methods for on-line uncer-tainty and prediction risk assessment. An integrated software platform was developed to host the various models. It was in-stalled by several end-users for on-line operation and evaluation at a local, regional and national scale. This paper presents the research methodology and the major results obtained.
