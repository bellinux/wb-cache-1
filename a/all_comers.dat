5|$|As {{the reigning}} 200 m {{champion}} {{at both the}} World Youth and World Junior championships, Bolt hoped to take a clean sweep of the world 200 m championships in the Senior World Championships in Paris. He beat <b>all</b> <b>comers</b> at the 200 m in the World Championship trials. Bolt was pragmatic about his chances and noted that, {{even if he did}} not make the final, he would consider setting a personal best a success. However, he suffered a bout of conjunctivitis before the event, and it ruined his training schedule. Realising {{that he would not be}} in peak condition, the JAAA refused to let him participate in the finals, on the grounds that he was too young and inexperienced. Bolt was dismayed at missing out on the opportunity, but focused on getting himself in shape to gain a place on the Jamaican Olympic team instead. Even though he missed the World Championships, Bolt was awarded the IAAF Rising Star Award for the 2003 season on the strength of his junior record-equalling run.|$|E
5|$|Most non-human-related {{mortality}} involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive {{their first}} year. However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived {{to their first}} year. Occasionally, nestling or egg fatalities are due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. These have been verified to be preyed by large gulls, corvids (including ravens, crows and magpies), wolverines (Gulo gulo), hawks, owls, eagles, bobcats (Lynx rufus), American black bears (Ursus americanus) and raccoons. If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage thus resulting in less protection. Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island. The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from <b>all</b> <b>comers</b> and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black bear out of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of Banagher {{as a military}} position on the Shannon and on the highway from Leinster and Munster to Connacht was early appreciated by the English, whose forces seized it about {{the middle of the}} 16th century, coming up the river to do so. They constructed some fortifications which they called Fort Frankford (later Fort Falkland) and held the place {{in spite of the fact}} that the part of Offaly for some miles around Banagher was in the hands of the MacCoghlan clan. The MacCoghlans, aided by boundaries of bog and river, held their territories against <b>all</b> <b>comers</b> for about 500 years, even maintaining a footing by open defiance well into the 17th century. Garry Castle, Clonony Castle, and Moystown Castle are remains of MacCoghlan strongholds. Sometime after 1554, when Queen Mary married Philip II of Spain, Offaly County was named King's County in honour of Philip, but it is doubtful if the royal jurisdiction extended to any of the MacCoghlan areas except Banagher. Ultimately, the MacCoghlans were overthrown and their lands were planted by order of James I issued in 1621.|$|E

5|$|England {{had started}} the Third Test at Sydney strongly. Australia took its first wicket when Miller caught Washbrook from Johnson with a {{horizontal}} diving catch at slip. England were still in control at 1/128 when Miller came on to bowl. He removed Hutton and Reg Simpson before bowling Compton for a duck. In the space of four overs from Miller, England were now 4/137. Miller had contributed to all four wickets. Miller ended with 4/37 as England were bowled out for 290 on the second day. Miller batted patiently on the third day, reaching 96 by stumps with Australia at 6/362. The next day, with his century four runs away, Miller arrived late, leaving his batting partner Johnson waiting at the players' gate. Miller progressed to 145notout despite the interruption. It has been a patient innings by his standards, taking almost a day. England collapsed for 123, leaving Australia to take an innings victory. In the first innings of the Fourth Test in Sydney, Miller scored 44 and did not take a wicket, but he was heading for consecutive Test centuries in the second innings. He reached 99 when a leg break from Doug Wright spun across him and clipped the off bail. The innings helped Australia to set England a target of 503. Miller took 3/27 on the final day, helping {{to cut through the}} middle order as Australia won by 274runs. Miller was out for seven and a duck in the Fifth Test at the MCG. He took 4/76 in the first innings, joining Lindwall in cutting down the middle order, despite which England won by eight wickets. Miller topped the Test batting averages with 350 runs at 43.75, and for the entire first-class season, he scored 1332runs at 78.35, the highest among <b>all</b> <b>comers.</b> His bowling was also strong, with 17wickets at 17.70, second only to Jack Iverson (21 wickets at 15.23).

40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} {{performance}} of the everolimus-eluting stent (EES) versus cobalt chromium bare-metal stent (BMS) in the setting of primary percutaneous coronary intervention for treatment of patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The implantation of a drug-eluting stent in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction is still controversial. In several registries this clinical scenario has been associated with the development of stent thrombosis. The EES has demonstrated to reduce the stent thrombosis rate as compared to paclitaxel-eluting stent in randomised controlled trials, mainly performed in patients in stable clinical conditions. There are however few data regarding the effectiveness of EES in the context of STEMI. Methods and results: This is an investigator-driven, prospective, multicentre, multinational, randomised, single blind, two-arm, controlled trial (ClinicalTrials. gov number: NCT 00828087). This trial, with an <b>all</b> <b>comer</b> design, randomises approximately 1, 500 patients 1 : 1 to EES or BMS. Overall, any patient presenting with STEMI up to 48 hours who requires emergent percutaneous coronary intervention can be included. The primary endpoint is the patient-oriented combined endpoint of all-cause death, any myocardial infarction and any revascularisation at 1 -year according to the Academic Research Consortium. Clinical follow-up will be scheduled at 30 days, six months, one year and yearly up to five years. No angiographic follow-up is mandated per protocol. Conclusions: This trial with broad inclusion and few exclusion criteria will shed light on {{the performance of}} the second generation EES in the complex scenario of STEMI...|$|R

40|$|Background: Second-{{generation}} everolimus-eluting stents (EES) {{and third}} generation biolimus-eluting stents (BES) {{have been shown}} to be superior to first-generation paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) and second-generation sirolimus-eluting stents (SES). However, neointimal proliferation and very late stent thrombosis is still an unresolved issue of drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation overall. The Absorb™ (Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, IL, USA) is the first CE approved DES with a bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) thought to reduce long-term complication rates. The EVERBIO II trial was set up to compare the BVS safety and efficacy with both EES and BES in all patients viable for inclusion. Methods/Design: The EVERBIO II trial is a single-center, assessor-blinded, randomized trial. The study population consists of all patients aged ≥ 18 years old undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Exclusion criterion is where the lesion cannot be treated with BVS (reference vessel diameter > 4. 0 mm). A total of 240 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned into 3 groups of 80 with either BVS, EES or BES implantation. All patients will undergo a follow-up angiography study at 9 months. Clinical follow-up for up to 5 years will be conducted by telephone. The primary endpoint is in-segment late lumen loss at 9 months measured by quantitative coronary angiography. Secondary endpoints are patient-oriented major adverse cardiac event (MACE) (death, myocardial infarction and target-vessel revascularization), device-oriented MACE (cardiac death, myocardial infarction and target-lesion revascularization), stent thrombosis according to ARC and binary restenosis at follow-up 12 months angiography. Discussion: EVERBIO II is an independent, randomized study, aiming to compare the clinical efficacy, angiographic outcomes and safety of BVS, EES and BES in <b>all</b> <b>comer</b> patients.

40|$|BackgroundStenting {{options for}} {{patients}} {{at high risk}} of bleeding (elderly, AF, ACS) are sub-optimal. BMS are not as effective as DES in reducing restenosis but DES require long term DAPT, which increases bleeding risk. Recent animal studies have demonstrated that the nano PzF surface modified stent (Cobra PzF, CeloNova) is thrombo-resistant, and is associated with a rapid reendothelialization. Method 100 patients (71 men) with mean age 71. 4 ± 2 year old of <b>all</b> <b>comer</b> patients were prospectively included to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the Cobra PzF stent. Patients presented with multiple co-morbidities including 22 % DM, 10 % AF, 17 % EF< 40 %, 10 % VKA, 28 % ACS, 10 % STEMI and 26 % diffused and multivessel diseases. Results 166 Cobra PzF stents were implanted in 151 lesions (74 % B 1 lesions) via a radial route (72 %) with a 6 F-guiding catheter. 1. 66 stent/pt was implanted for a mean stent length of 18. 7 ± 0. 5 mm and a mean diameter of 3. 1 ± 0. 3 mm. Target lesions in left main (2 %), LAD Diag (43 %), CxMg (23 %), RCA (32 %), including bifurcated kissed lesions (12 %) were treated with 50 % direct stenting. The device was successfully implanted in 100 % of targeted lesions to achieve a complete revascularization in all cases. In-hospital, there were no adverse events (Death, MI, TLR, cerebral events, stent thrombosis) or incidence of major bleeding complications or transfusions. At one month, no events were reported. 6 -month results showed 4 % of MACE (terminal cardiac insufficiency and 3 restenosis successfully treated). ConclusionThose Results are very promising in real world and complex patients (Diabetes, AF, Acute MI, Unstable Angina, Bifurcation, VKA). The COBRA PzF stent is safe and effective in routine practice. These preliminary data and the rapid reendothelialization observed in preclinical will serve as an impetus for a multi-center randomized study of short DAPT...|$|R
