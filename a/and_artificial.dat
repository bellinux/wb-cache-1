5|$|Even {{though many}} species of Stylidium may coexist in the same location, natural hybrids between species have not often been reported. Both natural {{hybridisation}} in the field <b>and</b> <b>artificial</b> hybridisation in cultivation are rare.

5|$|Habitat {{enhancements}} used {{to increase}} the breeding success of terns include floating nest platforms for black, common and Caspian terns, <b>and</b> <b>artificial</b> islands created {{for a number of}} different species. More specialised interventions include providing nest boxes for roseate terns, which normally nest in the shelter of tallish vegetation, and using artificial eelgrass mats to encourage common terns to nest in areas not vulnerable to flooding.|$|E

5|$|The {{notion that}} it is a simple matter to {{distinguish}} between the yield of natural agents and that of improvements is fanciful and confusing....

5|$|The {{production}} of a final combined image at each wavelength was a complex process. Bright pixels caused by cosmic ray impacts during exposures were removed by comparing exposures of equal length taken one after the other, and identifying pixels that were affected by cosmic rays in one exposure but not the other.

5|$|Treatment for {{hyperthermia}} includes reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine. More {{severe cases}} may require muscular paralysis with vecuronium, intubation, <b>and</b> <b>artificial</b> ventilation. Suxamethonium {{is not recommended}} for muscular paralysis as it may {{increase the risk of}} cardiac dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia associated with rhabdomyolysis. Antipyretic agents are not recommended as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity, not a hypothalamic temperature set point abnormality.|$|E
5|$|Turing {{was highly}} {{influential}} {{in the development of}} theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.

5|$|Valve {{struggled}} to find a publisher, as many believed the game was too ambitious for a first-time developer. Sierra On-Line signed Valve for a one-game deal as it was interested in making a 3D action game, especially one based on the Quake engine. Valve first showed Half-Life in early 1997; it was a success at Electronic Entertainment Expo that year, where Valve demonstrated the game's animation <b>and</b> <b>artificial</b> intelligence.|$|E

5|$|A 2000 UK {{systematic}} review (York) found that water fluoridation {{was associated with}} a decreased proportion of children with cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (average decreases was 2.25teeth). The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce observer bias, control for confounding factors, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural <b>and</b> <b>artificial</b> fluoridation were apparent, the evidence was inadequate for a conclusion about any differences.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's pupil and {{successor}} at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, {{wrote the}} History of Plants, the first classical book of botany. It has an Aristotelian structure, {{but rather than}} focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, comparing natural <b>and</b> <b>artificial</b> processes. Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical. Where Aristotle insisted that species have a fixed place on the scala naturae, Theophrastus suggests that one kind of plant can transform into another, as when a field sown to wheat turns to the weed darnel.|$|E
5|$|Aspmyra Stadion is a {{football}} stadium in Bodø, Norway. Home of Bodø/Glimt and Grand Bodø, it holds {{a capacity for}} 7,354 spectators.

The venue has floodlights <b>and</b> <b>artificial</b> turf with under-soil heating. Immediately south of the venue lies Aspmyra kunstgressbane, a training pitch with artificial turf. Aspmyra Stadion has hosted one Norway national football team match, against Iceland in 2002.|$|E
