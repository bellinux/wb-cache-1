Terron Moore of Ology praised the episode, giving it an 8.5 out of ten rating. Points of acclaim went to the humor of the episode, to which Moore opined that it [...] "was packed with a lot of funny lines, a lot of ridiculous Stan antics , <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> funny arc involving Roger and his girlfriend".|$|E
500|$|When the Florida {{legislature}} {{passed the}} American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) model law to outlaw {{the killing of}} plume birds, this created a need for qualified and competent wardens to enforce it. [...] Kirk Munroe, {{a friend of the}} Bradley family and a founding vice president of the Florida Audubon Society, recommended Guy for the position. [...] Seen as different from the other [...] "wild" [...] young men in Flamingo, Bradley was described as [...] "pleasant, quiet… fair, with blue eyes, always whistling <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good violinist… [...] social asset to the isolated, frontier community, clean-cut, reliable, courageous, energetic and conscientious".|$|E
500|$|When {{the episode}} {{originally}} aired in 1982, Fred Rothenberg of the Associated Press {{called it an}} introduction to a [...] "new wise-cracking comedy", [...] "a warm and wacky companion of a television show, a delightful place to spend idle time, [...] a five-star watering hole" [...] known as Cheers. Television and radio critic Mike Drew {{said it was not}} great but [...] "funnier [...] with cute lines [...] than" [...] any other sitcom, even those (like Archie Bunker's Place on TV and Duffy's Tavern on radio) set in bars. Fred L. Smith of The News and Courier found this episode similar to Taxi: [...] "Both are set in a place of business−Cheers at a , Taxi at a —both have a sensible guy <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty,</b> preppy girl as main characters—Ted Danson and Shelley Long in Cheers and Judd Hirsch and Marilu Henner in Taxi—and both are wacky comedies." [...] He found it [...] "amusing"; some jokes, funny; many others, forced; and the number of [...] "weird characters" [...] in the show greater than their real-life bar counterparts.|$|E

500|$|In {{the period}} drama The Girl of Your Dreams (La niña de tus ojos), Cruz portrayed Macarena Granada, a singer {{who is in}} an on-and-off {{relationship}} with Antonio Resines's character, Blas. They {{are part of a}} Francoist film troupe that travels from Spain during the Spanish Civil War to Nazi Germany for a joint production with UFA. Cruz's performance in the film was praised by film critics, with Jonathan Holloland of Variety magazine writing [...] "if confirmation is still needed that Cruz is an actress first <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> face second, then here it is". A writer for Film4 commented that [...] "Cruz herself is the inevitable focus of the film" [...] but noted that overall the film [...] "looks great". Cruz's role as Macerna has been viewed as her [...] "largest role to date". For her performance, Cruz received a Goya Award and Spanish Actors' Union Award, and was nominated for a European Film Award. In 1999, Cruz worked with Almodóvar again in All About My Mother, playing Sister María Rosa Sanz, a pregnant nun with AIDS. The film received favorable reviews, and was commercially successful, grossing over $67million worldwide, although it performed better at the box office internationally than domestically.|$|E
500|$|An {{episode of}} MTV Unplugged {{starring}} Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29, 2014; she performed an acoustic version of [...] "Wrecking Ball", among several additional tracks from Bangerz. On May 27, 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo, Monaco; where she also won four World Music Awards. She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance. It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery. Cyrus returned {{to perform the}} song during the musical festival on June 21, 2014, Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London, in front of 80,000 people. Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. A critic from the Nashville Scene praised the performance, writing, [...] "Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena, some of the audience tearing up." [...] Blake Hannon praised Cyrus' vocal delivery, writing, [...] "The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball. It was {{the highlight of the}} night, and not because of anything visual. The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black, with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights. It's a reminder that beneath it all, Cyrus has a voice — <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> big one, at that." ...|$|E
500|$|Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine {{noted that}} the song has the album's [...] "toughest, weirdest beat, {{not to mention a}} show-stopping Chance the Rapper verse <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> disarming message from the singer herself." [...] He was unsure if Madonna meant to [...] "embrace her iconic status or fight her way out from under its oppressive expectations" [...] during the track, but praised the discontent and {{uncommon}} message for making the album her [...] "most committed work since 2003's underrated 'American Life'." [...] Bradley Stern of MuuMuse was positive, saying that the result is [...] "a confidence-boosting compliment to a grueling gym workout." [...] He continued: [...] "The ominous beat drops are certainly more ‘on-trend’ than, say, 'Hold Tight,' but the song still feels (mostly) fresh and strange, as opposed to the late-to-the-party dubstep/EDM excursion on 'MDNA'. [...] It's a thrilling, weird and semi-embarrassing-yet-ultimately-empowering centerpiece of Rebel Heart that feels as bold as a song called 'Iconic' by Madonna should." [...] Joe Lynch of Billboard called the collaboration [...] "just about as odd as you'd expect," [...] but labeled it [...] "a fairly overwrought affair. Chance's verse is fire, but the intense, busy production ultimately adds up to very little." [...] Michelle Geslani of Consequence of Sound pointed out that [...] "as odd as the circumstances might be, the track surprisingly gels together far more smoothly than one would expect." [...] Ben Kelly of Attitude named it [...] "her own ‘bow down bitches’ moment." [...] while Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of Financial Times said that the song is [...] "wonderfully unhinged." ...|$|E

500|$|Wilhelm [...] "Deathshead" [...] Strasse, the game's main antagonist, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as an antagonist of Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001) and main antagonist of Wolfenstein (2009). For The New Order, the team achieved closure on his story; {{to do so in}} an effective way, they wanted to find an interesting angle to portray him: his personality is full of enthusiasm, and he appreciates life after his near-death experience in the previous game. When developing the Nazis, Matthies states that the team [...] "didn't want to cartoon-ify them", instead opting to treat them seriously. Gideon Emery, who portrayed Fergus Reid, auditioned {{for his role in the}} game. He described Fergus as [...] "a tough as nails soldier, who gives [...] both support <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> hard time in the process". Matthies felt that Fergus is a type of father figure to Blazkowicz, and that he [...] "only gives negative reinforcement". Conversely, he saw Wyatt as a [...] "sort of son surrogate", as Blazkowicz is tasked as being his protector and mentor, and that he gives [...] "positive reinforcement". Max Hass, a seemingly brain-damaged member of the Resistance, was inspired by the character of Garp from John Irving's novel The World According to Garp. Alex Solowitz portrayed Max in the game. [...] "Max was the most challenging character to cast, which seems counter-intuitive because he's a pretty simple guy on paper, but it took a tremendous actor to pull that off and a long time to find him," [...] Matthies said.|$|E

[...] Lenny Kaye, writing in Jazz & Pop magazine, praised the album, noting that [...] "One {{of the more interesting}} things about Preflyte is the consistency of The Byrds sound, especially when compared with their later post-Tambourine Man days." [...] In more recent years, Classic Rock reviewer Rob Hughes praised [...] "the purring harmonies, the extraordinary songcraft of frontman Gene Clark and the smooth exhalations of what became the California folk-rock sound", despite the fact that The Byrds had [...] "yet to become competent musicians". Andrew Lynch, writing for the entertainment.ie website, described the album as [...] "a fascinating slice of pop history <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good album in its own right too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clarke {{conducted}} at ten or more London theatres, including the Lyceum Theatre, where he composed music {{for a number}} of Henry Irving's productions, including Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice. Irving's co-star, Ellen Terry, wrote in her memoir, The Story of My Life, [...] "No one was cleverer than Hamilton Clarke, Henry's first musical director, and a most gifted composer, at carrying out [...] instructions. [...] Hamilton Clarke often grew angry and flung out of the theatre, saying that it was quite impossible to do what Mr. Irving wanted. 'Patch it together, indeed!' he used to say to me indignantly.... 'Mr. Irving knows nothing about music, or he couldn't ask me to do such a thing.' But the next day he would return with the score altered on the lines suggested by Henry, and would confess that the music was improved. 'Upon my soul, it's better! The 'Guv'nor' was perfectly right.'" [...] He was one of the many composers recruited to write German Reed Entertainments at St. George's Hall. These included Castle Botherem: or An Irish Stew (1880), Cherry Tree Farm (1881), [...] and Nobody's Fault (1882) to texts by Arthur Law, and Fairly Puzzled (text by Oliver Brand) in 1884 <b>and</b> <b>A</b> <b>Pretty</b> Bequest (text by T.

2500|$|As a child, Elizabeth was the {{particular}} favorite of her father. She resembled him {{both physically and}} temperamentally. She was a bright girl, if not brilliant, but received only a desultory formal education. Even though he adored his daughter, Peter did not devote time or attention to her education. He had a son (and grandson) {{from his first marriage}} to a noblewoman, and did not anticipate that a daughter born to his former maid and second wife might one day inherit the throne. Indeed, no woman had ever sat upon the throne of Russia yet. It was therefore left to Catherine to raise the girls as best she could, but she was herself too uneducated to be able to superintend the formal education of her daughters. Elizabeth had a French governess and grew fluent in Italian, German and French. She was also an excellent dancer and rider. Like her father, Elizabeth was physically active and loved riding, hunting, sledging, skating, and gardening. From her earliest years, she delighted everyone with her extraordinary beauty and vivacity, and was regarded as the leading beauty of the Russian Empire. The wife of the British minister (ambassador) described Elizabeth as [...] "fair, with light brown hair, large sprightly blue eyes, fine teeth <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> mouth. She is inclinable to be fat, but is very genteel and dances better than anyone I ever saw. She speaks German, French and Italian, is extremely gay and talks to everyone..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Victorian critic John Ruskin, {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, {{provided}} short analyses of various writers in his [...] "Nature and Literature" [...] essays collected in [...] "Art and Life: a Ruskin Anthology". In speaking of Wordsworth, Ruskin claimed, [...] "Wordsworth is simply a Westmoreland peasant, with considerably less shrewdness than most border Englishmen or Scotsmen inherit; and no sense of humor; but gifted... with vivid sense of natural beauty, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> turn for reflection, not always acute, but, as far as they reach, medicinal to the fever of the restless and corrupted life around him." [...] After mocking the self-reflective nature of Wordsworth's poetry, he then declared that the poetry was [...] "Tuneful nevertheless at heart, and of the heavenly choir, I gladly and frankly acknowledge him; and our English literature enriched with a new and singular virtue in the aerial purity and healthful rightness of his quiet song;—but aerial only—not ethereal; and lowly in its privacy of light". The ode, to Ruskin, becomes a means to deride Wordsworth's intellect and faith when he claims that Wordsworth was [...] "content with intimations of immortality such as may be in skipping of lambs, and laughter of children-incurious to see in the hands the print of the nails." [...] Ruskin's claims were responded to by an article by Richard Hutton in the 7 August 1880 Spectator. The article, [...] "Mr. Ruskin on Wordsworth", stated, [...] "We should hardly have expected Mr. Ruskin—a great master of irony though he be—to lay his finger so unerringly as he does on the weak point of Wordsworth's sublime ode on the 'Intimations of Immortality,' when he speaks of him—quite falsely, by the way—as 'content with intimations of immortality'". The article continued with praise of Wordsworth and condemns Ruskin further: [...] "But then, though he shows how little he understands the ode, in speaking of Wordsworth as content with such intimations, he undoubtedly does touch the weak chord in what, but for that weak chord, would be one of the greatest of all monuments of human genius... But any one to whom Wordsworth's great ode is the very core of that body of poetry which makes up the best part of his imaginative life, will be as much astonished to find Mr. Ruskin speaking of it so blindly and unmeaningly as he does".|$|E
