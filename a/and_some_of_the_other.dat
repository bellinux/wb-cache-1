5|$|Since then, thermal {{anomalies}} (hot spots) and {{gas emissions}} (including hydrogen sulfide) have occurred {{especially on the}} summit plateau and indicate that Adams is dormant, not extinct. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of andesite or basalt. Because the primary products were andesite, the eruptions that occur on Adams {{tend to have a}} low to moderate explosiveness and present less of a hazard than the violent eruptions of St. Helens <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Cascade volcanoes. However, since the interior of the main cone {{is little more than a}} pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, there is a potential for very large landslides and other debris flows.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Harold at the Battle of Hastings, Stigand worked with Earl Edwin and Earl Morcar, as well as Archbishop Ealdred of York, to put Edgar the Ætheling on the throne. This plan {{did not come to}} fruition, however, due to {{opposition}} from the northern earls <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> bishops. Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror at Wallingford in early December 1066, and perhaps assisted at his coronation on Christmas Day, 1066, although the coronation was performed by Ealdred. William took Stigand with him to Normandy in 1067, although whether this was because William did not trust the archbishop, as the medieval chronicler William of Poitiers alleges, is uncertain. Stigand was present at the coronation of William's queen, Matilda, in 1068, although once more the ceremony was actually performed by Ealdred.|$|E
5|$|Black Rock, Antelope Island, White Rock, Egg Island, Fremont Island, and the Promontory {{mountain}} range are each {{extensions of the}} Oquirrh Mountain Range, which dips beneath the lake at its southeastern shore. Stansbury, Carrington, and Hat Islands are extensions of the Stansbury {{mountain range}}, and Strongs Knob {{is an extension of}} the Lakeside Mountains which run along the lake's western shore. The lake is deepest in the area between these island chains, measured by Howard Stansbury in 1850 at about 35 feet (10.7 meters) deep, and an average depth of 13 feet (four meters). When the water levels are low, Antelope Island becomes connected to the shore as a peninsula, as do Goose Islands, Browns Island, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> islands. Stansbury Island and Strongs Knob remain peninsulas unless the water level rises well-above the average.|$|E

The pirates rob everyone on board and tie them up in a net which they then toss overboard. But to the luck of Homer <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> guests {{who happen to be}} above ocean surface level, it floats and they avoid drowning. Eventually Homer and Bart make it back to the mansion where the family returns the house to Burns after Marge and Lisa have scrubbed all the rooms clean. Back at the Simpsons home, everyone is glad to live a normal life again—with the exception of Homer, who is upset that he does not live the lifestyle of rich people. The episode ends with Homer wailing about how rich all the persons in the closing credits are (except Richard K. Chung, whom he dismisses as poor) and threatening to report them to the Internal Revenue Service and telling the Gracie Films woman not to shush him.|$|E

It was in this film that Nimoy first publicly revealed that he had struggled with alcoholism while he was acting in the original television series.

5|$|After the débâcle at Ypres, the bishop's forces divided, some {{going back}} to England, some {{remaining}} with the bishop and others under Sir Thomas Trivet and Sir Hugh Calveley retiring to Bourbourg and Bergues. The bishop and Calveley had wished to advance into France, but Sir William Elmham, Trivet <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> commanders refused to go. The bishop, after entering Picardy for some distance, was obliged to fall back upon Gravelines. It {{turned out that the}} French had little stomach for a showdown with the English and their allies, preferring instead to negotiate: part of the French army was unwilling to fight when Despenser and Calveley encountered it when moving towards Picardy. It is possible that had King Richard crossed the Channel with a large English army, the campaign would have ended in a famous victory. However, for the demoralised and disease-ridden English forces, the arrival of the French headed by the boy-king Charles VI was decisive. Charles had taken the oriflamme on 2 August and his army was mustered in Arras on 15 August. They advanced into Flanders, reaching Thérouanne by the end of August, Drincham on 5 September, Bergues on 7 September (forcing Trivet's and Elmham's retreat to Bourbourg and Gravelines) and Dunkirk on 9 September. Bourbourg was besieged on 12 September: two days later the Duke of Brittany persuaded the French to negotiate a surrender and the English garrison was given safe conduct from the town. The French army then proceeded along the coast and besieged Gravelines. There, without Despenser's authority, the defenders accepted bribes and the bishop's treasurer pocketed 5000 francs. Despenser at first refused the surrender terms, but a few days later Gravelines was evacuated and Despenser ordered it to be sacked. By the end of October the remaining crusaders had returned across the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's {{first major}} speech in Congress {{was in favor}} of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle. His {{position}} was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to lift the ban. His views on flogging, for good or ill, were forgotten when he turned his energies to the second of President Fillmore's proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first compulsory retirement {{in the history of the}} U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled to go to sea, but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography. Maury <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> retirees enlisted other Senators to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory's views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War, when both men sided with the South.|$|E
