The ability to easily locate {{relevant}} information in a site will determine the effectiveness and utility of the site to potential users.

40|$|Phase {{transforming}} {{cellular materials}} (PXCMs) {{are a new}} class of materials that can go through large deformation and return to their original configuration. Currently, there are reliable cellular materials that can resist large deformation, for example, honey comb; however, when these materials are compared to PXCMs, they cannot stay in their elastic range. The biggest advantage about PXCMs is that they are not only inexpensive materials, but they are also highly-durable and they absorb and dissipate high amounts of energy. The main concept behind PXCMs is that they contain unit cells that have stable configurations. Each stable configuration of the unit cell corresponds to a phase. The transition between these phases are interpreted as phase-transformation of the cellular material. Our approach to this project is to create a simulation tool that will predict the mechanical behavior of a PXCM. The tool will have a GUI interface where users can input the information of the unit cell of the PXCMs that they want to model. When the tool is executed, the simulation will present a graph representative of the output. The output displays phases and stable configuration of the material in a force vs displacement graph of a M rows by N columns of PXCMs. The purpose of this interactive tool is to serve as a visual <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>users</b> who {{want to learn more about}} PXCMs and also create more complex and sophisticated PXCMs designs.

40|$|Abstract. Exploratory search over a {{collection}} often requires users to iteratively apply {{a variety of}} strategies, such as searching for more general or more specific concepts {{in reaction to the}} information they encounter. Rich semantic models, such as WordNet, are potentially valuable <b>aids</b> <b>for</b> <b>users</b> to make sense of this information. However, these large complex models often contain specialized vocabularies and a detailed level of granularity that makes them difficult to use as an <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> opportunistic search. In this paper, we describe how Semantic Fisheye Views (SFEV) can be designed to transparently integrate rich semantic models into the search process, allowing users to effectively explore a diverse range of related concepts without explicitly navigating over the underlying model. The SFEV combines semantic guided search with interactive visualization techniques, creating a search tool that we have found to be significantly more effective than keyword similarity alone for exploratory tasks. ...|$|R

40|$|We present four {{empirical}} {{measures of}} the immediate usability of Graffiti, a character recognizer for pen-based computers. Since speed is fully controlled by the user, we measured the accuracy attainable after minimal exposure. The first measure, 79 %, is the inherent accuracy, or {{the extent to which}} Graffiti strokes match letters in the Roman alphabet. The other three measures were obtained in a formal experiment. We asked 25 subjects to enter the alphabet five times into a pen-based computer under three conditions: (a) following one minute studying the Graffiti reference chart, (b) following five minutes practicing with Graffiti, and (c) following a one week lapse with no intervening practice. The accuracy was 86 %, 97 %, and 97 %, respectively. These are very respectable figures given the limited exposure of subjects.

It focuses on the virtual representation of minimally invasive procedures for training, planning, and diagnosis without an actual invasive intervention.

This report covers concepts used in current systems in research and products, and how they might be applied to daily practice in health-care.

40|$|Automatic text {{summarization}} is a {{very challenging}} task whose goal is to compress text to its most important parts, therefore providing an indispensable <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> the <b>user</b> in dealing with {{a large body of}} text documents. Statistical methods of summarization incorporate minimum semantics and hence are suboptimal on summarization tasks. We propose a new, flexible and modular summarization framework called Document Map in this paper and a first implementation of it called WN-SUM. WN-SUM is a hybrid between semantic and statistical methodology. WordNet is employed by WN-SUM for semantic information. For statistical information, sentence position and topic relation are used. As used, WordNet makes a small improvement to WN-SUM. Nonetheless, the history of the Document Understanding Conferences (DUC) shows that even small improvements in this area are hard to achieve and can be significant. If WordNet is included, WN-SUM provides a Ngram(1, 1) score of 0. 45329, while WN-SUM without WordNet yields a score of 0. 44312.

Several algorithms were developed for each of these control methods. This paper presents three of the most significant of those algorithms with emphasis on the shared control method.
