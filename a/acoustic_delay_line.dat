5000|$|Another upgrade helped reject unsynchronized pulses, supplanting the two-layer display. This device, the [...] "Anti-Jamming Black-Out" [...] unit, AJBO, fed the Y-axis signal into a {{delay and}} then into the {{brightness}} control of the CRT. Short pulses that appeared and disappeared were muted, disappearing from the display. Similar techniques using <b>acoustic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>lines,</b> both for jamming reduction and filtering out noise, became common on many radar units during the war.|$|R
50|$|The next {{significant}} {{advance in}} computer memory came with <b>acoustic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> memory, developed by J. Presper Eckert {{in the early}} 1940s. Through {{the construction of a}} glass tube filled with mercury and plugged at each end with a quartz crystal, delay lines could store bits of information in the form of sound waves propagating through mercury, with the quartz crystals acting as transducers to read and write bits. Delay line memory would be limited to a capacity of up to a few hundred thousand bits to remain efficient.|$|E
50|$|Early MTI systems {{generally}} used an <b>acoustic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> {{to store}} a single {{pulse of the}} received signal for exactly the time between broadcasts (the pulse repetition frequency). This stored signal was electrically inverted and then sent into the receiver {{at the same time}} as the next pulse was being received. The result was that the signal from any objects that did not move mixed with the inverted stored signal and became muted out. Only signals that changed, because they moved, remained on the display. Such systems were in use in late-World War II radars of UK design, and became widely used in the post-war era. These were subject to a wide variety of noise effects that made them useful only for strong signals, generally for aircraft or ship detection.|$|E
50|$|The Williams tube {{works by}} {{displaying}} {{a grid of}} dots on a cathode ray tube (CRT). Due to the way CRTs work, this creates a small charge of static electricity over each dot. The charge {{at the location of}} each of the dots is read by a thin metal sheet {{just in front of the}} display. Since the display faded over time, it was periodically refreshed. In comparison to the contemporary <b>acoustic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> memory, the Williams-Kilburn tube was much faster as the cycling took place at the speed of the electrons inside the vacuum tube, as opposed to the speed of sound within the delay line. However, the system was negatively impacted by any nearby electrical fields, and required constant alignment to keep operational. Williams-Kilburn tubes were used primarily on high-speed computer designs.|$|E

It occurs naturally as the mineral sillénite and can be produced synthetically, by heating a mixture of bismuth and silicon oxides. Centimeter-sized single crystals of Bi12SiO20 can be grown by the Czochralski process from the molten phase. They exhibit piezoelectric, electro-optic, elasto-optic and photoconductive properties, and therefore have potential applications in spatial light modulators, <b>acoustic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> and hologram recording equipment.|$|R
50|$|As {{the names}} imply, {{both of the}} NRL systems relied on the {{comparison}} of returned signals stored on magnetic drums. In an attempt to remove clutter from radar displays, many late-war and post-war radar systems added an <b>acoustic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> that stored the received signal for exactly {{the amount of time}} needed for the next signal pulse to arrive. By adding the newly arrived signal to an inverted version of the signals stored in the delay line, the output signal included just the changes from one pulse to the next. This removed any static reflections, like nearby hills or other objects, leaving only the moving objects, such as aircraft. This basic concept would work for a long-range radar as well, but had the problem that a delay line has to be mechanically sized to the pulse repetition frequency of the radar, or PRF. For long-range use, the PRF was very long to start, and deliberately changed in order to make different ranges come into view. For this role, the delay line was not usable, and the magnetic drum, recently introduced, provided a convenient and easily controlled variable-delay system.|$|E

40|$|Linearly {{polarized}} ultrasonic {{shear waves}} constitute a privileged tool for {{investigation in the}} field of mechanical behavior of materials and metallic structures {{as well as for the}} determination of acoustical properties of porous materials. These waves are often generated by a piezoelectric plate vibrating in a direction perpendicular to its thickness. However, this way of production presents some difficulties to obtain a perfectly linear polarization. To palliate to this inconvenience, shear waves can be generated by the mode-conversion of a longitudinal wave. This paper deals with the principle and some applications of two types of mode conversion transducers which permit transmitting and receiving shear waves obtained by reflection mode-conversion. These transducers are made up with straight ultrasonic probes coupled, by contact, to <b>acoustic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> (or relays) of different geometry. The first type of transducer uses an <b>acoustic</b> relay or <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> of big length.

A strategy for generating high resolution time delays while allowing for long interrogation durations (up to 5 µs) is implemented by combining an FPGA-based delay generator with commercially available programmable digital <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> The measurement sequence of generating interleaved combs is due to the long <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> reconfiguration duration (SPI communication) with respect to the coarse comb (FPGA based counter).

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that single-piezoelectric substrate based acoustic transducers act as ideal sensors for probing with various RADAR strategies.

Keywords gas sensor, conditioning circuit, {{surface acoustic wave}} 1. SAW TRANSDUCER AS A GAS SENSOR Systems with surface acoustic wave (SAW) have been applied in the construction of gas detectors for a long time [1 - 4]. The SAW gas sensors are composed of at least one <b>acoustic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> with a sensitive thin film layer on a top of the piezoelectric substrate and a pair of interdigital transducers (IDT) for excitation and detection of Rayleigh wave (see Fig. 1). In this paper results of investigations of two types of primary electronic circuits are presented and discussed. The first one is the oscillator with frequency output signal and the second is the phase-shift output circuit. 2. FREQUENCY OUTPUT CONDITIONING CIRCIUT As a conditioning circuit for SAW sensors the electronic oscillators are often applied – the delay line with SAW transducer is placed in the feedback loop of an amplifier. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> ensures the phase condition for oscillation, whilst the amplifier ensures the amplitude condition. The main disadvantages of this simple configuration are high output frequency range (30 – 150 MHz) and a weak thermal stability.

To demonstrate its real-time photoacoustic imaging capability, the silicon PADL array was interfaced with one single-element ultrasonic transducer followed by one channel of data acquisition electronics to receive 16 channels of photoacoustic signals simultaneously. A PAT image of an optically-absorbing target embedded in an optically-scattering phantom was reconstructed, which matched well with the actual size of the imaged target.

The 16 optical-fiber PADLs, each with a different time delay, were arranged to form one input port and two output ports. A handheld PADL probe was constructed using two single-element transducers and two data acquisition channels (equal to a channel reduction ratio of 8 : 1). Photoacoustic (PA) images of a black-ink target embedded in an optically scattering phantom were successfully acquired. After traveling through the PADLs, the eight channels of differently time-delayed PA signals reached each single-element ultrasonic transducer in a designated nonoverlapping time series, allowing clear signal separation for PA image reconstruction.
