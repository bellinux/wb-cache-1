While he is widely considered to be the first promoter of <b>acid</b> <b>paper</b> issues, his earliest published work on this topic goes somewhat unheeded until the 1950s when he began to receive grants from the Council on Library Resources (CLR) and the American Library Association (ALA), among others. The delay in addressing these issues could be largely due to the onset of the Depression, and the following paper-hungry war which pushed the <b>acid</b> <b>paper</b> problem to the back of scientists' minds.|$|E

The 78-rpm records were issued in both 10- and 12-inch diameter sizes and were usually sold separately, in brown paper or cardboard sleeves that were sometimes plain and sometimes printed {{to show the}} producer or the retailer's name. These were invariably made out of <b>acid</b> <b>paper,</b> limiting conservability. Generally the sleeves had a circular cutout allowing the record label to be seen. Records could be laid on a shelf horizontally or stood upright on an edge, but because of their fragility, many broke in storage.|$|E
50|$|Preservation {{of meaning}} {{is perhaps most}} {{relevant}} and recognized in museum collections, {{but this does not}} mean there are not key books and documents that are defined by their social construction as well as their physical existence. When a book printed on <b>acid</b> <b>paper</b> turns to dust, {{there is no doubt that}} it ceases to exist as book. However, when books are stacked on top of a Koran, or a Guru Granth Sahib is repaired rather than ceremoniously cremated, the spiritual integrity of these texts is compromised or destroyed, and the physical object is void of spiritual or cultural meaning. It may at this point actually cease to be what it had been previously identified as, at least in terms of its cultural or spiritual meaning.|$|E

50|$|After auditioning {{at least}} a dozen {{potential}} bass players, they finally found Joe Raposo through an advertisement. An audition was set up for Raposo by a friend. Raposo became the bass player for RKL in time for touring support of RocK 'n Roll Nightmare. In 1988, RKL toured Europe in support of the new album where it was particularly well received. A live album was recorded in West Berlin at Quartier Latin (now Wintergarten Varieté) on July 9, 1988. It was entitled Greatest Hits Double Live and released on Destiny Records. It was the first RKL album on CD in addition to the common vinyl and cassette formats. The artwork of the album is a collection of blotter <b>acid</b> <b>paper</b> of varying size, image, and age contributed by Mark McCloud, famous for his extensive collection which he calls the Institute of Illegal Images. Due to Raposo's status as a minor (he was only seventeen), his parents, though less than enthusiastic, gave permission for him to leave the country. Ward was named temporary guardian for the European tour. The signed guardianship papers are included in the Greatest Hits Double Live artwork.|$|E
5000|$|... 1933: William Barrow {{introduces}} {{the field of}} conservation to paper deacidification when he publishes a paper on the <b>acid</b> <b>paper</b> problem. In later studies, Barrow tested paper from American books made between 1900 and 1949 and learned that after forty years the books had lost on average 96 percent of their original strength; after less than ten years, they had already lost 64 percent. Barrow determined that this rapid deterioration was not {{the direct result of}} using wood-pulp fibers, since rag papers of this period were also aging rapidly, but rather due to the residual sulfuric acid produced in both rag and wood pulp papers. Manufacturing methods used after 1870 employed sulfuric acid for sizing and bleaching the paper. Earlier papermaking methods left the final product only mildly alkaline or even neutral. Such paper has maintained its strength for 300 to 800 years, despite sulfur dioxide and other air pollutants. [...] Barrow's 1933 article on the fragile state of wood pulp paper predicted the life expectancy, or [...] "LE," [...] of this paper was approximately 40-50 years. At that point the paper would begin to show signs of natural decay, and he concluded that research for a new media on which to write and print was needed.|$|E

40|$|Metamorphosis: a {{word that}} means change {{but it also means}} keeping {{something}} from the original. Maybe even keeping the essence of that original. You can find metamorphosis in the classics, in literature, in art and, of course, in life itself: the changing of a caterpillar into a butterfly. In the Dutch language the word is spelled „Metamorfose”. The most famous late-nineteenth century author of the Netherlands, Louis Couperus, used an onorthodox way of spelling. His semi-autobiographical novel „Metamorfoze” with a „Z” which deals with the changes in an artist’s life was published in 1897. br> Exactly one hundred years later the Dutch National Preservation Programme was launched. And we decided to name it after this novel. The programme is all about change: from <b>acid</b> <b>paper</b> to microfilm or digital image, but it is also about keeping things from the past, preserving them. So the title of this nineteenth century novel seemed appropriate. And the Z could serve as an eyecatcher.

40|$|That lipids {{constitute}} {{an integral part}} of both sound and decayed dentin has been known for a number of years. Leopold, Hess, and Carter ' have previously reviewed the literature and further determined that root dentin from third molars contains up to 0. 024 per cent cholesterol. In a more recent study, Hess, Lee, and Peckham 2 have reported 0. 36 per cent total lipids in dentin, of which 0. 014 per cent was phospholipids; however, the nature of the phospholipids and those lipids in excess of cholesterol had not been investigated. Other studies 3 ' 4 concerning carious lesions have demonstrated the presence of lipid materials in the decalcified areas; the non-specific histochemical procedures, unfortunately, did not give insight into the different lipids present. Thus the nature of the lipid material present in both sound and carious dentin bears further investigation. Marinetti and his associates 5 - 10 have recently introduced silicic <b>acid</b> <b>paper</b> chroma-tography for the separation of different phospholipids and non-phospholipids.

40|$|The {{esterification}} of {{some natural}} antioxidants such as cinnamic acid derivatives and ascorbic acid in nonaqueous media, catalyzed by immobilized lipases from Candida antarctica and Rhizomucor miehei was investigated. The alcohol chain length affected {{the rate of}} esterification of cinnamic acids by both lipases. Higher reaction rates were observed when the esterification was carried out with medium- or long-chain alcohols, The rate also depended on aromatic acid structure. The reactivity of the carboxylic function of the cinnamic acids was affected by electron-donating substituents in the aromatic ring. Higher yields were observed for the esterification of p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (97 %) catalyzed by C. antarctica lipase and for the esterification of cinnamic acid (59 %) catalyzed by R. miehei lipase. Candida antarctica lipase was more suitable for-producing ascorbic acid fatty esters, catalyzing with a relatively high yield (up to 65 % within 24 h) the regioselective esterification of ascorbic acid with various fatty acids in 2 -methyl- 2 -propanol. The reaction rate and yield depended on the fatty acid chain length and on the molar ratio of reactants.

40|$|In any {{stage of}} social {{development}} the preservation and spreading {{of knowledge is}} an important desideratum. The present society still relies on the information written on paper and stored in archives, libraries and collections. The lack of funding, adequate spaces and personnel, various calamities, biological aggression and <b>acid</b> <b>paper</b> technol-ogy were the main damaging factors for {{a large number of}} archives. Humidity, temperature and pollutants also had a significant role to the degradation of the paper. Paper is a good food supply for some microorgan-isms and insects. Hygroscopic environment makes paper susceptible to biodegradation. The most important spe-cies involved in the degradation of paper are insects, fungi and bacteria. They are changing the chemical and physical structure of the paper by the alteration of cel-lulose links with products of metabolism. Some fungi as Aspergillus and Penicillium have a high tolerance to environmental conditions and they can proliferate with a low content of water (62 – 65 % RH), conditions encountered in libraries and archives. From the fungal damage can result acidification of the paper and a variety of spots with different shapes and colours [3]. Bacteria attack on paper occurs in conditions of humid environment (> 85 % RH). Insects are also involved in the damage of paper. Some are capable to alter the cellulose; others are feeding from glue, textile fibber, leather or other ma-terials from the books. The damages may vary from the Archives decontamination by gamma irradiation...|$|E
