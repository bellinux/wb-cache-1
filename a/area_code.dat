The cable has frequently been severed by miscreants, often in the Sitakunda area, since its installation on 21 May 2006. Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication (BNNRC) has brought internet services to the upazila by establishing Rural Knowledge Centres (RKC). BTTB and RanksTel run telephone services in the upazila.

In Game 2, Ovechkin and Crosby scored three goals each, though Dave Steckel's second period goal was the difference as Washington won 4–3.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, it was {{anticipated}} that the available phone numbers in <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 330 would be exhausted, and an overlay <b>area</b> <b>code</b> was introduced. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 234 was assigned to overlap existing <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 330. With the creation of <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 234, any new phone number in the geographical area formerly covered by <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 330 could be assigned a phone number in either the 234 or 330 area codes, with no change in local or long distance toll status. This made necessary the use of ten-digit dialing within the 330/234 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> region. After the introduction of <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 234, assignments of new telephone numbers in the area did not continue at an accelerated pace, and new phone numbers for <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 234 were not assigned until 2003.|$|E

25|$|Since the 408 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> {{was close}} to being exhausted, a new <b>area</b> <b>code</b> became {{necessary}} in the region.

25|$|The Lehigh Valley {{area was}} once served {{only by the}} 215 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> from 1947 (when the North American Numbering Plan of the Bell System went into effect) until 1994.

25|$|In 1997, <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 216 {{was further}} split {{as the need}} for {{additional}} phone numbers grew. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 216 was reduced in geographical area to cover the city of Cleveland and its inner ring suburbs. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 440 was introduced to cover the remainder of was what previously <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 216, including all of Lorain, Geauga, and Lake counties, and parts of Cuyahoga County.

25|$|When area codes were {{introduced}} in 1947 San Jose was assigned to <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 415 {{along with the rest}} of the San Francisco Bay Area and much of northern California. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 408 was created on January 1, 1959, and included most of Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Benito Counties. Until the late 1970s, there was permissive dialing between (408) and (415). At the time, the entire East Bay, peninsula, and on to Marin County was in <b>area</b> <b>code</b> (415). Phone numbers were not duplicated across (415) and (408), so subscribers could dial seven-digit San Francisco or Berkeley numbers without dialing an <b>area</b> <b>code</b> and the call would go through. Population growth, facsimile machines, and pagers caused demands for numbers to outrun the capacity of this permissive dialing plan. The additional demands for PCS and cellular phone numbers helped necessitate the (831)/(408) <b>area</b> <b>code</b> split, the (650)/(415) split, and the earlier (510)/(415) split.|$|E
