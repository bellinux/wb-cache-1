5000|$|The European Union is a {{supranational}} polity, and {{is neither}} a country nor a federation; but as the EU wields political power it complies with the principle of separation of powers. There are seven institutions of the European Union. In intergovernmental matters, most power is concentrated in the Council of the European Union—giving it {{the characteristics of a}} normal international organization. Here, all power at the EU level is in one branch. In the latter there are four main actors. The European Commission acts as an independent executive which is appointed by the Council in conjunction with the European Parliament; but the Commission also has a legislative role as the sole initiator of EU legislation. An early maxim was: [...] "The Commission proposes and the Council disposes"; and although the EU's lawmaking procedure is now much more complicated, this simple maxim still holds some truth. As well as both executive and legislative functions, the Commission arguably exercises a third, quasi-judicial, function under Articles 101 & 102 TFEU (competition law [...] ); although the ECJ remains the final arbiter. The European Parliament is one half of the legislative branch and is directly elected. The Council itself acts both as {{the second half of the}} legislative branch and also holds some executive functions (some of which are exercised by the related European Council in practice). The European Court of Justice acts as the independent judicial branch, interpreting EU law and treaties. The remaining institution, the European Court of Auditors, is an independent <b>audit</b> <b>authority</b> (due to the sensitive nature of fraud in the EU).|$|E

However, they have also believed that <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> have not provided enough knowledge {{to enable them to}} share auditing experiences and educational training. Organizations can begin using technology to help people forge new relationships across traditional boundaries in order to expand learning networks. Making use of peer coaching, mentoring circles, and learning partners can provide favorable opportunities for individuals to build their own developmental networks. To enhance knowledge sharing between preparers and reviewers in the work-paper review process, training should be tailored to the specific needs of different ranks of auditors. <b>Audit</b> <b>authorities</b> should encourage knowledge sharing, strategic job rotation, and cross-training among different generations to integrate baby boomers’ experience with the creativity of Millennials. Such practice can result in groundbreaking innovations.|$|R
30|$|We {{have found}} that most {{respondents}} have believed that there are numerous opportunities for personal growth in their organizations and that their jobs have provided opportunities for future development. This is because auditors are routinely assigned tasks that vary in complexity and industry. Job enrichment provides {{a sense of control}} over one’s work environment and motivates people to exercise their full potential, thus presenting more opportunities for employee success. However, they have also believed that <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> have not provided enough knowledge to enable them to share auditing experiences and educational training. Auditors must share knowledge and expertise on industry-specific trends with members of the audit team as well as their accounting, auditing, and regulatory concerns that may influence the performance and outcome of an audit. In addition, <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> must create, integrate, share, and use knowledge regarding their clients’ control activities and corporate governance. Implementing these knowledge-based activities effectively is increasingly critical for <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> for maintaining their competitive advantage, including gaining tangible benefits regarding time and cost reductions. Thus, sharing knowledge can aid <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> in leveraging the skills, knowledge, and optimal practices of their professional staff members. More training and recruitment of talented employees would enhance audit processes which in turn would have a favorable impact on audit outcomes.|$|R

30|$|An auditor’s effort level {{needs to}} be {{tailored}} to each client within {{the structure of the}} basic audit methodology as applied by the audit team using their best judgement. Professional skepticism as well as auditor knowledge and expertise increase the quality of auditor judgements. Thus, the quality of the audit is based on auditor’s professional judgement. Auditors’ perceived goals of the audit and perceptions of how the <b>audit</b> <b>authority</b> values them influences auditors’ judgments. The resources needed for an audit depend on the personnel available for an engagement, the abilities and expertise of the audit team, and the audit technology and methodology being used. Consequently, assigning personnel with the appropriate levels of technical training and proficiency to audit engagements is required. Auditors can advance their personal development through continuous learning to increase their knowledge, open-mindedness, sensitivity to fraud detection, to set career goals, and to promote peer learning.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a macroeconomic manifesto for prosperity. The main macroeconomic obstacles to prosperity are rent-seeking and policy variability and uncertainty. The main proposals for overcoming these obstacles are {{the creation of}} three new independent and publicly accountable economic policy institutions: an Independent Monetary Authority, a National Externalities Board, and an Economic Policy <b>Audit</b> <b>Authority.</b> Working with parliament, these institutions would provide an incentive {{system of checks and}} balances in which the principles of free trade, price stability, and policy stability would moderate rent-seeking and provide an environment in which markets could function to deliver a high level of prosperity.

30|$|To improve {{communication}} among <b>audited</b> units, <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> {{should understand that}} reprimanding people or challenging policies is not {{the main purpose of}} a performance audit. Auditors should focus on the outcomes of a policy to obtain insightful results and recommendations for governing without interfering with the executive branches. Therefore, <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> can positively affect society by increasing the economic value of audited units. Because the main aim of a performance audit is to improve government performance, <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> should strive to develop collaborative partnerships with the executive and legislative branches in enhancing governance. Audit leaders should recognize that developing cooperative goals among team members is essential for reinforcing these values and ensuring the credibility. Our study has showed that the evaluation, performance, and value of outputs and outcomes have evidently relied on auditors’ self-efficacy. Auditors should maintain a strong and professional relationship with audited units, enabling them to appropriately communicate audit results, thereby effectively improving governing performance. According to the mission statement of the American Accounting Association, the auditing profession should “foster excellence in the teaching, research, and practice of auditing and assurance services.” Accordingly, the core competencies of auditors are as follows: (a) communication ability and leadership for inspiring people to achieve common goals; (b) the ability to conduct comprehensive financial analyses, provide insight, and offer constructive recommendations; and (c) an awareness of new technological trends and the ability to apply advanced technology to increase client and employee value. <b>Audit</b> <b>authorities</b> should operate on the basis of public governance perspectives and focus on regulatory and performance auditing to ensure that the executive branches utilizes the allocated funds legally, enabling it to economically and efficiently achieve the set goals.|$|R
30|$|We {{have found}} that {{auditors}} generally have {{a positive attitude toward}} their professional abilities and experience, confirming the view that experience can increase self-efficacy. Self-efficacy obviously depends on past successful experiences, also known as mastery experiences (Bandura 1986). More importantly, achievements foster self-efficacy only when individuals ascribe these successes to their own personal effort or ability (Tolli and Schmidt 2008). In the “intrinsic motivation” section of the survey, “My work provides opportunities to learn new knowledge” (3.94) has exhibited the most agreement. The results have revealed that most of the respondents have believed that numerous opportunities are available for personal growth within their organizations, probably because of the diverse jobs available in auditing. This is because auditors are routinely assigned tasks that vary in complexity and industry. Job enrichment provides a sense of control over one’s work environment and motivates people to exercise their full potential, thus presenting more opportunities for employee success. However, in the “organization culture” section, “My organization has adequate knowledge resources” (3.31) has lower score. The respondents have perceived that <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> have not provided adequate knowledge resources. <b>Audit</b> <b>authorities</b> must create, integrate, share, and use knowledge regarding their clients’ control activities and corporate governance. Implementing these knowledge-based activities effectively is increasingly critical for <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> in maintaining their competitive advantages, including gaining tangible benefits regarding time and cost reductions. Thus, sharing knowledge can aid <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> in leveraging the skills, knowledge, and optimal practices of their professional staff members. Auditors must share knowledge and expertise in industry-specific trends with members of the audit team as well as their accounting, auditing, and regulatory concerns that may influence the performance and outcome of an audit.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} has three objectives. The {{first is to}} investigate the extent of publishing delay and its determinants in Libya. The second {{is to find out}} how useful the annual report is to five user groups in Libya namely the Tax Authority, Academics, Auditors, Banks and the <b>Auditing</b> <b>Authority.</b> Finally, the research also seeks to determine the impact publishing delay has on banks, Tax and <b>Auditing</b> <b>Authorities.</b> A sample of 33 companies over two year period was used {{to determine the extent of}} publishing delay and its determinants. The results indicate that the average publishing delay is 154. 86 days. The results of the ordinary least square regression analysis indicate that company size, profitability, company age, number of accountants, accountant qualification, and audit opinion are significantly associated with publishing delay. However, the type of accounting system is not associated with publishing delay. The results of the usefulness of the annual report indicate that the balance sheet is regarded as the most important followed by the profit and loss account, auditors' report, management report and the funds flow statement. The results also suggest that there are significant differences in the perceived usefulness of 'on-time' and 'late' annual reports in terms of predictive value, confirmatory value and faithful representation. The results of the impact of the publishing delay on banks, Tax <b>authority</b> and <b>Auditing</b> <b>authorities</b> are as follows. Loans advanced by banks on the basis of 'on-time' annual reports are more likely to be repaid than those made on the basis of 'late' annual reports. The Tax Authority collect less revenue from companies whose annual reports are produced late compared to those whose annual reports are produced on time and <b>Auditing</b> <b>Authority</b> is more likely to issue a qualified audit report if the annual report is produced late compared to one produced 'on-time'. The results have important implication for the Libyan Authorities in terms of what actions they should take to reduce the publishing delay. Reduction in publishing delay is likely to increase the usefulness of the annual report and reduce the impact the delay is having on banks, Tax and <b>Auditing</b> <b>Authority.</b> ...|$|R
