40|$|In this thesis, I have {{examined}} how Norwegian prices on various consumption {{goods and services}} differ from the prices in other wealthy countries in Europe. The goal has been {{to find out how}} expensive it actually is to live an average life for an average citizen in Norway. The data used is based on European purchasing power parities study published by Eurostat. A key variable is the Price Level Index, which is an index {{for the price of a}} certain good or category of goods measured in a common unit, which makes it possible to compare price levels across countries. Another key variable is the Purchasing Power Standards, which are based on price level indices by converting these into an <b>artificial</b> common <b>currency.</b> Purchasing Power Standards (PPS) can thus be used when comparing quantities, like GDP per capita or consumption per capita, across countries. The empirical results are based on twelve main consumption categories. These categories include both goods and services paid by the households as well as goods and services that are covered by the government. The results confirm that within most of the consumption categories, Norway does have one of the highest price levels among all the economies surveyed. These high price levels are a result of a high income level - high gross domestic product per capita and on high wages. Prices on alcohol and tobacco are exceptionally high in Norway, when compared to other economies. But on these goods, high prices are due to a political decision-making rather than being a result of economic development. However, prices in Norway are not high for all the goods and services within the twelve categories. Both housing and other communal services as well as the communication sector are relatively inexpensive in Norway compared to the other European countries. Presumably, the reasons for that include governmental subsidies and different taxation policies. In addition, one must not forget the fact that consumers in different countries have different tastes and preferences, making the universal comparison more complicated. As prices influence both the quantity produced and the patterns of consumption, the thesis also takes a look at to what extent prices actually influence households’ consumption expenditure based on income levels. In case of Norway, the evidence indicates that when prices are measured against households’ average gross wage, there does not seem to be any clear effect on consumption patterns. However, when prices are measured against households’ net average wages, there seems to be a slight effect on households’ consumption. Thus Norwegian income tax and social security contributions do have an impact on actual consumer demand. The results show that for an average citizen working in Norway, it is not an expensive country to live in. This is because wages fit the prices and many of the vital services like healthcare, housing and education are partly covered by the state...|$|R

Additionally several exchange rates existed depending on the purpose of the transaction and who was exchanging, for example złoty could be exchanged for, say, US dollars at one of several official exchange rates depending on what was to be bought with the hard currency and the entity that was buying. In reverse it worked when an individual or a business had western currency earnings and wanted (or needed) to convert them into złote. The exchange rate did not depend on the amount being converted. Visitors from countries outside of the Soviet Bloc were offered a particularly poor exchange rate. Concurrently, the private black-market exchange rate contrasted sharply with the official government exchange rate until the end of communist rule in 1989 when official rates were tied to market rates.|$|E

40|$|For WIFO, unlike private households, {{businesses}} and public corporations, the change-over to the euro {{requires more than}} a simple transformation of prices by the conversion factor and double cash management in both Austrian schillings and euros during the transition period. The essential issue for WIFO is to preserve the economic relevance of the data published. All economic data previously denominated in ATS will be converted into euros {{on the basis of the}} official conversion factor of 13. 7603 by 15 January 2002, at the latest. The resulting <b>artificial</b> <b>currency</b> unit applicable to data from before 1 January 1999 will be called euro-ATS. The other Member States of the euro zone will be using the same "euro-national currency" designation for their <b>artificial</b> <b>currency</b> units (e. g., euro-DEM, euro-ITL). All data from after 1 January 1999 expressed in monetary units are already euro-based. This procedure is being applied in accordance with the most important providers of economic data in Austria: the Austrian National Bank and Statistics Austria. The change-over concerns all WIFO media: the quarterly economic forecast, which will be expressed in euros already as of December, the WIFO economic data published on the website, data in current publications (above all the WIFO monthly reports and the Austrian Economic Quarterly), the WIFO studies, and the economic database of Austrian and international economic data administered by WIFO. All data expressed in monetary units and administered by WIFO (data classes: (K) GEN, FTA 3, KON, NMAU, REZB, etc.) will be changed over to the euro. As regards data class (K) GEN, users will still be able to obtain ATS-denominated data in the newly generated (K) GENS section, but such data will no longer be maintained in the future, i. e., data revisions will only be considered in the euro time series. Transformation on the basis of the constant conversion factor offers many advantages for domestic data users. Firstly, data already published in euros are not affected by the change-over. Secondly, all rates of change of both nominal and real data are identical with the rates of change of ATS time series. Thirdly, the deflators remain unchanged, and fourthly, there is no limit to back-calculations in euro-ATS. For international comparisons, however, data expressed in euro-ATS are subject to certain limitations, which might lead to distorted conclusions. Values expressed in euro-ATS should not, for example, be added to values in euro-ITL, as the constant conversion factor disregards the exchange-rate fluctuations between Italy and Austria. For nominal data, for example, the calculation of market shares in foreign trade should be made on the basis current exchange rates. International comparisons of purchasing power should be performed, if possible, in purchasing power parities. Finally, real data in an international comparison should be calculated on the basis of the exchange rate of the base year of the price deflator.

40|$|Abstract. We present Turing Trade, {{a web-based}} game {{that is a}} hybrid of a Turing test and a {{prediction}} market. In this game, there is a mystery conversation partner, the “target, ” {{who is trying to}} appear human, but may in reality be either a human or a bot. There are multiple judges (or “bettors”), who interrogate the target in order to assess whether it is a human or a bot. Throughout the interrogation, each bettor bets {{on the nature of the}} target by buying or selling human (or bot) securities, which pay out if the target is a human (bot). The resulting market price represents the bettors ’ aggregate belief that the target is a human. This game offers multiple advantages over standard variants of the Turing test. Most significantly, our game gathers much more fine-grained data, since we obtain not only the judges ’ final assessment of the target’s humanity, but rather the entire progression of their aggregate belief over time. This gives us the precise moments in conversations where the target’s response caused a significant shift in the aggregate belief, indicating that the response was decidedly human or unhuman. An additional benefit is that (we believe) the game is more enjoyable to participants than a standard Turing test. This is important because otherwise, we will fail to collect significant amounts of data. In this paper, we describe in detail how Turing Trade works, exhibit some example logs, and analyze how well Turing Trade functions as a prediction market by studying the calibration and sharpness of its forecasts (from real user data). Key words: prediction markets, Turing tests, games with a purpose, deployed webbased applications, using points as an <b>artificial</b> <b>currency...</b>|$|E
40|$|Motivation and {{preview of}} the results Abundant {{experimental}} evidence documents that in the ultimatum game unfair offers are frequently rejected. Recent neuroeconomic evidence (see e. g., Sanfey et al., 2003) indicates that negative emotions, like anger, {{play an important role}} in the decision to reject such offers. At the same time, it has long been recognized by practitioneers that anger may {{play an important role in}} determining the outcome of negotiations; leading participants to retaliate against the offender (see e. g., Adler et al., 1998). In particular, this literature has emphasized that cooling-off periods (where negotiations are temporarily halted) are one of the most commonly employed and successful methods of lessening angry moods. 1 This suggests that rejection rates in the ultimatum game might fall if a cooling-off period is imposed. And indeed, this is what we find in our experiment: there is a statistically significant drop in the rejection rate of unfair offers by 25 percent. Experimental design To investigate the possible effects of cooling-off periods in June-July 2006 we conducted an internet experiment with 650 participants, where an substantial amount of prize money was at stake. In the following, we will first describe the experiment and then carefully explain our design choices. After loging in on our website and providing some personal background information, subjects played a one-shot mini-ultimatum game between a proposer and a responder, where the proposer could make one out of two possible offers to distribute a cake of 10 “Lotto-Euros ” (our <b>artificial</b> <b>currency)</b> : she could either make the offer “ 5 : 5 ” (leaving both with the same amount of Lotto-Euros) or the offer “ 8 : 2 ” (leaving the proposer (responder) with 8 (2) Lotto-Euros).

In 1996, United Nation General Assembly came to terms that eradicating poverty is an ethical, political, social and economic imperative of humankind. International development, trade organizations, and financial, as well as practitioners and academics in this field confirmed to this statement (World Bank, 2001) In a world of 7 billion people, 80 percent live on less than $ 10 per day and 3 billion people, {{about half of the}} world, live on less than $ 2. 50 a day. About 5 percent of global income was generated by the poorest 40 percent of the world’s population, while the wealthiest 20 percent of the population generates 75 percent of world income (Shah, 2013). The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF, 2011) estimates that poverty is the cause of daily mortality for 22, 000 children ages five and younger in 2009. Thus, in a calendar year, more than eight million children do not progress past the age of five years. Poverty literally has two central meanings.
