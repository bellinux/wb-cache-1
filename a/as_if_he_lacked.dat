60|$|The {{sound of}} the word, or the current of his own thoughts, {{suggested}} to Grip his old phrase 'Never say die!' But he stopped short {{in the middle of}} it, drew a dismal cork, and subsided into a faint croak, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> the heart to get through the shortest sentence.|$|E
50|$|Murong Ke did {{not rely}} on terrorizing his army with punishments, but relied on {{kindness}} and faithfulness. He calmed his soldiers and paid attention to important things, and did not micromanage. Everyone felt protected by order. In ordinary times, the military laws were relaxed, and it might appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> discipline and could be defeated easily. Instead, reality was that he paid great care to defense, and enemies could not get close. Therefore, he never lost a battle.|$|E
60|$|Don Benito, {{with his}} servant, now appeared; his coming, perhaps, hastened by hearing the noise. Of him Captain Delano sought {{permission}} to serve out the water, {{so that all}} might share alike, and none injure themselves by unfair excess. But sensible, and, on Don Benito's account, kind as this offer was, it was received with what seemed impatience; <b>as</b> <b>if</b> aware that <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> energy as a commander, Don Benito, with the true jealousy of weakness, resented as an affront any interference. So, at least, Captain Delano inferred.|$|R
5000|$|... "If one lacks five attributes, do {{not expect}} to gain {{anything}} good out of him for your life in this world or your life to come: if his lineage is known to be untrustworthy, if his nature lacks generosity, if his temper <b>lacks</b> balance, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>lacks</b> a noble conduct, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>lacks</b> fear of his Lord." ...|$|R
60|$|Schomberg made {{a gesture}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't know, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't care. Then he squared his {{shoulders}} and frowned at vacancy.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me, and his eyelids hung heavy {{over his eyes}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been drinking, or <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were tired.|$|R
6000|$|... "He doesn't look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{belonged to}} this crowd," [...] was Dick's comment. [...] "He looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{might be a}} {{thorough}} gentleman." ...|$|R
6000|$|After a short silence, he made {{a gesture}} with his hand, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> set her {{question}} by; <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> brushed it aside; and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Is he jealous?' asked a young man, looking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did {{not know}} what jealousy was and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had no time to be jealous.|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her; first <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{were trying to}} remember, then <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> might {{have been trying to}} forget. [...] "Nothing, I think--at that place." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “The Christian {{knows that}} his {{love is the}} active {{presence}} of God in the world; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>lacks</b> it, <b>he</b> takes away God's presence from {{the only place where}} he can put it. He has come between his neighbor and the saving love of Jesus Christ.” The Power and the Wisdom, page 232.|$|R
5000|$|A more {{tempered}} view {{is taken}} by W. H. Auden in The Dyer's Hand: Rhymes, meters, stanza forms, etc., are like servants. If the master is fair {{enough to win}} their affection and firm enough to command their respect, {{the result is an}} orderly happy household. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> is too tyrannical, they give notice; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>lacks</b> authority, they become slovenly, impertinent, drunk and dishonest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{tell me he}} is an impostor. I {{suppose he}} is, but doesn't it look to you <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> isn't? You are cool, you know, and outside; and so, maybe it can look to you <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> isn't one, when it can't to me. Doesn't it look to you <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> isn't? Couldn't you--can't it look to you that way--for--for my sake?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} the back of the seat, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were {{addressing}} himself to that; and softly played upon it with his hands, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were striking chords upon a dumb piano.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Grewgious {{said all}} this, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were reading it aloud; or, still more, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were repeating a lesson. So expressionless of any {{approach}} to spontaneity were {{his face and}} manner.|$|R
60|$|Louis took it, but <b>he</b> still sat <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted {{another to}} speak. It seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would not open it unless the proud Shirley deigned to show herself {{interested}} in the exhibition.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle Dick {{started and}} turned pale. Fust <b>'e</b> seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>'e</b> {{was going to}} speak, and then 'e thought better of it. He sat staring at 'Arry <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>'e</b> couldn't believe his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Asks me <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is going!' exclaimed Fledgeby. 'Asks me, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't {{know his}} own purpose! Asks me, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> hadn't got his hat on ready! Asks me, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his sharp old eye--why, it cuts like a knife--wasn't {{looking at his}} {{walking-stick}} by the door!' ...|$|R
2500|$|... "As Hillel the Elder had stated, whosoever destroys a soul, it is {{considered}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> destroyed an entire world. And whosoever that saves a life, it {{is considered}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> saved an entire world." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Ormersfield {{looked on}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> almost envied {{the relief of}} the outburst, but James's first {{movement}} was to turn on him, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were neglecting his son, sharply demanding, 'Who is with him?' ...|$|R
60|$|Bartholomew {{had assumed}} a {{confidential}} tone, much <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{were about to}} impart some important secret; but evidently concluded not to, since he stopped suddenly, and looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had already betrayed too much.|$|R
6000|$|Under this stone does Walter Harcourt lie, [...] Who valued nought that God or {{man could}} give; [...] <b>He</b> lived <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{never thought to}} die; [...] <b>He</b> died <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> dared not hope to live![962:1] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is impossible!" [...] {{answered}} Raoul--"call me blind if thou wilt;-- but I {{have never}} seen man so changed in a few weeks--and his attire is flung on him so wildly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wore a horse-cloth round him instead of a mantle--What can ail the youth?--he has made a dead pause at the door, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> saw something on the threshold that debarred his entrance--Saint Hubert, but <b>he</b> looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were elf-stricken!" ...|$|R
50|$|Blessed {{with good}} pace, {{once in the}} penalty area he could finish to the net equally well with either his head or his foot. His tall, blond figure {{bursting}} through defences was a thrilling sight and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>lacked</b> a little ball control he {{more than made up}} for it with his willingness to chase everything, making life difficult for his markers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, there is!" [...] cried Alric, [...] "for, {{when a man}} goes moping {{about the}} country <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were fey, or <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had dreamed of seeing his own {{guardian}} spirit, his friends cannot help being concerned about him." ...|$|R
60|$|Sixth, To {{follow that}} ancient precept, not {{construed}} to any point of perfidiousness, {{but only to}} caution and moderation, that we are to treat our friend <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> might one day be a foe, and our foe <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> should one day be friend.|$|R
60|$|Seth {{was delighted}} at {{receiving}} such permission, for by thus {{being allowed to}} work for Ninety-four's men it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> occupied a definite place among them; whereas {{if this had been}} denied it would have seemed almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been cast out.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let,' saith he, 'the miserable worldly man answer me; what remedy or safe refuge {{can there}} be unto him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>lack</b> God, who is the life and {{medicine}} of all men: and how can he be said to fly from death, when he himself is already dead in sin. If Christ be the way, verity, and life, how {{can there be}} any life then without Christ? ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Merdle looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{thought he}} would say something, but {{subsequently}} looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{thought he would}}n't. The interval afforded time for Bishop to be announced. Bishop came in with meekness, and yet with a strong and rapid step <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted to get his seven-league dress-shoes on, and go round {{the world to see}} that everybody was in a satisfactory state. Bishop had no idea that there was anything significant in the occasion. That was the most remarkable trait in his demeanour. He was crisp, fresh, cheerful, affable, bland; but so surprisingly innocent.|$|R
60|$|The trooper gasps <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{would admit}} it all <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could speak.|$|R
60|$|From {{that date}} onward Tom toiled at the goldfields <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had been a}} galley-slave, and scraped {{together}} every speck and nugget of gold he could find, and hoarded it up <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been a very miser, and, strange to say, Betty did not discourage him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{same idea}} {{struck me that}} {{occurred}} to Hampton,' Danvers said, 'but I suppose it was fancy. It sounded to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had already paid, to some extent, the debt he spoke of, or <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had no doubt whatever that he should {{do so in the}} future.' ...|$|R
60|$|The perfect ease of manner {{with which}} he put the money up again {{and looked at me}} with a smile on his refined face, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been {{mentioning}} a curious little fact about somebody else, almost made me feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> really {{had nothing to do with}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I’m trying to, Mr. Anne. But clean-shaved? I don’t seem to rightly {{get hold}} of that p’int. Sometimes it might appear to me like <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was; and {{sometimes}} like <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wasn’t. No, it wouldn’t surprise me now if you was to tell me he ’ad a bit o’ whisker.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|Prophets spoke <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had already}} come (Mosiah 3:13; 16:6).|$|R
60|$|Adair was {{breathing}} rather heavily, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been running.|$|R
