5|$|The team's founders enjoy playing {{co-operative}} multiplayer {{games and}} <b>are</b> <b>passionate</b> about them, as they allow players to play alongside each other instead of against each other. In addition, {{they found it}} more fun than the typical competitive multiplayer experience. However, they thought {{that this type of}} game was not well-developed, and often encouraged players to complete objectives alone. As a result, the company decided to develop a game which tasks players to deploy strategy and work with other players, leading to the development of both Left 4 Dead and Evolve.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{acknowledges}} {{having said}} intemperate things in years past, though {{he also says}} that many stories have been exaggerated. One psychoanalytic comparison suggests that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper, and cultural critic Julia Keller argues that voters want leaders who <b>are</b> <b>passionate,</b> engaged, fiery, and feisty. McCain has employed both profanity and shouting on occasion, although such incidents have become less frequent over the years. Lieberman has made this observation: [...] "It {{is not the kind of}} anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person." [...] Senator Thad Cochran, who has known McCain for decades and has battled him over earmarks, expressed concern about a McCain presidency: [...] "He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me." [...] Ultimately Cochran decided to support McCain for president, after it was clear he would win the nomination.|$|E
500|$|American {{football}} {{also plays}} a significant role in American culture. The Super Bowl is considered a de facto national holiday, and in parts of the country like Texas, the sport has been compared to a religion. Football is also linked to other holidays; New Year's Day is traditionally the date for several college football bowl games, including the Rose Bowl. However, if New Year's Day is on a Sunday, the bowl games are moved to another date to not conflict with the typical NFL Sunday schedule. Thanksgiving football is an American tradition, hosting many high school, college, and professional games. Steve Deace of USA Today wrote that Americans <b>are</b> <b>passionate</b> about football [...] "because it embodies everything we love about American exceptionalism. Merit is rewarded, not punished. Masculinity is celebrated, not feminized. People of various beliefs and backgrounds – a melting pot, if you will – must unify for a common goal for the team to be successful". Implicit rules such as playing through pain and sacrificing for the better of the team are promoted in football culture.|$|E

500|$|Another Side of Bob Dylan, {{recorded}} {{on a single}} evening in June 1964, had a lighter mood.

[...] "Spanish Harlem Incident" [...] and [...] "To Ramona" [...] <b>are</b> <b>passionate</b> love songs, while [...] "Black Crow Blues" [...] and [...] "I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)" [...] suggest {{the rock and roll}} soon to dominate Dylan's music. [...] "It Ain't Me Babe", on the surface a song about spurned love, {{has been described as a}} rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him. His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the impressionistic [...] "Chimes of Freedom", which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by Allen Ginsberg as [...] "chains of flashing images," [...] and [...] "My Back Pages", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction.|$|E
500|$|Starting from Avalanche Studios' inception, the company's {{primary focus}} {{is to create}} open world sandbox games, citing Elite as their inspiration. According to Blomberg, the studio has always been {{interested}} in creating open world games, and they aimed to be [...] "the best" [...] in developing them. The company seeks to remain flexible to market changes and tries not to limit themselves to one business model. Avalanche also focuses on developing games with long gameplay length and high replay value. Sundberg considers Avalanche Studios to be an independent company, and often keeps the rights to their intellectual properties. Sundberg also stated that video game developers should not put too much weight in income; as a result, the company seldom develops [...] "forced" [...] multiplayer modes, as they believe that approach [...] "makes absolutely no sense" [...] and does not add any value to the game. When seeking future projects, the studio chooses projects that they <b>are</b> <b>passionate</b> about and allow creative freedom. They only make games that [...] " [...] love to play" [...] or games that [...] "can bring a smile to people's faces".|$|E
500|$|Jenny was {{negatively}} received amongst TV critics and viewers {{from the very}} first episode after she cheated on her nice guy boyfriend, Tim, with another woman for no clear reason.

I love the character, and I love that people <b>are</b> <b>passionate</b> about her. I know {{there are a lot of}} people who just can't stand her. And that's why it's so important to have that character in the mix." [...] Kirshner defended Jenny stating: [...] "Jenny's a very controversial character. I think the great thing about her is the fact that she's so flawed." [...] During season two Jenny is seen coming out, getting her hair cut and becoming best friends with Shane McCutcheon (Katherine Moennig). AfterEllen.com stated that Jenny cutting off her hair was a defining moment in her development because it also symbolized her cutting all of the bad stuff that happened before out of her life.
