5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "symbol of courage, strength, and wisdom", Link was {{designed}} by Miyamoto as a coming of age motif for players to identify with: he begins the game an ordinary boy but strengthens to triumph over the ultimate evil. The name of the princess was inspired by Zelda Fitzgerald: [...] "Zelda {{was the name of}} the wife of the famous novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. She was a famous and beautiful woman from all accounts, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> sound of her name. So I took the liberty of using her name for the very first Zelda title," [...] Miyamoto explained.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Webb revealed that the video was a sequel of the music video [...] "Ocean Avenue"; [...] "The 'Holly' video expands {{on some of the}} elements of the 'Ocean Avenue' clip. There are references to it, particularly some scenes involving a suitcase. It refers to that world, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea of paralleling the band's experiences {{over the past two years}} with some of the things [...] Ryan [...] is going through in this video." [...] Webb went on to add that the reason Key is sprinting through Los Angeles, once again, is not bad guys that are after him, it is his [...] "own personal demons". Webb concluded that before filming began for the video, he had wanted to learn the experience that Key and bassist Peter Mosely were going through in New York, as they moved there to begin working on Lights and Sounds, and about the things they saw while they were there.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--not {{particularly}} pretty. But <b>I</b> <b>like</b> her body. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> fresh air. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> fresh air, {{the summer}} sea-air all through it--through her as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's easy enough, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idea, I'm aching for {{something}} to do, that is, some new amusement, you know," [...] added Jo quickly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{softness}} of your gown, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> fur against your throat <b>and</b> neck, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> those buckles on your shoes, {{and the way}} you do your hair." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{acting in}} the episode was praised by Michael Hogan and Rachel Ward, who wrote in The Daily Telegraph that [...] "with their gift for comedy, {{vulnerability}} and pathos, Tamsin Grieg and Sophie Thompson ... deliver excellent performances". Similarly, Owen wrote that [...] "the performances were good—especially from Thompson as the mousy housewife, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> sour expressions from child star Hutchinson". Nonetheless, he thought it regrettable than a real-world musician had not been cast, especially as he considered it unlikely that Tamsin would admire Parsons. Awarding the episode {{three and a half}} out of five, he thought [...] "the set-up ... sublime, the central dilemma amusing, and the execution typically brilliant". In the review published in The Star, [...] "Last Gasp" [...] was described as [...] "hilarious". The title, it was suggested, is appropriate, [...] "as I caught myself gasping more than once as its foul contents unfolded". Upton called the episode [...] "a clever little piece".|$|E
500|$|Zelda's name {{served as}} {{inspiration}} for Princess Zelda, the eponymous character of The Legend of Zelda series of video games. Series co-creator Shigeru Miyamoto explained, [...] " [...] {{was a famous}} and beautiful woman from all accounts, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> sound of her name. So I took the liberty of using her name {{for the very first}} Zelda title." [...] New York City's borough of Manhattan's Battery Park's resident wild turkey Zelda (d. 2014) was also named after her, because according to legend during one of Fitzgerald's nervous breakdowns, she went missing and was found in Battery Park, apparently having walked several miles downtown. Of Zelda's legacy in popular culture, biographer Cline wrote, [...] "Recently myth has likened Zelda to those other twentieth-century icons, Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana. With each she shares a defiance of convention, intense vulnerability, doomed beauty, unceasing struggle for a serious identity, short tragic life and quite impossible nature." [...] In 1989, the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald museum opened in Montgomery, Alabama. The museum is in a house they briefly rented in 1931 and 1932. It {{is one of the few}} places where some of Zelda's paintings are kept on display.|$|E
500|$|Nichols {{was cast}} as Shana [...] "Scarlett" [...] O'Hara in the live-action film {{adaptation}} of the G.I. Joe franchise [...] (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. [...] "I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then when I finally got to read it myself... I really, really liked it... I liked {{that there were two}} kick-ass female roles. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> fact that it wasn't just a big action movie... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised when I read the script." [...] She put on approximately [...] of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had [...] "an appealing manner and comely biceps" [...] as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her [...] "savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness." [...] After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played Anna Farrier. Going straight-to-video on October 27, 2009, the movie went largely unnoticed by critics and audiences alike.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, madam," [...] said Frank, [...] "some {{one must}} {{look after the}} fires, you know, else London would be in ashes in a few months; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> work." ...|$|R
50|$|In January 2017 he {{was named}} as Gillingham's captain, with the {{recently}} appointed head coach Adrian Pennock commenting that “I <b>like</b> his attitude <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> centre-half to be the captain".|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> <b>like</b> my nice Captain. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> waiters. They {{would take}} me to the Crystal Palace--only they're always busy. I wish it was bedtime; I don't {{know what to do with}} myself." ...|$|R
2500|$|The role of DS Ellie Miller was {{the second}} role cast. Producer Jane Featherstone first {{suggested}} Olivia Colman {{for the role of}} Ellie Miller, to which Chibnall (having also had her in mind) immediately agreed. Chibnall then specifically wrote the role of Ellie Miller for Colman, hoping she would agree to join the cast. Colman remained Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and there was consensus among the producers to offer the job to her without the need for an audition. Colman says she was immediately drawn to the role: [...] "From the off I really liked the idea of the story, a hard story and an upsetting one, but I liked the idea of a whole community being affected by something <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> character of Ellie. ... And I liked Ellie. I find it hard to play a character if I can't feel any of me in them. Especially {{if you are going to}} be playing that person through the whole series you need to feel that connection." [...] She was also highly impressed with the script she read, calling the script one she [...] "couldn't put down" [...] and that she turned the pages [...] "frantically" [...] because it was such a good read. Colman says she also had heard that David Tennant and actress Vicky McClure were under consideration for roles as well, and she wanted very much to work with them. She accepted the role immediately after reading the script.|$|E
2500|$|Unferth {{is portrayed}} by John Malkovich. Malkovich became {{involved}} in the project because one of his friends, who had worked with Zemeckis, [...] "spoke very highly of him. I had always found him a very interesting and innovative filmmaker. I liked the script very much <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> group involved and the process interested me a great deal also." [...] He found the experience of working with motion capture to be similar to his experiences working in the theater. He also found the process intriguing: [...] "Say you do a normal day of filmmaking. Sometimes that’s 1/8 of a page, sometimes it’s 3/8th of a page, normally let’s say it’s 2½ pages, maybe 3. Now it’s probably a little more {{than it used to be}} but not always. So you may be acting for a total of 20 minutes a day. In this, you act the entire day all the time except for the tiny amount of time it takes them to sort of coordinate the computer information, let’s say, and make sure that the computers are reading the data and that you’re transmitting the data. It interests me on that level because I’m a professional actor so I’d just as soon act as sit around." [...] Malkovich also recalled that he studied the original poem in high school, and that “I think we got smacked if we couldn’t recite a certain number of stanzas. It was in the Old English class and I think my rendition was exemplary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a {{pleasure}} to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> way he listened. I could have talked {{a long time to}} such a listener; he was so quiet, so intense; he drank it all in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lottie, [...] "pretty well. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to see <b>the</b> sailors {{climb up}} the masts <b>and</b> rigging; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> cabins, {{because there are so}} many sofas in them, and so many places to hide." ...|$|R
6000|$|He went on quietly. [...] "Sure! Me mind's made up. You want <b>the</b> garden <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> porch; so 'phone {{the agent}} after dinner, and we'll {{go up and}} see to it this very afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Salthaven is {{a pretty}} place altogether, I think," [...] {{continued}} Robert. [...] "I was quite glad {{to come back to}} it. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> town <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> people. Except for holidays I haven’t been in the place since I was ten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I liked England greatly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> English, but I {{could not}} like the theory of their civilization or the aristocratic {{structure}} of their society. It seemed to me iniquitous, for we believe that inequality and iniquity are {{the same in the}} last analysis." ...|$|E
60|$|This sounded all right. Goodness knows I am no snob, and can rough it when required, but I do like comfort when {{it comes}} my way, {{and it seemed to}} me that this was where I got it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> boy. He was the right sort.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} read any but this,' said Phyllis. 'Ada and I have often {{looked at the}} pictures, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> poor wounded stag coming {{down to the water}} so much, that I read about it, and then I went on. Was it wrong, Claude? no one ever told me not.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Away from filming Taggart, Duff enjoys live {{performance}} and {{has said that}} she prefers to work in theatre: [...] "I love working on Taggart. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> my character <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> all <b>the</b> people <b>I</b> work with. I have been in Taggart since 1990 so I can't imagine my life without it, but <b>I</b> really <b>like</b> working on stage. That is where I feel very comfortable <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> response of an audience good or bad." ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a college}} prospect, Stoglin {{garnered}} early interest from {{the staff of}} Maryland coach Gary Williams. Assistant coach Rob Ehsan first observed Stoglin {{during the summer of}} 2008 at the Nike Hoop Jamboree in St. Louis, Missouri. Maryland's recruitment progressed throughout the following year. Stoglin declined to wait for the University of Arizona to hire its next basketball coach, and committed to attend Maryland in April 2009. He said, [...] "I was weighing my options, {{and as a matter of}} fact, I was going to wait until the summer commit ... my family sat down at the dinner table <b>and</b> discussed it. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> D.C. area, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> climate. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> way Coach Williams coaches <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> program overall. Maryland has a great guard history <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just thought I'd pull the trigger." [...] Williams said he expected Stoglin to contribute immediately as a freshman.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{pleasant}} here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> sun," [...] she explained. [...] "Besides, it's still a {{good way}} to the top, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> generally feel discontented when I get there. There are other peaks much higher--one wants to go on." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{liked that}} speech; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> cool, decided {{way in which}} it was uttered. It denoted, in its spirit, a man who saw things as they are, and who was not afraid to say what he thought about them. My uncle Ro was surprised, and that agreeably, too, and he turned to Miller to pursue the discourse.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{first thing}} I {{observed}} {{was that a}} Scotchman and two boys came on board with violins and a flageolet, and began to play to amuse the company. At first I could not hear very well, the steampipe made such a noise. Afterwards, when the pipe stopped blowing off the steam, I could hear better, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> music very well.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--I did. I {{thought about}} it a good deal, my lady. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea of it very much." [...] Lizzie pricked up her ears. In spite of all his harshness, {{could it be that}} he should be the Corsair still? [...] "I am a rambling, uneasy, ill-to-do sort of man; but still I {{thought about it}}. You are pretty, you know,--uncommonly pretty." ...|$|E
5000|$|Band member Ian Kenny said [...] "the song is {{all about}} our own journey, where we’re going and where we can take things. It’s all about possibility, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idea of the romance {{that we can go}} anywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure <b>I</b> does--I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> capt'in--och, he's a jontleman-- <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> missus; she's a laddy--and <b>I</b> <b>likes</b> Miss Beuly, who's a swate young woman--and then there's Miss Maud, who's {{the delight}} of my eyes. Fegs, but isn't she a crathure to relish!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so?" [...] he answered. [...] "You see, I am {{so used to}} it I should miss it. No; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> pits here <b>and</b> there. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> rows of trucks, and the headstocks, and the steam in the daytime, and the lights at night. When I was a boy, I always thought a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night was a pit, with its steam, and its lights, and the burning bank,--and I thought the Lord was always at the pit-top." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We had no children," [...] {{said the}} man. [...] "My own folks were dead, but I {{contrived}} to see Derrick now and then. My {{wife had been}} very fond of him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> lad. Once or twice when I went up to London he insisted on making a fuss over me--took me to his chambers and his club, though I believe I was in several ways not exactly a credit to him." ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, the Art of Golf. A {{lot of it}} is very funny, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> fun very well; {{but what}} {{interested}} me most was the more serious part, because it turns all the while on a branch of psychology that no one has treated and that interests me much: the psychology of athletics. I had every reason to be interested in it, because I am abnormal: I have no memory in athletics. I have forgotten how to ride and how to skate; and I should not be the least surprised if I had forgotten how to swim.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{certainly}} {{looks like}} her," [...] the other agreed. [...] "Well, if so, {{there is one}} more debt to be paid off. The captain was a good old fellow, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> second mate very much. I hope both of them fell before the vessel was seized, for we may be sure that they would not have had an easy death if they were captured. It will be a tough fight, for I have no doubt that the boats are crammed with men. There is one thing which I do not expect they have--many guns, except in the two ships; but counting only fifty men a boat--and no doubt many of them carry a hundred--we shall be tremendously outnumbered if they get alongside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{love our}} liturgy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> ritual; {{but what we}} want is the {{voluntary}} principle. <b>I</b> do not <b>like</b> to put myself in a position which I can, in fact, hold whether I do the duties of it or no. Nor do I wish--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jine 'em, say I," [...] replied Joe. [...] "I'm fond of Meyer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Scotchman too, {{though he}} is rather fond of argification; besides, {{it strikes me that}} from what we have heard of diggers' ways, we shall be the better of being a strong party." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Won't {{you let me}} {{remain with}} you, uncle? <b>I</b> love you <b>and</b> Aunt Josey' (Madame Voss was named Josephine, and was {{generally}} called Aunt Josey) 'and the children.
