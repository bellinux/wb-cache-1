The {{components of the}} kit varied, but generally included parts to modify the spark advance of the distributor, limiting spark advance to 34–36° at no more than 3,000rpm (advancing the timing at high rpm for increased power), a thinner copper head gasket to raise compression to about 11.23:1, special intake manifold gaskets to block the heat riser to the carburetor (keeping it cooler), larger carburetor jets, and locking rocker nuts to hold the hydraulic valve lifters at their maximum point of adjustment, allowing the engine to rev higher without [...] "floating" [...] the valves. Properly installed, the kit could add between 30 and 50 horsepower (20–40kW), although it required high-octane superpremium gasoline of over 100 octane to avoid spark knock with the higher compression and <b>advanced</b> <b>timing.</b> Adhesive [...] "Royal Bobcats" [...] stickers were also included.|$|E

50|$|Spark timing, {{relative}} to piston position, {{is based on}} static (initial or base) <b>timing</b> without mechanical <b>advance.</b> The distributor's centrifugal <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> mechanism makes the spark occur sooner as engine speed increases. Many of these engines will also use a vacuum <b>advance</b> that <b>advances</b> <b>timing</b> during light loads and deceleration, independent of the centrifugal advance. This typically applies to automotive use, marine gasoline engines generally use a similar system but without vacuum advance.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{ignition}} systems use {{a mechanical}} spark distributor to distribute a high voltage current {{to the correct}} spark plug at the correct time. In order to set an initial <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> or <b>timing</b> retard for an engine, the engine is allowed to idle and the distributor is adjusted to achieve the best ignition timing for the engine at idle speed. This process is called 'setting the base advance'. There are two methods of increasing <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> past the base advance. The advances achieved by these methods {{are added to the}} base advance number in order to achieve a total <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> number.|$|R

50|$|Performance {{gains are}} {{realized}} {{by adjusting the}} ignition timing advance. Different timing may result in better performance.

50|$|The {{exclusive}} {{use of a}} rotating bezel is considered a rudimentary diving technique in the 21st century, suitable for basic, shallow single gas (air) diving only. Non-basic diving profiles and depths past 30 m require other more <b>advanced</b> <b>timing</b> and measuring methods to establish suitable decompression profiles to avoid decompression sickness.Besides for basic diving and as a backup for monitoring time during more complex preplanned diving, the one-way bezel {{can also be used}} for other situations in which a measurement of elapsed time of under one hour might be useful, like cooking.|$|E
50|$|Lighter weights or heavier springs {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> at lower engine RPM. Heavier weights or lighter springs {{can be used to}} <b>advance</b> the <b>timing</b> at lower engine RPM. Usually, {{at some point in the}} engine's RPM range, these weights contact their travel limits, and the amount of {{centrifugal}} ignition advance is then fixed above that rpm.|$|R
50|$|The second {{method used}} to advance (or retard) the {{ignition}} timing is called vacuum <b>timing</b> <b>advance.</b> This method {{is almost always}} used in addition to mechanical <b>timing</b> <b>advance.</b> It generally increases fuel economy and driveability, particularly at lean mixtures. It also increases engine life through more complete combustion, leaving less unburned fuel to wash away the cylinder wall lubrication (piston ring wear), and less lubricating oil dilution (bearings, camshaft life, etc.). Vacuum advance works by using a manifold vacuum source to <b>advance</b> the <b>timing</b> at low to mid engine load conditions by rotating the position sensor (contact points, hall effect or optical sensor, reluctor stator, etc.) mounting plate in the distributor {{with respect to the}} distributor shaft. Vacuum advance is diminished at wide open throttle (WOT), causing the <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> to return to the base advance in addition to the mechanical advance.|$|R

50|$|Using {{standardized}} wheels {{with precision}} ball bearings, modern gravity-powered racers start at a ramp {{on top of}} a hill, attaining speeds of up to 35 miles per hour. Rally races and qualifying races in cities around the world use <b>advanced</b> <b>timing</b> systems that measure the time difference between the competing cars to the thousandth of a second to determine the winner of a heat. Each heat of a race lasts less than 30 seconds. Most races are double elimination races where a racer that loses a heat can work their way through the Challenger's Bracket in an attempt to win the overall race. The annual World Championship race in Akron, however, is a single elimination race which uses overhead photography, triggered by a timing system, to determine the winner of each heat. Approximately 500 racers compete in two or three car heats to determine a World Champion in each divisions.|$|E
50|$|The {{contact breaker}} is {{operated}} by an engine-driven cam, {{and the position}} of the contact breaker is set so that it opens (and hence generates a spark) at exactly the correct moment needed to ignite the fuel {{at the top of the}} piston's compression stroke. The contact breaker is usually mounted on a plate that is able to rotate relative to the camshaft operating it. The plate is rotated by a centrifugal mechanism, thus advancing the ignition timing (making the spark occur earlier) at higher revolutions. This gives the fuel time to burn so that the resulting gases reach their maximum pressure at the same time as the piston reaches the top of the cylinder. The plate's position can also be moved a small distance using a small manifold vacuum-operated servomechanism, providing <b>advanced</b> <b>timing</b> when the engine is required to speed up on demand. This helps to prevent pre-ignition (or pinging).|$|E

50|$|The {{distributor}} also {{houses the}} centrifugal advance unit: {{a set of}} hinged weights attached to the distributor shaft, that cause the breaker points mounting plate to slightly rotate and <b>advance</b> the spark <b>timing</b> with higher engine revolutions per minute (rpm). In addition, the distributor has a vacuum advance unit that <b>advances</b> the <b>timing</b> even further {{as a function of}} the vacuum in the inlet manifold. Usually there is also a capacitor attached to the distributor. The capacitor is connected parallel to the breaker points, to suppress sparking to prevent excessive wear of the points.|$|R

Aims To quantify the impact of shifts in timing {{of breeding}} on changes in Willow Warbler productivity across the UK. Methods Using records of ∼ 7000 nests from the British Trust for Ornithology Nest Record Scheme, we quantify shifts in timing of breeding and seasonal variation in productivity and timing of breeding, and explore their relative contribution to changes in overall productivity. As population trajectories vary across Britain (south-east declining, north-west stable), analyses were conducted regionally. Results In both regions, nesting dates have advanced and early-season productivity is highest. However, while the proportion of early-season nests has increased, the seasonal decline in productivity in the north-west has lessened, and overall (season-long) productivity is stable. In the south-east, however, the seasonal decline in productivity has strengthened and, despite the <b>advance</b> in <b>timing</b> of breeding, overall productivity has declined. Conclusions <b>Advances</b> in <b>timing</b> of breeding have not led to increased Willow Warbler productivity in the UK, because the population-level impact of advances depends on seasonal patterns in both productivity {{and the distribution of}} nesting dates within a population...|$|R
50|$|For {{athletic}} facilities Curtis has a stadium, pool, auxiliary gym {{and large}} gym that reside {{in between the}} high school and original junior high site. The gym opened in 69' and had a north-south layout. Torn down in the spring of 2009, a new gym was built in its place. Opened in February 2010 this gym features a large glass lobby, entirely new locker room and weight lifting facilities and a gym with a capacity of 2,000 that runs east-west. The pool was renovated in 2011. Expansion in the form of <b>advanced</b> <b>timing</b> systems, more lanes and a newer facility will benefit the students of Curtis greatly. The third facility is the football field, Viking Stadium. Designed to seat several thousand, this stadium was opened in the mid-1980s.

30|$|This paper {{develops}} a joint timing synchronization and channel estimation algorithm suitable for downlink MIMO networks {{based on a}} time-domain training sequence arrangement in the short-range wireless transmission environment. Unlike the previous works [9 – 13, 17, 18], this paper not only introduces the use of sliding observation vector in timing synchronization phase but also applies the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion to perform fine time adjustment. In this paper, we first obtain a coarse timing offset using the cross-correlation function outputs based on the proposed training sequences at each receive antenna and then apply the generalized maximum-likelihood (ML) algorithm to find the <b>advanced</b> <b>timing,</b> relative timing indices, and the corresponding CIR estimates. The reason why we use the <b>advanced</b> <b>timing</b> instead of coarse timing offset to perform fine time adjustment {{is that we can}} have better timing synchronization performance at very low SNR. Finally, the designed metric based on the MMSE criterion is utilized to perform fine time adjustment. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

40|$|Gravitational wave {{detection}} using {{a network}} of detectors relies upon the precise time stamping of gravitational wave signals. The relative arrival times between detectors are crucial, e. g. in recovering the source direction, an essential step in using gravitational waves for multi-messenger astronomy. Due to the large size of gravitational wave detectors, timing at different parts of a given detector {{also needs to be}} highly synchronized.

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} joint timing {{synchronization}} and channel estimation scheme for communications systems with multiple transmit antennas {{based on a}} well-designed training sequence arrangement. In addition, a generalized maximum-likelihood (ML) channel estimation scheme is presented, and this one-shot scheme is applied to obtain all channel impulse responses (CIR) from different transmit antennas. The proposed approach consists of three stages at each receive antenna. First, coarse timing and frequency offset estimates are obtained. Then, an <b>advanced</b> <b>timing,</b> relative timing indices, and the corresponding CIR estimates at the second stage are obtained using the generalized ML estimation based on a sliding observation vector. Finally, the fine time adjustment based on the minimum mean squared error criterion is performed. From the simulation results, the proposed approach has excellent performance in timing synchronization under several channel models at signal-to-noise ratio smaller than 1 dB.|$|E
50|$|An {{increasing}} mechanical {{advancement of}} the timing takes place with increasing engine speed. This is possible by using the law of inertia. Weights and springs inside the distributor rotate and affect the <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> according to engine speed by altering the angular position of the timing sensor shaft {{with respect to the}} actual engine position. This type of <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> is also referred to as centrifugal <b>timing</b> <b>advance.</b> The amount of mechanical advance is dependent solely on the speed at which the distributor is rotating. In a 2-stroke engine, this is the same as engine RPM. In a 4-stroke engine, this is half the engine RPM. The relationship between advance in degrees and distributor RPM can be drawn as a simple 2-dimensional graph.|$|R
