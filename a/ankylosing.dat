5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, <b>ankylosing</b> spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear {{if they have a}} role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, <b>ankylosing</b> spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Several Smilodon fossils {{show signs}} of <b>ankylosing</b> spondylitis, {{hyperostosis}} and trauma; some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, {{which is where the}} largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having been bitten by other Smilodon, with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine. The frequency of trauma in S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries.|$|E

40|$|Pseudo-ankylosis of the temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) {{refers to}} a {{persistent}} restricted mandibular hypomobility resulting from a pathologic condition outside the TMJ. <b>Ankyloses</b> may be acquired or congenital. Most congenital <b>ankyloses</b> are extracapsular (pseudo- <b>ankyloses),</b> {{while most of the}} acquired <b>ankyloses</b> (true <b>ankyloses)</b> are intracapsular. An extremely rare form of extracapsular ankylosis is bony pterygomandibular fusion, few cases having been reported in the literature. To our knowledge, a case with two separate ipsilateral extracapsular ankylosis sites together with bilateral intracapsular ankylosis has never been reported. This paper considers the case of a 24 year-old patient who had been unable to open his mouth for six years. There was neither a history of trauma nor one of recurrent infection. The patient presented with a slight facial asymmetry with deviation of the mandible towards the right. CT scans confirmed the diagnosis of a complex pseudoankylosis, characterised by unilateral bony fusions between the lateral pterygoid plate and the medial aspect of the ramus, coronoid process and zygoma together with bilateral intracapsular <b>ankyloses.</b> The patient underwent surgery for ostectomy of the pterygomandibular fusion and a bilateral coronoidectomy.

40|$|Abstract Background Patients with Parkinson’s disease {{have higher}} risk of {{complications}} and revision surgery following spine surgery. Spinal fracture in an <b>ankylosed</b> spine is also difficult to treat. We recently treated a case of thoracic spine fracture in a patient with Parkinson’s disease complicating a severely <b>ankylosed</b> spine. There is no report describing surgical treatment of spine fracture in such a difficult condition, thus, we firstly report the case and discuss the reasons for a successful result. Case presentations A 68 -year-old man with Parkinson’s disease had a pathologic thoracic spine fracture at T 11. Four days after onset, he was referred to a local hospital because of gradually increasing back pain, but no spinal fracture was pointed out at that time. Because he developed lower extremity bilateral numbness and weakness, he was transported to our hospital, eight days after onset. When referred to our hospital, he exhibited severe back pain and paralysis of the lower extremities due to spinal cord involvement. Emergency surgery was performed. Decompression of T 10 - 11 was performed followed by instrumented spinal fusion from T 8 to L 2. A dramatic neurological improvement was observed following surgery, and complete bony fusion was achieved. At the final two-year postoperative follow-up, the patient had no pathological symptoms related to spinal fracture and no instrument failure was observed. Conclusion This patient had Parkinson’s disease and a severely <b>ankylosed</b> spine, both of which may lead to unsatisfactory surgical results from spinal surgery. Generally, patients with Parkinson’s disease have an increased risk for adjacent segment disease and instrument failure. In this patient, fusion surgery did not change the number of fused segments because operated segments were already <b>ankylosed.</b> Because no stress force exists between adjacent vertebral bodies, a severely <b>ankylosed</b> spine may help prevent screw pullout. Thus, treatment of a spinal fracture in an <b>ankylosed</b> spinal segment is a less adverse condition for patients with Parkinson’s disease. Our experience led us {{to think that a}} combination of Parkinson’s disease with severely <b>ankylosed</b> spine does not necessarily suggest unsatisfactory outcomes after surgical treatment of spinal fracture. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Fused or <b>Ankylosed</b> hip is late {{complication}} of chronic inflammatory disorder with progressive changes {{in and around}} articular as well as periarticular structures with alteration in bio-force line of body which later lead to severe flexion deformity of joint. This not only results decreased movements of hip, it’s also increase pain around the hip, back and contralateral hip. Methods: Retrospectively, all patients aged 18 years or older undergoing THA between June 2006 to June 2012 were reviewed with selection criteria. The five <b>ankylosed</b> hips (three left and two right) with severe flexion deformities which <b>ankylosed</b> spontaneously were successfully converted to THA at time period of 2006 to June 2012. Range of Motion (ROM), Harris Hip Score and Flexion Deformity Angle at preoperative, postoperative and follow-up periods were used as evaluation. Results: Mean follow up is 42 months. Mean HHS increased from 21. 6 ± 4. 97 to 81. 8 ± 4. 02 points with one excellent, two good and two fair cases. The FDA is corrected to mean 8 °± 10. 95 postoperatively and 4 °± 5. 47 at final follow up from 81. 6 °± 4. 39 with two hips of 10 ° residual deformity. Hip ROM is improved as flexion 70 ° to 100 °, adduction 10 ° to 20 °, abduction 10 ° to 30 °, internal rotation 5 ° to 10 ° and external rotation 2 ° to 50 ° from 0 ° activity. As complications, one hip had loose prosthesis, two had early postoperative dislocations, one had Deep Vein Thrombosis and one had femoral nerve palsy with quadriceps weakness. Conclusions: THA is an effective treatment for <b>ankylosed</b> hip with severe flexion deformity although complications are noted more than routine hip arthroplasties.

30|$|Recently, {{orthodontic}} mini-implants {{have been}} used successfully for space closure in mandibular molar protraction [2, 3, 6, 24]. However, they have the risk of soft tissue inflammation, damage of anatomical structures during implant placement, lack of stability, and implant fracture [25 – 27].
