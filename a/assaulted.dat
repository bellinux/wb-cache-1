40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Underage {{college women}} {{are at high}} risk for alcohol use and sexual <b>assault</b> and {{targeting}} both alcohol use and sexual <b>assault</b> is needed for this population. The current 3 studies examined the etiology and reduction of sexual <b>assault</b> and re-assault on college campuses among women. Study 1 was a prospective assessment of the use of sexual <b>assault</b> protective behavioral strategies (PBS) on subsequent sexual <b>assault</b> incidence and severity. The use of sexual <b>assault</b> PBS at Time 1 was associated with less sexual <b>assault</b> incidence and severity at Time 2. Study 2 furthered this by examining the relationship between sexual <b>assault</b> PBS, drinking PBS, sexual <b>assault,</b> and re-assault. Both sexual <b>assault</b> PBS and drinking PBS were associated with sexual <b>assault</b> and re-assault in college. Study 3 was a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of a combined intervention targeting both sexual <b>assault</b> risk and alcohol use in college women to reduce sexual <b>assault</b> and re-assault. The combined intervention decreased incapacitated rape, sexual <b>assault</b> incidence and severity, and frequency of heavy-episodic drinking for women with higher incidence and severity of sexual <b>assault</b> at baseline. Taken together, targeting both alcohol use and sexual <b>assault</b> risk in college women may be an effective way to decrease sexual <b>assault</b> and re-assault on college campuses...|$|R

40|$|A {{sample of}} 54 adult {{psychiatric}} outpatients, previously identified {{as victims of}} sexual or physical <b>assault,</b> were interviewed regarding their childhood and adult victimization experiences.

Eighty percent of the sample had experienced major physical <b>assault</b> as an adult and 59 % had experienced major physical <b>assault</b> as a child; 37 % and 31 %, respectively, reported major sexual <b>assault</b> as a child and as an adult. Women were more likely than men to report physical and sexual <b>assault</b> as an adult and sexual <b>assault</b> as a child. Childhood <b>assault</b> most often occurred before the onset of the patient's mental illness; whereas, adult sexual <b>assault</b> for women and physical and sexual <b>assault</b> for men was as likely to occur after the onset of the psychiatric disorder, suggesting an increased vulnerability to victimization for the adult mentally ill...|$|R
40|$|Sexual <b>assaults</b> {{are less}} likely to be {{reported}} to the police than physical <b>assaults,</b> while sexual <b>assaults</b> by a current partner are the least likely of all to be reported, even compared to other types of sexual <b>assaults.</b> Despite indications of a high prevalence rate of spousal sexual violence, there seems to be more reluctance on the part of victim/survivors to report or discuss spousal sexual violence compared to other types of sexual <b>assaults.</b> There is also reluctance to disclose sexual violence even when physical violence may be identified. This means that sexual <b>assault</b> may remain a hidden aspect of abuse in relationships, even where physical <b>assaults</b> are disclosed. The Australian Bureau of Statistics personal safety data also indicated that sexual <b>assaults</b> {{are less likely}} to be reported to the police than physical <b>assaults,</b> while sexual <b>assaults</b> by a current partner are the least likely of all to be reported, even compared to other types of sexual <b>assaults...</b>|$|R

5|$|Under the Tang law code {{compiled}} in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined {{for those}} who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders. Those who <b>assaulted</b> their parents could be put to death, those who <b>assaulted</b> an older brother could be put to forced labor, and those who <b>assaulted</b> an older cousin could be sentenced to caning. A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state. Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just secular Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of ancestor worship transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures. Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.|$|E
