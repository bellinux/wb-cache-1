5|$|During the menstrual {{period of}} the older queen, Ambika, Satyavati invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber. However, during sex with Vyasa, Ambika noticed his dark {{appearance}} <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> eyes. Vyasa declared to Satyavti that due to Ambika's cruelty, her son would be blind (but strong) and have a hundred sons – later known as Kauravas (descendants of Kuru). Satyavati considered such an heir to be an unworthy king, so she asked Vyasa to have niyoga with her other daughter-in-law. During their niyoga, Ambalika fell pale due to Vyasa's grim appearance. As the result the child would be wan, Vyasa told his mother, who begged for another child. In due course, the blind Dhritarashtra and the pale Pandu were born. Satyavati again invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber; she remembered Vyasa's grim appearance (and repulsive odour), and substituted a Shudra (lowest caste) maid in her place. The maid respected the sage and was not afraid of him, and Vyasa thus blessed her; her son {{would be the most}} intelligent man, and she would no longer be a slave. Vyasa told Satyavti of the deception, and then disappeared; Vidura, an incarnation of the god Dharma, was born to the maid.|$|E

25|$|A tale {{explains}} {{her name}} Yamuna: Sanjna {{was unable to}} bear her husband, the sun's heat and light <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> eyes in his presence. Surya felt insulted and said that their son will be known as Yama ("restraint"), due to the restraint she showed. Thereafter, Sanjna tried her best to keep her eyes open, however she flickered them angering Surya again who proclaimed that her daughter would be Yamuna. Since Sanjna had {{tried to keep the}} eyes open, Yamuna was blessed that she would worshipped as a goddess and remembered throughout time.|$|E

500|$|Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News {{gave the}} film {{one out of}} five stars. She criticized the lack of Bell's screentime saying, [...] "What the filmmakers of the last four Saw movies have somehow {{overlooked}} is that Tobin Bell's Jigsaw is the linchpin of these films. It's right there in the title, so you'd think they'd realize what they lost when they killed him off in Saw III. But it's been downhill ever since, and we hit bottom today". She admitted that the performances have become [...] "painfully stilted" [...] and called the script [...] "a jumble of nothing punctuated by barely-trying death traps". She went on to say, [...] "It's also disappointing to watch a once-original franchise morph into a generic slasher series, in which random people are killed in banal ways just to up the body count" [...] <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> review with, [...] "No matter how much money The Final Chapter makes over Halloween weekend, it's time to acknowledge that this game is over".|$|E

2500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film an A minus. She praised the {{performance}} of Wormald, commenting that he [...] "handily owns the role for a new audience" [...] <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> review saying, [...] "Guardians of the '80s flame will approve of the production's sincere respect for the original; church still matters, and so do Ariel's red cowboy boots." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a negative review of the film, rating it one and half stars out of four. He criticized the film for being {{so close to the}} 1984 original [...] "sometimes song for song and word-for-word". He thought poorly of Wormald's performance, saying, [...] "He's got the Kevin Bacon role but not the Kevin Bacon charisma." [...] Ebert closed his review expressing, [...] "This new Footloose is a film without wit, humor or purpose. It sets up the town elders as old farts who hate rock 'n' roll. Does it have a clue that the Rev. Moore and all the other city council members are young enough that they grew up on rock 'n' roll? The film's message is: A bad movie, if faithfully remade, will produce another bad movie." ...|$|E
