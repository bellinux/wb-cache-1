5|$|Blacklist {{graphics}} {{and lack of}} difficulty were criticized. McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing and frame rate issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even when {{the game is played}} in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought Blacklist gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> feature. Bloodworth was puzzled by the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.|$|E

There and then, he summons the Four Giants, who halt the moon's descent toward Termina by holding it up with their arms. Now seeing the Skull Kid as <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> puppet, Majora's Mask drops his grip on him and flies up to possess the moon instead. With Tatl at his side, Link follows the Majora's Mask inside the moon and defeats him once and for all, {{returning}} the moon to its proper place in the sky. The Four Giants return to their sleep. Tatl and Tael reunite with the newly liberated Skull Kid. The Happy Mask Salesman takes Majora's Mask, stating it has been purified of its evil power. Link rides away on Epona while the people of Termina celebrate the Carnival of Time and the dawn of a new day.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian {{may have}} become {{involved}} in battles against the Quadi and Marcomanni immediately after the Battle of the Margus. He eventually {{made his way to}} northern Italy and made an imperial government, but it is not known whether he visited the city of Rome at this time. There is a contemporary issue of coins suggestive of an imperial adventus (arrival) for the city, but some modern historians state that Diocletian avoided the city, and that he did so on principle, as the city and its Senate were no longer politically relevant to the affairs of the empire and needed to be taught as much. Diocletian dated his reign from his elevation by the army, not the date of his ratification by the Senate, following the practice established by Carus, who had declared the Senate's ratification <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> formality. However, Diocletian was to offer proof of his deference towards the Senate by retaining Aristobulus as ordinary consul and colleague for 285 (one of the few instances during the Late Empire in which an emperor admitted a privatus as his colleague) and by creating senior senators Vettius Aqulinus and Junius Maximus ordinary consuls for the following year – for Maximus, it was his second consulship.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{escalated}} when Baldwin deprived {{the monks}} {{of some of}} the revenues of their monastic estates. After that, Baldwin proposed to establish a church dedicated to Becket in Canterbury itself, staffed by secular rather than monastic clergy. The monks of the cathedral chapter saw this proposed foundation as the first step in an attempt to change the see of Canterbury from a monastic cathedral chapter, a peculiarity of the English Church, to the more normal pattern of secular clergy. It is not clear if Baldwin himself intended such a plan, but the other bishops supported the effort, as contemporary writers made clear. Baldwin sought the advice of Hugh, the Bishop of Lincoln, who advised Baldwin to abandon the plan as it would only cause distress to all parties. The controversy was long and involved and, at one point, the monks were imprisoned within their own buildings {{for a year and a}} half, from January 1188 to August 1189. This led to the suspension of the liturgy in the cathedral. Eventually all the prominent ecclesiastics and monastic houses of Europe were forced into choosing sides in the dispute. In October 1189, in an attempt to gain control, Baldwin appointed Roger Norreys as the chapter's prior, an appointment widely acknowledged by contemporaries as putting <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> individual into the office. His plan for financing the church involved soliciting contributions from donors by promising a one-third reduction in penances for annual donations.|$|E

As the German 28th Infantry Division moved along the line of fortifications on 19 May they were fired upon by Boussois. The Germans replied with fire from 8.8cm and 15cm guns, hitting blocks 1 and 3 at short range. Firing continued the next day and was extended to the other ouvrages of the sector, with aerial bombardment by Stukas. Late on the 21st an infantry attack on the ouvrage was repelled. By the next morning the ventilation system had failed ventilation had to be improvised using the drains and a portable fan. The turret was jammed, pointing in <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> direction.

25|$|The main {{owner of}} Kone ja Silta, {{commercial}} counsellor Robert Mattson died in 1935. His shares {{were sold in}} the same year to Wärtsilä, a company led by enegetic Wilhelm Wahlforss. Lavonius was fired, because he did not get along with Wahlforss, and Wahlforss wanted to restructure the organisation. He saw the Kone ja Silta corporation management as <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> intermediate level between the Wärtsilä management and the subdivisions. Kone ja Silta became fully amalgamated into Wärtsilä in July 1938 and it was confirmed in general meeting in August. Both companies, Kone ja Silta and Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering works were disestablished. Wärtsilä was now renamed Wärtsilä Group; its subdivisions were Wärtsilä ironworks, Kone ja Silta, Kotka Mekaniska Verkstad and Hietalahti shipyard. In addition, Wärtsilä owned then Kareliawood, Wärtsilä in Vaasa, Wärtsilä in Pietarsaari and 99.52% of Ab Crichton-Vulcan Oy.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of an alkali {{on a large}} scale became an important goal as well, and Nicolas Leblanc succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the {{production of}} sodium carbonate. The Leblanc process was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and hydrochloric acid. The sodium sulphate was heated with limestone (calcium carbonate) and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium sulphide. Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide. The process produced a large amount of pollution (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulphide was <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic soda ash proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants (barilla) or from kelp, which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash, and also to potash (potassium carbonate) produced from hardwood ashes.|$|E
25|$|One {{historian}} {{wrote that}} the battle cost the French 3,000 casualties and the Allies 4,000 casualties. A second authority stated that the French lost 3,400 killed and wounded plus three guns and 800 men captured. Allied losses were about 3,000. A third source agreed that the French suffered 4,200 casualties. The Bavarian corps alone lost 224 officers and 2,000 rank and file casualties. The French fought extremely well. On the first day, the divisions of Janssens and Boyer and two battalions of the Old Guard, perhaps 7,000 men, had fought Wrede's 22,000 soldiers to a standstill. On 25 March the Allies defeated Marmont and Mortier at the Battle of Fère-Champenoise. Napoleon won <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> victory at the Battle of Saint-Dizier the following day. The Battle of Paris was fought on 30 March and the Allies occupied the French capital the next day. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814.|$|E

25|$|When, on December 1, 1990, Habré {{and much}} of his {{government}} fled the capital before the advancing rebel forces of Idriss Déby, Alingué, as the highest ranking civilian authority left in N'Djamena, appealed for calm on the national radio and {{announced that he had}} assumed the lead of an interim government composed of fellow assemblymen and protected by the French troops stationed in the country. He also added that he had already started negotiations with General Déby and invited the government forces to depose their arms. Alingué refused on the occasion to assume the post of Head of State as he was entitled by the constitution in case of vacancy of the presidency, and instead was content to prepare for Déby's arrival. When later in his political career he was accused of having shown weakness and timidity in taking this course, he answered that if he had taken the office he would have plunged the country into <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> bloodbath.|$|E
25|$|The Sheridan Expressway was {{originally}} planned to extend northeast to the New England Thruway (I-95) in Eastchester {{just north of}} Co-op City, creating a shortcut toward New England and a direct route to New England from the Triborough Bridge. The extension would have been built along Boston Road (U.S. Route 1) through Bronx Park and Northeast Bronx. Shortly after {{the opening of the}} first segment of the expressway, it was projected that construction of the first extension to the Bronx River Parkway would begin 1965, and the final segment to the New England Thruway in 1967. However the project, like other Robert Moses highways, faced increasing community opposition and was cancelled by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1971, one year before its projected completion. Because of the cancellation of the extension, the Sheridan is locally seen as <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> stub, serving the same movements as the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87) and Bronx River Parkway.|$|E
25|$|The General Staff had {{reinforced}} the Route 7/13 intersection {{to the rear}} of the battle with four battalions under General Kouprasith Abhay in mid-March, to block the route to the Royalist capital at Vientiane in case of defeat in MR 2. Now they sent a fleeting delegation of four generals to 20A, who made <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> recommendation to supply more uniforms to the guerrillas. Otherwise, the irregulars were on their own in the battle against the invaders. And while the guerrilla base at Long Tieng still held, outlying Royalist positions continued to fall to the communists. One of the fallen positions was Skyline One, which overlooked the 20A airfield. A PAVN artillery direction team was spotted three kilometers from the guerrilla base. That evening, Long Tieng came under communist fire for the first time, as communist 122mm rockets dropped in and a small band of Dac Cong attempted to raid the airstrip.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of foreign}} sources are {{unanimous}} in considering an unknown lineage for Ardashir; for example, Agathias {{has stated that}} Papak was a shoemaker who found out from astronomic proofs that Sasan would have a great son; thus Papak allowed Sasan to sleep with the former's wife {{and the result was}} Ardashir. Shakki considered Agathias's narrative <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> and vulgar story by the familiar Sergeus, Surianian translator of Khosrow I's court, ordered by the opponents and foes of Sasanians. Shakki said it was obvious Sergeus the Christian had induced that nonsense to Agathias. Like he had cleared Ardashir's family tree, and it was adapted from the imaginations of Christians and the materialist and atheist league. Shakki's reasoning is based on the current norm in marital customs that the children resulting from a woman's marriage with a second spouse (after divorcing her first spouse) will belong to the first spouse. In the three-language inscription of Shapur I's on Ka'ba-ye Zartosht in Naqsh-e Rustam, Sasan is introduced only as a nobleman and Papak as a king.|$|E
25|$|On 18 April 1806, Captain John Ayscough assumed {{command of}} Success.

They fired grape and ball down on the British, killing the First Lieutenant, Mr. Duke, with their first volley. The British withstood the enemy fire for an hour and twenty minutes, suffering seven more men wounded, and having the barge shot through in several places before Lieutenant Spence, then in command, deemed any attempt on the hill <b>a</b> <b>useless</b> sacrifice, so ordered the enemy ship to be towed out, which was achieved under heavy fire.
