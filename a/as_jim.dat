50|$|Jigme Namgyal (also known <b>as</b> <b>Jiming</b> Nanjia) is {{the current}} vice-mayor of Lhasa. He is more {{concerned}} with the cultural preservation of Lhasa, than the growth-oriented mayor Doje Cezhug. However, he shares Cezhug's anti-Dalai Lama sympathies.|$|R

5|$|Beal was {{a friend}} of Paynter, while Murray was a West Ham trialist and played {{football}} at schoolboy level with a number of West Ham players such <b>as</b> <b>Jim</b> Barrett. Through this contrivance of association the club's fans took it upon themselves to begin singing the popular music hall tune before home games, sometimes reinforced by the presence of a house band requested to play the refrain by Charlie Paynter.|$|E
5|$|From 1956 to 1958, Bowie was {{the subject}} of a CBS {{television}} series, The Adventures of Jim Bowie, which was primarily set in 1830s Louisiana, although later episodes ventured into the Mexican province of Texas. The show, which starred Scott Forbes <b>as</b> <b>Jim</b> Bowie, was based on the 1946 novel Tempered Blade.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There you are,' {{cried the}} Babe, with an entirely {{improper}} {{pride in his}} voice, considering the circumstances. 'What did I tell you?' Out of the darkness {{in front of them}} came a shout. They recognized the voice at once <b>as</b> <b>Jim's.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1959, Syracuse earned {{its first}} National Championship {{following}} an undefeated football {{season and a}} Cotton Bowl victory over Texas. The team featured sophomore running back Ernie Davis who, in 1961, became the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy. Davis was slated {{to play for the}} Cleveland Browns in the same backfield <b>as</b> <b>Jim</b> Brown, but died of leukemia before being able to play professionally.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, public {{attention}} in the United States was drawn to prosperity theology through the influence of prominent televangelists such <b>as</b> <b>Jim</b> Bakker. Bakker's influence waned, however, after he was implicated in a high-profile scandal. In the aftermath, Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) emerged as the dominant force in prosperity televangelism, having brought Robert Tilton and Benny Hinn to prominence.|$|E
5|$|Alan Hugh Dale (born 6 May 1947) is a New Zealander actor. As a child, Dale {{developed}} {{a love of}} theatre and also became a rugby player. After retiring from the sport, he took {{on a number of}} professions to support his family, before deciding to become a professional actor at age 27. With work limited in New Zealand, Dale moved to Australia, where he played Dr. John Forrest in The Young Doctors from 1979 to 1982. He later appeared <b>as</b> <b>Jim</b> Robinson in Neighbours, a part he played from 1985 until 1993. He left the series when he fell out with the producers over the pay he {{and the rest of the}} cast received.|$|E
50|$|Wayne {{offers to}} have Jim {{come with him}} to the afterlife, which Jim refuses. Wayne says he can move on to heaven and see his parents because the greasers are no longer a threat. Wayne goes back to the afterlife <b>as</b> <b>Jim's</b> family heads home.|$|R
50|$|Jester Hairston <b>as</b> Jethro, <b>Jim</b> Bowie's loyal slave.|$|R
50|$|Whether it is ever {{completely}} recognized or not by {{his friends}} or family, Jim is a super genius with a childlike mind {{and a huge}} heart. This unseen aspect is commonly mistaken by the other characters <b>as</b> <b>Jim's</b> being {{nothing more than the}} victim of long-term drug abuse.|$|R
5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{has been}} {{promoted}} to Assistant Regional Manager {{and as a result}} is inspired to find ways to be more productive, for himself and the office. However, his ideas for the office are ignored by Andy, leading to a discussion with Jim in the warehouse about their increasing dissatisfaction with Dunder Mifflin. Jim tells Darryl about his sports marketing job opportunity in Philadelphia and offers him a possible position. However, <b>as</b> <b>Jim</b> has yet to tell Pam, Darryl says he should before going forward. When Pam comes back, Jim reveals the job opportunity to Pam, who, despite giving her approval, is upset that Jim did not consult her beforehand.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the United States Football League {{formed as}} a spring league, and enjoyed {{moderate}} success during its first two seasons behind such stars <b>as</b> <b>Jim</b> Kelly and Herschel Walker. In 1985, the league, which lost {{a considerable amount of}} money due to overspending on players, opted to gamble on moving its schedule to fall in 1986 and filing a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against the NFL in an effort to stay afloat. When the lawsuit only drew a three-dollar judgment, the USFL folded.|$|E
5|$|King {{believed}} that organized, nonviolent {{protest against the}} system of southern segregation known <b>as</b> <b>Jim</b> Crow laws would lead to extensive {{media coverage of the}} struggle for black equality and voting rights. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by Southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers and marchers, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the Civil Rights Movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Money was {{a problem}} in the McCartney house, <b>as</b> <b>Jim</b> only earned up to £6.00 a week, which was less than his wife. Because of their {{financial}} situation, the McCartney family could not afford to buy a television set until the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, and never owned a car. His two sons were the first in the McCartney family line to buy cars. When The Beatles became successful, Jim had to leave Forthlin Road because fans used to stand outside and stare through the windows, which made him feel uncomfortable and nervous. Eight years after Mary's death, Jim married , on 24 November 1964. Williams had a daughter from a previous marriage, Ruth, whom Jim legally adopted.|$|E
5|$|The film grew {{a strong}} following, which {{expanded}} overseas in the 1980s, and has established {{itself as a}} cult classic. Film critics and enthusiasts now regard it as an absurdist masterpiece. It has been cited as an influence by filmmakers such <b>as</b> <b>Jim</b> Jarmusch, John Woo, Chan-wook Park and Quentin Tarantino, and composer John Zorn. Thirty-four years after Branded to Kill, Suzuki filmed Pistol Opera (2001) with Nikkatsu, a loose sequel to the former. The company has also hosted two major retrospectives spotlighting his career.|$|E
5|$|Under Ferguson's guidance, {{the club}} won three league championships, four Scottish Cups, the European Cup Winner's Cup, the European Super Cup, a League Cup, and a Drybrough Cup—all {{in the space}} of seven years. Players such <b>as</b> <b>Jim</b> Leighton, Willie Miller, Alex McLeish and Gordon Strachan became the {{backbone}} of the team. Aberdeen's second League title was won in 1979–80, and this initial success was built on, with Scottish Cup wins in three successive seasons from 1982 to 1984, and two more league titles in 1983–84 and 1984–85.|$|E
6000|$|Mordaunt agreed. Much {{depended}} on Bernard. The {{old man was}} rich and Mordaunt had much less money than he would like; indeed he had long reckoned on an improvement in his fortune when Bernard died. His claim, however, was not <b>as</b> strong <b>as</b> <b>Jim's,</b> and Bernard was eccentric. But Mrs. Halliday resumed: ...|$|R

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>Jim</b> Brown's star rose, players {{began to}} {{question}} Paul Brown's leadership and play-calling in the late 1950s. The skepticism {{came to a head}} in a game against the Giants {{at the end of the}} 1958 season in which a win or tie would have given the Browns a spot in the championship game against Ewbank's Colts. In the third quarter, the Browns drove to New York's 16-yard line with a 10–3 lead and lined up for a field goal. But Coach Brown called a timeout before Groza could make the try, which alerted the Giants to a possible fake kick. Brown indeed called a fake, and the holder stumbled as he got up to throw, ruining the play. The Giants came back to win the game by a field goal and reach the championship, while the Browns went home without a spot in the title game for the second year in a row.|$|E
5|$|Bremner {{signed a}} new three-year {{contract}} in summer 1987. New arrivals {{at the club}} were Glynn Snodin (£150,000 from Sheffield Wednesday), winger Gary Williams (£230,000 from Aston Villa) and Bobby Davison (£350,000 from Derby County), as well <b>as</b> <b>Jim</b> Melrose and Ken DeMange. A more significant new face was David Batty, a key player of the future who was given his debut from the youth team. United started the season inconsistently, but five straight wins in December won Bremner the Second Division Manager of the Month award. The inconsistent results returned however, and Leeds finished the 1987–88 season in seventh place, eight points outside the play-offs. Bremner did not enjoy {{a good relationship with}} the club's board, who felt him to be uncommunicative with them, and after a poor start to the 1988–89 season he was sacked in September 1988. His successor, Howard Wilkinson, was given money to spend by the board and Leeds went on to win promotion in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the McCartney {{family moved}} {{for the last}} time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built terrace house at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, which is now owned by The National Trust. It only cost £1:6s:0d per week, which was due to Mary's {{seniority}} at the hospital. Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the lavender hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds. <b>As</b> <b>Jim</b> was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush sprigs of Lavender and then burn them (like incense) in the ashtrays to kill the smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|E
