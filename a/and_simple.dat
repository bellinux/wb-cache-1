It will either {{collapse}} to a point in a finite amount of time, or remain smooth <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> forever. In the latter case, the curve necessarily converges to a closed geodesic of the surface.|$|E

5|$|Dominica's folk musical {{heritage}} includes work songs, storytelling, children's {{music and}} masquerade songs. Dominican work songs {{are accompanied by}} the tambou twavay drum, and are performed by workers while gathering fruit, building roads, fishing, moving a house or sawing wood. Many are responsorial, and are generally short <b>and</b> <b>simple,</b> with the lyrical text and rhythm tying into the work to be accompanied. On modern Dominica, work songs are rarely performed.|$|E
5|$|In this aspect, it {{resembled the}} stegosaurids, which also bore {{primitive}} teeth <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> jaws. Its diet would have consisted of ferns or conifers, as grasses did not evolve until {{late into the}} Cretaceous Period, after Scelidosaurus was long extinct.|$|E
5|$|No {{time was}} to be wasted on {{elaborate}} drawings; charts and plans should have notes <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> views of the land {{as seen from the}} sea showing measured heights of hills. Continued records of tides and meteorological conditions were also required. An additional suggestion was for a geological survey of a circular coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean including its profile and of tidal flows, to investigate the formation of such coral reefs.|$|E

5|$|Ryse: Son of Rome {{received}} a mixed critical reaction from reviewers upon launch, being praised for its visuals, story and high production values but criticized for its repetitive <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> gameplay. Cevat Yerli, CEO of Crytek, {{added that he}} was not satisfied with the sales of the game. Upon launch, the game was supported with several multiplayer-focused downloadable content, but the originally planned Challenge Editor was cancelled.|$|E

5|$|The Lockheed XF-104 was a single-engine, high-performance, {{supersonic}} interceptor {{prototype for}} a United States Air Force (USAF) series of lightweight <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> fighters. Only two aircraft were built; one aircraft was used primarily for aerodynamic {{research and the}} other served as an armament testbed, both aircraft being destroyed in accidents during testing. The XF-104s were forerunners of over 2,500 production Lockheed F-104 Starfighters.|$|E
5|$|The T-26 was {{exported}} {{and used}} extensively by Spain, China and Turkey. Captured T-26s {{were used by}} the Finnish, German, Romanian and Hungarian armies. The tank was reliable <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> to maintain, and its design was continually modernised between 1931 and 1941. No new models of the T-26 were developed after 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive <b>and</b> <b>simple,</b> generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E
