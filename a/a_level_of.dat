Majesco's port {{of the game}} garnered mediocre reviews, holding scores of 54 percent and 52 percent on Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. While the level design, story and atmosphere were praised, critics were negative towards what was seen to be a poorly performed port, with complaints focused on difficult controls, graphical problems and frame rate issues. In addition, the artificial intelligence was deemed to be significantly worse than the earlier PC incarnation of the game.

Even the higher-level taxonomy is disputed, with some experts preferring to place most lemurs within the infraorder Lemuriformes, while others prefer Lemuriformes to contain all living strepsirrhines, placing all lemurs in the superfamily Lemuroidea and all lorises and galagos in the superfamily Lorisoidea.|$|E

A 48 -year-old man {{originally}} {{presented with}} a 5 -day history of watery, nonbloody diarrhea without recent travel or contact with ill people. His medical history was significant for a prolonged course of Clostridium difficile diarrhea 1 year earlier. On physical exam, he had orthostatic hypotension, dry mucous membranes, mild right lower quadrant tenderness to palpation, and hyperactive bowel sounds. Laboratory testing revealed <b>a</b> sodium <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 130 mEq/L, <b>a</b> potassium <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 1. 7 mEq/L, <b>a</b> chloride <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 102 mEq/L, <b>a</b> bicarbonate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 13 mEq/L, <b>a</b> blood urea nitrogen <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 43 mg/dL, <b>a</b> creatinine <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 1. 6 mg/dL, and <b>a</b> calcium <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 11. 4 mg/dL. Despite several liters of IV hydration and aggressive potassium repletion, he remained severely hypokalemic with <b>a</b> potassium <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 1. 5 mEq/L. He {{was admitted to the}} medical ICU for further resuscitation. Stool testing was negative for C. difficile and other infectious organisms. The patient's symptoms resolved before additional evaluation, and he was discharged with a presumed diagnosis of severe viral gastroenteritis. The patient returned 1 week later with recurrence of profuse diarrhea. His physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of 104 / 59 mm Hg (nonorthostatic) and a pulse of 106 beats/min, again with dry mucous membranes and mild tenderness to palpation of the right lower quadrant. Serum chemistry panel revealed <b>a</b> sodium <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 137 mEq/L, <b>a</b> potassium <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 2. 3 mEq/L, <b>a</b> chloride <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 111 mEq/L, <b>a</b> bicarbonate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 10 mEq/L, <b>a</b> blood urea nitrogen <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 38 mg/dL, <b>a</b> creatinine <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 2. 3 mg/dL, and <b>a</b> calcium <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 10. 4 mg/dL.

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{study focused}} on how {{cognitive}} ability, personality traits, self-rated psychiatric symptoms, and social functioning {{were related to the}} way in which patients with psychosis perceived supportive aspects of the ward atmosphere. METHODS: Patients at a psychiatric rehabilitation unit (PRU) in southern Sweden completed a ward atmosphere questionnaire (COPES), rated their psychiatric symptoms (SCL- 90), self-image (SASB), and were tested on cognitive functioning (WAIS-R) and global social functioning (GAF). They were diagnosed according to ICD- 10. Data were analysed by means of logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Self-monitoring and restraining (self-control), one cluster in the SASB, was the strongest factor associated with how the patients perceived the ward atmosphere. <b>A</b> perceived high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> self-control indicated high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> perceived Support, Practical orientation, and Order and organisation of the ward atmosphere. <b>A</b> high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> self-rated paranoid symptoms (SCL- 90) increased the risk <b>of</b> perceiving <b>a</b> high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Anger and aggression and <b>a</b> low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Program clarity. Regarding cognitive ability (WAIS-R), two factors were important for predicting perceived ward atmosphere. <b>A</b> low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> social competence was associated with <b>a</b> low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> perceived Order and organisation. Furthermore, <b>a</b> low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> abstract thinking was related to <b>a</b> low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> perceived Anger and aggression, while <b>a</b> high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> abstract thinking was associated with <b>a</b> low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Program clarity. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited <b>a</b> lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Self-monitoring and restraining than patients with other psychoses. CONCLUSION: The results from this study indicate that individual factors such as self-control, paranoid symptoms and social competence may be important for how the ward atmosphere is perceived.
