25|$|Renin {{can bind to}} ATP6AP2, {{which results}} in a {{fourfold}} increase in the conversion of <b>angiotensinogen</b> to angiotensin I over that shown by soluble renin. In addition, renin binding results in phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine residues of ATP6AP2.|$|E
25|$|Renin {{activates}} the {{renin-angiotensin system}} by cleaving <b>angiotensinogen,</b> {{produced by the}} liver, to yield angiotensin I, which is further converted into angiotensin II by ACE, the angiotensin-converting enzyme primarily within the capillaries of the lungs. Angiotensin II then constricts blood vessels, increases the secretion of ADH and aldosterone, and stimulates the hypothalamus to activate the thirst reflex, each leading {{to an increase in}} blood pressure. Renin's primary function is therefore to eventually cause an increase in blood pressure, leading to restoration of perfusion pressure in the kidneys.|$|E
25|$|While diastolic blood {{pressure}} is diminished and the pulse pressure widens, systolic {{blood pressure}} generally remains normal or can even be slightly elevated, this is because sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis of the kidneys compensate for the decreased cardiac output. Catecholamines will increase the heart rate and increase the strength of ventricular contraction, directly increasing cardiac output. Catecholamines will also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, which causes increased systemic vascular resistance and ensures that organs are adequately perfused. Renin, a proteolytic enzyme, cleaves <b>angiotensinogen</b> to angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II. In the case of chronic aortic insufficiency with resultant cardiac remodeling, heart failure will develop, {{and it is possible}} to see systolic pressures diminish. Aortic insufficiency causes both volume overload (elevated preload) and pressure overload (elevated afterload) of the heart.|$|E
25|$|Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone {{system is}} a major blood {{pressure}} regulating mechanism. Markers of electrolyte and water imbalance in the body such as hypotension, low distal tubule sodium concentration, decreased blood volume and high sympathetic tone trigger {{the release of the}} enzyme renin from the cells of juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney. Renin activates a circulating liver derived prohormone <b>angiotensinogen</b> by proteolytic cleavage of all but its first ten amino acid residues known as angiotensin I. ACE (Angiotensin converting enzyme) then removes a further two residues, converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II. ACE is found in the pulmonary circulation and in the endothelium of many blood vessels. The system increases blood pressure by increasing the amount of salt and water the body retains, although angiotensin is also very good at causing the blood vessels to tighten (a potent vasoconstrictor).|$|E
25|$|Another system {{maintaining}} the extracellular fluid volume, peripheral resistance, {{and that if}} disturbed may lead to hypertension, is the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Renin is a circulating enzyme that participates in maintaining extracellular volume and arterial vasoconstriction, therefore contributing to regulation of blood pressure. It performs this function by breaking down (hydrolysing) <b>angiotensinogen,</b> secreted from the liver, into the peptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is further cleaved by an enzyme that is located primarily but not exclusively in the pulmonary circulation bound to endothelium; that enzyme is angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). This cleavage produces angiotensin II, the most vasoactive peptide. Angiotensin II is a potent constrictor of all blood vessels. It acts on the musculature of arteries, raising peripheral resistance and thereby elevating blood pressure. Angiotensin II also causes the adrenal glands to release aldosterone, which stimulates the epithelial cells of the kidneys to increase re-absorption of salt and water, leading to raised blood volume and raised blood pressure. So elevated renin levels in the blood (normally 1.98-2.46ng/ml in the upright position) leads to hypertension.|$|E
25|$|The primary mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, is {{produced}} in the adrenocortical zona glomerulosa {{by the action of}} the enzyme aldosterone synthase (also known as CYP11B2). Aldosterone is largely responsible for the long-term regulation of blood pressure. Aldosterone effects on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidney where it causes increased reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of both potassium (by principal cells) and hydrogen ions (by intercalated cells of the collecting duct). Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon, and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Although sustained production of aldosterone requires persistent calcium entry through low-voltage activated Ca2+ channels, isolated zona glomerulosa cells are considered nonexcitable, with recorded membrane voltages that are too hyperpolarized to permit Ca2+ channels entry. However, mouse zona glomerulosa cells within adrenal slices spontaneously generate membrane potential oscillations of low periodicity; this innate electrical excitability of zona glomerulosa cells provides a platform for the production of a recurrent Ca2+ channels signal that can be controlled by angiotensin II and extracellular potassium, the 2 major regulators of aldosterone production. Angiotensin II originates from plasmatic angiotensin I after the conversion of <b>angiotensinogen</b> by renin produced by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney.|$|E

5000|$|Renin, {{the first}} enzyme in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, {{plays a role}} in blood {{pressure}} control. It cleaves <b>angiotensinogen</b> to angiotensin I, which is in turn converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II has both direct and indirect effects on blood pressure. It directly causes arterial smooth muscle to contract, leading to vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the production of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which causes the tubules of the kidneys to increase reabsorption of sodium, with water following, thereby increasing plasma volume, and thus blood pressure. Aliskiren binds to the S3bp binding site of renin, essential for its activity. [...] Binding to this pocket prevents the conversion of <b>angiotensinogen</b> to angiotensin I.Aliskiren is also available as combination therapy with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E

50|$|Angiotensin is an {{oligopeptide}} and is {{a hormone}} and a powerful dipsogen. It {{is derived from the}} precursor molecule <b>angiotensinogen,</b> a serum globulin produced in the liver.

Angiotensin was independently isolated in Indianapolis and Argentina in the late 1930s (as 'angiotonin' and 'hypertensin', respectively) and subsequently characterised and synthesized by groups at the Cleveland Clinic and Ciba laboratories in Basel, Switzerland.|$|E
50|$|The Renin {{stability}} regulatory element (REN-SRE) is a cis-acting element {{identified in}} the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of the renin (REN) gene. It acts to regulate the levels of renin protein produced in the cell. Renin is secreted by renal juxtaglomerular cells and catalyses the conversion of <b>angiotensinogen</b> into angiotensin I which is the rate-limiting step {{in the production of}} angiotensin II. Angiotensin II induces hypertension and REN therefore requires tight expression control.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of {{renovascular hypertension}} involves the narrowing {{of the arteries}} supplying the kidneys which causes a low perfusion pressure that is detected by the juxtaglomerular apparatus (via the juxtaglomerular cells, which act as baroreceptors; located on the afferent arteriole wall). This leads to renin secretion that causes the <b>angiotensinogen</b> conversion to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I then proceeds to the lung where it is converted to angiotensin II via angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).|$|E
50|$|Renin inhibitors bind to {{the active}} site of renin and inhibit the binding of renin to <b>angiotensinogen,</b> {{which is the}} rate-determining step of the RAAS cascade. Consequently, renin inhibitors prevent the {{formation}} of Ang I and Ang II. Renin inhibitors may also prevent Ang-(1-7), Ang-(1-9) and Ang-(1-5) formation, {{although it is not}} known if this is clinically important. Renin is highly selective for its only naturally occurring substrate which is <b>angiotensinogen,</b> and the incidence of unwanted side effects with a renin inhibitor is infrequent. and similar to angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Ang II also functions within the RAAS as a negative feedback to suppress further release of renin. A reduction in Ang II levels or blockade of angiotensin receptors will suppress the feedback loop and lead to increased plasma renin concentrations (PRC) and plasma renin activity (PRA). This can be problematic for ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy since increased PRA could partially overcome the pharmacologic inhibition of the RAAS cascade. Because renin inhibitors directly affect renin activity, decrease of PRA despite the increased PRC (from loss of the negative feedback) may be clinically advantageous.|$|E
50|$|The {{decrease}} in expression and instability of connexin-43 {{may be due}} to the down regulation of tubulin and kinesin genes, and the alteration of microtubule structure, caused by DEHP; all of which are responsible for the transport of protein products. Also, DEHP caused down regulation of several growth factors, such as <b>angiotensinogen,</b> transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor C and A, and endothelial-1. The DEHP-induced down regulation of these growth factors may also contribute to the reduced expression and instability of connexin-43.|$|E

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} is the {{predominant}} constituent of the crystalline {{core of the}} eosinophil granule. High levels of the proform of this protein are also present in placenta and pregnancy serum, where it exists as a complex with several other proteins including pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPPA), <b>angiotensinogen</b> (AGT), and C3dg. This protein {{may be involved in}} antiparasitic defense mechanisms as a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin, and in immune hypersensitivity reactions. It is directly implicated in epithelial cell damage, exfoliation, and bronchospasm in allergic diseases.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ability of}} {{penbutolol}} {{to act as}} a partial agonist proves useful in the prevention of bradycardia as a result of decreasing the heart rate excessively. [...] Penbutolol binding β1 adrenergic receptors also alters kidney functions. Under normal physiological conditions, the enzyme renin converts <b>angiotensinogen</b> to angiotensin I, which will then be converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal gland, causing a decrease in electrolyte and water retention, ultimately increasing water excretion and decreasing blood volume and pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Angiotensin I (CAS# 11128-99-7) {{is formed}} {{by the action of}} renin on <b>angiotensinogen.</b> Renin cleaves the peptide bond between the leucine (Leu) and valine (Val) {{residues}} on <b>angiotensinogen,</b> creating the ten-amino acid peptide (des-Asp) angiotensin I. Renin is produced in the kidneys in response to renal sympathetic activity, decreased intrarenal blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic blood pressure [...] ) at the juxtaglomerular cells, or decreased delivery of Na+ and Cl- to the macula densa. [...] If a reduced NaCl concentration in the distal tubule is sensed by the macula densa, renin release by juxtaglomerular cells is increased. This sensing mechanism for macula densa-mediated renin secretion appears to have a specific dependency on chloride ions rather than sodium ions. Studies using isolated preparations of thick ascending limb with glomerulus attached in low NaCl perfusate were unable to inhibit renin secretion when various sodium salts were added but could inhibit renin secretion with the addition of chloride salts. This, and similar findings obtained in vivo, has led some to believe that perhaps [...] "the initiating signal for MD control of renin secretion is a change in the rate of NaCl uptake predominantly via a luminal Na,K,2Cl co-transporter whose physiological activity is determined by a change in luminal Cl concentration." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{generation}} {{consists of}} two groups of compounds, either peptide analogues of the prosegment of renin or peptide analogues of the amino-terminal part of the substrate <b>angiotensinogen.</b> The drugs in the latter group seemed {{to be effective in}} inhibiting renin activity and lowering blood pressure in both animals and humans. Unfortunately, they had to be given parenterally because of poor bioavailability. They also turned out to have short durations of action, low potencies and their ability to lower blood pressure was inadequate. None of these drugs completed clinical investigations.|$|E
50|$|Pepstatin, {{which was}} {{described}} in 1972, was the first synthetic renin inhibitor, but poor pharmacokinetic properties prevented it from entering in vivo investigations. The first generation of renin inhibitors, such as H-142, were peptide analogues of <b>angiotensinogen.</b> However, these inhibitors had also limited drug-like properties. Hopes of breakthrough appeared in 1982 when development of the second generation renin inhibitors began. This generation consisted of peptide-like compounds, such as remikiren, enalkiren and zanikiren. They had more drug-like rather than substrate-like properties, and in 1990 they went to clinical trials. The second generation had its limitations and never completed clinical trials.|$|E
