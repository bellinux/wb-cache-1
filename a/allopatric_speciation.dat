5|$|A {{year before}} their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, Niles Eldredge {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Evolution which suggested that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr's standard mechanism of <b>allopatric</b> <b>speciation</b> might suggest a possible resolution.|$|E
5|$|The second mode of {{speciation}} is peripatric speciation, {{which occurs}} when small populations of organisms become isolated {{in a new}} environment. This differs from <b>allopatric</b> <b>speciation</b> in that the isolated populations are numerically {{much smaller than the}} parental population. Here, the founder effect causes rapid speciation after an increase in inbreeding increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.|$|E

About 75 % of ail species disappeared in the Uppermost Frasnian in all studied regions of the world. Others survived, with some geographic changes, owing to littoral refuges (Lazarus effect). Deep benthic ostracods seem almost untouched by this event. We show that new post-event species resulted front <b>allopatric</b> <b>speciations</b> by migration between neritic provinces or along continental slopes towards deeper environments. During the event, surviving lineages show a continuous gradation from unscathed species to chronocline species, to phyletic subspeciations or speciations (=pseudo-extinctions) and even to new genera. The durability of lineages is controlled by the migration of populations. (C) 1999 Academie des sciences...|$|R

40|$|The {{strictly}} <b>allopatric</b> {{model of}} <b>speciation</b> makes definable predictions on {{the pattern of}} divergence, {{one of which is}} the uniformity in the divergence time across genomic regions. Using 345 coding and 143 intergenic sequences from the African great apes, we were able to reject the null hypothesis that the divergence time in the coding sequences (CDSs) and intergenic sequences (IGSs) is the same between human and chimpanzee. The conclusion is further supported by the analysis of whole-genome sequences between these species. The difference suggests a prolonged period of genetic exchange during the formation of these two species. Because the analysis should be generally applicable, collecting DNA sequence data from many genomic regions between closely related species should help to settle the debate over the prevalence of the <b>allopatric</b> mode of <b>speciation...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{distribution}} of genetic variation and the phylogenetic relationships between 18 {{populations of the}} arctic-alpine plant Trollius europaeus were analysed in three main regions (Alps, Pyrenees and Fennoscandia) by using dominant AFLP markers. Analysis of molecular variance revealed {{that most of the}} genetic variability was found within populations (64 %), although variation among regions (17 %) and among populations within regions (19 %) was highly significant (P < 0. 001). Accordingly, the global fixation index F-ST averaged over loci was high (0. 39). The among-population differentiation indicates restricted gene flow, congruent with limited dispersal of specific globeflower's pollinating flies (Chiastocheta spp.). Within-population diversity levels were significantly higher in the Alps (mean Nei's expected heterozygosity H-E = 0. 229) than in the Pyrenees (H-E = 0. 197) or in Fennoscandia (H-E = 0. 158). This finding is congruent with the species-richness of the associated flies, which is maximum in the Alps. We discuss the processes involved in shaping observed patterns of genetic diversity within and among T. europaeus populations. Genetic drift is the major factor acting on the small Pyrenean populations at the southern edge of T. europaeus distribution, while large Fennoscandian populations result probably from a founder effect followed by demographic expansion. The Alpine populations represent moderately fragmented relics of large southern ancestral populations. The patterns of genetic variability observed in the host plant support the hypothesis of sympatric speciation in associated flies, rather than recurrent <b>allopatric</b> <b>speciations...</b>|$|R

50|$|Speciation, the {{divergence}} of {{one species}} into {{two or more}} descendant species, occurs when {{a part of the}} species is separated from the main population by a reproductive barrier. In <b>allopatric</b> and peripatric <b>speciation,</b> the reproductive barrier {{is the result of a}} physical barrier (e.g. flood waters, mountain range, deserts). Once separated, the species begins to adapt to their new environment via genetic drift and natural selection. After many generations and continual evolution, the populations become unable to interbreed with one another.|$|R
5|$|Speciation {{has been}} {{observed}} multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature. In sexually reproducing organisms, speciation results from reproductive isolation followed by genealogical divergence. There are four primary geographic modes of speciation. The most common in animals is <b>allopatric</b> <b>speciation,</b> which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by habitat fragmentation or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms. As selection and drift act independently on populations isolated {{from the rest of}} their species, separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed.|$|E
5|$|The crested newts are {{believed}} to have originated in the Balkans and radiated in a brief time interval between 11.5 and 8 mya: First, the Balkan–Asian group (the Anatolian, Balkan and southern crested newt) branched off from the other crested newts, probably in a vicariance event caused by the separation of the Balkan and Anatolian land masses. The origin of current-day species is not fully understood so far, but one hypothesis suggests that ecological differences, notably in the adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle, may have evolved between populations and led to parapatric speciation. Alternatively, the complex geological history of the Balkan peninsula may have further separated populations there, with subsequent <b>allopatric</b> <b>speciation</b> and the spread of species into their current ranges.|$|E

Several subspecies have been classified since 1827, though there is no consensus on the number. <b>Allopatric</b> <b>speciation</b> is believed to have played a major role in the variations of the curve-billed. It shares striking similarities in appearance with another Toxostoma member, Bendire's thrasher. Nevertheless, it is recognized for its grey color and sickle-shaped bill.

In this study fragments of the COI and 18 S rRNA genes were used to estimate genetic divergences among 37 C. alpina populations from the European Alps. Phylogenetic analyses revealed five geographically and genetically distinct groups and at least 10 distinct lineages of C. alpina across the European Alps.

40|$|Patterns of {{biodiversity}} {{predicted by the}} neutral theory rely on a simple phenomenological model of speciation. To further investigate the effect of speciation on neutral biodiversity, we analyze a spatially-explicit neutral model based on population genetics. We define the metacommunity as a system of populations exchanging migrants and we use this framework to introduce speciation {{with little or no}} gene flow (<b>allopatric</b> and parapatric <b>speciation).</b> We find that with realistic mutation rates, our metacommunity model driven by neutral processes cannot support more than a few species. Adding natural selection in the population genetics of speciation increases the number of species in the metacommunity but the level of diversity found in Barro Colorado Island is difficult to reach.

40|$|The diversities and {{distributions}} of diatoms {{are much more}} complex than ever 3 imagined. To understand the underlying mechanisms, research must focus on evolutionary 4 processes occurring at a population level and employ sufficiently informative molecular 5 markers. Using ten microsatellites, we investigated the genetic structure of populations of the 6 benthic freshwater Sellaphora capitata (until 2004 a cryptic entity within the S. pupula agg. 7 species complex). This {{is the first time}} that microsatellites have been used to investigate the 8 genetic structure of any freshwater or benthic microalga. Using an integrated approach 9 (morphology, DNA barcoding, specificity of the microsatellite primers and mating 10 experiments), we verified the identity of 70 S. capitata isolates obtained from lakes in the 11 UK, Belgium and Australia. FST values were very high (> 0. 4) and in Bayesian analyses, 12 isolates clustered according to their country of origin with limited evidence of admixture. 13 Considering the apparent absence of desiccation-resistant resting stages in most diatoms, we 14 conclude that such levels of differentiation are likely to be a consequence of limited 15 dispersal.

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Ernst Mayr {{was influenced}} by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch showing the influence of local environmental factors on the geographic distribution of sub-species and closely related species. Mayr followed up on Dobzhansky's work with the 1942 book Systematics and the Origin of Species, which emphasized the importance of <b>allopatric</b> <b>speciation</b> in the formation of new species. This form of speciation occurs when the geographical isolation of a sub-population is followed by the development of mechanisms for reproductive isolation. Mayr also formulated the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.|$|E
5|$|Speciation {{requires}} {{a degree of}} reproductive isolation—that is, a reduction in gene flow. However, it is intrinsic {{to the concept of}} a species that hybrids are selected against, opposing the evolution of reproductive isolation, a problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in <b>allopatric</b> <b>speciation</b> with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations. E. B. Poulton realized in 1903 that reproductive isolation could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the heterozygote would then directly create reproductive isolation, leading to the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model, further elaborated by H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets. With reinforcement, however, natural selection can favor an increase in pre-zygotic isolation, influencing the process of speciation directly.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Analyses {{of spatial}} overlap in species {{distributions}} are frequently {{used to test}} a range of ecological and evolutionary hypotheses, from the role of competition in community assembly to the geography of speciation. Most studies quantify overlap at one spatial resolution. Here we explore the effects of measuring spatial and niche overlap patterns for the same clade (Banksia) at multiple resolutions. Location: Australia. Methods: We quantify overlap among species using broad overlap of species range polygons, proximity of occurrence points and co-occurrence within small survey plots. We compare overlap patterns with null models using age–range correlations {{and the frequency of}} sympatric sister species. We then use similar methods to examine patterns of overlap in environmental niche dimensions. Results: Banksia species show a wide range of overlap values based on range polygons and point proximities, but very low levels of co-occurrence at the local scale. Intercepts of age–range correlations point to higher levels of overlap among recently diverged species than expected. However, comparing the frequency of sympatric sister species with an evolutionary null model supports a prevailing <b>allopatric</b> mode of <b>speciation.</b> In many cases, niche overlap between species exceeds that expected from phylogenetic relatedness or spatial overlap alone. Main conclusions: Patterns of broad geographical overlap among Banksia species support a predominantly <b>allopatric</b> mode of <b>speciation,</b> combined with post-speciation range drift. There is more evidence for niche conservatism than for rapid niche divergence among closely related species. This pattern is consistent with broad-scale geomorphic and landscape complexity as a driver of plant speciation in south-west Australia. It is less consistent with finer-scale mechanisms of species divergence such as fire mosaics, or with ecological divergence in sympatry. Analysis of species overlap patterns at different resolutions is a useful approach for revealing the multiple ecological and historical factors that influence species distributions. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|<b>Allopatric</b> {{processes}} of <b>speciation</b> have routinely {{been presented to}} explain the extraordinary radiation of the East African Great Lakes cichlid fish species flocks. The 21 or more species of pelagic cichlids within the Lake Malawi flock appear to have lake-wide distributions that challenge such a concept. Data from six microsatellite DNA loci indicate single, panmictic populations across the lake of three Diplotaxodon species. Levels of variability at these loci suggest that populations have been large and stable. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data (872 bp of control region + 981 bp of the NADH- 2) from 90 species, representing all major clades within the Lake Malawi flock, indicate reciprocal monophyly of the pelagic clade.

40|$|Description The {{package is}} a {{flexible}} simulation tool for phylogenetic trees under a general model. It {{is possible to}} assume any probability distribution for the waiting time until speciation and extinction independently. Thus, TreeSimGM allows to simulate stochastic phylogenetic trees using any probability distribution and parameters for speciation and extinction. The speciation modes have all binary splits and are: (i) symmetric,where for every speciation event new waiting times until speciation and extinction are drawn for both daughter lineages; and (ii) asymmetric, where a speciation event results in one species with new waiting times, and another that carries the extinction time and age of its ancestor. Those two modes were inspired by <b>allopatric</b> and peripatric <b>speciation</b> respectively. Both models (symmetric and asymmetric) were created and implemented so that different processes (distributions) for speciation and extinction could be independently and explicitly specified. It is also possible to have an implicit extinction process by setting the extinction rate to zero...|$|R

25|$|Speciation is the lineage-splitting {{event that}} results in two {{separate}} species forming from a single common ancestral population. A widely accepted method of speciation is called <b>allopatric</b> <b>speciation.</b> <b>Allopatric</b> <b>speciation</b> begins when a population becomes geographically separated. Geological processes, such as the emergence of mountain ranges, the formation of canyons, or the flooding of land bridges by changes in sea level may result in separate populations. For speciation to occur, separation must be substantial, so that genetic exchange between the two populations is completely disrupted. In their separate environments, the genetically isolated groups follow their own unique evolutionary pathways. Each group will accumulate different mutations as well as be subjected to different selective pressures. The accumulated genetic changes may result in separated populations that can no longer interbreed if they are reunited. Barriers that prevent interbreeding are either prezygotic (prevent mating or fertilisation) or postzygotic (barriers that occur after fertilisation). If interbreeding is no longer possible, then they will be considered different species. The result of four billion years of evolution is the diversity of life around us, with an estimated 1.75million different species in existence today.|$|E
25|$|This {{species of}} white-headed tamarin {{is thought to}} have diverged from the other Amazonian forms such as S. leucopus.

Hershkovitz proposed that the separation of the two species happened in the Pleistocene {{at the height of the}} Atrato River, where it intersected the Cauca-Magdalena. At that time, the area was covered by a sea, which created a geographic barrier that caused the species to diverge through the process of <b>allopatric</b> <b>speciation.</b> Today, the two species are principally separated by the Atrato River.|$|E
40|$|Abstract An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} identified complex diversification patterns of Neotropical faunal groups. One example of such complexity is found in bats of the widely distributed and locally abundant Neotropical genus Artibeus, wherein both <b>allopatric</b> and hybrid <b>speciation</b> events have been hypothesized. However, conflicting hypotheses regarding the timescale of diversification for Artibeus exist, and therefore, temporal inferences of the speciation events within the genus remain in doubt. We examine hypotheses regarding the chronology of diversification events within Artibeus. Our results indicate the most parsimonious time of origin for the genus was during the late Miocene to early Pliocene, with multiple speciation events during the early Pleistocene. Considering this evolutionary timescale, we revisit a century-old systematic debate regarding the status of Central American populations known as Artibeus lituratus intermedius. We present nuclear genetic data that indicate intermedius is distinct from lituratus and hypothesize that this distinction was ecologically driven, likely involved sympatry and reinforcement, and occurred during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. Collectively, the data from Artibeus indicate that multiple speciation processe...|$|R
40|$|Tropical {{mountains}} are areas of high species richness and endemism. Two historical phenomena {{may have contributed}} to this: (1) fragmentation and isolation of habitats may have promoted the genetic differentiation of populations and increased the possibility of <b>allopatric</b> divergence and <b>speciation,</b> and; (2) the mountain areas may have allowed long-term population persistence during global climate fluctuations. These two phenomena have been studied using either species occurrence data or estimating species divergence times. However, only few studies have used intraspecific genetic data to analyse the mechanisms by which endemism may emerge at the microevolutionary scale. Here, we use landscape analysis of genomic SNP data sampled from two high-elevation plant species from an archipelago of tropical sky-islands (the Transmexican Volcanic Belt) to test for population genetic differentiation, synchronous demographic changes and habitat persistence. We show that genetic differentiation {{can be explained by the}} degree of glacial habitat connectivity among mountains, and that mountains have facilitated the persistence of populations throughout glacial/interglacial cycles. Our results support the ongoing role of tropical mountains as cradles for biodiversity by uncovering cryptic differentiation and limits to gene flow...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonocelis ophiocephala (Schmidt, 1861), a mesopsammic proseriate, {{is common}} {{in a variety of}} shallow water {{habitats}} in the Mediterranean. The genetic relationships between morphologically indistinguishable populations across the Mediterranean were surveyed by means of combined allozyme and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Genetic distances, UPGMA cluster analysis and F-statistics based on 27 allozyme genetic loci and 68 RAPD primer fragments were consistent in showing that the taxon Pseudomonocelis ophiocephala is a complex of sibling species, consisting of four taxonomic units. The four species differ in distribution and habitat: sibling A is widespread in lower intertidal habitats of the Mediterranean, in well-sorted, medium- to coarse-grained sand; siblings B, C and D show a restricted distribution (Corsican–Sardinian region and Elba Island, west and east coast of Greece, respectively) in low-energy marine habitats. Given that the species of the complex are morphologically indistinguishable, the type material is absent, and that there are two siblings in the type locality (Corfu Island, Greece), a neotype is designated for P. ophiocephala. The three further siblings are named; species descriptions are based on non-morphological characters (karyotype, allozymic and RAPD patterns).

25|$|Ernst Mayr's key {{contribution}} to the synthesis was Systematics and the Origin of Species, published in 1942. It asserted the importance of {{and set out to}} explain population variation in evolutionary processes including speciation. He analysed in particular the effects of polytypic species, geographic variation, and isolation by geographic and other means. Mayr emphasized the importance of <b>allopatric</b> <b>speciation,</b> where geographically isolated sub-populations diverge so far that reproductive isolation occurs. He was skeptical of the reality of sympatric speciation believing that geographical isolation was a prerequisite for building up intrinsic (reproductive) isolating mechanisms. Mayr also introduced the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations. Before he left Germany for the United States in 1930, Mayr had been influenced by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch, who in the 1920s had analyzed the geographic distribution of polytypic species, paying particular attention to how variations between populations correlated with factors such as differences in climate.|$|E

40|$|Bunocephalus is {{the most}} species-rich Aspredinidae genus, {{corresponding}} to a monophyletic clade with 13 valid species. However, many species have their classification put in question. Here, we analyzed individuals from four Amazonian populations of Bunocephalus coracoideus by cytogenetic and molecular procedures. The geographic distribution, genetic distances and karyotype data indicate that each population represents an Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU). Cytogenetic markers showed distinct 2 n and karyotype formulas, as well as different numbers and locations of the rDNA sites among ESUs. One of such populations (ESU-D) highlighted an extensive polymorphic condition, with several cytotypes probably due to chromosomal rearrangements and meiotic non-disjunctions. This resulted in several aneuploid karyotypes, which was also supported by the mapping of telomeric sequences. Phylograms based on Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Neighbor Joining (NJ) analyses grouped each ESU on particular highly supported clades, with the estimation of evolutionary divergence indicating values being higher than 3. 8 – 12. 3 % among them. Our study reveals a huge degree of chromosomal and genetic diversity in B. coracoideus and highly points {{to the existence of}} four ESUs in <b>allopatric</b> and sympatric <b>speciation</b> processes.

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} at 21 loci {{as determined}} by isozyme electrophoresis was examined from 218 specimens of Macrotus representing two species and including both mainland and island populations. Karyotypic and electrophoretic data suggest that specimens from the Antillean population (Macrotus waterhousii) are conspecific with populations of the southern main-land taxa. This high degree of similarity between Antillean and the southern mainland taxa and the tendency for the average heterozygosity of populations to be higher in peripheral populations than at the zone of contact between the two mainland species are best explained by the classical <b>allopatric</b> model of <b>speciation</b> and the data {{do not support the}} centrifugal model of speciation in this genus. A reduced degree of average heterozygosity per individual as is thought to be characteristic of island populations was not found for specimens of Mac-rotus from Jamaica. A decrease in variation is indicated, however, by a reduced number of loci that are polymorphic with most of the heterozygosity of the Jamaican population being in the esterase loci.

40|$|The co-evolution between {{hosts and}} parasites {{has long been}} {{recognized}} as a fundamental driver of macro-evolutionary patterns of diversification. The effect of co-differentiation on parasite diversification is, however, often confounded by underlying geographic patterns of host distribution. In order to disentangle the confounding effects of <b>allopatric</b> versus host <b>speciation,</b> the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene was sequenced in seventy individuals of the parasitic nematode genus Heligmosomoides sampled in the six Apodemus mice species common in the western Palearctic region. The nuclear internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2 were also sequenced in fifteen parasites to confirm the mitochondrial data. All lineages differentiated according to a geographic pattern and independently from the sampled host species. This suggests that host speciation did not involve concurrent parasite speciation. However, the geographic distribution range of some parasite lineages mirrors that of A. sylvaticus lineages in SW Europe, and that of A. flavicollis lineages in the Balkans and in the Middle East. Thus, regional co-differentiation likely occurred between the parasite and the two sister Apodemus hosts {{in different parts of}} their distribution range. We suggest that differences in regional abundances of A. sylvaticus and A. flavicollis are responsible for generating this pattern of regional co-differentiation. This study highlights the importance of integrating both geography and biogeographic information from potential hosts to better understand their parasite phylogeography. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.
