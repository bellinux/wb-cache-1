We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft.

2500|$|Ribbentrop became Hitler's {{favourite}} foreign-policy adviser, {{partly by}} dint of his familiarity with the world outside Germany, but also by flattery and sycophancy. One German diplomat later recalled that [...] "Ribbentrop didn't understand anything about foreign policy. His sole wish was to please Hitler". In particular, Ribbentrop acquired the habit of listening carefully to what Hitler was saying, memorizing his pet ideas, and then later presenting Hitler's ideas as his own – a practice that much impressed Hitler as proving Ribbentrop was an ideal National Socialist diplomat. Ribbentrop quickly learned that Hitler always favoured the most radical solution to any problem, and accordingly tendered his advice in that direction as a Ribbentrop aide recalled:When Hitler said 'Grey', Ribbentrop said 'Black, black, black'. He always said it three times more, {{and he was always}} more radical. I listened to what Hitler said one day when Ribbentrop wasn't present: 'With Ribbentrop it is so easy, he is always so radical. Meanwhile, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> I have, they come here, they have problems, they are afraid, they think we should take care and then I have to blow them up, to get strong. And Ribbentrop was blowing up the whole day and I had to do nothing. I had to break – much better!' ...|$|E

50|$|However, {{not all of}} Middle-earth remains under Sauron's sway.

At this time Sauron is still able to put on a fair appearance and manages to fool the elves into believing his intentions are good.
