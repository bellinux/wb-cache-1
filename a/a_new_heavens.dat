50|$|Meaning: There is {{no direct}} Scriptural {{indication}} {{for what the}} day means; however, clues may be determined {{in the use of}} the number 8 in Scripture. The number 8 is widely accepted as meaning “a new beginning”. It is prophetic of the time after the 7000 year millennium when the White Throne Judgment is held. A new beginning, termed the “World to Come” (Olam Haba in Hebrew) will occur with the establishment of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>Heavens,</b> new Earth, and a new Jerusalem as described in Revelation 22.|$|E
50|$|There {{will be a}} rapture of the Gentile church {{followed}} by a great tribulation of seven (or three-and-a-half) years' duration during which Antichrist will arise and Armageddon will occur. Then Jesus will return visibly to earth and re-establish the nation of Israel; the Jewish temple will be rebuilt at Jerusalem and the Temple mount, possibly {{in place of the}} Muslim Dome of the Rock (see Christian Zionism). Christ and the people of Israel will reign in Jerusalem for a thousand years, {{followed by}} last judgment and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>heavens</b> and new earth.|$|E
5000|$|Overview: History {{is divided}} into (typically seven) [...] "dispensations" [...] where God tests man's {{obedience}} differently. The present Church dispensation concerns Christians (mainly Gentiles) and is a parenthesis to God's main plan of dealing with and blessing his chosen people the Jews.Because of the Jews' rejection of Jesus, Jewish sovereignty over the promised earthly kingdom of Jerusalem and Palestine was postponed {{from the time of}} Christ's first coming until prior to or just after his Second Coming when most or all Jews will embrace him. There will be a rapture of the Gentile church followed by a great tribulation of seven (or three-and-a-half) years' duration during which Antichrist will arise and Armageddon will occur. Then Jesus will return visibly to earth and re-establish the nation of Israel; the Jewish temple will be rebuilt at Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Christ and the people of Israel will reign in Jerusalem for a thousand years, followed by the last judgment and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>heavens</b> and new earth.|$|E

50|$|Historicists believe Revelation articulates a {{full range}} {{of the history of the}} Christian church, from John's day to the Second Coming of Christ. The author (John) alludes to Daniel 2:28 and 45; Daniel's vision (Daniel 2) uses symbols giving a {{sequence}} of future events in history, from the Babylonian empire, through Medo-Persian period, Greece and Rome continuing until the end of the current civilization. This apocalyptic volume builds on Daniel's approach focusing on major points of Christian history: the cross of Christ (Rev. 5:6,9,12); the Second Coming (Rev. 14:14-16; 19:11-16); the 1,000 years in heaven (Rev. 20:4-6); the third advent of Christ to earth along with His loyal followers and the destruction of Satan and those who refused Christ (20:7-15); and the creation of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>heavens</b> and a new earth where death, sorrow, and sin cease and God dwells with His people (Rev. 21:1-8, 22-27; 22:1-5). The book of Daniel is divided into two parts--the historical narrative of the captivity of Judah and the prophecies pointing to both promised Messiah and the events of the end of the world. Attention to the text of Revelation aids the student of Bible prophecy by showing how the Apostle John and Jesus intended us to interpret Bible apocalyptic literature as found in Daniel.|$|E

40|$|Most Christians confess {{their belief}} in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>heaven</b> and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> earth. The question, however, arises as to what exactly is meant by and {{expected}} from {{the acceptance of the}} concept of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>heaven</b> and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> earth. In some Christian traditions the idea of heaven is predominantly emphasized- thus neglecting the notion of earth. In line with this emphasis the general idea of "after death we go to heaven" is stimulated. In other views, the new earth as final destination plays an important role, while the concept of the <b>new</b> <b>heaven</b> is underrated. In this article it is attempted not only to investigate different theological views concerning the <b>new</b> <b>heaven</b> and the <b>new</b> earth, but also to present a Biblical perspective on this topic of discussion...|$|R

5000|$|The poem's title echoes a {{line from}} Revelation 21:1, [...] "And I saw <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>heaven</b> and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> earth". The poem is written {{from the point of}} view of a soldier (or soldiers) in France {{wondering}} about death; since they have no chance of gaining entry into any mythological afterlife (or even the Christian Paradise), they call on the Channel ferry - rather than that over the Styx - to take them home and find remembrance and wholeness in their mothers' tears.|$|R
25|$|Christian eschatology is {{concerned}} with death, an intermediate state, Heaven, hell, the return of Jesus, and {{the resurrection of the}} dead. Several evangelical denominations include a rapture, a great tribulation, the Millennium, end of the world, the last judgment, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>heaven</b> and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> earth (the World to Come), and the ultimate consummation of all of God's purposes. Eschatological passages are found in many places, esp. Isaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Matthew 24, Mark 13, The Sheep and the Goats, and the Book of Revelation, but Revelation often occupies a central place in Christian eschatology.|$|R
