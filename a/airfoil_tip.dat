The devices {{consist of a}} passive tuned tab, a control coupled tab, an all-flying tip and a harmonic dilational <b>airfoil</b> <b>tip.</b> Each device was conceived for improving either aerodynamic performance or reducing vibratory control loads or hub shears. The evaluation was performed using a comprehensive rotor aeroelastic analysis (the G 400 PA code with appropriate modifications), together with data for a realistic helicopter rotor blade (the UH- 60 A Blackhawk), in high speed flight (90 m/s, 175 kts). The {{results of this study}} show that significant performance (L/(D sub e)) gains can be achieved with the all-flying free tip. Results from the harmonic dilational <b>airfoil</b> <b>tip</b> show the potential for moderate improvements in L/(D sub e).

40|$|The {{turbomachinery}} industry continually {{struggles with}} the adverse effects of con-tact rubs between airfoils and casings. The key parameter controlling the severity of a given rub event is the contact load produced when the <b>airfoil</b> <b>tips</b> incur into the casing. These highly non-linear and transient forces are difficult to calculate and their effects on the static and rotating components are not well understood.

Two baselines, a Convair, 30 passenger, 0. 47 Mach number airplane and a Lockheed, 50 passenger, 0. 70 Mach number airplane, were selected from NASA-Ames sponsored airframe contracts. Parametric performance, noise level, weight and cost trends for propellers with varying number of blades, activity factor, camber and diameter incorporating blade sweep, tip proplets, advanced composite materials, advanced airfoils, advanced prevision synchrophasing and counter-rotation are presented.

40|$|The present paper {{presents}} time-resolved volumetric {{measurements on}} the SD 7003 airfoil, {{performed in a}} water towing tank at a Reynolds number of 60, 000 and a 4 ° angle of attack. Under these conditions a mid-chord and stable laminar separation bubble (LSB) occurs on the suction side of the airfoil. As former investigations by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), the present study focuses on the unsteady 3 D topology of the bubble. For this reason the time-resolved Volumetric 3 -Component Velocimetry (V 3 V) technique was applied, which is highly capable of capturing a truly volumetric velocity distribution instantaneously in a nearly cubic volume. Furthermore, towing the airfoil through the resting fluid leads to a negligible turbulence level, {{and it is possible}} to observe the flow from the leading edge to the far wake of the airfoil, along with the interaction between the starting- and tip-vortex with its effect on the separation behavior. Thereby, the influence of the tip-vortex was systematically studied by changing the gap between the tank’s bottom and the <b>airfoil’s</b> <b>tip.</b> As a result, the three-dimensional coherent vortex structures shed near the reattachment region were detected.

Wing pitch angles of 6, 8, 9 and 12 deg were investigated. Detailed surface pressure distributions and wing force measurements were obtained for each wing tip configuration.

The experiment is based on the improvement of an existing rig: a cambered airfoil (NACA 5510) now mounted with a 16. 5 ° ± 0. 5 ° angle of attack between two horizontal plates, a 10 mm gap being maintained between the <b>airfoil</b> <b>tip</b> and the lower (casing) plate.

The control system consists of elevon surfaces on the outboard fins, a set of four body flaps on {{the upper and lower}} aft body, and an all-movable center fin. Both the elevons and body flaps were capable of trimming the model to angles of attack from - 2 deg to above 20 deg. The maximum trimmed lift-drag ratio was 3. 6.

40|$|The {{orientation}} of the single crystal material within a structural component is known to affect the strength and life of the part. The first stage blade of the High Pressure Fuel Turbopump (HPFTP) / Alternative Turbopump Development (ATD), of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) was used to {{study the effects of}} secondary axis'orientation angles on the failure rate of the blade. A new failure criterion was developed based on normal and shear strains on the primary crystallographic planes. The criterion was verified using low cycle fatigue (LCF) specimen data and a finite element model of the test specimens. The criterion was then used to study ATD/HPFTP first stage blade failure events. A detailed ANSYS finite element model of the blade was used to calculate the failure parameter for the different crystallographic orientations. A total of 297 cases were run to cover a wide range of acceptable orientations within the blade. Those orientations are related to the base crystallographic coordinate system that was created in the ANSYS finite element model. Contour plots of the criterion as a function of orientation for the blade tip and attachment were obtained. Results of the analysis revealed a 40 % increase in the failure parameter due to changing of the primary and secondary axes of material orientations. A comparison between failure criterion predictions and actual engine test data was then conducted. The engine test data comes from two ATD/HPFTP builds (units F 3 - 4 B and F 6 - 5 D), which were ground tested on the SSME at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.

40|$|Paper Number 47 In {{order to}} produce aircraft, turbo-machinery and {{helicopters}} with low acoustic signatures and without annoying tones, {{it is essential to}} understand the noise generated by airfoils. A series of experiments were carried out in the ane-choic wind tunnel facility at the University of Adelaide with subsonic, low Mach number turbulent flow over a wall-mounted finite-length NACA 0012 airfoil of span 124 mm and chord 67 mm (aspect ratio of 1. 851). Acoustic data were acquired using two phase-matched microphones, one mounted 560 mm above and the other 560 mm below the trailing edge of the airfoil, for flow conditions in the Reynolds number range of 2. 2 × 104 - 1. 675 × 105. Experiments were conducted for airfoil geometric angles of attack (α) of 0 º, 5 º and 10 º.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{control of}} running gaps between static and rotating components {{is vital to}} preserve mechanical integrity and ensure a correct functioning of any rotating machinery. In aero-engines, tip leakage above the <b>airfoil</b> <b>tip</b> results in relevant aerodynamic losses, therefore {{the gap between the}} rotor blades tip and the casing must be the smallest possible, but enough to avoid contacts. One way to measure and monitoring tip gap is by a Blade Tip Clearance (BTC) technique. The measurement of blade vibrations and eigen frequencies is also a crucial part of the development of any new gas turbine or aero-engine. For more than half a century, this has been performed by installing strain gauges on the blades and using telemetry to transmit the signals. The Blade Tip Timing (BTT) technique, (i. e. measuring the blade time of arrival from the casing at different angular locations with proximity sensors) is currently being adopted by all manufacturers as a replacement for the classical strain gauge technique because of its non-intrusive character. However, the aero engines presents an extremely challenging environment for the application of reliable in-service instrumentation. Current studies focus on sensors development, new data processing methods and the realization of a standard for such measurements. In this thesis, a simultaneous BTC & BTT measurement system was designed, realized and optimized using magnetoresistive sensing elements. A simultaneous BTC & BTT system ensures the measurement of the gap between the rotor blades and the casing and the measurement of blade vibrations. Different types of probes have been proposed and are currently used to monitor these parameters: optical, capacitive, microwave, eddy current. The sensors developed in this research project are based on the magnetoresistivity. Dedicated hardware and software components had to be designed and manufactured. Two external test at Fogale Nanotech in France and at the Military Research Institute of Technology (ITWL) in Poland are reported. The measurement chain was fully characterized and the innovative instrumentation for BTT and BTC measurements based on the magnetoresistivity has achieved promising performance for a professional product...|$|E

Data are presented for blade tip Mach numbers M(t) of 0. 29 to 0. 74 with corresponding values 6 6 of tip Reynolds number of 2. 59 x 10 (exp 6) and 6. 58 x 10 (exp 6). Comparisons are made between the data from the present rotor with results previously obtained from two other rotors: one having NACA 0012 airfoil sections and the other having an NACA 0009 <b>airfoil</b> <b>tip</b> section. At low tip Mach numbers, the maximum mean lift coefficient for the blade having the NACA 64 (1) AO 12 section was about 0. 08 less than that obtained with the blade having the NACA 0009 tip section and 0. 21 less than the value obtained with the blade having the NACA 0012 tip section. Blade maximum mean lift coefficient values were not obtained for Mach number values greater than 0. 47 because of a blade failure encountered during the tests. The effective mean lift-curve slope required for predicting rotor thrust varied from 5. 8 for the tip Mach nuniber range of 0. 29 to 0. 55 to a value of 6. 65 for a tip Mach number of 0. 71. The blade pitching-moment coefficients were small and relatively unaffected by changes in thrust coefficient and Mach number. In the instances in which stall was reached, the break in the blade pitching-moment curve was in a stable direction. The efficiency of the rotor decreased with an increase in tip speed. Expressed as figure of merit, at a tip Mach number of 0. 29 the maximum value was about 0. 74. Similar measurements made on another rotor having an NACA 0012 airfoil and with a rotor having an NACA 0009 tip section, showed a value of 0. 75.

40|$|An {{extensive}} parametric {{study of}} vortices shed from airfoil vortex generators {{has been conducted}} to determine the dependence of initial vortex circulation and peak vorticity on elements of the airfoil geometry and impinging flow conditions. These elements include the airfoil angle of attack, chord length, span, aspect ratio, local boundary layer thickness, and free stream Mach number. In addition, the influence of airfoil-to-airfoil spacing on the circulation and peak vorticity has been examined for pairs of co-rotating and counter-rotating vortices. The vortex generators were symmetric airfoils having a NACA- 0012 cross-sectional profile. These airfoils were mounted either in isolation, or in pairs, {{on the surface of}} a straight pipe. The turbulent boundary layer thickness to pipe radius ratio was about 17 percent. The circulation and peak vorticity data were derived from cross-plane velocity measurements acquired with a seven-hole probe at one chord-length downstream of the airfoil trailing edge location. The circulation is observed to be proportional to the free-stream Mach number, the angle-of-attack, and the span-to-boundary layer thickness ratio. With these parameters held constant, the circulation is observed to fall off in monotonic fashion with increasing airfoil aspect ratio. The peak vorticity is also observed to be proportional to the free-stream Mach number, the airfoil angle-of-attack, and the span-to-boundary layer thickness ratio. Unlike circulation, however, the peak vorticity is observed to increase with increasing aspect ratio, reaching a peak value at an aspect ratio of about 2. 0 before falling off again at higher values of aspect ratio. Co-rotating vortices shed from closely spaced pairs of airfoils have values of circulation and peak vorticity under those values found for vortices shed from isolated airfoils of the same geometry. Conversely, counter-rotating vortices show enhanced values of circulation and peak vorticity when compared to values obtained in isolation. The circulation may be accurately modeled with an expression based on Prandtl's relationship between finite airfoil circulation and airfoil geometry. A correlation for the peak vorticity has been derived from a conservation relationship equating the moment at the <b>airfoil</b> <b>tip</b> to the rate of angular momentum production of the shed vortex, modeled as a Lamb (ideal viscous) vortex. This technique provides excellent qualitative agreement to the observed behavior of peak vorticity for low aspect ratio airfoils typically used as vortex generators...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{acoustic}} {{characterization of}} a tip leakage flow developing downstream {{of a single}} blade test rig has been performed via wavelet-based post-processing techniques. Hot-Wire Anemometer, far-field and wall-pressure signals were processed which have been measured on an instrumented airfoil installed within the anechoic wind tunnel available at the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Acoustics of the Ecole Centrale de Lyon. The adopted airfoil is a NACA 5510 airfoil and the test rig has adjustable tip gap, which allows for tuning of the gap width: two flow configurations, with and without gap at the <b>airfoil</b> <b>tip,</b> are investigated. The Reynolds number, based on the airfoil chord, was Rec 9. 3105. In the experimental campaign, conducted by researchers of the Ecole Centrale de Lyon, measurements of the pressure both on the airfoil surface and in the acoustic field have been coupled with HWA and PIV acquisitions. The outcoming database provided a suitable characterization of the (strong unsteady) flow dynamics in the tip-gap region {{as well as the}} impact of the tip-gap turbulent interaction on to the measured acoustic emission. In the present research activity, advanced post-processing procedures based on the wavelet transform are applied to the data measured by ECL in order to extract the most energetic non-periodic contributions, localized in time and in space, and to detect the fluid dynamic structures which may act as noise sources. The events tracking method is based on the computation of the time-frequency maps from which it is possible to select events, determine their time of appearance, and perform conditional averages. The conditioning procedure has shown that the gap width plays a fundamental role in the noise generation mechanisms: the amplitude of the oscillations in the averaged wall-pressure signatures becomes larger for increasing width of the gap, probably as an effect of a roll–up phenomenon occurring at the tip edge of the airfoil. This phenomenon is known to produce complex unsteady interactions within the flow. Arising turbulent mechanisms dominate the flow behaviour not only in the gap region. Vortex structures shed by the tip leakage flow convect downstream, interact with the trailing edge flow and strongly modify the flow dynamics and the scattering mechanisms. Wavelet–conditioned HWA signals confirmed this features, as the averaged velocity fluctuations in the trailing edge region seem to be significantly affected by the gap width and statistically related to strong pressure energy fluctuations detected over the airfoil suction side close to the gap. The pressure–velocity cross–analysis here presented evidenced the effectiveness of the tip leakage flow as a noise source and provided useful information about the turbulent mechanisms excited by its formation. Pressure/velocity wavelet– based correlation obtained by processing HWA/far–field pressure and PIV/far– field pressure measurements yielded, in a statistic sense, the location of the major fluid dynamic structure which {{may be related to the}} largest pressure fluctuations at the wall and in the far field. A further step in the present research activity, has been the implementation of a boundary–to–field transfer function approach, as an attempt to model the acoustic phenomenon under investigation. The approach is based upon a theoretical formulation which uses the well-known concept of transpiration velocity and is devoted to the vorticity generated sound problem. Preliminary results were obtained by using this approach in a simple test–case, but the application to the configuration here analyzed is one of the future steps in the ongoing research activity...|$|E

40|$|In a {{traditional}} automotive cooling system, energy optimization {{could be achieved}} by controlling the engine temperature by means of several sensors placed inside the cooling circuit. Nevertheless, {{in some cases the}} increasing use of a great number of sensor devices makes the control system too bulky, expensive and not sufficiently robust for the intended application. This paper presents the development of a heavyduty automotive cooling axial fan with morphing blades activated by Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) strips that work as actuator elements in the polymeric blade structure. The application of smart materials to compact, high-energy density devices as well as the development of modeling and control systems has been of great interest during the last decade. SMAs are frequently combined within monolithic or composite host materials to produce adaptive structures whose properties could be tuned in response to external stimuli. The blade was designed to achieve the activation of the strips (purposely thermo-mechanically treated) by means of an air stream flow. With the aim of studying the morphing capability of the adaptive structure together with the recovery behavior of the NiTi strips, four different polymeric compounds have been compared in a specifically-designed wind tunnel. Digital image analysis techniques have been performed to quantitatively analyze the blade deflections and to evaluate the most suitable polymeric matrix for the intended application. As the airstream flow increases in temperature, the strips recover the memorized bent shape, leading to a camber variation. To study the possibility of employing SMA strips as actuator elements, a comparison with common viscous clutch behavior is proposed. The time range actuator response indicates that the SMA strips provide a lower frequency control that fits well with the engine coolant thermal requirement. The experimental results demonstrate the capability of SMA materials to accommodate the lower power actuators in the automotive field. Finally, the blade <b>tip</b> <b>airfoils,</b> reconstructed using a CAD procedure, were used to study the fluid dynamic behavior of the blade <b>tip</b> <b>airfoil.</b> A CFD numerical simulation was carried out in order to highlight the differences in the airfoil performance due to the different shapes of the blade.

40|$|Far-field {{acoustic}} {{data for}} a model helicopter rotor have been {{gathered in a}} large open-jet, acoustically treated wind tunnel with the rotor operating in hover and out of ground-effect. The four-bladed Boeing 360 model rotor with advanced <b>airfoils,</b> planform, and <b>tip</b> shape was run over a range of conditions typical of today's modern helicopter main rotor. Near in-plane acoustic measurements were compared with two independent implementations of classical linear theory. Measured steady thrust and torque were used together with a free-wake analysis (to predict the thrust and drag distributions along the rotor radius) as input to this first-principles theoretical approach. Good agreement between theory and experiment was shown for both amplitude and phase for measurements made in those positions that minimized distortion of the radiated acoustic signature at low-frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} on the Mod-O 100 kW experimental wind turbine to provide data on yaw alignment characteristics of a large {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} with its yaw restraint removed (i. e., in free yaw). The wind turbine consisted of a downwind horizontal axis rotor mounted on a tubular tower. Three rotor configurations were tested. Each rotor was teetered, coned 3 deg and tip-controlled. Two of the rotors had pitch-flap coupling or Delta- 3, and one rotor had none. The two rotors with Delta- 3 differed in the airfoil used in the tip sections. Test results indicate the rotor without pitch-flap coupling did not align closer than 25 deg with the wind, and pitch-flap coupling improved the wind turbine's alignment with the wind. Yaw damping was shown to have a favorable effect on free yaw characteristics. The change in the <b>tip</b> <b>airfoil</b> section was shown to affect the free yaw alignment also. The rotors with Delta- 3 were shown to be capable of responding to wind shifts and exhibited stable operating properties...|$|R
40|$|The near-vortex-wake flow {{of a large}} aspect-ratio {{rectangular}} wing is accurately computed {{by using}} the thin-layer and full Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. The chordwise section of the wing is a NACA- 0012 <b>airfoil</b> and its <b>tip</b> is round. The computations {{have been carried out}} on a fine C-O grid using an implicit, upwind, flux-difference splitting, finite-volume scheme. The thin-layer NS results have been obtained with and without flux limiters, and the full NS results have been obtained without flux limiters. Flow transition from laminar to turbulent is mimicked by turning-on the Baldwin-Lomax algebraic model at an experimentally prescribed chord-station location of 0. 05. Comparison of computed results and experimental data shows that the full NS results give the best resolution of the near-vortex-wake flow. Next, the strength of the wing-tip vortex has been reduced substantially without reducing the lift coefficient by using flow-injection from a slot along a portion of the wing tip. The flow injection is directed in the wing plane at 45 deg with the wing-tip chord...|$|R
40|$|The high {{frequency}} broadband noise radiated {{by the local}} separated flow at rotor blade tips is analyzed. The aeroacoustic model {{is based on the}} convection of the tip region's separated flow pressure fluctuations past the trailing edge of the blade. The tip vortex formation and separation are modeled from available experimental studies. The separated flow pressure fluctuations are estimated using available separated flow experimental data and correlations. The trailing edge noise was approximated using a point dipole model. The point dipole strengths were evaluated by a method based on the trailing edge noise theory of Amiet. The point dipole approach compares favorably to stationary airfoil trailing edge noise analyses and experiments except near the plane of the <b>airfoil.</b> The rotor <b>tip</b> separation noise results are compared to other noise mechanism calculations and to experiments. The tip noise mechanism is shown to be quite important in the {{high frequency}} range. It {{is likely to be the}} major contributor to high frequency broadband noise for heavily loaded rotors with low turbulence inflow...|$|R
40|$|Optimization {{of a low}} Reynolds number airfoil for use {{in small}} wind {{turbines}} is carried out using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization technique. With the aim of creating a roughness insensitive <b>airfoil</b> for the <b>tip</b> region of turbine blades, a multi-objective genetic algorithm code is developed. A review of existing parameterization and optimization methods are presented along with the strategies applied to optimize the airfoil in this study. A composite Bezier curve is used to parameterize the airfoil. The resulting airfoil, the USPT 2 has a maximum thickness of 10 % and shows insensitivity to roughness at the optimized angles and at other angles of attack as well. The characteristics of USPT 2 are studies by comparing it against the popular SG 6043 airfoil. While a slight loss in lift is noticed for both airfoils, the drag increments due to early transition are noticeable as well. The airfoil is also studied using CFD and wind tunnel experiments during free and forced transition. The USPT 2 airfoil will be useful in small wind turbines for locations where blade soiling is likely or where other flow phenomena may cause early transition of the boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|High {{resolution}} Nusselt number (Nu) distributions {{were measured}} on the blade tip {{surface of a}} large, 1. 0 meter-chord, low-speed cascade representative of a high-pressure turbine. Data was obtained at a Reynolds number of 4. 0 × 105 based on exit velocity and blade axial chord. Tip clearance levels ranged from 0. 56 % to 1. 68 % design span or equally from 1 % to 3 % of blade chord. An infrared camera, looking through the hollow blade, made detailed temperature measurements on a constant heat flux tip surface. The relative motion between the endwall and the blade tip was simulated by a moving belt. The moving belt endwall significantly to shifts the region of high Nusselt number distribution and reduces the overall averaged Nusselt number on the tip surface by up to 13. 3 %. The addition of a suction side squealer tip significantly reduced local tip heat transfer and resulted in a 32 % reduction in averaged Nusselt number. Analysis of pressure measurements on the blade <b>airfoil</b> surface and <b>tip</b> surface along with PIV velocity flow fields in the gap give {{an understanding of the}} heat transfer mechanism.

40|$|Data for rotors using {{unconventional}} airfoils are {{of interest}} to permit an evaluation of this technology's capability to meet the U. S. Army's need for increased helicopter mission effectiveness and improved safety and survivability. Thus, an experimental investigation was conducted in the Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) to evaluate the effect of using slotted airfoils in the rotor blade tip region (85 to 100 percent radius) on rotor aerodynamic performance and loads. Four rotor configurations were tested in forward flight at advance ratios from 0. 15 to 0. 45 and in hover in-ground effect. The hover tip Mach number was 0. 627, which is representative of a design point of 4000 -ft geometric altitude and a temperature of 95 F. The baseline rotor configuration had a conventional single-element <b>airfoil</b> in the <b>tip</b> region. A second rotor configuration had a forward-slotted airfoil with a - 6 deg slat, a third configuration had a forward-slotted airfoil with a - 10 slat, and a fourth configuration had an aft-slotted airfoil with a 3 deg flap (trailing edge down). The results of this investigation indicate that the - 6 deg slat configuration offers some performance and loads benefits over the other three configurations...|$|R
