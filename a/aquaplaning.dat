5|$|In Q2, lap times {{improved}} {{and the two}} Mercedes drivers led the way, with Rosberg {{a little over a}} tenth of a second ahead of teammate Hamilton. Fernando Alonso went faster than Valtteri Bottas and looked to make it into Q3, when Max Verstappen went faster and eliminated the McLaren driver. Also not in the top ten were both Lotus and the second McLaren of Jenson Button. Conditions soon worsened, preventing faster lap times. Many drivers spun out {{in the latter part of}} the session, complaining about <b>aquaplaning.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due {{to safety}} {{issues such as}} <b>aquaplaning,</b> the race is not held in wet conditions. In {{the event of a}} rain delay, the race will be {{postponed}} until rain showers cease, and the track is sufficiently dried. If rain falls during the race, officials can end the race and declare the results official if {{more than half of the}} scheduled distance (i.e., 101 laps) has been completed.|$|E
25|$|The Be-103 is a mid-wing monoplane, {{making use}} of the {{modified}} wing roots as water-displacing sponsons. It features an all-moving slab tail and retractable tricycle landing gear for land operations. Its hallmark and most distinguishing design feature is the water-displacing wing, an unusual feature for a seaplane, with three <b>aquaplaning</b> implements (planing step, port and starboard wing trailing edges) which substantially enhance the aircraft's on-the-water stability and seaworthiness.|$|E
50|$|There is no precise {{equation}} {{to determine}} {{the speed at which}} a vehicle will <b>aquaplane.</b> Existing efforts have derived rules of thumb from empirical testing. In general, cars <b>aquaplane</b> at speeds around 45-58 mph (72-93 kph).|$|R

25|$|McIntyre still {{competed in}} non-championship events, {{and it was}} at one such event at Oulton Park, Cheshire in August 1962 that he won the 250 cc race, and then started in the 500 cc race on his Manx Norton. After a bad start in poor conditions, he fought his way to the front before <b>aquaplaning</b> across a stream of water, losing control and {{crashing}} into a post holding an advertising sign, sustaining serious head injuries. After nine days in hospital, he died, an outstanding racer, and a great loss to the motorcycling world.|$|E
25|$|Rain {{fell across}} {{parts of the}} circuit in the second hour of the race and several cars were caught out by the change in conditions. The KCMG Oreca-Nissan driven by Richard Bradley, which had been trading the LMP2 lead with Jota Sport, hydroplaned into the first Mulsanne chicane and {{impacted}} the tire barriers heavily, while further up the Mulsanne several contenders in multiple classes {{were involved in a}} heavy accident. A group of LMGTE cars as well as the No. 3 Audi were slow on the course when they were approached by the No. 8 Toyota of Lapierre at a high rate of speed. <b>Aquaplaning</b> under braking, Lapierre spun amongst the group of cars and impacted the barriers head on. This was followed by Bird in the LMGTE Am-leading AF Corse Ferrari who drove into the rear of Bonanomi. The accident led to a safety car intervention, during which Lapierre was able to limp the Toyota back to the pit lane for repairs that lasted for nearly an hour. Bonanomi and Bird were unable to get their cars moving again and retired. Bradley was able to drive back to the pit lane for repairs and kept second place in LMP2.|$|E

500|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held; {{there were two}} 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. In first practice, Carlos Sainz Jr. set the fastest time with a 1:49.434 in rainy conditions, about half a second ahead of second placed Daniil Kvyat. Eight drivers chose not to set a time, with complaints about <b>aquaplaning</b> in the later stage of the session. The first fifty minutes of the session saw most drivers only drive installation laps. While the first timed laps were set on full wet tyres, the two Williams cars {{were the first to}} go out on intermediate tyres. Nico Rosberg ran with the power unit that he had used briefly at the [...] before it was changed due to a coolant leak. He switched back to the one he used in the previous race in Singapore {{for the rest of the}} weekend. Jolyon Palmer again took over for Romain Grosjean at Lotus, but he did not set a timed lap.|$|E
500|$|The race {{began at}} 15:00 Japan Standard Time (...) [...] The track {{had a large}} amount of {{standing}} water on its surface, since Typhoon Phanfone had brought heavy rain to the area. The air temperature was , and the track temperature was [...] About 142,000 people attended the race. The standing water caused heavy spray and impaired visibility, and all cars used full wet tyres. The race began behind the safety car, with no formation lap; despite the slow speed, drivers struggled for grip on the wet surface. Ericsson lost control of his car after accelerating out of the final turn, and spun into the gravel trap at the corner. Marshals pushed his car out of the gravel, enabling him to keep driving. Following complaints from Hamilton about poor visibility, the race was suspended after two laps. The cars drove back into the pit lane, lined up in grid formation and their engines were shut off. Several cars had their ride heights raised to make them less prone to <b>aquaplaning</b> on their underbody planks. The race was restarted 20 minutes later behind the safety car, after the rain let up. Alonso stopped his car with an electrical issue (possibly a short circuit from the wet conditions), and was the race's first retirement on lap three. His departure promoted Ricciardo into fifth place, Magnussen sixth and Button seventh.|$|E
500|$|Magnussen ran wide {{onto the}} first-turn run-off area on lap 38 but rejoined without spinning, and Vergne {{went off the}} track at the second corner. Vettel ran wide off the circuit and into the gravel trap at the S-turns during that lap, {{allowing}} Button to close in on him. Ricciardo closed the gap to Button that lap and attempted to pass him around the inside at the hairpin; Button defended his position, and Ricciardo ran wide. Hamilton recorded the fastest overall lap time of the race during the 39th lap, completing a circuit of one minute and 51.600 seconds. DRS was disabled on lap 41 because weather conditions continued to deteriorate. Visibility was reduced due to fading light and low cloud cover; drivers were dazzled by lights on their steering wheels. Ricciardo attempted to pass Button again that lap by taking the inside lane into the hairpin, but Button took a wide line. He passed Button at the hairpin to move into fourth position on the 42nd lap, and Button made a pit stop for full wet tyres. Sutil lost control of his car due to <b>aquaplaning,</b> spun and collided with the outside tyre barrier {{at the top of}} the hill at Dunlop Curve on the lap. Double yellow flags were waved at the corner to warn drivers about the incident, and Whiting did not use the safety car. Sutil's car was extracted from the track by a tractor crane that lap and turned backwards toward a gap in the barrier. Bianchi lost control of his Marussia at [...] on lap 43, veering right towards the run-off area outside the Dunlop Curve. Although he applied his throttle and brake pedals simultaneously, his fail-safe system did not work because the settings of his brake-by-wire system were incompatible.|$|E

50|$|If {{the rear}} wheels <b>aquaplane</b> and cause oversteer, the driver should steer in the {{direction}} of the skid until the rear tires regain traction, and then rapidly steer in the other direction to straighten the car.|$|R
50|$|If {{the drive}} wheels <b>aquaplane,</b> {{there may be}} a sudden audible rise in engine RPM and {{indicated}} speed as they begin to spin. In a broad highway turn, if the front wheels lose traction, the car will suddenly drift towards the outside of the bend. If the rear wheels lose traction, {{the back of the car}} will slew out sideways into a skid. If all four wheels <b>aquaplane</b> at once, the car will slide in a straight line, again towards the outside of the bend if in a turn. When any or all of the wheels regain traction, {{there may be a}} sudden jerk in whatever direction that wheel is pointed.|$|R
2500|$|On the track, the McLaren and Williams teams {{dominated}} the 1980s and 1990s, with Brabham also being competitive {{during the early}} part of the 1980s, winning two Drivers' Championships with Nelson Piquet. Powered by Porsche, Honda, and Mercedes-Benz, McLaren won sixteen championships (seven constructors' and nine drivers') in that period, while Williams used engines from Ford, Honda, and Renault to also win sixteen titles (nine constructors' and seven drivers'). The rivalry between racers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became F1's central focus during , and continued until Prost retired at the end of [...] Senna died at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix after crashing into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve Tamburello, having taken over Prost's lead drive at Williams that year. The FIA worked to improve the sport's safety standards since that weekend, during which Roland Ratzenberger also lost his life in an accident during Saturday qualifying. No driver had died of injuries sustained on the track at the wheel of a Formula One car for 20 years, until the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix where Jules Bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle after <b>aquaplaning</b> off the circuit. Since 1994, three track marshals have lost their lives, one at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix, the second at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix and the third at the 2013 Canadian Grand Prix.|$|E

5000|$|On 31 May 1995 an Air Niugini Fokker F-28 Fellowship 1000, {{registration}} P2-ANB, {{attempted a}} landing {{in bad weather}} and <b>aquaplaned</b> off the runway and fell into a ditch at {{the eastern end of}} the runway. The aircraft was carrying 4 crew and 35 passengers, none of whom was injured.|$|R
50|$|<b>Aquaplaning</b> is a {{condition}} that can exist when an aircraft is landed on a runway surface contaminated with standing water, slush, and/or wet snow. <b>Aquaplaning</b> can have serious adverse effects on ground controllability and braking efficiency. The three basic types of <b>aquaplaning</b> are dynamic <b>aquaplaning,</b> reverted rubber <b>aquaplaning,</b> and viscous <b>aquaplaning.</b> Any {{one of the three}} can render an aircraft partially or totally uncontrollable anytime during the landing roll.|$|E
50|$|The best {{strategy}} is to avoid contributors to <b>aquaplaning.</b> Proper tire pressure, narrow and unworn tires, and reduced speeds from those judged suitably moderate in the dry will mitigate the risk of <b>aquaplaning,</b> as will avoidance of standing water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aquaplaning</b> or {{hydroplaning}} by {{the tires}} {{of a road}} vehicle, aircraft or other wheeled vehicle occurs when a layer of water builds between {{the wheels of the}} vehicle and the road surface, leading to a loss of traction that prevents the vehicle from responding to control inputs. If it occurs to all wheels simultaneously, the vehicle becomes, in effect, an uncontrolled sled. <b>Aquaplaning</b> is a different phenomenon from when water {{on the surface of the}} roadway merely acts as a lubricant. Traction is diminished on wet pavement even when <b>aquaplaning</b> is not occurring.|$|E
50|$|Pierluigi Martiniâ€™s Minardi car <b>aquaplaned</b> on the Brabham Straight on lap 10, {{which sent}} his car {{straight}} into the right hand wall and rebounded {{to the other side}} of the track before eventually stopping out of the drivers' way. This indicated that the rain was beginning to fall even harder, and more torrential than before.|$|R

50|$|Any <b>aquaplaning</b> tire reduces both braking {{effectiveness}} and directional control.|$|E
50|$|Reverted rubber <b>aquaplaning</b> {{frequently}} follows {{an encounter}} with dynamic <b>aquaplaning,</b> during which time the pilot may have the brakes locked {{in an attempt to}} slow the aircraft. Eventually the aircraft slows enough to where the tires make contact with the runway surface and the aircraft begins to skid. The remedy for this type of aquaplane is for the pilot to release the brakes and allow the wheels to spin up and apply moderate braking. Reverted rubber <b>aquaplaning</b> is insidious in that the pilot may not know when it begins, and it can persist to very slow groundspeeds (20 knots or less).|$|E
