This was followed by two additional films, Anggrek Bulan (Moon Orchid; 1948) and Gadis Desa (Maiden from the Village; 1949), both based on plays he wrote several years earlier. In 1950, Andjar published his only novel, Noesa Penida, <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Balinese caste system, which followed lovers from different levels of the social hierarchy.

5|$|As a {{cultural}} critic, Said {{is known for}} the book Orientalism (1978), <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism—how the Western world perceives the Orient. Said’s model of textual analysis transformed the academic discourse of researchers in literary theory, literary criticism, and Middle-Eastern studies—how academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied. As a foundational text, Orientalism was controversial among the scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature.|$|E

5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} emerged as <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis.

5|$|Feminist {{theory can}} also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood {{relations}} rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.|$|E
5|$|In a 1989 {{review of}} the {{research}} on juvenile delinquency and violence, Lisabeth DiLalla and Gottesman found delinquency could be transitory or continuous, and genes contributed more to the continuous type. In 1991 the same authors published <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> then-prevalent idea of antisocial behavior being transmitted through generations by child abuse alone in antisocial families. They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents.|$|E

5|$|The Sermons, a {{political}} treatise composed {{in the guise}} of sermons, went almost unnoticed by contemporaries.

Another notable aspect of the book is its focus on the desperate plight of the serfs (the peasants).|$|E

It was seen in theatres by over 1 million people– the only Indonesian film of 2010 to do so. It also received favourable critical reception, winning the 2011 Bandung Film Festival after being refused a nomination at the 2010 Indonesian Film Festival.

5|$|The {{translation}} of the myth of Myrrha as it appeared in Ovid's Metamorphoses is suggested as being <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political settlement that followed the Glorious Revolution. The wife of {{the leader of this}} revolution, William of Orange, was Mary, daughter of James II. Mary and William were crowned king and queen of England in 1689, and because Dryden was deeply sympathetic to James he lost his public offices and fell into political disfavor under the new reign. Dryden turned to translation and infused these translations with political satire in response - the myth of Myrrha being one of these translations.|$|E

5|$|The Yomesh cult is the {{official}} religion of Orgoreyn, and worships light. Critics such as David Lake have found parallels between the Yomesh cult and Christianity, such {{as the presence of}} saints and angels, and the use of a dating system based on the death of the prophet. Le Guin portrays the Yomesh religion as influencing the Orgota society, which Lake interprets as <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influence of Christianity upon Western society. In comparison to the religion of Karhide, the Yomesh religion focuses more on enlightenment and positive, obvious statements. The novel suggests that this focus on positives leads to the Orgota being not entirely honest, and that a balance between enlightenment and darkness is necessary for truth.|$|E
5|$|The most {{familiar}} {{form of the}} myth was recounted in the Metamorphoses of Ovid, and the story {{was the subject of}} the most famous work (now lost) of the poet Helvius Cinna. Several alternate versions appeared in the Bibliotheca, the Fabulae of Hyginus, and the Metamorphoses of Antoninus Liberalis, with major variations depicting Myrrha's father as the Assyrian king Theias or depicting Aphrodite as having engineered the tragic liaison. Critical interpretation of the myth has considered Myrrha's refusal of conventional sexual relations to have provoked her incest, with the ensuing transformation to tree as a silencing punishment. It has been suggested that the taboo of incest marks the difference between culture and nature and that Ovid's version of Myrrha showed this. A translation of Ovid's Myrrha, done by English poet John Dryden in 1700, has been interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society of that day linking Myrrha to Mary II and Cinyras to James II.|$|E
