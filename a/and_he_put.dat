5|$|The Prime Minister {{recognized}} that the modernization of Madagascar and its system of state administration could strengthen the country against invasion by a Western power and directed his energy to this end. In 1877, he outlawed the enslavement of the Makoa community. Rainilaiarivony expanded the public education system, declaring school attendance mandatory in 1881 and forming a cadre of school inspectors the following year to ensure education quality. The island's first pharmacy was established by LMS missionaries in 1862, and the first hospital was inaugurated in Antananarivo three years later, followed by the launching in 1875 of a state medical system staffed by civil servant clinicians. Rainilaiarivony enacted a series of new legal codes {{over the course of}} his administration that sought to create a more humane social order. The number of capital offenses was reduced from eighteen to thirteen, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> an end to the tradition of collective family punishment for the crimes of one individual. Fines were fixed for specific offenses and corporal punishment was limited to being locked in irons. The structure of legal administration was reorganized so that matters that exceeded the authority of the traditional community courts at the level of the fokonolona village collective, administered by local magistrates and village heads, would be referred to the three high courts established in the capital in 1876, although final judicial authority remained with Rainilaiarivony. The Code of 305 Laws established that same year would form the basis of the legal system applied in Madagascar for the remainder of the 19th century and throughout much of the colonial period. To strengthen rule of law, the Prime Minister introduced a rural police force, modernized the court system and eliminated certain unjust privileges that had disproportionately benefited the noble class.|$|E
25|$|While {{there were}} many sensational stories in the New York World, they {{were by no means}} the only pieces, or even the {{dominant}} ones.

25|$|Although Nolde gained {{tremendous}} wealth, {{there is}} evidence that he never lost touch with his working class roots.

25|$|An ardent ascetic, he {{received}} the grace of unceasing prayer and saw Christ in a vision. After long years of spiritual trial, he acquired great humility and inner stillness. He prayed and wept {{for the whole world}} as for himself, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> the highest value on love for enemies. He became widely known as an elder. St Silouan died on September 24, 1938. His memory is celebrated on September 24.|$|E

25|$|He {{published}} {{many books}} and essays {{on social and}} political problems, and exposed the unscientific theories of Cesare Lombroso and his Scuola positiva (Positive school) and Enrico Ferri on criminology. Colajanni was particularly critical of Lombroso’s biological determinism – in particular the alleged inferiority of southern Italians – <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> a much greater emphasis on social conditions {{as a cause of}} offending. Lombroso and his disciples, however, remained dominant in Italy.|$|E
25|$|Hao Meng's {{subordinate}} Cao Xing {{refused to}} betray Lü Bu, {{so he turned}} against his superior and fought with him.

25|$|This {{set him up}} for the 1988 English season, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> in some {{eye-catching}} performances.

He also took nine wickets against a powerful Essex team containing Graham Gooch and Allan Border, picking up Border's wicket in both innings.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, civil {{disorder}} {{broke out in}} central Vietnam, and Buddhists protested military control of the government. Trưởng was asked to quell the rebellious 1st Division in Huế, which had decided to stop military operations with the communists in solidarity with the Buddhist protest movement. A Buddhist, Trưởng, was uncomfortable with his mission, but he carried out his orders. On 18 June, he commanded three airborne battalions that entered the city and restored order within two days <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> the 1st Division under government control.|$|E
25|$|Ronaldinho's {{career began}} with the Grêmio youth squad. He made his senior side debut during the 1998 Copa Libertadores. 1999 saw the {{emergence}} of the 18-year-old Ronaldinho, with 23 goals in 48 matches, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> in headlining displays in derbies against Internacional, most notably on 20 June 1999 in the Rio Grande do Sul State Championship final. In a match-winning performance, Ronaldinho embarrassed Internacional's Brazilian legend and 1994 World Cup-winning captain Dunga, flicking the ball over his head on one occasion, and leaving him flat-footed in a mazy dribble on another. Ronaldinho achieved further success with Grêmio, winning the inaugural Copa Sul-Minas.|$|E

25|$|In 565, Justinian I {{died and}} was succeeded by Justin II (565–578), who {{resolved}} to stop subsidies to Arab chieftains to restrain them from raiding Byzantine territory in Syria.

Justin II took advantage of the Armenian revolt to stop his yearly payments to Khosrau I for the defense of the Caucasus passes.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} confirm that it was among the four or five best teams in the world, Greece had to reach at least the semifinals in the FIBA World Championship it hosted in 1998. Coach Panagiotis Giannakis was {{confident}} that the Greek team would fulfill its mission <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> Alvertis, alongside his Panathinaikos teammate Nikos Oikonomou, {{in charge of the}} team's offense. Alvertis averaged 13.2 points and a surprisingly high 6.2 rebounds per game, being a major contributor in Greece's fourth-place finishing team. His leading role was now indisputable, especially since the great Panagiotis Fasoulas decided to retire from the national team {{after the end of the}} tournament.|$|E
25|$|Richards {{began to}} {{concentrate}} on upgrading the breeding operation. He experimented with grain feeds {{to take care of}} calves and other special feeding problems, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> windmills for adequate water. Richards and Comstock were the first cattlemen in the area to use chloro-naptholeum, a livestock dip that removed lice, mange, Texas itch, and other external parasites. The Spade Ranch was the agent for this patented product west of the Mississippi River. In 1903, the Spade's Hereford cattle won the Grand Prize at the American Royal Stock Show in Kansas City, Missouri for the best of any breed in both yearling and calf competition.|$|E

25|$|After dismal batting in {{the first}} Test of the South African tour, Laxman once again helped India to a {{historic}} win at Durban. India struggled to cope with Dale Steyn {{in the first}} innings before getting bundled out for 205. Laxman's 38 was {{the highest score in}} that innings. In the second innings, India were struggling at 94/5 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> on crucial partnerships with Dhoni and Zaheer Khan to help his team to 228, giving South Africa a target of 303. South Africa were bundled out for 215 giving India an 87-run win that helped level the series 1–1. He was awarded the Man of the Match for his match-winning innings of 96.|$|E
25|$|The black scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, in his , {{published}} in 1935, compared results across {{the states to}} show achievements by the Reconstruction legislatures and to refute claims about wholesale African-American control of governments. He showed black contributions, as {{in the establishment of}} universal public education, charitable and social institutions and universal suffrage as important results, and he noted their collaboration with whites. He also pointed out that whites benefited most by the financial deals made, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> excesses in the perspective of the war's aftermath. He noted that despite complaints, several states kept their Reconstruction constitutions for nearly a quarter of a century. Despite receiving favorable reviews, his work was largely ignored by white historians of his time.|$|E

When they enter the study, Mr. Carlile has the papers out but Lord Charles quickly sees that the plans of the fighter itself are gone. Carlile is adamant that they were in the safe <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> them on the table. He was distracted when he heard a woman's scream in the hallway and ran out to find Leonie, Mrs. Vanderlyn's maid, who claimed that she had seen a ghost. Carlile had not otherwise left the study.
