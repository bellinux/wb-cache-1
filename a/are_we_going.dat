25|$|The end {{of history}} is, alas, also {{the end of the}} dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for {{disposing}} of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum {{suggested}} that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting {{was inspired by a}} Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where <b>Are</b> <b>We</b> <b>Going?.</b> In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.|$|E

500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} Tanner Gill {{explained that}} the hotel in which the climactic fighting takes place was designed specifically with the fights in mind, saying [...] "The basic environment of the fight had to be constructed to be “stunt friendly.” The space was tailored. Each corner was rounded; surfaces were measured for height and size, then padded." [...] Elaborating on this, fight choreographer Matt Mullins stated, [...] "The main fight starts in a hallway, and then we move into a penthouse. Okay, we have a hallway and a penthouse—what can we do with that? <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to crash into some walls? <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> {{to go into a}} kitchen? We see what we would get in terms of props, we take into consideration what the actors can do, move-wise—in our case, Ming-Na is exceptionally talented, so we {{can do a lot of}} different martial arts movement with her." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally set for {{a single}} {{theatrical}} release, the idea to split the book into two parts was suggested by executive producer Lionel Wigram due to what David Heyman called [...] "creative imperative". Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, “No, David. How <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to do it?”. After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter Steve Kloves, he agreed with the division.|$|E
500|$|Jagger told Stephen Schiff in a 1992 Vanity Fair profile: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to}} be rebellious in those days; I was just being me. I wasn't trying to push the edge of anything.

500|$|Dark Horse's Buffy the Vampire Slayer-related comics {{feature the}} lesbian {{characters}} of Willow, Tara and Kennedy and the closeted character Andrew {{from the television}} series. The Buffy Season Eight comics attracted media attention when the title character has a one night stand with another girl who {{had fallen in love}} with her. The encounter was repeated, but both the character and the creators denied that this made Buffy gay, with Joss Whedon saying: [...] "We're not going to make her gay, nor <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to take the next 50 issues explaining that she's not. She's young and experimenting, and did I mention open-minded?".|$|E

[...] In keeping with the UFA's view of good government as being the non-partisan administration of business rather than any clash of ideologies, he concluded his speeches by asking [...] "Are we going to return in this Province to Government based on the two-party system, or <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to continue to work for a better ?" ...|$|E
500|$|Gig 'em: Both {{a saying}} and the thumbs up hand gesture of all Texas A University {{current and former}} {{students}} as sign of affiliation. Gig 'em also {{is the name of}} an Aggie yell. This tradition began at a 1930 Midnight Yell Practice held before the football game against the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. In an attempt to excite the crowd, Pinky Downs, a 1906 Texas A graduate and member of the school's Board of Regents, asked the crowd [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to do to those Horned Frogs?" [...] Using a term for frog hunting, he answered his own question, [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!".|$|E

500|$|Geoff Johns {{confirmed}} on his Twitter {{account that}} the film had ended principal photography on August 6, 2010 and entered post-production. In an interview with MTV News, director Martin Campbell {{was asked about the}} film's effects-heavy epic scale and commented [...] "It's daunting, just the process, (there are) something like 1,300 visual shots, it's mind-blowing, quite honestly". When asked about the constructs created from the power rings, Campbell stated [...] "One of the nice things is, we'll all sit down and say, 'Well, what <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to do here?' Really, it's as much as your imagination can go to make the constructs". The studio also confirmed to MTV News {{that the film}} would have a 3-D release.|$|E
500|$|Lessing {{dedicated}} Shikasta to her father. While she {{was still}} a child in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) he often used to gaze up at the night sky and say, [...] "Makes you think – there are so many worlds up there, wouldn't really matter if we did blow ourselves up – plenty more where we came from." [...] Shikasta gave rise to a religious cult in America. Lessing {{said in an interview that}} its followers had written to her and asked, [...] "When <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to be visited by the gods?", and she told them that the book is [...] "not a cosmology. It's an invention", and they replied, [...] "Ah, you're just testing us".|$|E
500|$|The first chapter, [...] "Gauguin's Questions", {{poses the}} {{questions}} that {{provide a framework for}} the book. Referring to Paul Gauguin's painting of the same name the questions are: Where do we come from? What are we? Where <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going?</b> Wright defines progress using the Victorian terms [...] "the assumption that a pattern of change exists in the history of mankind...that it consists of irreversible changes in one direction only, and that this direction is towards improvement". Despite the extended time span of the Stone Age, Wright places the first sign of progress as being the ability to create fire. The competition between Cro-Magnon and Neanderthals is examined with respect to the conditions that allowed one to out-compete the other.|$|E

500|$|Aggies {{today will}} often end public {{addresses}} and emails to other Aggies with a hearty [...] "Thanks and Gig 'em!". The [...] "Gig 'em" [...] tradition began at a 1930 Midnight Yell Practice held before {{the football game}} against the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. In an attempt to excite the crowd, Pinky Downs, a 1906 Texas A graduate {{and member of the}} school's Board of Regents, asked [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to do to those Horned Frogs?" [...] Using a term for frog hunting, he answered his own question, [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!" [...] For emphasis, he made a fist with the thumb extended. The phrase and hand signal proved popular, and it became the first hand sign of the Southwest Conference. Gig 'em is also the name of one of the school yells, which is used during football kickoffs.|$|E
500|$|The Virginia Tech defense {{looked to}} recover from its slide during the last five games of the regular season. During the Hokies' first eight games (all wins), Tech gave up averages of 10.5points, 267.5total yards and 40.8rushing yards per game. In the final five games (in which Tech went 1–4), the Hokie defense allowed averages of 32.8points, 446.7total yards and 229.4rushing yards per game. This led to doubts about Tech's ability to stop the Falcons' top-ranked rushing attack. Head {{defensive}} coach Bud foster said, [...] "... right now {{you just kind of}} have a question mark: <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to do what we're taught to do?" [...] That late-season falter still saw Tech ranked as the No.20 rushing defense in the country heading into the San Francisco Bowl, allowing an average of just 113.31yards per game.|$|E
500|$|Trevor Noah also avoided talking {{too much}} about Fox News, as Stewart was {{previously}} known for.

It’s no longer predicated around 24 hour news. There are so many different choices. Half of it is online now. Now you’ve got the 'Gawker's, the 'Buzzfeed's. The way people are drawing their news is soundbites and headlines and click-bait links has changed everything. The biggest challenge {{is going to be an}} exciting one I'm sure is how <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to bring all of that together looking at it from a bigger lens as opposed to just going after one source — which was historically Fox News" [...] Noah said at a press conference before the shows debut.|$|E
