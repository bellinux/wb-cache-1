5|$|Measuring the film's {{pros and}} cons, Boxoffice {{magazine}} {{said that the}} film's social media activity online and Lopez's pull with Latino audiences would help it. However, the publication <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Lopez's box office drawing power had been dwindling, which worked against the film.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{wrote that}} Peshkin's account was fair, and praised his {{decision}} to let the participants speak for themselves through quotations.

5|$|Yamato is the {{director}} of the Japan Meteorological Agency, Geomagnetism Research Department which was established by his own Hotsuin family. He is a level-headed thinker and able to maintain composure in most situations. Suwabe praised the cohesiveness of the music, video and dialogue of the series.

5|$|According to Jesús Pastor Paloma, an Agustinian Recollect priest, the {{structure}} was also {{supposed to have}} a prefabricated retablo (reredos) altar, which was lost at sea when the ship carrying it from Belgium capsized in a storm; a wooden altar was made locally in its stead. Paloma <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the bottom part of the church was designed to resemble a ship's hull, so that it would sway during an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|According to Perry Link, {{pressure}} on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong is avoided {{because it could}} result in a denial of visas for fieldwork in China. Ethan Gutmann <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> media organizations and human rights groups also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC government's attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.|$|E

5|$|Benny Benke, {{writing for}} the Semarang-based daily Suara Merdeka, found that Bramantyo had used ? to portray {{tolerance}} in Indonesia without making the subject seem cliché; however, he considered some scenes, such as Hendra's conversion, overdone. Frans Sartono, reviewing for the historically Catholic daily Kompas, considered the film heavily didactic but ultimately interesting, because its social commentary was much needed, considering Indonesia's religious turmoil. He <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the characters were driven to their actions by worldly needs and not religion.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of his junior season, the Illinois class of 2014 was being {{mentioned}} {{as one of the}} all-time great statewide classes of basketball players. Chicago Sun-Times writer Joe Henricksen noted that there was a high chance that this would be the fifth Illinois class and first since 2002 to include three McDonald's All-Americans. He <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the class has a chance to rival if not surpass the classes of 1998 and 2011 which each had nine top 100 players.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter. But he <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> such estimates depend on many dubious assumptions.|$|E

5|$|Commenting on the gameplay, Famitsu {{noted that}} it was rather simple, but {{approved}} of the inclusion of Casual Mode and praised the content of each chapter for being just the right size. Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to dismount steeds when indoors, but <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of user-friendly options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|E
5|$|Crawford made a {{successful}} transition to talkies. Her first {{starring role in}} an all-talking feature-length film was in Untamed in 1929, co-starring Robert Montgomery. Despite {{the success of the}} film at the box office, it received mixed reviews from critics, who noted that while Crawford seemed nervous at making the transition to sound, <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> she had {{become one of the most}} popular actresses in the world.|$|E
5|$|Fogleman's {{investigation}} led {{to several}} of the officers involved in the incident receiving further administrative discipline. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) subsequently refused U.S. Senate subpoenas for four USAF officers {{to be interviewed for}} the Senate investigation, which was never publicly released. The U.S. House investigation, conducted in part by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), found that the military investigative and judicial systems had operated mostly as designed, but <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the DoD had refused access to key witnesses.|$|E

5|$|Following its collapse, {{there was}} some {{speculation}} about whether Great Southern had disclosed to the market issues with the rate of return {{it was going to}} achieve on some of its timber investments. During parliamentary committee inquiries, these allegations were extended to the possibility that the auditors had been misled. It was <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that,</b> at the time that difficulties were emerging for Great Southern, its CEO sold some of his shares {{at the top of the}} companies' fortunes for $32.6 million.|$|E
5|$|Glatter has praised MacLachlan's {{involvement}} in his role, believing that he fully embraced and explored {{the character of}} Cooper; she noted that he was as devoted to the character's comedic elements as to his dramatic side and that the crew had difficulty completing takes featuring Cooper without laughing at his comic delivery. She has <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> although the writers and directors on the series tended to emphasize the rapport between Cooper and Fenn's character Audrey Horne, {{there was never any}} intention to bring the characters together as a couple.|$|E
5|$|Harvey <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the fatwa {{covered a}} wide range of Islamic {{religious}} duties, while usually a responsum fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests that the author had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule was like.|$|E

5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on {{conservation of energy}} in part of which he used those principles {{to explain why the}} oscillation dies away, that it is the resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> there was evidence of oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, morphological, {{ecological}} and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach. Results support distinction {{of the two}} evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely Panthera tigris tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and Panthera tigris sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. The authors <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management.|$|E
5|$|In a December 22, 1990, {{win against}} in-state rival Western Kentucky, Farmer posted {{a new career}} high with 22 points, despite missing his first five three-point {{attempts}} of the game. He would not approach such scoring numbers again until a February 3, 1991, contest against Georgia, when he scored 16 points after seeing extended minutes due to Woods being in foul trouble. Farmer suffered a black eye during the game, which was notable for its physicality. Messenger-Inquirer sportswriter Jake Jennings <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Farmer relied on drives to the basket to score, as opposed to his usual penchant for shooting three-point shots.|$|E
