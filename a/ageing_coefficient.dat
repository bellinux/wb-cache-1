40|$|Few {{changes have}} {{occurred}} in the use of various stabilizers over recent years. In the current literature, phosphate derivatives are used as anti-ageing additives in polymers, and the most popular of these are sterically hindering cyclic amines. However, most of these compounds are carcinogenic. Synthetic phenols have been increasingly used as antioxidants in food and in polymers. Ecological standards encourage the elimination of harmful additives in polymeric products that come in contact with food or with the human body. This article presents application of flavonoid (silymarin/flavonoligand) for polymer stabilization and use of natural phytocompounds such as color indicators of polymers ageing time. In this research, I propose two ways of application: traditional, during processing; and the new one, by using impregnation method. Based on the change of deformation energy (<b>ageing</b> <b>coefficient</b> K), FTIR, oxidative induction time (OIT) evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (OIT), thermogravimetry analysis (TG), spectrophotometric color measurements in terms of CIE-Lab color space values, I confirmed the high antioxidant activity of flavonoids in EPM. They provide coloration of the polymeric materials that changes cyclically as a function of aging time. Additionally, the use of phytocompounds in polymers provides similar stabilizing effect to those of synthetic antioxidants...|$|E

These karyotypes include both extra unidentified structurally abnormal chromosomes (EUSAC) [...] often denoted as "markers" [...] and extra identified structurally abnormal chromosomes (EISAC). The rate of all EUSAC was 0. 64 / 1, 000 (0. 32 - 0. 40 / 1, 000 mutant and 0. 23 - 0. 32 inherited), and that of all EISAC was 0. 11 / 1, 000 (0. 07 / 1, 000 mutant and 0. 04 / 1, 000 inherited). The rate of all ESAC was approximately 0. 8 / 1, 000 - 0. 4 - 0. 5 / 1, 000 mutant and 0. 3 - 0. 4 / 1, 000 inherited. Mean +/- SD maternal age of mutant cases was 37. 5 +/- 2. 9, significantly greater than the value of 35. 8 years in controls. A regression analysis indicated a rate of change of the log of the rate of about + 0. 20 with each year of maternal age between 30 and 45 years. When paternal age was introduced, the maternal <b>age</b> <b>coefficient</b> increased to about + 0. 25 [...] close to that seen for 47, + 21 [...] but the paternal <b>age</b> <b>coefficient</b> was - 0. 06. After being matched for maternal age and year of diagnosis, the case-control difference in paternal age for 24 mutant cases was - 2. 4 with a 95 % confidence interval of - 4. 6 to - 0. 1 years. In a regression analysis {{of the effects of}} both parental ages on the (log) rate, the maternal <b>age</b> <b>coefficient</b> was + 0. 25 and the paternal <b>age</b> <b>coefficient</b> was - 0. 06. These results are consistent with a (weak) negative paternal age effect {{in the face of a}} strong maternal age effect. Since ESAC include a heterogeneous group of abnormalities, the maternal age and paternal age trends, if not the result of statistical fluctuation or undetected biases, may involve different types of events.

The data, selected for the analysis, show the level of general morbidity of children (0 - 17 years old) and adult (18 and older) population based in terms of 1000 residents of 16 districts in the Rivne region for 2012. Assessment of the morbidity of children and adult population was carried out by the following methods: method of "percentile-profile", method taking into account the <b>age</b> <b>coefficients,</b> method of total placing. Results. The applied methods of the calculation of integral indicators allowed children and adult population morbidity of the Rivne region to be analyzed from different points of view. By the results of the "percentile-profile" method it was possible to divide the areas into two groups - with a level of general morbidity below and above the average level.

The trends of the specific coefficients were analyzed by triennia of the historical series, including individuals of both sexes from 25 years of age on, partitioned into 6 age groups of ten years intervals.

This effect can be ascribed to the presence of bentonite at the sand grain contacts. The paper also presents Gmax data obtained over time (up to approximately 7 days), which show that the presence of 3 % and 5 % bentonite increases the <b>aging</b> <b>coefficient</b> (NG) by a factor of 2 and 3, respectively.

Despite its potential benefits, in urban areas dominated by high-rise developments, urban renewal has an unintended negative impact on nearby properties since it reduces their redevelopment option values. In this study, we develop a number of hypotheses on how an urban renewal project, once made known to the public, affects neighborhood housing prices and test them with data in Hong Kong.

Meanwhile, absolute magnitudes in the Johnson V RI system are calculated through the translation formulae between gri and V RI in the literature. The calibrations of absolute magnitude as functions of metallicity and age are established by linear regressions of the data. It is found that metallicity coefficients in these calibrations decrease, while <b>age</b> <b>coefficients</b> increase, from the blue u filter to the red z filter. The calibration of Mi = 0. 06 [Fe/H]+ 0. 040 t+ 0. 03 has the smallest scatter of 0. 04 mag, and thus i is the best filter in the ugriz system when RHB stars are used for distance indicators. The comparison of the MI calibration from our data with that from red clump stars indicates that the previous suggestion that the I filter {{is better than the}} V filter in distance determination may not be true because of its significant dependence on age...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a practical {{method of analysis}} for temperature dependent response of composite concrete section, in both statically determinate and indeterminate structures. The evaluation of the temperature effects in a structure involves two aspects of calculations, which are to predict the temperature distributions through the structure and to calculate the strain and stress levels induced by these temperature distributions. The mechanisms of heat transfer occur on the concrete bridges is investigated and a fifth-degree parabola curve is selected to present the temperature distribution along the cross-section in this thesis. The theory used {{in the analysis of}} thermal response is based on the theory proposed by Priestley (1978). It also takes the aging effect into account using Age-Adjusted Effective Modulus Method. The elastic modulus is replaced by age-adjusted effective modulus which is affected by two factors, namely creep coefficient φ(t, [tauz]) and <b>aging</b> <b>coefficient</b> χ(t, τ). The details of analysis of the thermal stress and strain in statically determinate and indeterminate bridge are discussed and described in several cases. A computer program which used in the thermal analysis is also described. To predict the time-dependent effects on concrete section, the creep and shrinkage effects are modeled using the aging-adjusted effective modulus method, couple with a relaxation procedure...|$|R
