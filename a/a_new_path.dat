With this new cutting the pile light had to be {{moved to a new}} position. Anticipating the need, tenders for the construction of the superstructure were published in January 1912 and were accepted by March of that year. On February 11, 1913 the old lighthouse was discontinued, though a small light was attached to the remaining platform which was eventually destroyed in the 1960s.|$|E

Several seminarians joined the new fraternity, some of them close to ordination, and Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, who signed the decree approving their constitutions for a preliminary experimental period of five years, promised to confer the sacrament of orders on them.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{the disciples}} of Cyril and Methodius were {{expelled}} from Great Moravia by King Svätopluk I, who re-orientated the Empire to Western Christianity. Nevertheless, the expulsion {{had a significant}} impact on countries where the disciples settled and from there continued their evangelizing missions - especially Southeastern Europe and later Eastern Europe. Arriving in the First Bulgarian Empire, the disciples continued the Cyrilo-Methodian mission and the Glagolitic script was substituted by Cyrillic which used some of its letters. The Cyrillic script and translations of the liturgy were disseminated to other Slavic countries, particularly in the Balkans and Kievan Rus', charting <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>path</b> in these Slavic nations' cultural development and establishing the Cyrillic alphabets as they are now known in Bulgaria, Belarus, Macedonia, Mongolia, Montenegro, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|With his ideals intact, the {{platform}} provided by his editorial {{position at the}} NRF, {{the support of his}} friends, and the modicum of experience garnered from the several stagings of The Brothers Karamazov, he decided to found a theatre company. On the Left Bank, on the rue du Vieux-Colombier, he rented the old and dilapidated Athénée-Saint-Germain, an unlikely venue for the utopian ideals of Copeau, but its location at distance from the commercial theatre district gave a signal that he intended to pursue <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>path.</b> He named the theatre after the street so that it could be found more easily. In the spring of 1913, with the help of Charles Dullin in whose Montmartre apartment the auditions took place, Copeau started to assemble a company. Besides Dullin and Louis Jouvet, whom he took on principally as stage manager, he hired, among others, Roger Karl and Suzanne Bing.|$|E
