5|$|Obama is a {{supporter}} of the Chicago White Sox, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator. In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket. He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as President. In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez began 2009 as {{a starter}} but {{was moved to the}} bullpen during the season. He was {{returned}} to the rotation on July 10 because of an injury to fellow starter Randy Johnson, however, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> a no-hitter against the San Diego Padres that day. In 2010, Sánchez struck out 200 batters {{for the first time and}} was a member of the Giants team that won the World Series. In 2011 he married a Dominican model name Audris Rijo. He was traded to the Kansas City Royals in 2012, who traded him to the Colorado Rockies after he struggled in the first half of the season. He began 2013 with the Pittsburgh Pirates.|$|E
25|$|In book 5, Hera and Athena plot to harm Ares, who {{had been}} seen by Diomedes in {{assisting}} the Trojans. Diomedes called for his soldiers to fall back slowly. Hera, Ares' mother, saw Ares' interference and asked Zeus, Ares' father, for permission to drive Ares away from the battlefield. Hera encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> his spear at the god. Athena drove the spear into Ares' body, and he bellowed in pain and fled to Mt. Olympus, forcing the Trojans to fall back.|$|E

25|$|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, {{was on the}} show, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> in {{a few of his}} folksy farm stories, {{which of}} course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were {{different}} on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.|$|E
25|$|Burnett {{finished}} the 2008 season with an 18–10 record and established career highs {{in almost every}} single pitching category. He set a career high with 18 wins, appeared in 35 games while starting 34 games, pitched 221 innings, and led the American league with 231 strikeouts. His 34 starts also led the AL, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> curveballs {{a higher percentage of}} the time than any other AL starter; 29.2%. His five-year contract with the Blue Jays allowed him to opt {{out at the end of}} the 2008 season, and he chose to do so, becoming a free agent.|$|E
25|$|After the Cuban Revolution, Marrero {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} players to remain in Cuba under Fidel Castro, thereby providing a link between the old professional Cuban League and the new amateur Cuban national baseball system and its Cuban National Series. He was a pitching coach for several years for the Havana Industriales and was also a roving pitching instructor. Marrero is a respected figure in Cuba; his portrait is shown on a mural at Estadio Latinoamericano, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> out the first pitch at the 1984 baseball World Championship. He also threw out the first pitch at the 1999 Baltimore Orioles – Cuban national baseball team exhibition series.|$|E

25|$|He {{once had}} a {{friendship}} with Ty Cobb, with whom he often had discussions about baseball. He often touted Rogers Hornsby as being the greatest right-handed hitter of all time. This assertion actually led to a split {{in the relationship between}} Ty Cobb and Ted Williams. Once during one of their yearly debate sessions on the greatest hitters of all-time, Williams asserted that Hornsby {{was one of the greatest}} of all-time. Cobb apparently had strong feelings about Hornsby <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> a fit, expelling Williams from his hotel room. Their friendship effectively terminated after this altercation. This story was later refuted by Ted Williams himself.|$|E
25|$|During this period, whilst pondering {{a project}} to give public {{readings}} for his own profit, Dickens was approached through a charitable appeal by Great Ormond Street Hospital, to help it survive its first major financial crisis. His 'Drooping Buds' essay in Household Words earlier on 3 April 1852 was considered by the hospital's founders {{to have been the}} catalyst for the hospital's success. Dickens, whose philanthropy was well-known, was asked by his friend, the hospital's founder Charles West, to preside over the appeal, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> himself into the task, heart and soul. Dickens's public readings secured sufficient funds for an endowment to put the hospital on a sound financial footing—one reading on 9 February 1858 alone raised £3,000.|$|E
25|$|On January 6, 2004, the Maple Leafs {{were playing}} {{a game against the}} Nashville Predators, when Leaf captain Mats Sundin's stick broke on an {{attempted}} shot at the blue line <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> it away in disgust. Instead of hitting the glass, the stick accidentally went over and into the crowd. The NHL reacted by giving him a one-game suspension. The game he was suspended for was a game against the Senators in Toronto. During the game, Daniel Alfredsson's stick broke, and he immediately faked a toss of his stick into the stands. This caused an uproar with the Maple Leafs, in part because they had also lost the game 7–1. Alfredsson dismissed the Leafs' reaction, calling it an over-reaction. This incident added to the rivalry, and Leafs fans continue to boo Alfredsson at future games.|$|E

25|$|Ironside {{remained}} with 99th Brigade for only six months; in September 1918, he {{was attached to}} the Allied Expeditionary Force fighting the Bolsheviks in northern Russia, and in November given command of the force, retaining his temporary rank of brigadier general. This was his first independent command, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> himself fully into it; for over a year, he travelled continually along the Northern Dvina River to keep control of his scattered international forces, at one point narrowly escaping assassination. However, the Red Army managed eventually to gain a superior position in the Civil War and in late 1919 he was forced to abandon the White Army to their fate. In November he handed command over to General Henry Rawlinson, who would supervise the eventual withdrawal, and returned to Britain. Ironside was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and promoted to substantive major general for his efforts; this {{made him one of the}} youngest Major Generals in the British Army.|$|E
25|$|In 217, Cao Cao {{launched}} {{another attack}} on Sun Quan, {{leading to the}} Battle of Ruxu. Zhou Tai participated in the defence of Ruxu, and Sun Quan's forces succeeded in driving back the invaders. After Cao Cao's retreat, Zhou Tai was appointed General Who Pacifies the Caitiffs (平虜將軍) and was ordered to remain behind to guard Ruxu. At the time, Zhu Ran and Xu Sheng were also stationed at Ruxu and were Zhou Tai's subordinates, but they were reluctant to submit to Zhou's command. Sun Quan made a special trip to Ruxu <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> a party for all the military officers there. Sun Quan personally served wine to Zhou Tai {{and asked him to}} undress. He pointed at every scar on Zhou Tai's body and asked Zhou about it, whereupon Zhou would relate stories of the battles he fought in. At the end, Sun Quan told Zhou Tai to put on his clothes and they revelled through the night. The following day, Sun Quan instructed a herald to grant Zhou Tai his imperial parasol.|$|E

Shawn Perry of Vintage Rock also admires {{the range of}} sounds, saying: [...] "incidental passages, scads of sitar, sarod and tabla, Dixieland cutaways, 'Cowboy Music,' church bells, chirps, acoustic guitar, space rock riffs, piano, horns – you name it <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> it in."

500|$|Burrell {{had four}} hits and three RBI on April 27, 2004, in a 73 {{victory over the}} Cardinals. He also made a leaping catch to take a home run away from Rolen, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> out Pujols trying to score from third base on a single by Édgar Rentería. On May 2, Burrell hit his first career pinch-hit home run: a two-run game-tying {{home run in the}} ninth inning against Matt Mantei of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Phillies won the game, 65, in extra innings. On May 14, Burrell had four RBI (including the game-winner) in a 64 victory over the Colorado Rockies. He had four RBI again on May 18 (including two home runs) in an 87 victory over the Dodgers. On July 30, he hit two home runs in a 107 loss to the Cubs. On August 3, Burrell {{strained}} his left wrist during batting practice, and he was placed on the disabled list (DL) {{for the first time in}} his career the next day. He was originally scheduled to have season-ending surgery on August 13, but after getting a second opinion from Dr. Tom Graham, he decided to postpone the surgery and attempt to come back before the season ended. On September 3, he was activated from the disabled list. In 127 games, Burrell batted [...]257 with 24 home runs and 84 RBI.|$|E
500|$|Pierce married Gloria McCreadie, who he {{had dated}} since high school, on October 22, 1949, {{and they have}} three children, William Reed (born July 6, 1953), Patricia [...] "Patti" [...] Crowley (born October 4, 1955) and Robert Walter (born July 16, 1958). Pierce told one {{interviewer}} of his wife, [...] "She's not only a loyal fan, but a smart one, {{and there was the}} day I had to go to Marty Marion – he was the White Sox manager then – and tell him that he'd better change our bunt sign because Gloria had stolen it, so very likely the opposition would be stealing it too." [...] Although he had by then been traded to the Giants, following the 1962 season they relocated from Birmingham, Michigan to the southwest Chicago suburb of Evergreen Park. (For several years while he was with the White Sox, they had also maintained a summer residence in the south side's landmark Flamingo-on-the-Lake Apartments, where teammate Jim Rivera and his family also lived.) He remained a member of the White Sox community relations department into his late 80s, making frequent public appearances in the Chicago area. In addition, beginning in 1993 he headed the not-for-profit Chicago Baseball Cancer Charities, a cause he began supporting after Nellie Fox's death in 1975 at age 47. On June 29, 2013, the White Sox gave out souvenir statuettes of Pierce to fans at that day's game against the Cleveland Indians, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> out the ceremonial first pitch. Pierce died in Palos Heights, Illinois on July 31, 2015 at the age of 88 from gallbladder cancer. Pierce was a 33rd Degree Mason of Evergreen Park Lodge; his funeral was held at Evergreen Park Presbyterian Church, and he was entombed in Chapel Hill Gardens South Cemetery in Alsip.|$|E

500|$|Hewett {{began the}} 1893 season in good form, {{reaching}} his half-century {{in each of}} his first three matches for the county, including a total of 94 against Oxford University in late May. Hewett missed most of the match against Kent shortly after, returning to Taunton due to the death of his brother-in-law, during which time George Wood replaced him as a substitute. In July 1893, the touring Australians played Somerset at Taunton {{for the first time since}} 1882, when both the ground and the county team were barely established. After the success of the 1892 season, and because talented, Australian-born Sammy Woods was playing for Somerset, the match was eagerly anticipated. Thousands arrived in Taunton for the match, but after overnight torrential rain, the umpires inspected the pitch at 11:00 and abandoned play for the day. In his history of the county club, Roebuck suggest that they may have been put under pressure by the Australians or by Hewett himself. The Somerset fans and members were angry at the decision, but the Australians packed picnic baskets and after exchanging strong words with the locals, departed for the Quantock Hills. Hewett, along with Woods and Vernon Hill, arranged to play golf in Minehead. The crowd continued to show their dismay at the decision, and eventually the Somerset officials asked the umpires to take another look at the ground. Woods supported this decision in his reminiscences, claiming that [...] "the decision not to play was premature." [...] At 14:00, after their second inspection, the umpires retracted their previous decision and announced that play could start. Hewett reacted angrily, and argued unsuccessfully against the decision with the Somerset committee. The Australian players were recalled from their picnic, and play began at 16:00, although neither team particularly wanted to play. Roebuck recorded that [...] "Hewett, in particular, was in high dudgeon <b>and...</b> <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> away his wicket for 12 runs, having been dropped once." [...] David Foot offered a more tempered opinion, saying simply that Hewett's [...] "mind wasn't on the game." [...] No play was possible on the second day, and on the third, Australia won the match by six wickets. Hewett felt let down by the Somerset committee, who he felt had undermined his authority, prompting him to say that [...] "if a captain can't lead at Taunton, this is no place for him." [...] Although friends thought he was overreacting, he declared that he would resign from the captaincy and the club at the end of the season. Both Foot and Roebuck suggested that Hewett reacted in an over-sensitive and extreme manner, but that his lack of self-control may have limited his long-term captaincy prospects.|$|E
