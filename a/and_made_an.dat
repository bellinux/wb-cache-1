5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about the new Constitution <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in the December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E
5|$|After the Headingley Test, Loxton {{came in at}} 5/344 <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> attacking 51 as Australia batted {{first and}} made 456 against Derbyshire. He then took 1/27 from 17.4 overs in the first innings. Australia {{enforced}} the follow on and Loxton took the first wicket before returning to take two tail-end wickets and end with 3/16 from 13.4 overs as Australia won by an innings. Loxton was the most economical of the Australian wicket-takers. After six consecutive matches, Loxton was rested for the rain-affected draw against Glamorgan, which did not reach the second innings. The hosts were bowled out for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.|$|E

5|$|Although Del Piero {{was mostly}} on the substitutes' bench at Euro 2008, he started in Italy's second group match against Romania as the squad's captain. In the first group match against the Dutch, he came on for the under-performing Antonio Di Natale <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> {{immediate}} impact, including several efforts on goal; however, he could not prevent Italy from losing 3–0. Italy qualified through the group stage in second-place behind the Netherlands, eliminating Romania and France. In the quarter-final against eventual champions Spain, Del Piero made a substitute appearance during extra-time, and with the game ending in a 0–0 draw, it was decided by a penalty shootout in which Spain won 4–2.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but on this occasion Bradman insisted that only six current English Test players be allowed to participate. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being the inclusion of Ian Johnson {{at the expense of}} Doug Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Hassett came in at No. 10 <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> unbeaten seven as Australia declared at 8/469. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. It was the tourists’ last first-class match for the tour and when it became obvious that they would not lose, Bradman let Hassett bowl four overs for twelve runs without taking a wicket. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Hassett missed both of the matches; Australia won both by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{spent the}} 1978–79 season in Gillingham's reserve team and, despite playing in defence, scored 18goals {{to finish the}} season as top scorer.

He came close to making his debut for the club's senior team in May 1979, but Summers decided at the last minute that, as Gillingham were chasing promotion from the Third Division, Bruce was not yet ready to handle the pressure of the occasion. He eventually made his senior debut in a Football League Cup tie against Luton Town on 11 August 1979, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> immediate impact in the team, winning the club's Player of the Year award {{at the end of the}} 1979–80 season. He went on to make more than 200appearances for the club, and was twice voted into the Professional Footballers' Association's Third Division Team of the Year.|$|E

Both sons and son in law would serve in the Army during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Conant (1929) gave a {{detailed}} account of the feeding behavior of a captive specimen from South Carolina. When prey was introduced, the snake quickly became attentive <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> attack. Frogs and small birds were seized and held until movement stopped. Larger prey was approached in a more cautious manner; a rapid strike was executed after which the snake would withdraw. In 2.5 years, the snake had accepted three species of frogs, including a large bullfrog, a spotted salamander, water snakes, garter snakes, sparrows, young rats, and three species of mice. Brimley (1944) described a captive specimen that ate copperheads (A. contortrix), as well as members of its own species, keeping its fangs embedded in its victims until they had been immobilized.|$|E
5|$|Despite Langdale's {{attempt to}} counter-charge, the Royalists were soon outflanked.

On Hoole Heath these retreating soldiers met with part of Gerard's force <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> initially successful counter-attack before being forced back to the walls of Chester. There the retreating cavalry choked up the streets, allowing the Parliamentarian musketeers to fire into the confused mass of horsemen and leading to a rout.|$|E
