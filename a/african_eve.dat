Mitochondrial DNA, therefore, {{can be used}} to trace matrilineal inheritance and to find the Mitochondrial Eve (also known as the <b>African</b> <b>Eve),</b> the most recent common ancestor of all humans via the mitochondrial DNA pathway.|$|E
5000|$|Citing genetic {{research}} by Cavalli-Sforza, the <b>African</b> <b>Eve</b> hypothesis, and the out of Africa theory, Rushton writes that Negroids branched off first (200,000 years ago), Caucasoids second (110,000 years ago), and Mongoloids last (41,000 years ago), arguing that throughout all of evolution, more ancient {{forms of life}} (i.e. plants, bacteria, reptiles) are less evolved than more recent forms of life (i.e. mammals, primates, humans) and that the much smaller variation in the races is consistent with this trend. [...] "One theoretical possibility," [...] said Rushton [...] "is that evolution is progressive and that some populations are more advanced than others". Rushton argues that this evolutionary history correlates with, and is responsible for, a consistent global racial pattern which explains many variables such as worldwide crime statistics or the global distribution of AIDS.|$|E
50|$|River Out of Eden {{comprises}} five chapters. The {{first chapter}} lays down the framework {{on which the}} rest of the book is built, that life is a river of genes flowing through geological time where organisms are mere temporary bodies. The second chapter shows how human ancestry can be traced via many gene pathways to different most recent common ancestors, with special emphasis on the <b>African</b> <b>Eve.</b> The third chapter describes how gradual enhancement via natural selection is the only mechanism which can create the complexity we observe all around us in nature. The fourth chapter expounds on the utter indifference of genes towards organisms they build and discard, in their relentless drive to maximise their own utility functions. The last chapter summarises milestones during the evolution of life on Earth and speculates on how similar processes may work in alien planetary systems.|$|E

"Skokiaan" [...] {{has been}} {{recorded}} many times, initially {{as part of a}} wave of world music that swept across the globe in the 1950s, spurred on in Africa by Hugh Tracey and in the United States by Alan Lomax, to name two. [...] "Skokiaan" [...] gained popularity outside Africa {{at the same time as}} the indigenous South African export, [...] "Mbube" [...] ("Wimoweh"). The sheet music was eventually released in 17 European and African languages. In France in 1955 the orchestra of Alix Combelle recorded a cover of [...] "Skokiaan" [...] on the Phillips label. Jacques Hélian also recorded a version. Performers recorded [...] "Skokiaan" [...] in Finland (Kipparikvartetti), Germany (James Last and Bert Kaempfert), and Sweden (Lily Berglund), among others. In the United Kingdom, vocal versions were recorded by South <b>African</b> singer <b>Eve</b> Boswell and Alma Cogan.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mythological compendia and indexes {{such as that}} by Stith Thompson {{create the}} {{impression}} that flood myths are rare in Africa and Australia. Erroneously, I too thought so in my short summary of Laurasian mythology (2001). A {{closer look at the}} worldwide distribution of flood myths tells differ-ently. While they are fairly widespread in the Laurasian Area (Eurasia, Polynesia, the Americas), they are by no means absent from what I like to call the Gondwana belt (sub-Saharan Africa, New Guinea / Melanesia, Australia). The hundreds of recorded flood myths from both areas can be classified into a few major types, region per region. A comparison of the Australian and African versions indicates a strong overlap that goes back to the time of the exodus from Africa, some 60, 000 years ago. The Eura-sian-American versions are more narrowly confined to a few basic types that {{can be traced back to}} the emergence of Laurasian mythology. However, the Laurasian types clearly emerge from the earlier Gondwana prototype. In sum, the flood myth is an ancient inheritance of human mythology. It is part of a very old core of myths connected with the emergence of humans and their early, evil ways – sur-prisingly echoing the Mesopotamian and Biblical accounts in many respects. Whether this myth has taken shape among the bottleneck population along the shores of E. Africa or even before, in the mind of the <b>African</b> <b>Eve</b> must remain moot, just as the psychological reason for its invention and formula-tion, which is a topic to be investigated by the study of the human brain and its productions. 1. Overview The flood myth is found widespread in Laurasian mythology 2 as well as in Gondwana areas. It is based on a relatively small number of well attested mythemes connected with a flood. This presentation is intended as a specimen of various investigations that...|$|E

Despite this over-representation, {{the resolution of the}} L0 subbranches was lacking and one other deep L1 branches has been found. Despite these limitations that sampling was adequate for the hallmark study. Today, L0 is restricted to African populations, whereas L1 is the ancestral haplogroup of all non-Africans, as well as most <b>Africans.</b> Mitochondrial <b>Eve's</b> sequence can be approximated by comparing a sequence from L0 with a sequence from L1. By reconciling the mutations in L0 and L1. The mtDNA sequences of contemporary human populations will generally differ from Mitochondrial Eve's sequence by about 50 mutations. Mutation rates were not classified according to site (other than excluding the HVR regions). The TCHLCA used in the year 2000 study of 5 Ma was also lower than values used in the most recent studies.|$|R
5000|$|Alistair was {{an emotionally}} distant father; he tolerated Julian as his heir and paid little {{attention}} to Sheridan when she was young. Alistair strove to ready Julian to take over the Crane empire some day in the future and felt that he needed a [...] "socially acceptable" [...] wife. When he learned that Julian had bedded and impregnated an <b>African</b> American woman, <b>Eve</b> Johnson, Alistair ordered Julian to leave her and marry Ivy Winthrop, daughter of the state's former governor, and then had Julian and Eve's son kidnapped at birth; he later faked the baby's death, blaming it on Eve's drug and alcohol abuse early in her pregnancy.|$|R
5000|$|One must {{consider}} the social mores of the mid 20th century. Although these books were written after the sexual revolution, {{it was still a}} [...] "bad" [...] woman and not a [...] "good" [...] girl who would choose to have sex. Therefore, having the choice taken away from the heroine by plot devices like being captured, or being forced to marry yet secretly in love with a hero took that choice away. The heroine relieved herself of moral responsibility {{in the eyes of the}} reader. [...] The Time of the Temptress (1978) conveys its jungle surrounding very realistically, especially with an episode where an unsuspecting Eve is besieged by crabs. Caught amidst an <b>African</b> civil war, <b>Eve</b> and Wade are forced to make their escape out of the jungle on foot. Despite Wade's ceaseless taunts and jeers, in a case of Stockholm syndrome, where Eve finds herself totally dependent on Wade for her rescue, she falls in love with him.|$|R
