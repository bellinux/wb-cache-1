5|$|The pre-mission {{briefing}} {{stage is}} where the player gets information on the background and objectives, and selects the ship <b>and</b> <b>weapons.</b> The choices of ships <b>and</b> <b>weapons</b> increase as the player proceeds further along the campaign. Certain missions, however, will dictate certain ships <b>and</b> <b>weapons</b> to be used. Weapons can be classified into primary weapons and secondary weapons. Primary weapons are kinetic and energy weapons, while missiles and torpedoes are classified as secondary weapons. Each weapon has its own specifications such as its rate of fire. They also inflict different damages on hulls (body of the ships) or shields (the protective energy fields surrounding the ships), or possess special effects such as shutting down specific electronic systems or propulsion.|$|E
