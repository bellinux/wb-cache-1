5|$|The {{buildings}} <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> from Hamstone, a Jurassic limestone quarried on {{the local}} Ham Hill.|$|E
5|$|Lundy has 23 holiday properties, {{sleeping}} {{between one}} and 14 people. These include a lighthouse, a castle and a Victorian mansion. Many of the buildings <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> from the island's granite.|$|E
5|$|Questions can {{be formed}} {{in several ways}} in Nafaanra. Basic yes–no {{questions}} <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> by adding a sentence-final question marker rá. Constituent questions (sometimes called Wh-questions or question word questions) are doubly marked. They contain a sentence-initial question word and are marked with a sentence-final question marker hin.|$|E
50|$|The {{hospital}} {{land was}} given to the British Malaya government in 1882 for them to construct a hospital. In 1930, the nurse dormitory <b>was</b> <b>constructed.</b> In 1935, block A and block C of the hospital <b>were</b> <b>constructed.</b> In 1939, the maternity hospital <b>was</b> <b>constructed.</b> In 1989, the central administration center blocks <b>were</b> <b>constructed.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{building}} to <b>be</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>was</b> the administration block in 1961 which housed the Jesuits before {{the construction of}} the Community House later in 1967. The next buildings to <b>be</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>were</b> the ZJC Block and Junior House. In 1967 the St. Ignatius College Chapel <b>was</b> <b>constructed.</b>|$|R
50|$|When the Victoria-class ferries <b>were</b> <b>constructed,</b> a {{total of}} seven <b>were</b> <b>constructed.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Peano axioms can be {{augmented}} {{with the}} operations of addition and multiplication and the usual total (linear) ordering on N. The respective functions and relations <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> in set theory or second-order logic, and can {{be shown to be}} unique using the Peano axioms.|$|E
5|$|The {{canons of}} page {{construction}} are {{a set of}} principles {{in the field of}} book design used to describe the ways that page proportions, margins and type areas (print spaces) of books <b>are</b> <b>constructed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The floor {{plates of}} the tower <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> from {{conventional}} reinforced concrete beams and slabs. The building's 14 passenger lifts are divided into three zones: low-rise (floors G-17), mid-rise (18–29) and high-rise (30–51), {{thought to be the}} first building in Australia to use such a configuration.|$|E
50|$|Two special {{editions of}} the first <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> with step-side beds. Both <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> by L.E.R. Industries of Edwardsburg, Michigan. The step-side beds <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> out of {{fiberglass}} and galvineel. Wooden bed rails were also available.|$|R
50|$|When the Sydney {{underground}} railways (now {{part of the}} Sydney Trains network) <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> in 1927, Wynyard {{railway station}} <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> by excavating the park and then rebuilding the park after the station had <b>been</b> <b>constructed.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to the 2001 federal census, {{approximately}} {{one out of}} ten (10%) residences in the neighbourhood <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> {{before the end of}} World War II. Two out of three residences (66.6%) <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> during the 1960s and 1970s when several apartment buildings <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> in the neighbourhood. A number of residences <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> between 1946 and 1960 (8.7%) and after 1980 (14.6%).|$|R
5|$|The {{walls and}} {{towers of the}} citadel <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> from {{carbonate}} rocks and basalt that were quarried {{in the vicinity of}} Damascus.|$|E
5|$|These {{coverings}} {{have been}} considered as a realistic model {{for the growth of}} quasicrystals: the overlapping decagons are 'quasi-unit cells' analogous to the unit cells from which crystals <b>are</b> <b>constructed,</b> and the matching rules maximize the density of certain atomic clusters.|$|E
5|$|An {{enumeration}} technique {{based on}} band generation was developed that is significantly less computationally intensive. The strategy begins {{by analyzing the}} permutations of the top band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 symmetries and equivalence class for the partial solutions are identified, the completions of the lower two bands <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> and counted for each equivalence class.|$|E
5000|$|The Parish of San Juan Bautista <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> in 1648. The Temple of the Holy Family <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> in 1841 in Neoclassical style. The Parish of Sangre de Cristo <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> at the {{beginning}} of the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, a {{waterworks}} <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> using May Pond. Presumably {{sewage disposal}} <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> concurrently.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Wollongong {{railway station}} (Platform 2) <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> in 1887. The Platform 2 refreshment room, {{which is still}} in use today, <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> in 1890. The Platform 1 station and refreshment room <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> in 1923 and 1926 respectively.|$|R
5|$|Anabolism is {{the set of}} {{constructive}} metabolic processes {{where the}} energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. First, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} {{walls are}} used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.|$|E
5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{are currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead blast furnaces <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> using water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, {{and have no}} refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.|$|E
50|$|The sub-choir <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> in the 16th century, {{resulting}} in {{the removal of the}} frontispiece. At the same time, the narthex <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> to replace the primitive structure constructed in the 15th century. In 1630, the main altarpiece <b>was</b> <b>constructed.</b>|$|R
50|$|While a small {{percentage}} (6.1%) of residences in Forest Heights <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> {{before the end of}} World War II, approximately half (51.1%) <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> between {{the end of the war}} and 1960 according to the 2001 federal census. One in four (24.6%) <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> during the 1960s and one in ten (10.2%) <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> during the 1970s. By 1980, residential construction in the neighbourhood was substantially complete.|$|R
50|$|The Sheikh Mohammad Younas {{auditorium}} <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> in 1994. Jamia Masjid in the College <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> in 1997.|$|R
5|$|Except for {{the iron}} or steel {{included}} in the bridges and the water tower, the structures are built in brick or stone. The stone is almost invariably red sandstone, obtained from local quarries in the Runcorn, Weston, and Halton areas. Unless stated otherwise, the buildings (except the bridges and the water tower) <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> in local red sandstone with slate roofs. Their locations {{can be found on}} the map of all coordinates.|$|E
5|$|In general, teleosts {{tend to be}} {{quicker and}} more {{flexible}} than more basal bony fishes. Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness. While teleost bones are well calcified, they <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> from a scaffolding of struts, rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean fish. In addition, the lower jaw of the teleost is reduced to just three bones; the dentary, the angular bone and the articular bone.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for Hasidic Jews to place kvitelach on the gravesite of a Rebbe or tzadik {{with the belief that}} the soul of the deceased will pray for them in Heaven. The visitor usually sits beside the grave to write his kvitel and meditate on his request, and then tears the kvitel and throws it on top of the grave. Many graves of Jewish holy men <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> with special apertures for the insertion of kvitelach.|$|E
50|$|Residential {{development}} in Allendale commenced {{prior to the}} end of World War II. Approximately one residence in eleven (9%) <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> at this time according to the 2001 federal census. Approximate half the residences in the neighbourhood (48.1%) <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> between the end of World War II and 1960. One in three (34.6%) of residences <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> during the 1960s and 1970s. A small number of residences <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> after 1980.|$|R
50|$|Two {{substantial}} two storeyed buildings <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> on the Maryborough hospital site as accommodation for nurses. The first, facing Walker Street, <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> in 1928, {{but after}} only ten years was converted to private wards and another nurses' quarters <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> facing Yaralla Street.|$|R
25|$|Many {{buildings}} were built for administrative purposes. In the quarters called Dar-ul-Amarat government offices and houses for {{the residence of}} officers were provided. Buildings known as Diwans <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> for the keeping of official records. Buildings known as Bait-ul-Mal <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> to house royal treasuries. For the lodging of persons suffering sentences as punishment, Jails <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> {{for the first time}} in Muslim history. In important cities Guest Houses <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> to serve as rest houses for traders and merchants coming from far away places. Roads and bridges <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> for public use. On the road from Medina to Mecca, shelters, wells, and meal houses <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> at every stage for the ease of the people who came for hajj.|$|R
5|$|Land was {{purchased}} by the local council in 1951 for a memorial hall to commemorate those {{who served in the}} two world wars. Built largely using volunteer labour and working bees, the hall opened on 9 December 1953. The buildings in Whitemore <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> either side of the only road through the town. The town section of this road was sealed in 1953.|$|E
5|$|New {{properties}} {{have also}} been introduced, including temporary properties which <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> by the Rig unit (formerly known as the APC). Temporary properties cannot build new units like other properties can, but can only be used as stationary resupply bases providing some defensive cover for units, and can be captured. Each Rig unit can construct one of two temporary properties, the Temporary Port and Temporary Airport. Additionally, the new Radar property has been added; when captured it clears a five-tile radius of Fog of War.|$|E
5|$|The Academy traces {{its roots}} to 1801, when President Thomas Jefferson directed, {{shortly after his}} inauguration, that plans be set in motion to {{establish}} the United States Military Academy at West Point. The entire central campus is a national landmark and home to scores of historic sites, buildings, and monuments. The majority of the campus's Norman-style buildings <b>are</b> <b>constructed</b> from gray and black granite. The campus is a popular tourist destination complete with a large visitor center and the oldest museum in the United States Army.|$|E
50|$|Their Oranienburg plant, 15 mi {{northeast}} of Berlin, <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> in 1926, and their Auer-Glaswerke <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> in 1938.|$|R
50|$|Residential {{development}} of the neighbourhood, according to the 2001 federal census, commenced during the 1970s when just under one half (46.4%) of the residences <b>were</b> <b>constructed.</b> Another three in ten (28.7) <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> during the 1980s. Most of the remaining residences <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> during the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of residential {{construction in the}} neighbourhood occurred during the 1970s when approximately three {{out of every five}} (62.4%) residences <b>were</b> <b>constructed.</b> Most of the remaining residences (26.2%) <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> during the 1980s with one out of every ten residences (8.2%) <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> during the 1990s.|$|R
