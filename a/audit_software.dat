50|$|The {{introduction}} {{of computer technology}} into accounting systems changed the way data was stored, retrieved and controlled. It is believed that the first use of a computerized accounting system was at General Electric in 1954. During the time period of 1954 to the mid-1960s, the auditing profession was still auditing around the computer. At this time only mainframe computers were used and few people had the skills and abilities to program computers. This began {{to change in the}} mid-1960s with the {{introduction of}} new, smaller and less expensive machines. This increased the use of computers in businesses and with it came the need for auditors to become familiar with EDP concepts in business. Along with the increase in computer use, came the rise of different types of accounting systems. The industry soon realized that they needed to develop their own software and the first of the generalized <b>audit</b> <b>software</b> (GAS) was developed. In 1968, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) had the Big Eight (now the Big Four) accounting firms participate in the development of EDP auditing. The result of this was the release of Auditing & EDP. The book included how to document EDP audits and examples of how to process internal control reviews.|$|E
50|$|In most {{developed}} countries, {{there are}} no or very limited apparent losses. For developing countries the World Bank has estimated that, on average, apparent losses - in particular theft through illegal connections - account for about 40% of NRW. In some cities, apparent losses can be higher than real losses. Reducing apparent losses from illegal connections is often beyond what a utility can achieve by itself, because it requires {{a high level of}} political support. Illegal connections are often in slums, which means that their regularization in some cases particularly affects the poor. A water audit is a key tool to assess the breakdown of NRW and to develop a program for NRW reduction. Often a distinction is made between unvalidated and validated water audits. Unvalidated water audits are desktop studies that include many estimates and their results can have an error range for real losses of +/- 50% or more. Its main value is to identify where it is necessary to reduce the uncertainty of the water audit through validation. Validating water audits is a complex process that involves testing of production water meters, testing of a representative random sample of customer meters, eliminating systematic errors created through the billing process and validating the number of illegal connections through aerial mapping, field surveys or cross-references between various existing databases. In developing countries it is rare to find utilities that have undertaken validated water audits, and even in developed countries they are not systematically used. The American Water Works Association (AWWA) has developed Water <b>Audit</b> <b>Software</b> which allows utilities to rate the overall degree of validity of their water audit data. Guidance on loss control planning is given based upon the credibility of the data and the measure of losses displayed by the water audit.|$|E

Even less research has been done on the students' perspective of the benefits of the introduction of such software. To offset this shortcoming, the third-year computer-auditing students at the University of Pretoria were requested to complete a questionnaire.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{perception}} of compliance personnel over audit technology tools implementation in Nigeria. The study provides an empirical analysis of input supplied by a sample of 173 professional auditors across 67 companies from 5 major sectors of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Subjects were tested of their perception on the application of audit technology tools in automated controls monitoring of financial transactions processing and assurance reporting. Although audit technology tools have been accessible for over a decade, the outcome of the study suggested that internal auditors and audit departments in Nigerian companies are not making substantial use of available tools. Internal auditors mostly have adopted <b>audit</b> <b>software</b> on an ad hoc basis with some repetitive use. In addition, most internal audit departments and units do not have formal strategies and plans for integrating technology in their internal audit processes with the exclusion of the financial services sector. The study also discovered that the most significant factors inhibiting the use of technology tools in other sectors were <b>audit</b> <b>software</b> inaccessibility and training costs alongside lack of senior management support from additional comments obtained from survey instrument. Respondents relatively share inconsistent views about the applicability and reliance on the underlying tools...|$|E
