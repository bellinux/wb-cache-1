5|$|Chalcogens have diverse fluorides: {{unstable}} difluorides {{have been}} reported for oxygen (the only known compound with oxygen in an oxidation state of +2), sulfur, and selenium; tetrafluorides and hexafluorides exist for sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. The latter are stabilized by more fluorine <b>atoms</b> <b>and</b> lighter central atoms, so sulfur hexafluoride is especially inert. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine can each form mono-, tri-, and pentafluorides, but only iodine heptafluoride has been characterized among possible interhalogen heptafluorides.

40|$|The Casimir-Polder {{potential}} for interaction between an excited <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> a ground-state {{one in the}} retarded case obtained {{with the help of}} perturbation technique drops as R^- 2 with the distance between the atoms [E. A. Power, T. Thirunamachandran, Phys. Rev. A, 47, 2539 (1993) ]. It results in diverdent integrals for interaction between an excited <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> a dilute gas medium. We investigate interaction between two atoms embedded in a dielectric medium with the help of non-perturbative approach. We take into account absorption of photons in the medium. This approach solves the problem of divergence. We consider interaction between an excited <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> a planar dielectric gas medium of ground-state atoms. We show that the retarded interaction between an excited <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> a gas of ground-state atoms is not oscillating but follows a simple power law. We show that to obtain coventional non-retarded expression for the van der Waals force between an excited <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> a dilute gas the distance between the <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> the interface should be much smaller than the free mean pass of a photon in the medium.

40|$|In this paper, {{we use a}} {{continuum}} approach together with the Lennard-Jones potential to determine the potential energy for an <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> a C 60 fullerene interacting with a single-layer graphene sheet. We also consider the interactions involving double-layer graphene structures. In order to explore {{the possibility of using}} double-layer graphene structures as a nano-carrier for targeted drug delivery, we investigate the molecular insertion of a carbon <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> a C 60 molecule into the space between the graphene layers. We find that an <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> the outer surface of the fullerene prefer to be approximately 3. 4 and 2. 95 ˚A away from a single-layer graphene, which is consistent with the literature. Further, we find that the minimum distances between the two layers of the graphene structure for an <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> a C 60 molecule to be accepted into the interspace are 6. 2 and 12. 2 ˚A, respectively. However, we find that when the distances between the layers equal to 6. 8 and 13 ˚A for the <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> the C 60 molecule, respectively, the total interaction energy is minimum and therefore the system is most stable. When the inter-layer distance is greater than 6. 8 and 13 ˚A for the <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> the fullerene C 60, even though the <b>atom</b> <b>and</b> the fullerene C 60 will be accepted into the inter-layer spacing, the system is not stable as the energy is higher.

5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas.

5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of <b>atoms</b> <b>and</b> their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E
