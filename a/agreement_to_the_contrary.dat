Recently, in Tasini v. New York Times, freelance authors claimed that the publishing industry allegedly infringed their copyrights in the underlying works of authorship. In absence of express <b>agreements</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> <b>the</b> authors maintained that section 201 (c) of the Copyright Act gives the publishers only the limited privilege of publishing an article as part of a 2 ̆ 2 particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series 2 ̆ 2 and that republication in electronic media does not fit within this definition. Publishers disagree and seek a more liberal interpretation of section 201 (c). This Note examines the existing bases for interpreting the section 201 (c) revision privilege with respect to electronic media, including the Act 2 ̆ 7 s plain language, legislative intent, and broader issues of public policy. This Note ultimately agrees with the Second Circuit Court of Appeal 2 ̆ 7 s reversal in Tasini, which held that that revision privilege does not include the unauthorized republication in certain electronic media (including NEXIS) and suggests a comprehensive analysis that supports the Copyright Act and the U.

40|$|Article 73 (3) of LOSC {{emphasizes}} that “Coastal State penalties {{for violations of}} fisheries laws and regulations in the exclusive economic zone may not include imprisonment, in <b>the</b> absence of <b>agreements</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> by <b>the</b> States concerned, or {{any other form of}} corporal punishment. ” Article 93 of the Indonesian Fisheries Act Nomor 31 2004 as revised by the Act Nomor 45 2009, however, imposes imprisonment for IUU fishing committed in the Indonesian EEZ. It can be seen that there is a clear contradiction in provisions between Article 93 of the Act Nomor 31 2004 and Article 73 (3) of the LOSC. On the other side, Indonesia is a state party of this convention and has ratified the convention. Thus, Indonesia should comply with the provisions in the LOSC. The question is has Indonesia exercised its sovereignty over the EEZ? This paper argues that the implementation of imprisonment in Indonesian EEZ contradicts both Indonesian laws and international law of the sea. Key words: imprisonment, EEZ, sovereignty and sovereign right...|$|R

Instead, the authors of these cinematographic works were the natural persons identified in the 1993 law as such. The decree explicitly declared that these authors were entitled to receive royalties for uses of these films (broadcast, whether by cable or wireless, reproduction, distribution (including rental), and showing to the public) and defined a remuneration schedule expressed in percentages of the income generated {{by the use of}} the works. The decree also clarified that the copyright on such Soviet films was subject to the rules of the 1993 law: the authors were the initial rights holders, and there was a presumption of a transfer of rights to the studios unless there existed an <b>agreement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> (See also [...] "Subjects of copyright" [...] above.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{specific}} contracts, such {{as those}} for sales of goods, between a landlord and tenant, or in employment, the courts imply standardised contractual terms (or terms [...] "implied in law"). Such terms set out a menu of [...] "default rules" [...] that generally apply in absence of true <b>agreement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> In one instance of partial codification, the Sale of Goods Act 1893 summed up all the standard contractual provisions in typical commercial sales agreements developed by the common law. This is now updated in the Sale of Goods Act 1979, and in default of people agreeing something different in general its terms will apply. For instance, under section 12-14, any contract for sale of goods carries the implied terms that the seller has legal title, that it will match prior descriptions {{and that it is}} of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose. Similarly the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 section 13 says services must be performed with reasonable care and skill. As a matter of common law the test is what terms are a [...] "necessary incident" [...] to the specific type of contract in question. This test derives from Liverpool City Council v Irwin where the House of Lords held that, although fulfilled on the facts of the case, a landlord owes a duty to tenants in a block of flats to keep the common parts in reasonable repair. In employment contracts, multiple standardised implied terms arise also, even before statute comes into play, for instance to give employees adequate information to make a judgment about how to take advantage of their pension entitlements. The primary standardised employment term is that both employer and worker owe one another an obligation of [...] "mutual trust and confidence". Mutual trust and confidence can be undermined in multiple ways, primarily where an employer's repulsive conduct means a worker can treat herself as being constructively dismissed. In Mahmud and Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA the House of Lords held the duty was breached by the employer running the business as a cover for numerous illegal activities. The House of Lords has repeated that the term may always be excluded, but this has been disputed because unlike a contract for goods or services among commercial parties, an employment relation is characterised by unequal bargaining power between employer and worker. In Johnstone v Bloomsbury Health Authority the Court of Appeal all held that a junior doctor could not be made to work at an average of 88 hours a week, even though this was an express term of his contract, where it would damage his health. However, one judge said that result followed from application of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, one judge said it was because at common law express terms could be construed in the light of implied terms, and one judge said implied terms may override express terms. Even in employment, or in consumer affairs, English courts remain divided {{about the extent to which}} they should depart from the basic paradigm of contractual freedom, that is, in absence of legislation.|$|E

Article 2 stated the convention shall also apply to waterways for which international commissions have been established. Article 3 obligated governments to allow free movement for in its waterways to vessels of any state whose government signed the convention. Article 4 required equal treatment for all nationalities in applying the freedom of navigation. Article 5 allowed some exceptions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> principles of freedom of navigation if a government chose to give priority to its own nationals in certain cases, conditional on {{the absence of any}} <b>agreements</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> Article 6 allowed governments to apply their rule of law in waterways under their control. Article 7 prohibited governments to levy any dues for passage in international waterways under their control, except for minimal dues necessary for the maintenance of the said above waterways. Article 8 prohibited governments from levying customs for goods passing through their territories, and stated that the principles of the Barcelona Convention and Statute on Freedom of Transit shall also apply to maritime navigation. Article 9 obligated governments to grant equal treatment to all foreign nationals in using their ports, with some exceptions. Article 10 obligated the governments controlling waterways to maintain them regularly to allow smooth navigation.|$|R
40|$|Lawrence Cunningham {{has written}} an {{insightful}} and persuasive article calling on courts <b>to</b> apply <b>the</b> contract-law doctrine of unconscionability in evaluating executive compensation. According to Cunningham, this additional doctrinal tool will allow courts {{to engage in}} genuine and meaningful oversight of excessive compensation. He argues that such oversight is valuable because existing corporate-law doctrine too often prompts courts to defer too much and too often to management’s decisions. Cunningham’s argument is modest yet impactful. It is modest in that it simply proposes that courts take account of a well-established area of contract law to analyze and evaluate the compensation contracts of corporate executives. It is impactful in that, as he points out, courts applying the doctrine of unconscionability will find that sometimes, some compensation contracts will be set aside. Perhaps courts will only find the worst of these contracts unconscionable. But {{that is more than}} zero, the number we can expect courts will find offensive to corporate-law norms as presently understood and adjudicated. This Essay will put Cunningham’s argument {{in the context of the}} larger debate over the dominant metaphors of corporate law. One way <b>to</b> tell <b>the</b> intellectual history of corporate law is to describe a battle between those who believe the dominant metaphor for the field is contract and those who believe it is property. In the contract metaphor, duties derive from voluntary agreements between and among parties to a deal. In the property metaphor, duties flow from status or rights, despite the absence of agreements or <b>the</b> existence of <b>agreements</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> One might think that Cunningham’s article fits squarely within the contract metaphor—he is, after all, calling on courts to use contract-law doctrine to evaluate corporatelaw questions. In my view, however, Cunningham’s argument fits within the larger movement away from the simplistic contractarian norms that have dominated the corporate-law field for the last generation. Cunningham’s argument in favor of contract doctrine is, in fact, best viewed as a celebration of property-law principles. Ironically, Cunningham’s article, arguing for an analysis based in contract law, is yet another attack on the dominance of contract reasoning in the theory and doctrine of corporate law...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{released}} on 16 February 2016 to assist participants in preparing a submission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public inquiry into Marine Fisheries and Aquaculture. It outlines {{a range of issues}} about which the Commission is seeking information. Initial submissions are due by Thursday 31 March 2016. Opportunity for further comment will be sought upon release of the draft report in mid August 2016. Background Commonwealth, State and Territory governments are responsible for the management of Australian fisheries within their respective jurisdictions. Regulations are used to implement controls, such as limits on catch or effort levels, and regulate fishing methods in order to manage Australia 2 ̆ 7 s fisheries in a way that meets social and economic considerations and ecological sustainability objectives. Except where <b>agreement</b> is reached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> state/territory laws apply to coastal waters (up to three nautical miles) and Commonwealth laws apply from those waters out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> limit of the Australian fishing zone (200 nautical miles). As most recreational and traditional Indigenous fishing activity occurs in waters within state/territory jurisdiction, state/territory administrations generally manage these forms of fishing activity. As a result, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s commercial fisheries are governed by a total of eight jurisdictions (the Commonwealth, states and the Northern Territory), with each jurisdiction developing specific regimes for fisheries management, fisheries research, reporting and environmental protection. In addition, there are 59 separate arrangements under the Offshore Constitutional Settlement that determine how cross-jurisdictional stocks are to be managed. There are also four joint fisheries authorities. This regulatory environment oversees an industry that has a gross value of production of 1. 3 billion per annum. It is also an industry that {{has been the subject of}} a large number of recent inquiries and reviews at many levels. While Australia 2 ̆ 7 s fisheries are regarded as sustainable, reliable and safe, there is scope <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> management of fisheries through effective and coordinated regulatory and management arrangements. This includes the streamlining of regulations, rationalising jurisdictional and offshore constitutional settlement arrangements through improved cross jurisdiction and multi-jurisdictional regulatory regimes, information and service sharing, and harmonisation of environmental, management and compliance arrangements. While aquaculture is within scope, it was the subject of a Productivity Commission research paper in 2004 which examined existing planning and environmental regulatory arrangements. The Commission should use the findings of this research as a basis to inform its current inquiry rather than commencing a new investigation into issues impacting the aquaculture sector...|$|R
