2500|$|The yellow-headed amazon (<b>Amazona</b> <b>oratrix),</b> {{also known}} as the yellow-headed parrot and double yellow-headed amazon, is an {{endangered}} amazon parrot of Mexico and northern Central America. Measuring [...] in length, it is a stocky short-tailed green parrot with a yellow head. It prefers to live in mangrove forests or forests near rivers or other bodies of water. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the yellow-crowned amazon. It is a popular pet and an excellent talker.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A 9 -year-old male Yellow-headed Amazon (<b>Amazona</b> <b>oratrix)</b> with {{a history}} of {{anorexia}} and vomiting died of a liver tumor. The tumor consisted of neoplastic cells with hepatocellular and cholangiocellular differentiations and their intermingled areas. Neoplastic hepatocytes showed islands or trabecular growth with vacuolated eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cells showing biliary differentiation formed ducts or tubules lined by cytokeratin AE 1 /AE 3 -positive epithelia, accompanied by desmoplasia consisting of myofibroblasts reacting to α-smooth muscle actin and desmin. The tumor was diagnosed as a combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, which is very rare in the avian...|$|R

Macroscopic and microscopic examinations revealed multifocal necrosis in liver, spleen, lungs, kidney, gut and heart caused by acute bacteremia. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, serogroup O: 1 a, was isolated from the visceral lesions. Virulence gene analysis showed the presence of inv gene and the complete pathogenicity island: IS 100, psn, yptE, irp 1, irp 2 ybtP-ybtQ, ybtX-ybtS, int asnT-Int. Histopathological findings and chemical analysis also reflected an excess of iron accumulation in liver. The relation between iron accumulation and systemic Pseudotuberculosis has been demonstrated in human medicine and in other species of birds. This work highlights also this relationship in Amazon Parrots...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Necropsies were {{conducted}} on a female blue-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva) and a female yellow-headed Amazon (<b>Amazona</b> <b>oratrix)</b> that died following depression, ruffled feathers, diarrhea and biliverdin in the urine. Gross and microscopic examinations revealed multifocal necrosis in the liver, spleen, lungs, kidney, intestine and heart caused by acute bacteremia. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, serogroup O: 1 a, was isolated by culturing from the visceral lesions in the liver, intestine and spleen. Virulence gene analysis showed {{the presence of the}} inv gene and the complete pathogenicity island: IS 100, psn, yptE, irp 1, irp 2 ybtP-ybtQ, ybtX-ybtS, int asnT-Int. Histopathologic findings and chemical analysis also demonstrated hepatic hemosiderosis. As has been demonstrated in other species, we suggest that hemosiderosis may also predispose Amazona spp. to systemic infection with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis following enteric disease...|$|R
40|$|We {{recorded}} 12 exotic {{bird species}} in San Luis Potosi, Mexico and adjacent areas. Obtained {{data were collected}} during the period August 2012 to August 2013. From the total of recorded species, eight are confirmations (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus, Cairina moschata, Bubulcus ibis, Columba livia, Sturnus vulgaris, Turdus rufopalliatus, Quiscalus mexicanus and Passer domesticus) and four are new records (Aratinga canicularis, <b>Amazona</b> <b>oratrix,</b> A. autumnalis and Cyanocorax yncas). Although not all exotic species represent a risk {{because of the lack}} of the necessary resources for the establishment of abundant viable populations, it is important to publicize their status in the region. Therefore, knowing the presence of exotic species in a new distribution area is important for monitoring its establishment and colonization, and defining management, control and eradication programs of these species, along with environmental education programs that would lead to a better understanding of impacts that these species can cause...|$|R
40|$|The parrot family {{represents}} one of the bird group with the largest number of endangered species, as a result of habitat destruction and illegal trade. This illicit traffic involves the smuggling of eggs and animals, and the laundering through captive breeding facilities of wild-caught animals. Despite the huge potential of wildlife DNA forensics to determine with conclusive evidence illegal trade, current usage of DNA profiling approaches in parrots has been limited by the lack of suitable molecular markers specifically developed for the focal species and by low cross-species polymorphism. In this study, we isolated DNA microsatellite markers in seven parrot species threatened with extinction (<b>Amazona</b> brasiliensis, A. <b>oratrix,</b> A. pretrei, A. rhodocorytha, Anodorhynchus leari, Ara rubrogenys and Primolius couloni). From an enriched genomic library followed by 454 pyrosequencing, we characterized a total of 106 polymorphic microsatellite markers (mostly tetranucleotides) in the seven species and tested them across an average number of 19 individuals per species. The mean number of alleles per species and across loci varied from 6. 4 to 8. 3, with the mean observed heterozygosities ranging from 0. 65 to 0. 84. Identity and parentage exclusion probabilities were highly discriminatory. The high variability displayed by these microsatellite loci demonstrates their potential utility to perform individual genotyping and parentage analyses, in order to develop a DNA testing framework to determine illegal traffic in these threatened species...|$|R
