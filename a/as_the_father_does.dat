60|$|The {{discontinuance}} of out-door {{relief to}} help out the wages was a great shock at first, but, when the ratepayers were no longer weighed down, they could give more work and better wages, and the labourers thus profited in the end, and likewise began to learn more independence.

Few families could get on unless <b>the</b> mother <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>did</b> field work, and thus she {{had no time to}} attend thoroughly to making home comfortable, mending the clothes, or taking care of the little ones.

I wrote several sonnets in praise of her, and spent half of my pocket-money at the shop, in buying articles which I did not want, that I might have an opportunity of speaking to her. Her father, a severe-looking old gentleman, with bright silver buckles and a crisp, curled wig, kept a strict guard on her; <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> generally <b>do</b> upon their daughters in Oxford; and well they may. I tried to get into his good graces, and to be sociable with him; but in vain. I said several good things in his shop, but he never laughed; he had no relish for wit and humor. He was one of those dry old gentlemen who keep youngsters at bay. He had already brought up two or three daughters, and was experienced in the ways of students.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Early {{childhood}} education and development has an interesting history {{dating back to}} the early philosophers, psychologists and sociologists. In Greece, philosophers like Socrates, Plato and Aristotle were involved in the education of the child. In Switzerland Pestalozzi did the same. In German Friedrich Froebel who is regarded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> of preschool <b>did</b> <b>the</b> same. However, in Southern Africa the field of early {{childhood education}} is relatively new compared to old established fields of education. The staff in this field is also relatively new. This has resulted in lecturers facing challenges of quality education and quality research output. This paper is a review and thus it articulates experiential in the field of education. We have used documentation and experience {{to come up with the}} arguments set and finally conclusion. This paper begins by explaining the concept of quality assurance and goes on to describe the quality in research and innovative projects as a tool for quality development in Early Childhood Education. It reveals that quality in early childhood depends on quality in our universities...|$|R

50|$|Research by {{prominent}} Libyan dissident {{and historian}} Mohamed Al-Magariaf, also questions Gaddafi's roots. Magariaf extensively researched the rumors of Gaddafi's birth, and added two facets to the debate. Magariaf did {{not focus on}} identifying Preziosi <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>father,</b> although he <b>did</b> acknowledge that the rumors that Gaddafi was born to a non-Libyan father could be true. He wrote that an Italian cardinal who was in Libya {{at the time of}} Gaddafi's birth had knowledge of his biological father. Magariaf wrote that in 1972, a Gaddafi colleagues named el-Meheshi, {{who was in charge of}} the Revolutionary Command Council, received a letter from an Italian cardinal who was working in Libya at the time of Gaddafi's birth. The letter was in Italian, which el-Meheshi could not read, so he asked the Libyan ambassador of external affairs, Khalefa Almuntasir, to translate it. Magariaf questioned Almuntasir about the letter, which he confirmed existed and said that it was from a cardinal reminding Gadhafi of his Jewish and Christian blood. Almuntasir believed that the cardinal was reminding Gaddafi of his religious roots after hearing of the brutality of the Gaddafi regime.|$|R
6000|$|For a {{while they}} had been lords of all England. The Anglo-Saxon race was wearing out. The men of Wessex, priest-ridden, and enslaved by their own aristocracy, quailed before the free Norsemen, among whom {{was not a single}} serf. The God-descended line of Cerdic and Alfred was worn out. Vain, incapable, profligate kings, the tools of such prelates as Odo and Dunstan, were no match for such wild heroes <b>as</b> Thorkill <b>the</b> tall, or Olaf Trygvasson, or Swend Forkbeard. The Danes had {{gradually}} colonized, not only their own Danelagh and Northumbria, but great part of Wessex. Vast sums of Danegelt were yearly sent out of the country to buy off the fresh invasions which were perpetually threatened. Then Ethelred the Unready, Ethelred Evil-counsel, advised himself to fulfil his name, and the curse which Dunstan had pronounced against him at the baptismal font. By his counsel the men of Wessex rose against the unsuspecting Danes, and on St. Brice's eve, A. D. 1002, murdered them all with tortures, man, woman, and child. It may be that they only did to <b>the</b> children <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> had <b>done</b> to them: but the deed was [...] "worse than a crime; it was a mistake." [...] The Danes of the Danelagh and of Northumbria, their brothers of Denmark and Norway, the Orkneys and the east coast of Ireland, remained unharmed. A mighty host of Vikings poured from thence into England the very next year, under Swend Forkbeard and the great Canute; and after thirteen fearful campaigns came the great battle of Assingdown in Essex, where [...] "Canute had the victory; and all the English nation fought against him, and all the nobility of the English race was there destroyed." ...|$|R
2500|$|Roman Catholics were {{specifically}} {{targeted by}} these acts, {{and many of}} them went underground. Some Christians who had hoped for a more Protestant Reformation within the Established Church chose to emigrate, especially to <b>the</b> American colonies, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Pilgrim <b>Fathers</b> had <b>done</b> in 1620. [...] Others maintained their faith openly, and lived with the restrictions the state placed upon them, moving to areas where they were tolerated. Often they set up educational establishments, known in general as dissenting academies, which were intellectually and morally more rigorous than the universities. One such was at Newington Green, then an agricultural village a few miles from London, but now within Inner London. Unitarianism or Rational Dissent– [...] "that intellectual aristocracy in the ranks of Dissent, as historians often characterise it"– had an obvious affinity with education, critical enquiry, and challenges to the status quo, and is [...] "one of the roots of modern English Culture". A critical mass of such people, including [...] "dissident intellectuals, pedagogues with reforming ideas and Dissenters" [...] and [...] "the well-to-do edge of radical Protestantism" [...] clustered around Newington Green. Not all of these free-thinkers were Unitarians, such as Quaker John Coakley Lettsome (physician, philanthropist, and abolitionist) or the Anglicans Vicesimus Knox (pacifist and writer) and George Gaskin (minister and long-time secretary of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge), but most had some connections to the chapel on the green.|$|R
50|$|Karisalkulam, a small village, is {{inhabited}} {{mainly by}} Farmers. When the arid land offers them nothing but penury, enter the match factory owners from nearby villages. They lure the credulous, illiterate villagers into sending their daughters {{to work at}} the factories from dawn to much after dusk. The initial euphoria of a steady income givesway to despair, as is clearly brought out through the story of Nallamuthu (Nasser), his wife Vadivu (Radhika) and their three children. Mariyappan (Charle) is the Match factory agent in charge of finding child labourers for the factory. While the children slog in the factories the men of the household become lazy appendages who spend their time getting drunk. Nasser, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> cynical <b>father,</b> who <b>does</b> not wish to get his daughter married because {{he does not want to}} forgo the income, has rendered a splendid performance in Karuvelam Pookal. Mention must be made of the scenes in which he cries aloud at his tragedies and when his impotent anger is turned towards the agents of the match factories. Radhika's is another sterling portrayal. In the role of a responsible mother caught between her husband's apathy and avarice and her children's untold suffering, she indeed lives the character. Sonia is the eldest daughter, Dhanalakshmi. Caught in the quagmire of drudgery and in the strangulating web of poverty, she seeks a way out, but sadly the respite is too short lived. A convincing essay by the young Actress. The visuals of the opening sequences transport you to the days of Bharatiraja's movie 16 Vayadhinilae. The beautifully captured rustic ambience is another creditable show by Thangar Bachan who has wielded the camera. The dialect, the innocent humour, the openness and the gullibility - Poomani presents them all with absolute vividness.The factories need only young girls and the boys therefore escape the hardship. After stressing on this point throughout, it is strange to see the boy accompany his sister to work, in the end. The fragrance of Karuvelam Pookkal is bound to last in the minds of the discerning audience. A film that makes you think.|$|R
