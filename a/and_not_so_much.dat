25|$|An {{important}} part of Scouting education is the personal example of the leader. The Scout is impressed by the leader because of his age, his knowledge, and his position as a leader.

25|$|This problem however was {{resolved}} {{with the use}} of so-called self-polishing paints, in which the biocide was released at a slower rate as the seawater reacted with the surface layer of the paint. More recently, copper-based anti-fouling paints have been used because they are less toxic than TBT in aquatic environment, but are only effective against marine animal life, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> weed growth. Non-stick coatings contain no biocide, but have extremely slippery surfaces which prevents most fouling and makes it easier to clean the little fouling that does occur. Natural biocides are found on marine organisms such as coral and sponges and also prevent fouling if applied to a vessel. Creating a difference in electrical charge between the hull and sea water is a common practice in the prevention of fouling. This technology has proven to be effective, but is easily damaged and can be expensive. Finally, microscopic prickles can be added to a coating, and depending on length and distribution have shown the ability to prevent the attachment of most biofouling.|$|E

[...] Many Muslims said their anti-cartoon stance is against insulting pictures <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as against pictures in general. According to the BBC, [...] "It is the satirical intent of the cartoonists and the association of the Prophet with terrorism, that is so offensive to the vast majority of Muslims."

2500|$|In {{orthopedic}} surgery, PMMA {{bone cement}} {{is used to}} affix implants and to remodel lost bone. It is supplied as a powder with liquid methyl methacrylate (MMA). Although PMMA is biologically compatible, MMA {{is considered to be}} an irritant and a possible carcinogen. PMMA has also been linked to cardiopulmonary events in the operating room due to hypotension. Bone cement acts like a grout <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> like a glue in arthroplasty. Although sticky, it does not bond to either the bone or the implant, it primarily fills the spaces between the prosthesis and the bone preventing motion. A disadvantage of this bone cement is that it heats up to [...] while setting that may cause thermal necrosis of neighboring tissue. A careful balance of initiators and monomers is needed to reduce the rate of polymerization, and thus the heat generated. A major consideration when using PMMA cement is the effect of stress shielding. Since PMMA has a Young's modulus between 1.8 and 3.1 GPa, which is lower than that of natural bone (around 14 GPa for human cortical bone), the stresses are loaded into the cement and so the bone no longer receives the mechanical signals to continue bone remodeling and so resorption will occur.|$|E

2500|$|TouchArcade {{noted that}} VA-11 HALL-A {{also has a}} more [...] "salacious side", due to the {{presence}} of sexually suggestive character interactions that was present in the game's demo.

[...] In another interview between Christopher Oritz and Kill Screen, Ortiz remarked how [...] "this game is all about exploring what's up with the characters that you always see in the background who are never fleshed out [...] ", and due to this, the characters were designed to be average non-heroes; Jill, for example, was described by Ortiz as the cliche [...] "bartender who’s always there in the background" [...] as opposed to a [...] "hero" [...] who is always at [...] "the center of the universe, with everyone else with a supporting role." [...] Adding that [...] "you can see it as early as the premise: [...] not a hero, but the bartender", Ortiz further explains that all the game's characters, from the [...] " [...] staples like mercenaries and hackers" [...] to [...] "common folk like veterinarians, journalists, or couriers", were deliberately made to be everyday [...] "people, each with their opinion and lives", making them relatable to the player despite the futuristic setting. To help with this relatability, many of the characters and subplots in VA-11 HALL-A were based on the experiences of the developers themselves or people they know, since [...] "We want the characters to feel as real as possible, and what better reference for real things than reality itself?".|$|E
