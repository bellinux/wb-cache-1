5|$|No Country for Old Men is a 2007 American neo-Western thriller film produced, directed, written, {{and edited}} by Joel and Ethan Coen. Based on Cormac McCarthy's {{novel of the}} same name, the film is about <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>man</b> to whom chance {{delivers}} a fortune that is not his, and the ensuing cat-and-mouse drama as the paths of three men intertwine in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas. The film stars Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, and Javier Bardem, with Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, and Beth Grant in featured roles.|$|E
5|$|South Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are {{primarily}} based on myths {{much older than}} the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He {{was said to have}} helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in Demir Kapija ("Iron Gate") with a stroke of his sabre. This drained the sea covering the regions of Bitola, Mariovo and Tikveš in Macedonia, making them habitable. After the earth was shaped, Marko arrogantly showed off his strength. God took it away by leaving a bag as heavy as the earth on a road; when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his strength and became <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Belle {{is walking}} down the road, she runs into The Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), who asks her if she is running from someone. Belle admits the man she is leaving is {{overcome}} by evil yet she loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse. Belle returns to Rumpelstiltskin's castle and the Dark one asks why {{she came back to}} him. She replies that she wasn't going to return but something changed her mind. After a moment of silence between the two, they both share true love's kiss, the magic starts to turn him back into <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>man,</b> but becomes furious and shakes off the magic, accusing Belle of conspiring with The Evil Queen. Rumpelstiltskin yells in a rage that no one will love him, and The Evil Queen will never take away his power. He throws Belle in his dungeon and smashes every cup against the wall but he cannot bring himself to destroy the chipped one. Once he has cooled off, he tells Belle to leave because his powers are more important to him than she is. Belle admonishes him for not believing she can love him. She warns him that he will regret his actions when all he has is an empty heart and a chipped cup.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Nesbitt auditioned to play Adam Williams, {{the male}} lead in Cold Feet, an ITV Comedy Premiere about three couples in {{different}} stages of their romantic relationships. The audition came about through a mutual friend of Nesbitt's and the director, Declan Lowney. The producer, Christine Langan, had also recalled his performances in Hear My Song and Go Now. Adam had not been written with an Irishman in mind to play him—English writer Mike Bullen had written the character as a thinly veiled portrayal of himself in his youth—but Nesbitt {{wanted to take the}} opportunity to appear in a contemporary drama as <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>man</b> from Northern Ireland with no connection to the Troubles, especially after the Troubles-based plot of Love Lies Bleeding. Cold Feet was a critical success; it won the 1997 Golden Rose of Montreux and the 1997 British Comedy Award for Best ITV Comedy and was thus commissioned for a full series. Cold Feets first series aired at the end of 1998 and was followed by the second series in 1999. A storyline in that series featured Adam being diagnosed with testicular cancer, which inspired Nesbitt to become a patron of the charity Action Cancer. By the time of the third series, Nesbitt and the other cast members were able to influence the show's production; an episode featuring Adam's stag weekend was due to be filmed on location in Dublin but Nesbitt suggested it be filmed in Belfast and Portrush instead. Several scenes were filmed at his old workplace Barry's Amusements, although they were cut from the broadcast episode. At the end of the fourth series in 2001, Nesbitt decided to quit to move on to other projects. Executive producer Andy Harries persuaded him to stay for one more series by suggesting that Adam be killed off, so Nesbitt signed on for the fifth series. During pre-production of the fifth series, Mike Bullen decided to kill off Adam's wife Rachel (played by Helen Baxendale) instead.|$|E

500|$|Hammerstein was {{initially}} unenthusiastic, thinking {{the subject matter}} trivial, but Rodgers pressed the matter.

[...] As the two discussed the backstage idea, Hammerstein became more enthusiastic, suggesting that the show start with the stage entirely bare, as if the audience had come in not at performance time but at another time during the day. Such effects are today well-known following the success of other [...] "backstagers" [...] such as A Chorus Line; in the early 1950s they were unrealized and novel.|$|E
500|$|Even {{well after}} their marriage, some {{observers}} disapproved of the prince's decision, {{regardless of what}} he had promised beforehand.

[...] After Anne's death, the royal court tried to find a new wife for James, but this new wife was not, under any circumstances, to be of humble birth. As good a father as Pepys portrayed James to be, he strangely stated that Anne and James were unaffected by the death of their firstborn son. Pepys also described Anne as [...] "not only the proudest woman in the world, but the most expensefull." [...] Even in the minds of Anne's nephew, William III of Orange, and that of her husband's cousin, Sophia of Hanover, the stigma of the Hydes' lowly birth remained.|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{was praised}} for his {{versatility}} {{and ability to}} fully inhabit any role, but specialized in playing creeps and misfits: [...] "his CV was populated almost exclusively by snivelling wretches, insufferable prigs, braggarts and outright bullies", writes the journalist Ryan Gilbey. Hoffman was appreciated for making these roles real, complex and even sympathetic; while Todd Louiso, director of Love Liza, believed that Hoffman connected to people on screen because he looked like <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>man</b> and revealed his vulnerability. Xan Brooks of The Guardian remarked that the actor's particular talent was to [...] "take thwarted, twisted humanity and ennoble it". [...] "The more pathetic or deluded the character," [...] writes Gilbey, [...] "the greater Hoffman's relish seemed in rescuing them from the realms of the merely monstrous." [...] When asked in 2006 why he undertook such roles, Hoffman responded, [...] "I didn't go out looking for negative characters; I went out looking {{for people who have}} a struggle and a fight to tackle. That's what interests me." ...|$|E
500|$|Author and {{journalist}} Heidi Stringell finds Flagg [...] "an embodiment of pure evil", contending that King sees {{good and evil}} as “real forces”; Flagg’s embodiment of evil is confirmed {{by the fact that}} [...] "he is a killer, a maker of mischief, a liar, and a tempter". To Stringell, Flagg’s disappearance at the end of The Stand shows that “evil ultimately leads nowhere”. The author calls Flagg a [...] "generic hybrid" [...] of the archetypical [...] "Dark Man and the Trickster". To her, the combination of these two characteristics found in different cultural realms forces people to face their [...] "flawed humanity" [...] with the [...] "amorality” Flagg represents. Jenifer Paquette, author of Respecting The Stand: A Critical Analysis of Stephen King's Apocalyptic Novel, writes that [...] "Flagg's horror is that he looks like <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>man,</b> and his behavior is a mockery of humanity—a terrible insight into the human psyche. King suggests that the thing to fear the most is inside ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of his death, within South Africa Mandela was widely {{considered}} both [...] "the father of the nation" [...] and [...] "the founding father of democracy". Outside of South Africa, he was a [...] "global icon", with the scholar of South African studies Rita Barnard describing him as [...] "one of the most revered figures of our time". One biographer considered him [...] "a modern democratic hero", while his popularity resulted in a cult of personality building up around him. Some have portrayed Mandela in messianic terms, in contrast to his own statement that [...] "I was not a messiah, but <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>man</b> who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances." [...] He is often cited alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. as one of the 20th century's exemplary anti-racist and anti-colonial leaders.

500|$|Morrissey's second {{television}} role came in 1987 when {{he played}} the 18-year old chauffeur George Bowman, whose obsession with his employer and lover Alma Rattenbury (Helen Mirren) leads him to murder her husband, in an Anglia Television adaptation of Terence Rattigan's play Cause Célèbre. At {{the end of the}} 1980s, Morrissey met director John Madden for the first time. Madden was looking for an actor who could portray <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>man</b> who {{turns out to be a}} mass murderer, in his film The Widowmaker (1990). He knew Morrissey was right for the part in his first audition. The next year, Morrissey appeared as Theseus in an episode of The Storyteller directed by Madden ("Theseus and the Minotaur", 1991), and as Little John in Robin Hood (1991). Robin Hoods cinema release clashed with that of [...] (1991). The latter, starring Kevin Costner in the title role, was a box office hit and left Morrissey's version forgotten. Morrissey was out of work in film and television for eight months after it was released. Eventually, he was cast in a leading role as a CID officer in the BBC television drama Clubland (1991). He almost lost the role a week into rehearsals when his appendix ruptured. In order to keep the part, and a flat in Crouch End he had just bought, Morrissey performed while still in stitches.|$|E
500|$|Spacey {{loosely based}} Lester's early [...] "schlubby" [...] deportment on Walter Matthau. During the film, Lester's {{physique}} improves from flabby to toned; Spacey worked out during filming {{to improve his}} body, but because Mendes shot the scenes out of chronological order, Spacey varied postures to portray the stages. Before filming, Mendes and Spacey analyzed Jack Lemmon's performance in The Apartment(1960), because Mendes wanted Spacey to emulate [...] "the way [...] moved, the way he looked, {{the way he was}} in that office and the way he was <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>man</b> and yet a special man". Spacey's voiceover is a throwback to Sunset Boulevard(1950), which is also narrated in retrospect by a dead character. Mendes felt it evoked Lester's—and the film's—loneliness. Bening recalled women from her youth to inform her performance: [...] "I used to babysit constantly. You'd go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside, and then be inside their house and see the difference." [...] Bening and a hair stylist collaborated to create a [...] "PTA president coif" [...] hairstyle, and Mendes and production designer Naomi Shohan researched mail-order catalogs to better establish Carolyn's environment of a [...] "spotless suburban manor". To help Bening get into Carolyn's mindset, Mendes gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like. He lent Bening the Bobby Darin version of the song [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade", which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car.|$|E
