40|$|Routine {{application}} of <b>artificial</b> <b>frost</b> treatment needs a detailed, exact technology, which would ensure {{the reliability of}} the results obtained. Buds being on spurs loose their frost resistance sooner because of their quick development. According to these results to examine samples containing both types of buds can lead to significant mistakes. Considering our experiences it seems that a sample containing 200 buds provides the reliable correctness. Further increasing of sample size decreases the value of deviation but it is not proportional to the work needed for the experiment. The following treatments are suggested: deep dormancy phase: - 24 - - 26 °C, directly after deep dormancy:- 21 - - 24 °C. beginning of February: - 19 - - 21 °C, two weeks before blossoming - 11 - - 12 °C. two -days before blossoming: - 4 - - 6 °C...|$|E
40|$|Yield {{and quality}} of nondormant alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) may be reduced by winter frost. This study {{surveyed}} 12 populations for injury and regrowth following <b>artificial</b> <b>frost.</b> Approximately 40 plants per population were grown in a greenhouse for 70 d in styrofoam flats for each of 2 treatments (control and frost) with 4 replications. At 70 d of age, plants were clipped to 4 cm, regrown for 14 d, exposed to 5 °C for 5 d to harden, and then exposed to - 3 °C for 6 - 8 h. After 2 - 3 d plants were scored for damage, stem height and stem number. Measurements were repeated weekly for 21 d, including a final damage score. Simulated selection comparing index selection and direct selection demonstrated positive response to selection in all populations analyzed. Selection for growth rate ratio resulted in reduced damage score, while selection for reduced damage did not improve growth rate ratio. Index selection improved both traits. Results indicate that response following frost in alfalfa may be improved...|$|E
40|$|English title: Investigation of {{moisture}} transfer and frost heave of composite geofoam under frost conditionA laboratory study {{was carried out}} to investigate the heat-moisture transfer and frost heave characteristics of a composite geofoam under <b>artificial</b> <b>frost</b> action. The geofoam was composed of expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads, waste foundry sand, water and cement in proportions. Thermal gradients were loaded through the geofoam by maintaining the temperature of - 5 ⁰C, - 10 ⁰C or - 15 ⁰C {{at the top and}} 10 ⁰C at the bottom of cylindrical samples. Test results showed that, with the increase of EPS beads, the thermo-physical properties of the geofoam were favorably improved, i. e., thermal resistance increased, freezing rate and depth decreased. The addition of EPS bead also led to the reduction of frost heave, which helped mitigate freeze-thaw impact on the geofoam. EPS bead content of 0. 5 %- 1. 0 % was considered as a favorable range, which enhanced the anti-frost performance of the composite geofoam. The anti-frost performance of the geofoam was related to the thermal isolation, hydrophobic and mechanical buffering behavior of the EPS beads. = 在补水条件下,对 4 种聚苯乙烯(EPS) 颗粒掺量的复合填料试样施加 3 种冷端温度(- 5,- 10,- 15 ℃) 冻结,开展水分迁移及冻胀特性测试与分析. 研究了冻结作用下复合填料温度分布特征、水分迁移规律和冻胀变形特性,基于温度场和水分场的相关性分析了复合填料抗冻胀破坏机理. 结果表明,一定程度地增加EPS颗粒含量,会使复合填料冻结温度与热阻提高,温度传导、冻结锋面移动速率以及冻结深度递减,已冻区含水率增量变小,冻结锋面和未冻区含水率增量变大,冻胀量减少,有助于缓解冻胀破坏.

50|$|Collyweston stone slate is a {{traditional}} roofing material found in England.It is not a proper slate but a limestone found in narrow beds. It is considerably heavier than true slate. The slates are quarried {{near the village of}} Collyweston in Northamptonshire, near Stamford and close to the borders of Lincolnshire and Rutland. Traditionally the mined stone was left outside for three winters until the frost revealed layers that could be broken ("clived") into flat slates. In the late 1990s, English Heritage (now Historic England) worked with the Burghley Estate and Sheffield Hallam University to develop an artificial system to reproduce the freeze-thaw cycle needed for production of slates. In 2012, when new slates were needed to reroof parts of Apethorpe Palace, further testing was commissioned by English Heritage to develop the <b>artificial</b> <b>frosting</b> and new Collyweston slates have been produced. New slates have been used to repair the roofs of Ufford Church in Cambridgeshire and High Wycombe Guildhall.|$|R
40|$|Summary Effects of <b>artificial</b> <b>frosts</b> on light-saturated pho-tosynthesis (Amax) and ground, maximal and {{variable}} fluores-cence variables (Fo, Fm, and Fv and Fv/Fm) were monitored on 1 -year-old foliage of black spruce seedlings (Picea mar-iana (Mill.) BSP) grown at high (25 °C), moderate (15 °C) and low (5 °C) temperatures and moderate (240 µmol m– 2 s– 1) and low (80 µmol m– 2 s– 1) irradiances. Photoinhibition of 1 -year-old foliage was greater in seedlings grown in moderate light than in seedlings grown in low light. Photoinhibition {{increased with decreasing}} growth chamber temperature at both irradian-ces. Most changes in Fv/Fm were caused by changes in Fv. Ex-posure to – 4 °C decreased both Fv/Fm and Amax compared with control values. The effect of the – 4 °C frost treatment was greater in seedlings grown in low light than in seedlings grown in moderate light, probably because seedlings grown in moder-ate light were already partially photoinhibited before the frost treatment. Following – 4 °C treatment, neither Fv/Fm nor Amax recovered in seedlings grown in low light. Light-saturated pho-tosynthesis decreased with decreasing growth chamber tem-perature. Light-saturated photosynthesis was {{more sensitive to the}} – 3 and – 4 °C frost treatments in seedlings grown at 25 °C than in seedlings grown at 15 and 5 °C. The Amax of seedlings grown at 15 °C was sensitive only to the – 4 °C frost treatment, whereas Amax of seedlings grown at 5 °C was not sensitive to any of the frost treatments. Recovery of Amax following frost took longer in seedlings grown at high temperatures than in seedlings grown at low temperatures. For seedlings grown at the same temperature but under different irradiances, both Amax and Fv/Fm reflected damage to the photosynthetic system fol-lowing a moderate frost. However, for seedlings grown at the same irradiance but different temperatures, Amax provided a more sensitive indicator of frost damage to the photosynthetic system than Fv/Fm ratio...|$|R
40|$|Genetic and {{physiological}} aspects {{of variation in}} frost resistance were investigated in Eucalyptus nitens seedlings. Frost resistance was primarily determined by measuring the relative leakage of electrolytes from leaf discs subjected to <b>artificial</b> <b>frosts,</b> in an air-filled freezing chamber. The method used was a modification of that developed by other researchers with eucalypts. Frost resistance assessments made using leaf discs compared favourably with both artificially frosting whole seedlings and visual assessments of relative frost damage to field plantings subjected to natural frosts. Transmission electron microscope observations indicated that frosted leaf discs with a high relative leakage of cellular electrolytes, had cells that were characterised by rupture of the plasma membrane and tonoplast, and protoplasm coagulation. The effects of photoperiod, temperature regime and differential root and shoot temperatures on frost resistance were examined in both hardening and dehardening E. nitens seedlings. Both hardening and dehardening processes were markedly influenced by temperature regime, but no photoperiodic responses were detected. Exposure to temperatures between 1. 5 and 4 °C for {{some part of the}} day/night cycle resulted in significantly increased frost resistance. Three separate experiments showed maximum hardening rates of c. 0. 5 °C week- 1. Increasing the daily amount of low temperature (2 to 3 °C), from 8 to 16 h, resulted in increased levels of frost resistance. In contrast, seedlings exposed to constant 24 h low temperature, were almost 2 °C less frost resistant than seedlings grown with 16 h day- 1 low temperature after eight weeks, and suffered considerable water stress. Whilst heating seedling roots to between 6 and l 8 °C throughout the constant low air temperature regime maintained high plant water status, it did not confer any increased frost resistance. Rates of dehardening in well hardened seedlings increased with increasing day and/or night temperature in the range 6 to 20 °C, but were significantly reduced if roots were kept at 3 °C. The apparent quantitative response of both hardening and dehardening processes to temperature regime is discussed. A comprehensive study of the genetic variation for frost resistance in E. nitens was made by means of artificial frostings, of both whole seedlings and leaf samples, and the assessment of damage from natural frosts to field trials. Two groups of provenances were identified. The Western provenance, from the Central Highlands of Victoria, and the provenance in Northern N. S. W. showed superior hardiness to the Southern N. S. W. and East Gippsland (Errinundra) provenances. This was demonstrated for plants that were unhardened, partially hardened and at near maximum hardiness. The critical frost temperature (50...|$|R
40|$|In the Tyrrhenian coastal area, {{frequent}} late frosts {{have occurred}} during the last ten years. The most severe event happened in 2003, causing a strong reduction in yield, above all in stone fruit species. However, several apricot selections, from different breeding sources, had a considerable yield, {{as a consequence of}} high flower and/or young fruit survival. The aim of this research was to evaluate the degree of tolerance to spring frost of ten selections and their own parents. During three subsequent years, the frost sensitivity of flower buds at dormant and swelling phenological stages was determined using the Phenolic Compound Leakage (PCL) test after an <b>artificial</b> <b>frost</b> treatment (– 4 °C). When this temperature was applied to flower buds at the dormant stage did not cause significant injuries, as indicated by the low PCL values. At the pre-flowering stages a significant increase in PCL was observed in most genotypes. On the basis of different levels of PCL, the genotypes were classified into three groups in relation to their frost sensitivity: i) very frost-tolerant; ii) frost-tolerant and iii) frost-sensitive. Within the very frost-tolerant group, the selections 7 C 20 / 3, 11 / 48 / 7 and 11 / 19 / 2, were the best genotypes confirming a good yield performance recorded after the severe spring frost of 2003...|$|E
40|$|In a 14 -week study, 1 -year-old Aleppo pine {{seedlings}} {{were grown}} in two growth chambers. Seedlings were artificially hardened by decreasing photoperiod and temperature. In each chamber {{half of the}} seedlings were fertilized with nitrogen (8. 4 mg seedling(- 1)). In {{order to determine the}} relative importance of the hardening environment versus fertilization, each chamber was programmed to decrease night temperatures down to a low of 8 or 4 degrees C. Chlorophyll fluorescence and frost hardiness was measured five times during the experiment. A sample of seedlings from each treatment was exposed to an <b>artificial</b> <b>frost</b> at - 5 degrees C and the freezing effects were assessed by measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and visual evaluation of needle damage. Seedlings increased their frost hardiness during the experiment in all the treatments but the ratio of variable to maximal chlorophyll fluorescence (F(v) /F(m)) measured before freezing did not vary during the experiment. This indicates that Aleppo pine maintains its photosynthetic ability during hardening in contrast to other coniferous species from colder climates. The effect of nitrogen fertilization on frost hardiness was small in comparison with chamber effect. Nitrogen fertilization slightly delayed the acquisition of hardening in the coldest chamber. Seedlings in the warmest chamber did not become fully resistant to - 5 degrees C, but in the coldest chamber, where night temperature reached 4 degrees C, all the seedlings were resistant to the frost. Severe damage caused by frost could be related to a rapid rise of minimal fluorescence (F(0)) but the best index of damage was the drop of F(v) /F(m) after freezing...|$|E
40|$|Question: In cold regions snow-cover {{duration}} {{is expected}} to decrease, especially in spring, {{as a consequence of}} climate warming. We investigated effects of changes in timing of snowmelt in relation to weather condition on Vaccinium myrtillus, a dominant shrub in heath vegetation. We tested the hypothesis that advanced snowmelt will enhance shrub growth in years with few frosts, but will reduce shrub growth in years with frequent frosts. Location: A sub-alpine heath in the Northern Apennines (Italy). Methods: We carried out two experiments. In the main experiment, snow was added to (+S) or removed from (–S) experimental plots in spring during three growing seasons (2004 - 2006), with a mean delay in snowmelt timing of about two weeks from –S to +S. In a companion experiment, we simulated a freezing event in late spring 2004. Results: During the snowmelt period, the –S plants experienced six to ten more frost events, compared with +S and unmanipulated controls (C), in 2004 and 2005 but not in 2006. In the first two years leaf production, leaf expansion and flowering were all significantly reduced in the –S plants, while shoot elongation was unaffected. In the companion experiment of <b>artificial</b> <b>frost</b> V. myrtillus presented similar responses. Conversely, the manipulations of snow did not affect either the hydric status or the nutrient status of plants and soils. Conclusions: The results overall supported our hypothesis, as shown by the differing effects of snow depth and timing of melt on V. myrtillus in the three years. Spring frost was the cause of reduced growth and reduced flower production in 2004 and 2005. However, advanced snowmelt will not decrease the cover of this dominant species. Therefore, the structure and the species dominance patterns in sub-alpine heath are not expected to change significantly in response to reduced snow cover. Support for this conclusion is provided by the capacity of V. myrtillus to recover vegetatively from frost injury through stimulated shoot elongation and by the low importance of sexual reproduction for propagating dominant ericaceous shrubs in closed heath communities...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{production}} of artificial snow in ski resorts is controversially discussed, but only few investigations {{have been carried}} out systematically to specify the environmental impacts. We measured snow depth and density from groomed ski pistes (runs) with compacted snow and their effects on ground temperatures and timing of snowmelt. We analyzed groomed pistes with and without artificial snow (10 each) as well as adjacent ungroomed off-piste control plots beside the piste. On pistes with natural snow, the thin and compacted snow cover led to severe and long lasting seasonal soil frost. On pistes with <b>artificial</b> snow, soil <b>frost</b> occurred less frequently because of increased insulation due to the greater snow depth. However, due to the greater snow mass, the beginning of the snow-free season was delayed by more than 2 wk. Average winter ground temperatures under a continuous snow cover were decreased by approximately 1 °C on both piste types compared with off-piste control plots. The results suggest that the heat balance of alpine soils is changed by both piste types, either by an extensive heat loss on pistes with natural snow or by prolonged snow cover on pistes with artificial snow...|$|R
