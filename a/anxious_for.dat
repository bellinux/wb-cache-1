5|$|<b>Anxious</b> <b>for</b> {{their safety}} Kirill and Victoria {{decided that the}} best thing to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, Arnold {{asked for}} Kenney to return Wilson {{to work on}} his own staff. Wilson took the long way back, visiting the other war theatres in India, China, the Middle East, Italy and England. Wilson found the Army Air Forces Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Barney Giles <b>anxious</b> <b>for</b> Wilson's return so Giles could pay a visit to the war theatres. Wilson {{therefore}} found himself acting chief of staff. On Giles' return, Wilson became Assistant Chief of Staff, Organization, Commitments and Requirements. In February 1945, Wilson was present at the Battle of Iwo Jima as an official Army Air Forces observer. He was promoted to major general on 17 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|On October 4, the Patriot militia reached Ferguson's former camp at Gilbert Town, where thirty Georgia militiamen joined them, <b>anxious</b> <b>for</b> action. On October 6, {{they reached}} Cowpens, South Carolina, (site {{of the future}} Battle of Cowpens), where they {{received}} word that Ferguson was east of them, heading towards Charlotte and Cornwallis. They hurried to catch him. Rebel spies reported Ferguson was making camp on Kings Mountain with some 1200 men. Ferguson, rather than pushing on until he reached Charlotte and safety (just a day's march away), camped at Kings Mountain and sent Cornwallis another letter asking for reinforcements. Kings Mountain {{is one of many}} rocky forested hills in the upper Piedmont, near the border between North and South Carolina. It is shaped like a footprint with the highest point at the heel, a narrow instep, and a broad rounded toe. The Loyalists camped on a ridge west of Kings Pinnacle, the highest point on Kings Mountain.|$|E

5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the Irish Free State had been {{strained}} since the appointment in 1932 of Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach (Prime Minister). The Anglo-Irish Trade War, {{sparked by the}} withholding of money that Ireland had agreed to pay the United Kingdom, had caused economic losses on both sides, and the two nations were <b>anxious</b> <b>for</b> a settlement. The de Valera government also sought to remove the remaining ties between Ireland and the UK, such as ending the King's status as Irish Head of State. Chamberlain as Chancellor had taken a hard-line stance against concessions to the Irish, but he was persuaded that the strained ties were affecting relations with other Dominions, and sought a settlement with Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Main Cell Block {{was built}} in two stages. Construction of the {{southern}} half of the block began in 1853 {{and most of the}} masonry works were finished within a year. The section was finished in 1855, including the association wards, a circular jarrah stairwell, and 18 solitary confinement cells in the Refractory Block. However, iron fittings for the guardrails, which had been ordered from England three years previously, still had not arrived. <b>Anxious</b> <b>for</b> the new cell block to start being used, Henderson ordered that doors and rails be made locally, with iron salvaged from convict transport ships. The obvious transition between the local and imported railing now marks the boundary between the southern and northern wings. Prisoners were transferred from the temporary South Beach prison on 1 June 1855.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} his staff were <b>anxious</b> <b>for</b> the {{president}} {{to appear to be}} recovering quickly, and the morning after his operation he saw visitors and signed a piece of legislation. Reagan left the hospital on the 13th day. Initially, he worked two hours a day in the White House's residential quarters, with meetings held there instead of the Oval Office. Reagan did not lead a Cabinet meeting until day 26, did not leave Washington until day 49, and did not hold a press conference until day 79. Ruge, the Physician to the President, thought recovery was not complete until October. Reagan's plans for the month after the shooting were canceled, including a visit to the Mission Control Center at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in April 1981 during STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle. Vice President Bush instead called the orbiting astronauts during their mission. Reagan would visit Mission Control during STS-2 that November.|$|E

5|$|Oshawa's hopes in the Cup Final {{were damaged}} when Orr {{suffered}} a groin injury against Shawinigan, an injury that is painful and weakens a player's skating ability. To promote the event, held in Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, the Generals had advertised {{it would be}} the last chance to see Orr in junior and were <b>anxious</b> <b>for</b> him to play. Bruins' management demanded Orr not play in the Final, not wanting to risk further damage to their property. Orr and his parents, however, were adamant he be allowed to play for the national championship. As he had not signed to the Bruins, they threatened he would never play for Boston if he was held out. Blair decided to defy the Bruins' ownership and let Orr play. While Orr dressed and played some, he was not a factor and Edmonton defeated Oshawa for the Cup. Oshawa coach Bep Guidolin was fired for letting Orr play, while Blair left the organization of his own accord to join the expansion Minnesota North Stars.|$|E
5|$|The film, under Hancock's {{direction}} and Tristan's writing, had originally a different tone and premise than what {{would eventually be}} seen in the final film. The two had envisioned Amity as a sort of ghost-town when the film opened with several businesses shuttered and the island's overall economy in ruins due to the events seen in the first film. The new resort and condos built on the island by developer Len Peterson were to help celebrate its rebirth giving the island's economy a much needed boost. Tristan had borrowed a subplot from the original Jaws novel and from a discarded early draft of the first film, in which Amity officials were in debt to the Mafia. Both Mayor Vaughn and Len Peterson were <b>anxious</b> <b>for</b> the new island resort to be a success not only to revive Amity but to pay back loans from the Mob that helped build it, thus leading to Vaughn's and Peterson's ignoring of Brody's warning. Tristan and Hancock felt this treatment would lead to more character development that would make the overall story that much more believable.|$|E

The truth is that he never yielded at all upon the question till my own opinions had become very strong and perfectly unchangeable, and, even then, it was with the greatest difficulty that he could be reconciled to my supporting the question.|$|E

25|$|Both {{these lines}} were {{incorporated}} in a Bill before Parliament in 1920, the Beeston and Chilwell line being passed, and the Hucknall line being passed {{subject to the}} completion of certain road works. Hucknall Urban District Council, the highway authority, objected to the line terminating in Hucknall Market Place; they were <b>anxious</b> <b>for</b> its extension to Annesley, but the Corporation was unwilling {{to do this because}} of the sparseness of the population between the two districts.|$|E

He won Poland's highest military decoration, the Virtuti Militari, but refused a permanent commission in Poland. Upon his return to France he would lecture on military history at Saint-Cyr, often drawing upon his experiences of the Polish–Soviet War.|$|E

After seeing Shilo at a GeneCo event (having been previously unaware she was alive) Mag reaches out to her, <b>anxious</b> <b>for</b> Shilo to not make the same mistakes Mag has made herself. She is marked for repossession and is set to deliver her final performance for the company.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the song was mostly positive, although many critics doubted that Rouvas would make a significant comeback. Others were not impressed by the modern dance style and sexual content. Although he had {{stepped down from the}} stage for many months, he still maintained a strong fanbase who were <b>anxious</b> <b>for</b> a new release, also contributing to the demand of the song. The single was very well received by the commercial audience who quickly brought {{it to the top of}} the charts for 10 weeks due to very fast sales.|$|E
25|$|In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a major {{component}} of the United States banking establishment, found itself unable to market several million dollars in Northern Pacific Railway bonds. Cooke's firm, like many others, had invested heavily in the railroads. At a time when investment banks were <b>anxious</b> <b>for</b> more capital for their enterprises, President Ulysses S. Grant's monetary policy of contracting the money supply (again, also thereby raising interest rates) made matters worse for those in debt. While businesses were expanding, the money they needed to finance that growth was becoming scarcer.|$|E

25|$|Preston was <b>anxious</b> <b>for</b> {{opportunities}} of preaching at Cambridge, {{and listened to}} proposals in 1624 for putting him into a vacant lectureship at Trinity Church. The other candidate, Middlethwait, fellow of Sidney Sussex, was favoured by Nicholas Felton, Bishop of Ely. The matter was referred to James I, who wanted to keep Preston out of a Cambridge pulpit, and, through Edward Conway (afterwards Viscount Conway), offered him any other preferment at his choice. It was then that Buckingham told Preston he might have the bishopric of Gloucester, vacant {{by the death of}} Miles Smith (d. 20 October 1624). But Preston, backed by the townsmen, maintained his ground and got the lectureship.|$|E
25|$|As the Franco-Italian army {{fell back}} to the Piave River, it met Jean Maximilien Lamarque's {{infantry}} division and Charles Joseph Randon de Malboissière de Pully's dragoon division moving forward. Eugène used these fresh units to cover his retreat. After holding {{the line of the}} Piave for four days, he began a withdrawal to the Adige on 21 April. At this time the army was joined by Teodoro Lechi's Royal Italian Guard. After a pause on the Brenta on the 24th, the retreat was resumed. <b>Anxious</b> <b>for</b> his northern flank, Eugène authorized Baraguey d'Hilliers to fall back to Rovereto. Chasteler followed this up, taking Trento on 23 April and appearing before Rovereto on the 26th.|$|E
25|$|In 1252, Alfonso X had resurrected another ancestral claim, {{this time}} to the duchy of Gascony, {{in the south of}} Aquitaine, last {{possession}} of the Kings of England in France, which he claimed had formed part of the dowry of Eleanor of England. Henry III of England swiftly countered Alfonso's claims with both diplomatic and military moves. Early in 1254 the two kings began to negotiate; after haggling over the financial provision for Eleanor, Henry and Alfonso agreed she would marry Henry's son Edward, and Alfonso would transfer his Gascon claims to Edward. Henry was so <b>anxious</b> <b>for</b> the marriage to take place that he willingly abandoned elaborate preparations already made for Edward's knighting in England, and agreed that Alfonso would knight Edward before the wedding took place.|$|E
