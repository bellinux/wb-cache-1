The research objects are companies which experienced both fraudulent and non-fraudulent financial statements between the years 2002 and 2013. In the first stage, two decision tree algorithms, including the classification and regression trees (CART) and the Chi <b>squared</b> <b>automatic</b> interaction detector (CHAID) are applied in the selection of major variables. The second stage combines CART, CHAID, Bayesian belief network, support vector machine and artificial neural network in order to construct fraudulent financial statement detection models.

40|$|The {{market for}} process {{instruments}} generally requires low cost devices that are robust, small in size, portable, and usable in-plant. Ultrasonic torsional guided wave sensors have received much attention by researchers for measurement of viscosity and/or density of fluids in recent years. The supporting electronic systems for these sensors providing many different settings of sine-wave signals are bulky and expensive. In contrast, a {{system based on}} bursts of square waves instead of sine waves would have a considerable advantage in that respect and could be built using simple integrated circuits at a cost that is orders of magnitude lower than for a windowed sine wave device.

40|$|The {{recording}} {{of a large}} amount of data required for high resolution digital images is a common problem in digital photogrammetric applications, where several digital images occur for each block. One solution could be, that of using compression algorithms (JPEG, ECW and now JPEG 2000) that allow an extremely large amount of image data to be compressed into a relatively small amount of data. Even the most recent compressor algorithms declare a lossless compression ratio, the most efficient are lossy (the compression of the image data decreases the geometric and radiometric quality information). The effects of the JPEG 2000 compression algorithm on the geometric quality of compressed images is studied in this analisis.

We consider the latter could be improved by targeting specific household groups rather than looking to follow a single energy consumption level target. This article explores the scope of having a disaggregated energy consumption market to design policies aimed at curbing residential energy consumption or lowering its carbon intensity. Using a clustering method based on the CHAID (Chi <b>Square</b> <b>Automatic</b> Interaction Detection) methodology, {{we find that the}} different levels of energy consumption in the French residential sector are related to socio-economic, dwelling and regional characteristics. Then, we build a typology of energy-consuming households where targeted groups (fuel poor, high income and high consuming households) are clearly and separately identified through a simple and transparent set of characteristics. This classification represents an efficient tool for energy efficiency programs and energy poverty policies, but also for potential investors, which could provide specific and tailor made financial tools for the different consumer groups. Furthermore, our approach helps designing some energy efficiency score that could reduce the rebound effect uncertainty for each identified household group...|$|R

However, previous neuroimaging studies on social orienting have only compared gaze cues to symbolic cues, which typically engage top-down mechanisms.

30|$|It is {{therefore}} urgent that we establish {{an effective and}} accurate fraudulent financial statement detection model, because conventional statistical models experience great disadvantages in detecting fraudulent financial statements due to their relatively high error rate. Some scholars have proposed using data mining techniques in order to judge concerns about business operational continuity and thereby reduce judgment errors. However, prior studies are neither sufficient nor complete. For example, most use only 1 – 2 statistical methods, without model comparison, Furthermore, most use a one-stage statistical treatment {{in order to establish}} the detection model, which is not prudent. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to propose a better model to detect potentially fraudulent financial statements, so that the losses incurred by investors and caused by auditors can be reduced. Compared with previous literature, this study adopts: (1) a two-stage statistical treatment; (2) five data mining techniques to create the detection model for comparison of model accuracy; (3) tenfold cross validation which is thought to be prudent and is commonly used in the academic field. In short, this study is not only prudent, but is also innovative and makes significant contributions to the literature. This study selects the major variables by applying the DT techniques of the Chi <b>squared</b> <b>automatic</b> interaction detector (CHAID) and classification and regression trees (CART).

Vibration monitoring and analysis is a predictive maintenance technique by which the faults can be detected in the machines. In this work, the vibration fault simulation system is developed for vibration signal monitoring. The structure of vibration monitoring system is discussed. The important components of vibration monitoring system are accelerometer transducer, charge amplifier, data acquisition card (DAQ) and computer. Data acquisition system, signal analysis and LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Engineering Workbench) are used to detect various faults which occur in the machine. For processing and analysis of vibration signal, time domain and frequency domain analysis of vibration signal is implemented in LabVIEW. From time domain analysis it is difficult to find the exact fault of the vibration signal. It is also difficult to locate the faults region and fault type. For avoiding the difficulties in time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis is performed. Spectrum analysis has provided more accurate information about the vibration signal type, signal fault region and fault extent as compared to time domain analysis.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{aimed to explore}} peoples’ {{experiences}} of social and organisational justice, {{and in doing so}} asked three central questions. The first focused on whether there was a relationship between the different dimensions of justice, and the second on the commonalties and differences in peoples’ perceptions of justice. The third question looked at whether demographic variables, as markers of social identity, were predictive of such justice perceptions. The study was quantitative in nature, and made use of a non-experimental, partially exploratory, cross-sectional design. Four hundred and eight six employees of a large South African manufacturing organisation completed a self report questionnaire containing questions about a range of biographic, domestic, financial, employment, and religious information, as well as two measures of social and organisational justice perceptions. Once preliminary analyses were carried out to ensure the psychometric properties of the measuring instruments and explore the data set, two key statistical procedures were used to answer the research questions, namely a cluster analysis and a Chi <b>Squared</b> <b>Automatic</b> Interaction Detection or CHAID analysis. Results of these analyses provided some evidence to argue that justice perceptions in different contexts, while not strongly related, cannot be seen in isolation from another, and that a more integrative or reciprocal approach to understanding different justice perceptions needs to be adopted.

Delays in accessing treatment can have fatal consequences; however, few studies have systematically assessed these delays among children under five years of age in malaria-endemic countries of sub-Saharan Africa. This study identifies predictors of prompt treatment with first-line artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) and describes profiles of children who received this recommended treatment. This study uses data from the most recent Demographic and Health Survey, Malaria Indicator Survey, or Anaemia and Parasite Prevalence Survey conducted in 13 countries. A Chi <b>square</b> <b>automatic</b> interaction detector (CHAID) model was used to identify factors associated with prompt and effective treatment among children under five years of age. The percentage of children with fever who received any anti-malarial treatment varies from 3. 6 % (95 % CI 2. 8 - 4. 4 %) in Ethiopia to 64. 5 % (95 % CI 62. 7 - 66. 2 %) in Uganda. Among those who received prompt treatment with any anti-malarial medicine, the percentage who received ACT ranged from 32. 2 % (95 % CI 26. 1 - 38. 4 %) in Zambia to nearly 100 % in Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar. The CHAID analysis revealed that country of residence is {{the best predictor of}} prompt and effective treatment (p < 0. 001). Depending on the country, the second best predictor was maternal education (p = 0. 004), place of residence (p = 0. 008), or household wealth index (p < 0. 001). This study reveals that country of residence, maternal education, place of residence, and socio-economic status are key predictors of prompt access to malaria treatment.

Data on 194 patients who underwent conservative (43 patients), endoclip (4 patients) stent-grafting (63 patients) or surgical treatment (84 patients) for esophageal perforation were retrieved from nine medical centers. In-hospital/ 30 -day mortality was 17. 5 %. Three-year survival was 67. 1 %. Age, coronary artery disease, and esophageal malignancy were independent predictors of early mortality. Chi <b>squared</b> <b>automatic</b> interaction detection analysis showed that patients without coronary artery disease, without esophageal malignancy and younger than 70 years had the lowest early mortality (4. 1 %). Surgery was associated with slightly lower early mortality (conservative 23. 3, endoclips 25. 0 %, stent-grafting 19. 0 %, surgery 13. 1 %; p = 0. 499). One center reported a series of more than 20 patients treated with stent-grafting which achieved an early mortality of 7. 7 % (2 / 26 patients). Stent-grafting was associated with better survival with salvaged esophagus (conservative 76. 7 %, endoclips 75. 0 %, stent-grafting 77. 8 %, surgery 56. 0 %; p = 0. 019). Propensity score adjusted analysis showed that stent-grafting achieved similar early mortality (p = 0. 946), but significantly higher survival with salvaged esophagus than with surgical treatment (p = 0. 001, OR 0. 253, 95 % CI 0. 110 - 0. 585). Primary surgical repair was associated with somewhat lower early mortality (14. 6 vs. 19. 0 %; p = 0. 561) and better survival with salvaged esophagus (85. 4 vs. 77. 8 %; p = 0. 337) than stent-grafting. Esophageal perforation was associated with a rather high mortality rate in this all-comers population. Stent-grafting failed to decrease operative mortality, but it improved survival with salvaged esophagus.

40|$|One {{possible}} way of implementing the TV telephone system is by transmitting the video signal over existing telephone cables. Not {{only is this}} attractive from an economical standpoint, it {{also appears to be}} technically reasonable. However, there are certain basic problems to be considered, particularly in reference to baseband analogue transmission over the local subscriber area. For a start, it is expected that fixed equalisers will be required at regular intervals along the line to compensate for attenuation losses. These equalisers will have to be designed on the basis of some average channel characteristic. As a result, there will be uncorrected losses owing to deviations from the average characteristic for the different TV telephone connections. These and other channel imperfections will have to be compensated automatically. This thesis is concerned with the design and testing of an automatic equaliser to serve the above-mentioned purpose. Chapter One outlines the basic principles of operation, together with the performance criterion used to assess the degree of optimality achieved. The mode of operation is discussed, as well as the different possible choices and arrangements of the basic equaliser function. To provide further insight into the process, a mathematical study is given in Chapter Two. This includes considering the control algorithm for tap adjustments, the conditions for convergence, and the choice of step size to be used. The analysis is extended to cover adaptive operations, where the information for updating the tap settings is not exactly available but must be estimated on-line. In addition, ways of improving performance through modifying the basic equaliser structure (such as using a feedback configuration instead of the conventional feedforward arrangement) are also considered. The theoretical investigation is carried further in Chapter Three. The effect of noise on equaliser capability and performance is discussed, along with the need for a defined standard of signal-to-noise ratio for acceptable transmission. This is followed by an evaluation of the effect of having a non-linearity in the feedback loop. The resulting system is studied, using some form of linearised analysis. Some reference to stability requirements is also given. In order to confirm some of the theoretical findings of the previous chapters, and to demonstrate the potential of automatic equalisation in practice, a real-time experimental system was designed and assembled. Chapter Four outlines the work involved and the problems encountered. The choice of suitable test signals and their method of generation are discussed in some detail. After the experimental equaliser had been built, various tests were conducted, using 500 yards of 4 lb P. I. U. T. cable to represent the TV telephone channel. The tests were designed to provide an estimate of some of the critical parameters and an assessment of system capability. The nature of the tests, with the results obtained, are given in Chapter Five. The implications of the test results are discussed in Chapter Six. The areas requiring further investigation are identified. A preliminary discussion of the problems involved in integrating the system into the existing telephone network is also included. The conclusion summarises the state of progress in evaluating the practicability of the <b>automatic</b> mean <b>square</b> equaliser for TV telephone applications...|$|R

A validated questionnaire was used to collect data. An extended version of CHAID was used to identify statistically significant (p 0. 05) interactions controlling for asthma severity. Family problems were associated with increased risk of mortality for patients aged > 31 years (OR = 6. 5; 95 % CI 2. 6 - 16. 1) but not for younger patients. Males were at increased risk overall, but females with family problems (OR = 4. 3; 95 % CI 1. 7 - 10. 7) were at greater risk then males (OR = 3. 1; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 7. 9) with family problems. Alcohol use increased risk of mortality for individuals with verbal instructions (OR = 5. 4; 95 % CI 1. 5 - 19. 5) or without a written action plan (OR = 4. 4; 95 % CI 1. 0 - 19. 4). Individuals with severe asthma and who reported having lung function tests were at increased risk for mortality if family (OR = 8. 2; 95 % CI 1. 6 - 41. 6) or financial problems (OR = 11. 5; 95 % CI 2. 0 - 65. 9) were present. This analysis highlights some important interactions and the magnitude of additional risk for mortality associated with psychosocial or family problems.

40|$|In 1999, the New South Wales Board of Studies (NSW BOS) {{released}} a revised Stage 6 Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) syllabus 1. This syllabus signalled a significant discursive shift with subject knowledge altering {{to reflect a}} sociocultural perspective of health and physical activity. This shift challenged the identity of many Physical and Health Education teachers who have historically created their professional self around the scientific discourses of human movement. Physical and Health Education teachers have been criticised for their lack of engagement with and insensitivity to the socio-cultural aspects of the revised syllabus (Gard 2 ̆ 6 Wright, 2001; MacDonald et al. 2002), and been described as “elitist, sexist, 2 ̆ 7 pragmatic sceptics 2 ̆ 7 and anti-intellectual” (Tinning, 2004). Given this professional identity, the question arose as to how professional development could assist NSW PDHPE teachers to engage with and commit to the socio-cultural perspective of the revised syllabus? Therefore {{the aims of the}} study were to identify the professional identity {{of the members of the}} community of practice (Lave 2 ̆ 6 Wenger, 1991) of PDHPE HSC markers and pre-service PDHPE teachers and establish how this identity influenced their preferences for particular aspects of the Stage 6 PDHPE syllabus. As a further educational outcome of this research, suggestions for professional development were proposed to assist PDHPE teachers to engage with curriculum change. As a mixed-method study, data gathering involved surveying PDHPE HSC markers and pre-service PDHPE teachers, and undertaking semi-structured interviews with 25 PDHPE teachers. A range of NSW BOS and educational systems’ professional development documents were used as artefacts. Survey data were analysed using Chi Square and Chi <b>Square</b> <b>Automatic</b> Interaction Detector (CHAID). Interview data were analysed for themes relating to the value of participating in communities of practice to assist in responding to curriculum change. The results from the examination of both the survey and interview data sources indicated that a range of factors influenced the HSC option selections of NSW PDHPE HSC markers. These factors included the academic ability, sex and interest of their students. The profile of HSC markers also influenced their HSC option selection, with sources of professional development, years of teaching experience and sex of the marker being the most influential factors. The representative sample of HSC markers indicated that they were practical doers, seekers of certainty, gendered interpreters of the syllabus, and conservative participants in the broader PDHPE community of practice who maintain the status quo. The results of the survey data further revealed that the pre-service PDHPE teachers in the research sample were influenced in their selection of HSC options by their students’ interest, their own expertise and interests, the pedagogy they believed could be used to teach a particular option, and the application of the option beyond school. Both HSC markers and pre-service PDHPE teachers indicated the benefits of engaging with colleagues as a resource for learning about a socio-cultural perspective of health and physical activity. By cultivating particular conditions within the PDHPE community of practice, members could engage with the socio-cultural perspective of the 1999 syllabus through their participation in situated and reflective learning experiences. The results of the thesis clearly indicate that by participating in overlapping communities of practice, acting as brokers, and creating time for reflection and shared dialogue that NSW PDHPE teachers can make meaning of and commit to the socio-cultural perspective of the 1999 Stage 6 syllabus...|$|R
