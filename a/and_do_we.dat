He also continued to compose music, including the comic opera Castle Bang (1894) and the sketches The Ibsenite Drama (1895) <b>and</b> <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> Enjoy Our Holidays? (1897) and songs like [...] "The Baby on the Shore" [...] (1893), [...] "Johnnie at the Gaiety" [...] (1895), [...] "Tommy's First Love" [...] (1897), and [...] "The Happy Old Days at Peckham" [...] (1903). In 1894–95, however, Gilbert enticed Grossmith to take the role of George Griffenfeld in His Excellency, with music by Frank Osmond Carr. [...] Also in 1897, he played briefly as King Ferdinand V of Vingolia in F. C. Burnand's His Majesty at the Savoy Theatre and made two more short London stage appearances thereafter, as Scoones in Young Mr Yarde (1898) and Lambert Simnel in The Gay Pretenders (1900). An 1896 interview of Grossmith reveals him feeling his age and considering the end of his touring career, while enjoying time spent at home with his family, dogs and antique piano collection. Grossmith suffered from depression {{after the death of his}} wife of cancer in 1905, and his health began to fail, so that he increasingly missed engagements. [...] He was nevertheless persuaded to continue giving his entertainments, which he did on a less frequent basis, until November 1908. The following year, Grossmith retired to Folkestone, Kent, a town that he had visited for many years, where he wrote his second volume of reminiscences, Piano and I (1910).|$|E

2500|$|According to tradition, Philemon did free Onesimus, {{and both}} were {{eventually}} recognized as saints by the Church. T. David Curp asserts that, [...] "Given that the Church received Philemon as inspired Scripture, Paul's ambiguity effectively blocked the early Fathers of the Church from denouncing slavery outright." [...] As an example, Curp points out that St. John Chrysostom, in his sermon on Philemon, considers Paul's sending Onesimus back to his master a sign that slavery should not be abolished. However, in his Homilies on Philemon, Chrysostom actually opposes unfair and unjust forms of slavery by stating that those who own slaves are to passionately love their slaves with the very Love of Christ for humanity: [...] "this ... is the glory of a Master, to have grateful slaves. And this is the glory of a Master, that He should thus love His slaves ... Let us therefore be stricken with awe at this so great love of Christ. Let us be inflamed with this love-potion. Though a man be low and mean, yet if we hear that he loves us, we are above all things warmed with love towards him, and honor him exceedingly. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> then love? And when our Master loves us so much, we are not excited?".|$|E

[...] The Guardians Caroline Sullivan felt that [...] "this record simply takes up where 2001's Rock Steady left off", but {{ultimately}} stated, [...] "As a comeback, this is nice work." [...] The Independents Andy Gill commented that the album finds No Doubt [...] "making only the most tentative divergences from previously tried and tested strategies, which gives Push and Shove a character that {{could be described as}} either dated or timeless", while noting that [...] "the title-track offers a fun, ebullient return to their ska-punk roots". Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen expressed that [...] "he songs are catchy, but Gwen Stefani doesn't have the voice, or the gravitas, for grandiose tunes. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> really want a 'mature' No Doubt record, anyway?" [...] Maria Schurr of PopMatters panned the lyrics as [...] "abysmally bad" [...] and remarked, [...] "After 'One More Summer'—which has a gigantic chorus perfectly suited for Wet Seal's speakers—and the inconsistent but decent title song, the album becomes so filler-centric that even the tracks' titles [...] are interchangeable." [...] Joseph Viney of Sputnikmusic critiqued that [...] "he very elements that made No Doubt popular in the first place have disappeared." ...|$|E

The church of God will not {{flourish}} as it should, until Babylon is destroyed: The world will never be in its right wits, until Babylon is destroyed: The kingdom of Christ will never be set up, in and by his church, as it ought, and shall, until Antichrist is destroyed: There will never be peace upon earth till Antichrist is destroyed: And God has promised that there shall be peace and truth, and glory, when Babylon is destroyed: <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> hold our peace?
