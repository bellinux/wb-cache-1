5|$|Additional optical {{effects were}} {{provided}} by Visual Concept Engineering (VCE), a small effects company headed by Peter Kuran; Kuran had previously worked at ILM and left after finishing The Empire Strikes Back. VCE provided effects including phaser beams, the Enterprise reactor, additional sand on Ceti Alpha V, and an updated transporter effect. Meyer and the production staff were <b>adamant</b> <b>about</b> not using freeze frames for the transporter, as had {{been done in the}} original television series. Scenes were shot so that conversations would continue while characters were in mid-transport, although much of the matte work VCE created was discarded when the production decided not to have as much action during transports.|$|E
5|$|Dev Gill was {{selected}} to portray the film's antagonist. Rajamouli was criticised for selecting him considering Gill's previous film, Krishnarjuna (2008), but remained <b>adamant</b> <b>about</b> casting him. He {{said that he had}} to cast a good looking man as the film's villain because the heroine needed to find him trustworthy. For this film, Gill had to practice horse riding in Ramoji Film City; Ram Charan was already an experienced equestrian. Srihari was cast in his role in the film in early April 2008. Kim Sharma {{was selected}} to perform one of the two item numbers in the film in early June 2008. Saloni Aswani made a cameo appearance in the film and shot for three days.

40|$|Owen Fiss has {{a passion}} for truth. This embrace has given moral fervor and power to his {{character}} and his work. At the same time, a puzzle accompanies this commitment - a puzzle that is both intellectual and personal. Intellectually, how does Professor Fiss sidestep the assaults of skepticism, relativism, post-modernism - and not only the ideological isms of our secular world which have cast doubt over authoritative truth claims, but also the corroborating historical experience of the social disasters accompanying authoritarian truth claims? Personally - and I say this from extensive and repeated experience - the puzzle is to understand how Owen combines his attentiveness to others 2 ̆ 7 needs and perspectives with the forcefulness of his moral vision, his clear and even <b>adamant</b> conviction <b>about</b> right conduct and belief. How {{can it be that}} he is such a good friend, sounding board and guide {{at the same time that}} he remains so resolute, so adamant, in his rectitude? It is in this sense that I intend to explore the 2 ̆ 2 truth about Owen 2 ̆ 2 - how, that is, can he wrap the robes of Truth around himself without succumbing to moralizing authoritarianism...|$|R
2500|$|As the Lublin {{project was}} falling apart, Lecca was {{streamlining}} the extortion {{part of his}} CE activities. In May 1943, he suggested collecting another 4 billion lei from those Jews who, as his report to the government claimed, [...] "enjoy the freedom to trade and live protected from war". Lecca talked about his plan in a face to face meeting with Chief Rabbi Alexandru Șafran, on Hanukkah 1942. Interviewed in 1994, Șafran recalled that Lecca treated him [...] "respectfully". He declared: [...] "I would say that, although corrupt and sometimes inebriated, he sometimes had toward me the attitude of a true to life Romanian boyar." [...] According to Șafran, Lecca pressured the Jews {{to come up with}} the sum in full, because [...] "our soldiers are out on the front dying, and they stay at home". The Chief Rabbi protested that his community could never have afforded such expenditures, but Lecca replied that Antonescu was <b>adamant</b> and passionate <b>about</b> the project.|$|R
5|$|Wirkola got {{the idea}} to create a film based on the adult lives of Hansel and Gretel in 2007 while at film school in Australia. After being {{discovered}} by Gary Sanchez Productions, Wirkola pitched the idea at a meeting with Paramount Pictures and won a contract. Production began in March 2011 at the Babelsberg Studios in Germany and included extensive use of traditional special effects. In addition, Renner and Arterton had a month of training beforehand {{to prepare for the}} physical demands of their roles. In terms of the weapons and wardrobe, Wirkola wanted an old-world look with a modern touch, and he was <b>adamant</b> <b>about</b> filming outdoors in European nature rather than in a studio. The project was filmed in Germany and featured an international cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|The conference {{failed to}} produce a settlement, {{breaking}} up {{on the same day}} it began with each side blaming the other for its unsuccessful outcome. Smith believed the nationalists were being unreasonable by requesting preconditions for talks—which they had previously agreed not to do—and asking for diplomatic immunity for their leaders and fighters. The nationalists contended that Smith was being deliberately intransigent and that they did not believe he was sincere in seeking an agreement if he was so <b>adamant</b> <b>about</b> not giving diplomatic immunity. Direct talks {{between the government and the}} Zimbabwe African People's Union followed in December 1975, but these also {{failed to produce}} any significant progress. The Victoria Falls Conference, the détente initiative and the associated ceasefire, though unsuccessful, did affect the course of the Rhodesian Bush War, as they gave the nationalist guerrillas significant time to regroup and reorganise themselves following the decisive security force counter-campaign of 1973–74. A further conference would follow in 1976, this time in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on Criterion's proprietary game engine RenderWare. The graphics engine was improved to give between 50–100% faster rendering than in Burnout 2. The increased performance {{allowed them to}} add features like real-time radiosity lighting and better environment mapping effects on vehicles. Programmers at the studio were <b>adamant</b> <b>about</b> making the game run at a frame rate of sixty frames per seconds to offer instant response and feedback while driving fast. Since the crash sequences were slower, the higher frame rate was less considered less critical than the spectacle of the vehicle collisions. They opted to run the game at thirty frames per second during these instances and dramatically {{increased the number of}} particles and debris that were rendered. From an early stage in development, the team wanted to include support for online network play in Burnout 3. They had never explored online play before, so they used Burnout 2 as a test-bed for the feature before integrating it into Burnout 3.|$|E
60|$|Captain Phelps was one {{of those}} angry men of iron mould, who appear to take {{pleasure}} in daring Fate to do her worst. On receipt of the letter, he swore with an awful oath that he would now go to sea in the Swordfish, even if he knew she would go to the bottom in twenty-four hours after weighing anchor. Accordingly, having intrenched himself behind a wall of moral <b>adamant,</b> he went <b>about</b> with quiet indifference, and let things take their course. He made no objection whatever when, in addition to the loading already in the ship, the agents added a deck cargo of some massive pieces of machinery, weighing thirty tons, and a supply of coals, the proper receptacle for which below had been filled with iron goods. Neither did he utter a word when--after the vessel had been taken out into the stream by the riggers--he and the owner, agents, pilot, and crew (only six of which last were A.B.'s), were taken off to her in a tug and put on board with orders to sail immediately.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{influence}} of race, social class status (middle income) and political party affiliation on the attitudes of middle class White and African Americans toward welfare reform legislation. This study focused on the comparison of the two groups: (1) African Americans with an annual income between $ 35, 000 - $ 99, 999; and (2) White Americans with an annual income also between $ 35, 000 - $ 99, 999. Specifically, a comparison was done to identify what similarities and/or differences exist between the two groups in relation to the dependent variable (attitudes toward welfare reform legislation), and the independent variables (race, social class status: income and political party affiliation). The sample population was randomly selected from a total of ten sites using the systematic sample process. This explanatory study used the survey questionnaire research method to collect data on each independent variable in relation to the dependent variable. The questionnaire contained 46 statements and was divided into three sections: (1) Demographics, (2) Poverty and Welfare Knowledge, and (3) Welfare Reform Attitudes. Data collected were analyzed by employing the Chi-square statistical technique. The findings of this study suggest that race and social class status (middle income) were not key factors in determining the public’s attitudes toward the issue of welfare reform legislation, while political party affiliation was a issue. Conclusions drawn from the data indicated that White and African Americans have very direct and <b>adamant</b> attitudes <b>about</b> the work ethics of poor people. In fact they share similar concerns about making America a more productive society through encouraging work and self- sufficiency among welfare recipients. Their attitudes about supporting welfare reform legislation transcend racial lines. Particular attention was given to understanding the level of support for welfare reform legislation expressed by African Americans. Finally, the author concluded this study with a series of recommendations that may assist the field of social work in addressing the issue of poverty. Specific emphasis was placed on the presentation of a strategic model for social work practitioners to address poverty...|$|R
5000|$|Barney {{is excited}} {{that he and}} Ted get to work {{together}} since Ted is designing the new GNB building. However, when Barney reveals {{the site for the}} future building is to be situated on the current location of [...] "The Arcadian," [...] a hotel that Ted describes as an architectural landmark, Ted refuses to go through with it. Barney is suspicious as to why Ted is so against the old building's demolition, and eventually has Ted reveal that he met a girl, Zoey. Zoey was as <b>adamant</b> as Ted <b>about</b> preserving the building, and had even organized a public protest of keeping it from getting demolished. Ted admits joining the protesters, leaving Barney stunned. Barney realizes Ted must not have told Zoey he was the architect of the new GNB building, and Ted admits he had told her he was a veterinarian. Ted assures Barney he isn't against the plan because of Zoey, but Barney remains unconvinced, pointing out Ted had done crazy things before because of a girl. Later, Zoey reveals she had been arrested several times due to previous protests, and Ted, realizing how passionate she is, decides to join her in a picketing. Barney retaliates by having a billboard lowered {{in front of the building}} revealing Ted to be the architect of the new GNB building. Ted confronts Barney, who had hoped that Ted would agree to design the building after ruining his chances with Zoey.|$|R
5|$|The {{arguments}} {{that led to}} the cancellation of the B-70 program had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber of any sort. The USAF was <b>adamant</b> <b>about</b> retaining bombers as part of the nuclear triad concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe counterforce option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM made moot the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs, such as the Minuteman III, had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost, but development costs were much higher. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed. McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{pressures}} of other projects, Jagger did not begin work on the memorial until the following year, by which time {{he had decided to}} alter the design. The revised memorial would be a third larger than before, cruciform in plan, and guarded by three bronze soldiers. Jagger initially intended to point the howitzer east, towards the Wellington Arch, but after much discussion—including advice from Lutyens and Sir Reginald Blomfield—it was agreed that the howitzer would point south to produce a pleasing silhouette from the park. A lengthy, year-long debate occurred within the RAWCF as to what inscription should be placed on the memorial, adding to the delay. Jagger then decided that the fourth side of the memorial should feature a dead soldier, a proposal which proved controversial. Although recumbent effigies were not uncommon on tombs and (to a lesser extent) war memorials, a sculpture of a dead soldier at eye level was an unusual and dramatic feature among First World War memorials—architects often preferred abstract, classical designs (such as the Cenotaph) or portrayed death through allegory. Jagger was <b>adamant</b> <b>about</b> the inclusion, even offering to pay for the casting of the additional figure himself. After considerable debate, the RAWCF agreed to the modification. Jagger's work continued to take longer than planned, partially due to shortages of staff, the need to approve each amendment to the plan and practical problems on the site itself. The names of his models for three of the statues are known: William Fosten for the Driver, another ex-gunner called Metcalfe for the Ammunition Carrier, and Lieutenant Eugene Paul Bennett, VC, who fought in the same regiment as Jagger.|$|E
5|$|Greg Jein, {{best known}} as the builder of the alien {{mothership}} from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was called on to build props for the film. Jein was a longtime Star Trek fan who had constructed the props for The Final Frontier, but was forced to remake props that had since mysteriously disappeared. Jein added references to the original television series and other science fiction franchises throughout the prop designs; the Rura Penthe warden's staff contained parts of a spaceship from Buck Rogers, while the frong was detailed with a prop from Buckaroo Banzai. Elements from The Final Frontier were modified and reused; a medical implement from the film became Chekov's blood tester, and the assault phasers first seen in The Final Frontier became standard issue. Gorkon's staff was intended to be a massive bone from an alien creature he had killed, with the designs shaped out of green foam and approved by Meyer. Two copies were strong enough to support David Warner's weight; another two were designed to be light enough to be hung from wires for the zero gravity scenes. Since the Klingon phasers were redesigned for the third film, the original holsters no longer fit the weaponry; as a result, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was <b>adamant</b> <b>about</b> having the actors be able to unholster their weapons, so the existing pistols had to be redesigned. The Klingon sniper rifle was broken into sections, with parts modeled from real weapons.|$|E

25|$|Wilcox {{was the one}} who {{encouraged}} emphasizing the buildings height with vertical piers. Howe argued against the vertical lines wanting to emphasize the office space inside the tower. Wilcox was <b>adamant</b> <b>about</b> showing off the building's height and in the end vertical piers were added, along with emphasizing the horizontal space inside using the spandrels. The piers protrude from the facade to not interfere with wall space and allow the maximum amount of floor space and flexible office arrangement. The t-shaped tower was designed in a way to allow in the maximum amount of light on the office floors and to emphasize the banking portion in the base.

25|$|Jordan {{started a}} {{crackdown}} on the PLO by closing their offices in Amman after the then Israeli minister of defense, Yitzhak Rabin, requested it from Hussein in a secret meeting. Jordan announced a $1.3billion five-year development plan for the West Bank, {{in a bid to}} enhance its image in the West Bank residents {{at the expense of the}} PLO. Around the same time, Hussein became troubled after he heard that Israel had been selling American weapons to Iran, thereby lengthening the conflict between Iraq and Iran, both supporters of the PLO. The relationship between Hussein and Saddam became very closeHussein visited Baghdad 61 times between 1980 and 1990, and Saddam used Hussein to relay messages to several countries, including the US and Britain. In June 1982, after Iran's victory seemed imminent, Hussein personally carried to Saddam sensitive photographic intelligence forwarded to him by the US. In return, Saddam provided incentives for Jordanian exports to Iraq, which accounted for a quarter of all Jordan's exports, valued at $212.3million in 1989. Iraqi aid helped Jordan's finances; Hussein had felt it humiliating to keep asking Gulf countries for assistance. Hussein made a little-known attempt to heal the rift between the two Ba'ath regimes of Iraq and Syria in April 1986. The meeting between Hafez Al-Assad and Saddam Hussein occurred at an airbase in Al-Jafr in the eastern Jordanian desert. The talks lasted for a day, after which no progress was made. Saddam was angry at Al-Assad for supporting Iran against an Arab country, Iraq, and Al-Assad was <b>adamant</b> <b>about</b> establishing a union between Iraq and Syria, which Saddam rejected.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself {{to save us}} from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very <b>adamant</b> <b>about</b> the fact that Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows {{his belief in the}} selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E
