5|$|There is a {{submerged}} forest {{beneath the}} eastern part of the Doom Bar, off Daymer Bay. It is believed to be part of the wooded plain that existed off the current Cornwall coast before it was overcome by sand dunes and beach sand during the last significant rise in sea-level, which ended around 4,000 years ago. Exposed <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> the Atlantic Ocean, the sands of the area have always been prone to sudden shifts: several houses were said to have been buried one night during a powerful storm. According to tradition one such shift led to the formation of the Doom Bar during the reign of Henry VIII (1509–1547), causing a decline in the prosperity of Padstow. Today, the sandbank covers approximately , linking the beaches near Harbour Cove by sand flats, although the actual size and shape varies.|$|E

25|$|The {{divisions}} between all {{these groups are}} rough and their boundaries aren't solid. The Mizrahim for example, are a heterogeneous collection of North African and Middle Eastern Jewish communities which are often as unrelated to each other <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> any of the earlier mentioned Jewish groups. In modern usage, however, the Mizrahim are also termed Sephardi due to similar styles of liturgy, despite independent evolutions from Sephardim proper. Thus, among Mizrahim there are Iranian Jews, Iraqi Jews, Egyptian Jews, Sudanese Jews, Tunisian Jews, Algerian Jews, Moroccan Jews, Lebanese Jews, Kurdish Jews, Libyan Jews, Syrian Jews, and various others. The Yemenite Jews ("Teimanim") from Yemen are sometimes included, although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the admixture found among them to that found in Mizrahim. Additionally, {{there is a difference}} between the pre-existing Middle Eastern and North African Jewish communities as distinct from the descendants of those Sephardi migrants who established themselves in the Middle East and North Africa after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain by the Catholic Monarchs in 1492, and in 1497 from the expulsion decreed in Portugal.|$|E

500|$|As {{government}} was ordained by God, Christians {{were obliged to}} obey in Zwingli's view. This requirement applied equally to a good or an evil government because both came from God. However, it is because rulers are to be servants of God and that Christians obey the rulers <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> obey God, that the situation could arise when Christians may disobey. When the authorities act against the will of God then Zwingli noted, [...] "We must obey God rather than men." [...] God's commands took precedence over man's.|$|E

At a transitional zone where fresh water meets salt water, mangrove trees thrive, adapted <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> {{both kinds of}} water. This brackish mixture of water and mangrove systems, crisscrossed by hundreds of tidal creeks, harbors a very productive ecosystem. The depth of these zones is dependent on how much water flows from the Everglades. In the wet season, fresh water pours into Florida Bay and sawgrass appears near the coastline. In dryer years, salt water creeps inland to the coastal prairie, an ecosystem that buffers the freshwater marshes by absorbing sea water. Mangrove trees grow in fresh water ecosystems when the salt water flows far enough inland. The Everglades have the most extensive contiguous system of mangroves in the world. The mangrove forests of the Ten Thousand Islands cover almost [...]|$|E
500|$|In 1932 the Hungarian Vilmos Hevesy (Guillaume de Hevesy) {{published}} an article claiming a relationship between rongorongo and the Indus Valley script, based on superficial similarities of form. This was not a new idea, but was now presented to the French Academy of Inscriptions and Literature by the French Sinologist Paul Pelliot and {{picked up by the}} press. Due to the lack of an accessible rongorongo corpus for comparison, it was not apparent that several of the rongorongo glyphs illustrated in Hevesy's publications were spurious. Despite the fact that both scripts were undeciphered (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> this day), separated by half the world and half of history ( [...] and 4000years), and had no known intermediate stages, Hevesy's ideas were taken seriously enough in academic circles to prompt a 1934 Franco–Belgian expedition to Easter Island led by Lavachery and Métraux to debunk them (Métraux 1939). The Indus Valley connection was published as late as 1938 in such respected anthropological journals as Man.|$|E

In June he used his lecture at the Royal Society to attack Owen's [...] "etherial archetype". Having gained a foothold in science with the aid of the Westminster Review group led by John Chapman and Herbert Spencer, Huxley was out to dislodge the domination of science by wealthy clergymen– led by Owen– instead wanting to create a professional salaried scientific civil service. To Spencer, animal species had developed by [...] "adaptions upon adaptions". Huxley was using arguments on origins to split science from theology, arguing that [...] "it is as respectable to be modified monkey as modified dirt".|$|E
2500|$|Before Brown left Springfield in 1850, the United States {{passed the}} Fugitive Slave Act, a law which {{mandated}} that authorities in free states {{aid in the}} return of escaped slaves and imposed penalties on those who aided in their escape. In response Brown founded a militant group to prevent slaves' capture—the League of Gileadites. In the Bible, Mount Gilead was the place where only the bravest of Israelites would gather together to face an invading enemy. Brown founded the League with these words, [...] "Nothing so charmes the American people as personal bravery. [...] would have ten times the number [...] they now have were they but half as much in earnest to secure their dearest rights <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> ape the follies and extravagances of their white neighbors, and to indulge in idle show, in ease, and in luxury." [...] Upon leaving Springfield in 1850, Brown instructed the League to act [...] "quickly, quietly, and efficiently" [...] to protect slaves that escaped to Springfield—words that would foreshadow Brown's later actions preceding Harper's Ferry. From Brown's founding of the League of Gileadites onward, not one person was ever taken back into slavery from Springfield. Brown gave his rocking chair to {{the mother of his}} beloved black porter, Thomas Thomas, as a gesture of affection.|$|E

2500|$|Lord, {{through his}} pseudonym, responded {{in his own}} defense, stating that [...] "Roman Catholic institutions, {{charitable}} if they please to call them so" [...] are not what is opposed by Protestants, only {{the fact that the}} state legislature is [...] " [...] not a public hospital but a Roman Catholic one," [...] and were [...] "willing to do for the Papists what they have never done for their own religious institutions." [...] He accused the government of being in collaboration with the Catholic Church, arguing that the funding was illegal. He warned that Sisters of Charity Hospital would make [...] "citizens become subjects of Romish magic," [...] and asked [...] "are Roman Catholics to be almoners of Protestant charities to the poor and destitute?" [...] In another letter, he asserted that the hospital funding was illegal because [...] "not a single Protestant is in the Corporation or has any supervision of its affairs." [...] In the Christian Advocate, a Protestant newspaper at which Lord was editor, he questioned why anyone who defends the Constitution [...] "will be willing to be taxed to build up an institution the control of which is beyond the votes of a free republican people."

2500|$|During the {{development}} of Darwin's theory, his investigation of barnacles showed, in 1849, how their segmentation related to other crustaceans, showing how they had diverged from their relatives. To both Darwin and Owen such [...] "homologies" [...] in comparative anatomy were evidence of descent. Owen demonstrated fossil evidence of an evolutionary sequence of horses, as supporting his idea of development from archetypes in [...] "ordained continuous becoming" [...] and, in 1854, gave a British Association talk on the impossibility of bestial apes, such as the recently discovered gorilla, standing erect and being transmuted into men, but Owen did {{not rule out the}} possibility that humans had evolved from other extinct animals by evolutionary mechanisms other than transmutation. Working-class militants were trumpeting man's monkey origins. To crush these ideas, Owen, as President-elect of the Royal Association, announced his authoritative anatomical studies of primate brains, claiming that the human brain had structures that apes brains did not, and that therefore humans were a separate sub-class, starting a dispute which was subsequently satirised as the Great Hippocampus Question. Owen's main argument was that humans have much larger brains for their body size than other mammals including the great apes. Darwin wrote that [...] "I cannot swallow Man [...] distinct from a Chimpanzee". The combative Thomas Henry Huxley used his March 1858 Royal Institution lecture to deny Owen's claim and affirmed that structurally, gorillas are as close to humans <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> baboons. He believed that the [...] "mental & moral faculties are essentially... the same kind in animals & ourselves". This was a clear denial of Owen's claim for human uniqueness, given at the same venue.|$|E
