5000|$|Tactile Programming: (1996) AgentSheets {{becomes the}} world's first drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> {{educational}} programming environment. Drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> interfaces {{can be used}} to compose syntactically correct programs. In Visual AgenTalk (VAT), a rule-based visual programming language, users create rules by dragging <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> conditions <b>and</b> actions from palettes. The tactile aspect of Visual AgenTalk allows users to perceive through drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> what programs do. By dragging <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> conditions, actions, rules and even methods onto agents they see the consequence of invoking program fragment without having to write a test program. Similar drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> programming can later be found in the Etoys language (part of Squeak), in Alice and in Scratch.|$|R

40|$|Drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> {{operation}} {{is one of}} the key capabilities of any Graphical User Interface. The user can do quite complex operations simply by visually dragging <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> objects from one location to another. It saves user from remembering and typing a lot of commands. The result of a drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> operation may vary depending the type of source object and type of destination object. For example dragging a file <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> on a folder may copy or move the file to the destination folder, dropping that file to a remote FTP location may upload that file using internet, dropping that file on a printer icon may print that file, dropping that file on the trash can may delete that file, <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> that file on an executable may play or open or compute or manipulate that file. Although a drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> operation prima facie seems to be a simple operation, it can become extremely complicated depending on the type of source objects dragged and the type of destination objects selected for dropping. There are many limitations of a conventional drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> operation. This article points out the difficulties of a drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> operation <b>and</b> illustrates the solutions disclosed by various inventions to overcome those difficulties.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experiment to investigate if {{the addition of}} non-speech sounds to the drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> operation would increase usability. There are several problems with drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> that can result in the user not dropping a source icon over the target correctly. These occur because the source can visually obscure the target {{making it hard to}} see if the target is highlighted. Structured non-speech sounds called earcons were added to indicate when the source was over the target, when it had been dropped on the target and when it had not. Results from the experiment showed that subjective workload was significantly reduced, and overall preference significantly increased, without sonically-enhanced drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> being more annoying to use. Results also showed that time taken to do drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> was significantly reduced. Therefore, sonic-enhancement can significantly improve the usability of drag <b>and</b> <b>drop.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of drops at the surface of turbulent liquids, e. g., turbulent primary breakup, was studied experimen-tally. Pulsed shadowgraphy and holography were used to observe {{the properties of the}} liquid surface <b>and</b> the <b>drops</b> formed by turbulent primary breakup. Measured proper-ties included liquid surface velocities, conditions at the onset of ligament <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> formation, ligament <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> sizes, ligament <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> velocities <b>and</b> rates of <b>drop</b> for-mation. Phenomenological theories were used to help interpret and correlate the measurements. Present results show that the onset of ligament formation occurs once the kinetic energy of the turbulent eddies that form the liga-ments exceeds the required surface tension energy of a ligament of comparable size. Subsequently, the onset o...|$|R
50|$|Drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> is {{considered}} an important program construction approach in many end-user development systems. In contrast to more traditional, text-based programming languages, many end-user programming languages are based on visual components such as tiles or icons that are manipulated by end users through drag-and-drop interfaces. Drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> is also featured in many shader editing programs for graphics tools, such as Blender. Drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> also features in some video game engines, including Unreal Engine, GameMaker: Studio, Construct 2 and, with expansion, Unity (game engine).|$|R
