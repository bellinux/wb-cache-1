50|$|Though Coleman fuel has an {{octane rating}} of 50 to 55 and a {{flammability}} similar to gasoline, it {{has none of}} the additives found in modern gasoline {{and should not be}} used as a substitute for gasoline. While it will function as a fuel for gasoline engines, its high combustion temperature and lack of octane boosting additives could damage engine valves, while its low octane rating and lack of <b>anti-knock</b> <b>agents</b> can produce knocking that could lead to bearing and piston rod damage, so such use should only be considered for emergencies and/or very short distances. And like gasoline, it should not be used as a substitute for kerosene or diesel fuel. However, it is quite popular as a fuel for model engines, where the low octane rating is not a problem, additives are unwanted, and the clean burning, low odor and longer shelf life are considered advantages.|$|R
40|$|Manganese is an {{essential}} trace element which is toxic in high doses. Over the past several decades, manganese has replaced lead as the <b>anti-knock</b> <b>agent</b> in gasoline, raising concern about air and road-side contamination with this element. In addition, manganese is absorbed by the liver, making specific populations (e. g., pregnant women, infants and children, and patients with liver disease) susceptible to its toxic effects. Using data from the US Census Bureau, the North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics, and the US Environmental Protection Agency, this ecological study evaluated chronic liver disease mortality rates in North Carolina’s 100 counties. It correlated these rates with county-level demographics as well as on-road and non-road air borne manganese concentrations. Median income by county was inversely associated with chronic liver disease mortality, while the logarithmically transformed airborne concentrations of on-road manganese were positively correlated with county-level chronic liver disease mortality. Because environmental manganese near roads {{is likely to increase}} over time, these pilot findings potentially have regulatory implications and argue for further research...|$|E
40|$|Increased Mn {{levels are}} known to damage the central nervous system, {{resulting}} in motoric abnormalities and psychic disorder and finally resulting even in symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. Monomethyl-Mn-pentadienyl-tricarbonyl is used as <b>anti-knock</b> <b>agent</b> and consequently Mn compounds are exhausted into air from automobiles. With additional inhalative Mn exposure, finally an Mn overflow of the liver is known, resulting in increased Mn transport to other organs, predominantly to the brain. Specific Mn-species then seem to be generated in liver, however, their speciation is still not investigated. This paper focuses on experiments {{to get more information}} on Mn species with respect to a size characterization of the Mn species in liver. Liver extracts were analyzed using a mass calibrated size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column being coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection. As an important prerequisite, the stability of Mn species in the liver extracts during storage was investigated as well. It turned out that short term storage of the extract (under Ar atmosphere) at 4 degrees C seems to be best suited. Storage for several days even at - 20 degrees C demonstrated already considerable changes in species pattern. Further investigations focused on improvements in detection during hyphenation using dynamic reaction cell (DRC) technology for Mn detection. The signal to noise (S/N) ratio was increased up to a factor of 15 when using DRC technology compared to conventional ICP-MS without DRC. The analysis of liver extracts with a mass calibrated SEC column coupled to inductively coupled plasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS) showed Mn associated to ca. 36 % to a peak covering a mass range 100 - 260 kDa, approximately 9 % was found in a peak having the mass range 37 - 77 kDa, 46 % in a peak having the mass range 13 - 36 kDa and ca. 7 % in the low molecular mass (LMM) range.

40|$|Manganese, an {{essential}} trace element, {{is one of}} the most used metals in the industry. Recently, several new manganese compounds have been introduced as fungicide, as antiknock agent in petrol and as contrasting agent in nuclear magnetic resonance tomography. Manganese displays a somewhat unique behaviour with regard to its toxicity. It is relatively non-toxic to the adult organism except to the brain where it causes Parkinson-like symptoms when inhaled even at moderate amounts over longer periods of time. Relatively high doses of manganese affect DNA replication and repair in bacteria and causes mutations in microorganism and mammalian cells although the Ames test does not appear to be particularly responsive to manganese. In mammalian cells, manganese causes DNA damage and chromosome aberrations. Information on organic manganese derivatives is still insufficient. Large amounts of manganese affect fertility in mammals and are toxic to the embryo and foetus. The fungicide MANEB and the contrasting agent MnDPDP also can be embryotoxic, but the latter only at doses much higher than those clinically employed. Information on the <b>anti-knock</b> <b>agent</b> MMT is inadequate. On the other hand, manganese deficiency can also affect fertility and be teratogenic. Information on cancer due to manganese is scanty but the results available do not indicate that inorganic manganese is carcinogenic. More information is desirable with regard to the organic manganese derivatives. It may surprise that an agent that causes mutations is not also carcinogenic. The experience with manganese shows that conclusions with regard to carcinogenicity of an agent based on the observation of mutations are subject to uncertainties. Altogether, it appears that, because of the very high doses at which positive effects have been found, manganese would not represent a significant carcinogenic risk to the population and workers. Care must, however, be exercised with respect to central-nervous symptoms after chronic exposure and with respect to effects on the embryo. Pregnant women should not be exposed to manganese at the work place...|$|E
50|$|Haensel {{worked on}} surface catalysts, {{patenting}} various methods for improving chemical {{processes in the}} oil industry. Platinum was known to chemists as a catalyst, but was considered too expensive for industrial use. Haensel, however, understood that only the surface mattered, so produced ceramic supports with tiny amounts of platinum metal on the surface, eventually showing that 0.01% could be effective. It has since been realised that the platinum was {{in the form of}} nanoparticles, long before this idea was common. The metal combined with the acid surface of alumina to carry out two chemical processes, resulting in the production of gasoline with a higher octane rating. At that time, octane rating was improved by the addition of <b>anti-knock</b> <b>agents</b> such as tetraethyllead. The development of the platforming process allowed the eventual removal of lead from gasoline. In addition, hydrogen was produced, which was valuable in itself but also helped to remove sulfur, giving a cleaner, more environmentally friendly process.|$|R
40|$|Changes {{in metal}} {{oxidation}} state and speciation can have significant health and ecotoxicological consequences. A few examples are provided below: i) Mining and industrial activities have contaminated soils and sediments throughout the world, including Baltimore Harbor. Reactions of molecular oxygen (O 2) with sparingly soluble CrIII(OH) 3 (s) may generate {{the far more}} soluble and transportable chromate ion (HCrVIO 4 -, CrVIO 42 -). ii) Combustion of gasoline containing the <b>anti-knocking</b> <b>agent</b> MMT (methylcyclopentadienyl manganese(I) tricarbonyl) forms a fine aerosol consisting of MnIII,IV (hydr) oxide solids. When inhaled, biofluids convert the oxidized manganese to soluble MnII. Within the nose, subsequent translocation of MnII along olfactory neurons leads to elevated manganese in a region of the brain called the olfactory bulb (1). A Parkinson's-like condition termed manganism can result. iii) Water supply plants maintain a disinfectant residual to ensure the deactivation of pathogenic bacteria. Recently it has been discovered that switching from free chlorine (HOClo,OCl-) to chloramine residuals raises dissolved lead concentrations (2). Higher lead levels in drinking water, in turn, may elicit adverse neurological effects, especially in children. Lytle and Schock (3) have determined that free chlorine is capable of oxidizing Pb 2 +(aq) to PbIVO 2 (s), but that chloramines cannot...|$|R
50|$|Ships {{entering}} the harbour in Table Bay {{from the east}} coast of Africa have to round the coast at Sea Point and over the years many of them have been wrecked on the reefs just off-shore. In May 1954, during a great storm, the Basuto Coast (246 tonnes) ended up on the rocks within a few metres of the concrete wall of the promenade. A fireman who came to the assistance of the crew was swept off the wall of the swimming pool adjacent to the promenade by waves and was never seen again. The vessel was soon thereafter salvaged for scrap. In July 1966 a large cargo ship, the S.A. Seafarer, was stranded on the rocks only a couple of hundred metres from the Three Anchor Bay beach. The stranding was the cause of one of Cape Town's earliest great environmental scares, owing to the cargo including drums of tetramethyl lead and tetraethyl lead, volatile and highly toxic compounds that in those days were added to motor fuels as an <b>anti-knocking</b> <b>agent.</b> The ship was gradually destroyed by the huge swells that habitually roll in from the south Atlantic. Salvage from the ship can still be found in local antique shops.|$|R
40|$|Mn is of {{toxicological}} {{concern because}} overexposure {{can lead to}} progressive, permanent neurodegenerative damage. Monomethyl-Mnpentadienyl-tricarbonyl (MMT) is used as an <b>anti-knock</b> <b>agent</b> in fuel. Exhausted Mn compounds are absorbed in the lung and transported to the liver. Extended exposure causes an overflow of the liver with Mn species moving e. g. to the brain, causing irreversible central nervous system (CNS) disorders like Manganism. This paper focuses on experiments for getting more information on Mn species in liver extracts. The investigations are performed with respect to (1) a size characterization and (2) a subsequent identification of the Mn species in liver extracts using preparative size exclusion chromatography (SEC) followed by capillary zone electrophoresis coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (CZE-ICP-MS). First, extracts were analyzed using a mass calibrated SEC column coupled to ICP-MS detection. The chromatograrn showed the Mn- 55 -trace and proved main Mn elution between ca. 60 - 150 kDa. Second, liver extracts were fractionated on the same SEC column, however, now the effluent was directed to a fraction collector. This resulted in fractions containing pre-purified, size characterized Mn species per fraction. It {{turned out that the}} Mn concentrations per fraction reflected roughly the previous on-line Mn trace. Third, the fractions were subject to CZE-ICP-MS, where the MS was operated additionally with dynamic reaction cell (DRC) technique. From size characterization (with SEC coupled on-line to ICP-MS or connected to a fraction collector and subsequent Mn determination in fractions) it was shown that most Mn species from liver extract were of high molecular mass (HMM) nature as they eluted mostly between 50 and 80 min, corresponding to ca. 60 - 150 kDa. With the two-dimensional speciation approach employing first SEC and then CZE-ICP-DRC-MS together with standard addition method, a series of Mn species was identified. Mn species predominantly were Mn-enzymes e. g. arginase, isocitric dehydrogenase, galactosyltransferase, prolidase, pyruvate carboxylase and oxalate oxidase. A typical Mn-transporter -Mn-alburnin-was also seen, whilst Mn-transferrin obviously was degraded during SEC separation. This Mn-compound (independent whether as a standard or from liver extract) was not stable during SEC even at the finally chosen physiological conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Manganese (Mn) is an {{essential}} trace element, but excessive inhalation can cause serious disorders of the central nervous system, lungs and liver, and results in the condition known as manganism. The general population is exposed to Mn through its use in the fungicide Maneb and MMT, which is used as an <b>anti-knock</b> <b>agent</b> to replaced lead in petrol. Also {{there have been a}} number of reports of Mn contaminated drinking water. Victims of Mn poisoning suffer from serious neurological disorders, such as an intermittent tremor of small amplitude, speech impairments and disruption of postural reflexes, which are caused by damage to certain regions of the brain. After prolonged exposure severe symptoms develop that generally resemble those associated with Parkinson's disease. The action of Mn on the brain is not well understood, although three possible mechanisms have been proposed: 1. Inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain following Mn accumulation by mitochondria. 2. Neuronal degradation by free radicals such as O 2 and OH causing lipid peroxidation and damage to DNA and protein. 3. Induction of mutation of the mitochondrial genome, as has previously been shown in both eukaryotes and prokaryoles. It has been shown in this study that Mn inhibits the mitochondrial electron transfer chain. An overall ionic strength inhibition of the entire electron transfer chain was observed, probably mediated by an interference of the electrostatic interactions between cytochrome c and the cytochrome bc 1 complex or cytochrome oxidase. Also a direct inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase, NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase was observed. This inhibition would be associated with a decrease the production of ATP and could be sufficient to cause the degradation of brain tissue seen in victims of Mn poisoning. It seems likely that if Mn can inhibit the mitochondrial electron transfer chain, this inhibition would lead to an increase in the generation of free radical species by the mitochondria. However, this was not shown in this work, due to difficulties with detector molecules. It was observed that sheep liver mitochondria can oxidise and reduce acetylated cytochrome c, which may not have been previously reported. The effect of Mn on isolated mtDNA showed a decrease in the intensity of PCR products after exposure to Mn, which may have been cause by an interference of the activity of Taq polymerase. It has previously been shown that Mn interferes with the activity of both Taq polymerase and chicken liver mitochondrial polymerase-γ and, if it could interfere with the activity of mitochondrial DNA polymerase, this would also decrease further both the number of functional mitochondria and the production of ATP. A decrease in the production of ATP by mitochondria, or a decrease in the production of functional mitochondria, would lead to cellular death of affected cells and could provide an explanation of the symptoms observed in victims of Mn poisoning...|$|E
30|$|Isoprene {{is a small}} {{volatile}} hydrophobic molecule containing five carbon {{atoms and}} {{is also known as}} 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -butadiene. It is a colorless organic compound that is produced by animals, plants and bacteria. It has a low solubility in water as well as a low boiling point of 34  °C which enables withdrawal from the upper gas phase of a bioreactor when produced via biotechnological processes (Xue and Ahring 2011). This aspect turns it valuable for downstream chemical products. Isoprene as biofuel contains more energy, is not miscible in water and does not show corrosive effects compared to ethanol (Atsumi and Liao 2008; Lindberg et al. 2010). Companies develop bioisoprene production such as Genencor and Goodyear, published their efforts to develop a gas-phase bioprocess for production of isoprene (Whited et al. 2010). Their work involved metabolic engineering of E. coli capable of producing high yields of isoprene, in addition to developing a large-scale fermentation process with high rates of the isoprene recovered from the off-gas. They reported a titer of over 60  g/L, a yield of 11 % isoprene from glucose and a volumetric productivity of 2  g/L/h (Chandran et al. 2011). Several researchers reported using isoprenol as <b>anti-knock</b> <b>agent,</b> in which branched C 5 alcohols store more energy than ethanol and high octane numbers (RON, or research octane number, of 92 – 102), that helps their use as gasoline alternatives and as anti-knock additives (Cann and Liao 2010; Mack et al. 2014). In addition, they have been verified in various engine types and they proved to have better gasoline-like properties than ethanol (Yang et al. 2010). All isoprenoids are known to be derived from the two universal five-carbon (C 5) building blocks, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). These universal precursors are known to be produced by either one of the three identified pathways: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and/or the pathway, which is also 1 -deoxy-d-xylulose- 5 -phosphate (DXP) pathway. Additionally, an alternative MVA-independent pathway has been identified for the biosynthesis of IPP and DMAPP in bacteria, algae and plants which is named the methylerythritol 4 -phosphate (MEP) pathway and lacks the first two steps of the DXP pathway (Rodríguez-Concepción and Boronat 2012). Bacillus subtilis uses the DXP pathway and was found to be the best naturally isoprene producing bacteria (Kuzma et al. 1995). It is known that the isoprene synthase utilize dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) as substrate (Withers et al. 2007). The isoprene synthase gene was not identified in bacteria yet, however it has been characterized from many plants such as Populus species, e.g. aspen, Poplar Alba (Beatty et al. 2014; Fortunati et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2001; Sasaki et al. 2005; Sharkey et al. 2005; Silver and Fall 1995; Chotani et al. 2013; Vickers et al. 2010), Pueraria Montana (kudzu) and/or Pueraria lobata (Beatty et al. 2014; Hayashi et al. 2015; Sharkey et al. 2005). The isoprene synthase gene from poplar was successfully isolated and heterologously expressed in E. coli. Moreover, isoprene synthase cDNA was isolated from Populus alba (PaIspS) and expressed in E. coli for enzymatic characterization (Sasaki et al. 2005). Previous studies failed to isolate the isoprene synthase from bacteria (Julsing et al. 2007; Sivy et al. 2002), thus the Kudzu isoprene synthase gene (kIspS) was codon optimized and heterologously expressed in E. coli (Zurbriggen et al. 2012). Previously, the codon optimized Mucuna bracteata IspS was engineered in S. cerevisiae and it only produced 16.1  μg/L (Hayashi et al. 2015). Additionally, when the codon optimized M. bracteata IspS was engineered in Pantoea ananatis, it produced 63  μg/L (Hayashi et al. 2015). Recent studies involved in overexpression of codon optimized kudzu IspS (kIspS) in E. coli using different constructs (Cervin et al. 2016). The E. coli best isoprene production yield was 10  μg/L. In addition, the codon optimized kudzu and poplar IspS genes were expressed in Yarrowia lipolytica using different methods; in which the isoprene yield was 0.5 – 1.0  μg/L from the headspace culture (Cervin et al. 2016). This study aimed to develop recombinant Bacillus strains (B. subtilis and B. licheniformis) with high level of isoprene production using the Kudzu isoprene synthase.|$|E
5000|$|To {{settle the}} issue, the U.S. Public Health Service {{conducted}} {{a conference in}} 1925, and the sales of TEL were voluntarily suspended for one year to conduct a hazard assessment. The conference was initially expected to last for several days, but reportedly the conference decided that evaluating presentations on alternative <b>anti-knock</b> <b>agents</b> was not [...] "its province", so it lasted a single day. Kettering and Midgley stated that no alternatives for anti-knocking were available, although private memos showed discussion of such agents. One commonly discussed agent was ethanol. The Public Health Service created a committee that reviewed a government-sponsored study of workers and an Ethyl lab test, and concluded that while leaded gasoline should not be banned, it {{should continue to be}} investigated. The low concentrations present in gasoline and exhaust were not perceived as immediately dangerous. A U.S. Surgeon General committee issued a report in 1926 that concluded there was no real evidence that the sale of TEL was hazardous to human health but urged further study. In the years that followed, research was heavily funded by the lead industry; in 1943, Randolph Byers found children with lead poisoning had behavior problems, but he was threatened with a lawsuit and the research ended.|$|R
5000|$|Working at the GM Research Laboratory at Dayton, Ohio, Charles Kettering and his {{assistant}} Thomas Midgley, Jr. studied <b>anti-knocking</b> <b>agents.</b> In 1921, the team directed by Midgley discovered TEL's anti-knocking property, which would eliminate the knock in internal combustion engines, allowing them to be built with higher compression ratios. GM proceeded to file a patent {{for the use of}} TEL as an additive in gasoline. In August 1924, after Standard Oil of New Jersey discovered a lower-cost method to synthesize TEL, it teamed up with GM to establish the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation to produce TEL as a gasoline additive with the help of DuPont. Soon, workers at Ethyl plants fell ill and a number of them died from lead poisoning. Kettering hired Kehoe to develop protocols for the workers handling TEL. Kehoe soon became the main medical advocate for the position that the use of TEL in gasoline is safe and gained prominence as the industry's expert at government and public health hearings. As almost all research support concerning leaded gasoline came from industry, and most was channeled to him, he held [...] "an almost complete monopoly" [...] on data for half a century. Kehoe claimed that presence of lead in humans and other organisms was normal and that exposure to low lead levels was not harmful.|$|R
40|$|Gasoline {{anti-knock}} quality, {{defined by}} the research and motor octane numbers (RON and MON), is important for increasing spark ignition (SI) engine efficiency. Gasoline knock resistance can be increased using a number of blending components. For over two decades, ethanol has become a popular <b>anti-knock</b> blending <b>agent</b> with gasoline fuels due to its production from bio-derived resources. This work explores the oxidation behavior of two oxygenated certification gasoline fuels and the variation of fuel reactivity with molecular composition. Ignition delay times of Haltermann (RON =[*] 91) and Coryton (RON =[*] 97. 5) gasolines have been measured in a high-pressure shock tube and in a rapid compression machine at three pressures of 10, 20 and 40  bar, at equivalence ratios of φ[*]=[*] 0. 45, 0. 9 and 1. 8, and in the temperature range of 650 – 1250  K. The {{results indicate that the}} effects of fuel octane number and fuel composition on ignition characteristics are strongest in the intermediate temperature (negative temperature coefficient) region. To simulate the reactivity of these gasolines, three kinds of surrogates, consisting of three, four and eight components, are proposed and compared with the gasoline ignition delay times. It is shown that more complex surrogate mixtures are needed to emulate the reactivity of gasoline with higher octane sensitivity (S = RON–MON). Detailed kinetic analyses are performed to illustrate the dependence of gasoline ignition delay times on fuel composition and, in particular, on ethanol content...|$|R
