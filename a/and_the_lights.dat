5|$|Around 17 hours later, {{the plane}} loses {{auxiliary}} power, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> go out inside. Despite Neerja {{and the other}} attendants' attempts to explain, the terrorists assume the Pakistanis cut the power deliberately, and anticipate an imminent Pakistani raid on the plane. The panicking hijackers begin shooting down passengers indiscriminately; at great peril to her own life, Neerja opens the rear door and deploys the chute, directing passengers out of the plane. Choosing to let the passengers escape first, Neerja is fatally shot by the terrorists when she tries to shield young children from the gunfire. The film ends with a tribute to Neerja, who was eventually honoured posthumously with the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest military decoration awarded for peacetime valor, courageous action or self-sacrifice.|$|E

Suddenly, their window is blown open <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> go out. Finn and Jake soon discover that Marceline the Vampire Queen has snuck into their house. Both Finn and Jake are terrified that Marceline will kill them and drink their blood, but she reveals that she has no intentions of killing them, noting that she really only eats the color red. However, she explains that the tree house used to belong to her, and she promptly evicts them from their residence.|$|E

5|$|As {{the train}} departs King's Cross, Hedwig the owl flies {{alongside}} while {{passing through the}} outskirts of London. Hedwig flies away and Dementors arrive from over the nearby buildings. At the same time Harry, Ron, and Hermione pass along the corridor side of the carriage looking for food. The journey enters a tunnel; upon its exit, it passes by Malfoy Manor during a stormy night. Next, the train passes through a second tunnel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> in the compartments go out as a Dementor enters the train and passes along the corridor; Harry Potter uses his magic to defeat the Dementor. After exiting the tunnel, riders are greeted by Hagrid flying on a motorbike with Hogwarts in the background. As the train enters a forest, the flying Ford Anglia appears and starts driving through the terrain. The car crashes soon after and the train leaves the forest, passing by Hogwarts once again before arriving at Hogsmeade Station with Hagrid greeting passengers.|$|E
5|$|In 1910s, London, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) {{is called}} to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dresses the body, she notices a {{sapphire}} ring on its finger. Chester steals it, accidentally tipping over {{a glass of water}} which drips on the floor; she is then assailed by a fly. Chester takes her ring home to her flat and witnesses strange events. The fly returns and continues to pester her, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> in her apartment go out as the sound of the dripping water is heard from various locations. Chester finds the woman's corpse lying in her bed. It rises and floats toward her. Chester begs for forgiveness, but ultimately strangles herself. The next morning, the concierge (Harriet White Medin) discovers Chester's body and calls the police. The pathologist arrives to examine the body and only finds a small bruise on her left finger where her ring once was. As the doctor announces this observation, the concierge appears distressed and hears the dripping of water.|$|E

At night when the building is closed, the lights are turned off and the flushing action stops.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly, {{lightning}} {{struck the}} hotel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> {{of both the}} hallway and elevator flickered out.

25|$|Lighting is {{controlled}} by several methods. Photoelectric eyes measure the amount of sun coming into the space and increase or decrease the fluorescent lighting to balance the light levels in the office. Occupancy/motion sensors turn lights on and off in conference spaces <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> are programmed to turn off automatically at night and on weekends. These strategies reduce the wattage per square foot to 35% below the baseline of one watt per square foot.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the change}} in {{destination}} from Plymouth to Milford Haven, and thus having no charts of the south coast of Ireland, LST-21s navigation officer took a plotting sheet and drew in the mineswept channel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> were plotted in by taking their position from the Admiralty list of lights. With that as a chart, they proceeded through the mineswept channel. At 14:55, the escort reported unidentified aircraft and fired its anti-aircraft guns. LST-21 went to General Quarters.|$|E
25|$|When the German Spring Offensive {{opened on}} 21 March 1918, Nos 8, 10 and 15 (Tyne) AASS were with Third Army around Bapaume, and No 17 with Fifth Army at Péronne. These {{sections}} {{had to be}} withdrawn hastily ahead of the advancing Germans. No 10 AASS retired to Méaulte, where Third Army HQ was subject to continuous night bombing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> themselves were bombed and machine-gunned. On 25 March, {{in the face of}} German advances and the absence of transport, No 10 AASS had to disable its equipment and withdraw.|$|E
25|$|Belfast was raided {{several times}} while the {{regiment}} was forming (the Belfast Blitz); thereafter {{there were only}} rare incursions by enemy aircraft over Northern Ireland. The searchlights were deployed in clusters, but {{towards the end of}} 1941 this arrangement was changed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> in Northern Ireland were redeployed singly to form a 'killer belt' to assist night-fighters. This system required fewer lights, and in November 1941 Anti-Aircraft Command decided that 91st S/L Rgt would be converted to the Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) gun role. In December the batteries went to Holywood, where they were retrained by what was now 237th LAA Training Rgt, and surplus manpower was drafted to other units.|$|E

The rear admiral gave him permission to use his own judgement in the coming hours. The conversation left Horve in no doubt that war was coming and he therefore ordered his ship to be made ready for war, guards to be posted, all leaves to be cancelled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> on the ship and in the harbour area to be blacked out.|$|E
25|$|Almost thirty {{thousand}} people paid their respects to Adolphus Busch when his body lay in {{state in the}} family mansion in St. Louis. Notable guests included the U.S. secretary of agriculture, the president of Harvard University, {{and the president of}} the University of California. Twenty-five trucks were needed to transport all the flower arrangements to the cemetery and a 250 piece band led the funeral procession. The procession spanned twenty miles, from No. 1 Busch Place to Bellefontaine Cemetery, Adolphus' final resting place. As many as 100,000 mourners lined the streets for the procession. Five minutes of silence were observed at the request of Mayor Henry W. Kiel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> were turned off at the Jefferson and Planter's House hotels. Streetcars were also halted.|$|E

At Armageddon, Undertaker defeated Kennedy in a Last Ride match, which was why the hearse had been at ringside for the last two weeks, and Kane defeated MVP earlier in an inferno match. The next week on SmackDown!, the Brothers would reunite once again, defeating King Booker and Finlay, before parting ways as Kane began a rivalry with The Great Khali while Undertaker successfully pursued the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 23.|$|E

25|$|Several {{changes were}} made to the National Christmas Tree and the Pageant of Peace in 1993 and 1994. Although {{organizers}} considered moving the pageant to the Washington Monument or onto the National Mall, no change in location was actually made.

A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory showed that solar lighting could be used to help illuminate the tree during the daytime, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> (donated by the United States Department of Energy) were used. 1994 also saw the first commercial sales of official National Christmas Tree items.

25|$|The new Panorama boasted a {{completely}} new front, featuring a slight peak overhang above the windscreen (which was now optionally undivided), a small grill {{at the bottom of}} the front panel, and for the first time double headlights. Embassy bodies on underfloor-engined chassis shared some or all of these features, depending on the entrance position. However, because the standard offering in the underfloor-engined sector was now the Panorama, most Embassy bodies were built on lightweight front-engined chassis - particularly the Thames 570E and Bedford SB. In this form, with the entrance behind the front axle, the Embassy retained the dished oval grill and wrap-around windscreen of the Consort IV. The rear of both Panorama and Embassy comprised a two-piece curved glass window that wrapped around to meet the rearmost side pillars, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> were contained in a single unit with a fin-like top rather like the rear of the Ford Anglia 105E saloon.|$|E
25|$|The scene late in {{the film}} where Grier, Lawrence, and Murphy hug {{in front of the}} Empire State Building was shot around one or two o'clock in the morning, when the lights are usually shut off.

When editing the film, they simply reversed the footage to make it appear as if the lights were being turned on. The filmmakers even thought about ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate ending was shot where Angela is teaching the kids at the school and Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually came up with the released version.|$|E
