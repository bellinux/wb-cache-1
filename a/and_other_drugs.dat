40|$|Explores the {{prevalence}} of sexual violence <b>and</b> alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> use (AOD) in Australia. Summary This state of knowledge paper explores: 	{{the prevalence}} of sexual violence <b>and</b> alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> use (AOD) in Australia; 	the association between alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> use <b>and</b> severity of, or vulnerability to, sexual violence and re-victimisation; 	correlations between child sexual abuse and subsequent alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> use, <b>and</b> adult sexual abuse and subsequent alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> use; <b>and</b> 	current practice around identification, assessment, response and referral pathways between AOD and sexual assault services. The paper finds that despite methodological limitations in the literature, there is growing consensus that the sexual assault services sector and the AOD sector share {{a significant number of}} clients and that integrated or coordinated service provision is key. This work is part of the ANROWS Landscapes series. ANROWS Landscapes (State of knowledge papers) are medium length papers that scope current knowledge on an issue related to violence against women and their children. Papers will draw on empirical research, including research produced under ANROWS’s research program, and/or practice knowledge.  ...|$|R

5|$|John was {{the eldest}} child of Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol. He was distant from his father, who treated him harshly, {{and did not}} get on well with him, though {{he was close to}} his first stepmother, Lady Juliet. After {{spending}} time in London, Monte Carlo, Paris and New York in the 1970s, he settled in part of the family seat, Ickworth House in Suffolk, becoming the 7th Marquess in 1985. Despite inheriting a large fortune of up to £35 million, the Marquess spent most of it during his lifetime. He struggled with addiction to cocaine <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drugs,</b> serving several jail sentences for possession, and was known for his flamboyant lifestyle and homosexuality. His brief marriage in the mid-1980s did not last because of this, and he became increasingly depressed as he lost money and faced bankruptcy, culminating in the sale of the remainder of Ickworth House to the National Trust. He died in early 1999 of complications resulting from his drug addiction, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol.|$|E
5|$|Osbourne's regular use {{of alcohol}} <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drugs</b> led to his {{dismissal}} from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured many personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, {{as well as several}} drummers and bassists. In 1991, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer (1992). The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album Reunion. Black Sabbath's final studio album and nineteenth overall, 13 (2013), features all of the original members but Ward, who left the band prior to the recording sessions due to a contract dispute. A year after embarking on a farewell tour, the band played their final concert in their home city of Birmingham on 4 February 2017, after which they broke up. Iommi has stated that he has not ruled out the possibility of new material or one-off shows under the Black Sabbath name.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drugs.</b>|$|E
