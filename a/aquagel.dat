40|$|Most of the {{agricultural}} soils in Saudi Arabia are calcareous sandy soils. Some constraints of production in these soils are low water holding capacities, high infiltration rates, high evaporation rates and low water use efficiency. Remediation of these unfavorable properties by using synthetic soil conditioners is very costly. However, {{it is possible to}} overcome these constraints by using natural clay deposits. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of two local natural deposits on relative swelling index (RSI); intermittent evaporation (E), percentage of water conserved (PWC) and soil moisture distribution in calcareous sandy soil. The two natural deposits are commercially known as <b>AQUAGEL</b> and BENTONITE. Five rates 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 % of each deposit were added to a sandy calcareous soil. The results showed that addition of both deposits caused a considerable increase in RSI. The relationship between the RSI and concentrations of the natural deposits were expressed by exponential equation with R 2 equals 0. 991. The magnitude of the increase in RSI of the soil using 1, 2, 3, and 4 % <b>AQUAGEL</b> were 1. 69, 2. 96, 4. 6, and 7. 92 times that of the untreated soil, while for BENTONITE at the same concentrations, RSI were 1. 62, 2. 09, 4. 24 and 5. 77 times that of the control. The results also showed that the concentrations of natural deposits application were significantly effective in reducing the cumulative evaporation and have increased the percentage of water conserved in the soil columns. At {{the end of the last}} cycle, E at different rates ranked as follows: 0 > 4 > 1 > 2 > 3 % for <b>AQUAGEL</b> and 0 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 % for BENTONITE. After the termination of the experiment, PWC values at the rate of 1, 2, 3, and 4 % were 2. 34, 2. 66, 2. 93, and 2. 18 % times that of the control for <b>AQUAGEL,</b> and 1. 07, 1. 23, 2. 14 and 2. 81 times that of the control for BENONITE. It can be concluded that the addition of higher rates of <b>AQUAGEL</b> (above 3 %) caused more swelling effect and consequently increased the E and reduced PWC...|$|E

40|$|Starch {{microcellular}} foams (SMCF) containing pores in the micron {{size range}} may be prepared by pore-preserving drying processes, developing highly porous, high specific surface area materials useful for {{applications such as}} opacifying pigments or as adsorbent materials. The objective {{of this research was}} to understand how the exchange of water with ethanol, used as a pore preserving step, affected the dimensional properties of the starch material during and after processing. SMCF were prepared from molded <b>aquagels</b> of cooked corn starch that were subjected to ethanol exchanges with different time intervals (6, 12, or 48 hrs) and number of exchanges (1, 2, or 3) and then air dried. To study the transformation of water-swollen starch into precipitated starch foam in ethanol, the volume of the starch material was measured in the wet state after each exchange and after final air drying. As water is replaced by ethanol, the starch material contracts, with the greatest contraction during the first ethanol exchange. The amount of contraction during air drying decreased with decreased starch water content just before air drying, presumably due to less pore collapse of the stiffer cell walls on drying. Interestingly, the minimum density of 0. 37 g/cc SMCF was for the 12 hour exchange time, not the longest exchange time. Evidence of a skin-core morphology included SEM images as well as dimensional instability data on dried samples. The results indicate that SMCF of low density with fewer tendencies to deform during drying does not necessarily require extremely long exchange times...|$|R

40|$|Today, the {{majority}} of materials used for single-use packaging are petroleum-based synthetic polymers. With increased concern about the environmental protection, efforts {{have been made to}} develop alternative biodegradable materials from renewable resources. Starch offers an attractive alternative since it is of low cost and abundant. However, the starch material is brittle without plasticizer and the mechanical properties of starch materials are highly sensitive to moisture. In nature, the plant cell walls combine mechanical stiffness, strength and toughness despite a highly hydrated state. This interesting combination of properties is attributed to a network based on cellulose microfibrils. Inspired by this, microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) reinforced starch-based nanocomposites films and foams were prepared. Films with a viscous matrix and MFC contents from 10 to 70 wt% were successfully obtained by solvent casting. The films were characterized by DSC, DMA, FE-SEM, XRD, mercury density measurements, and dynamic water vapor sorption (DVS). At 70 wt% MFC content a high tensile strength together with high modulus and high work of fracture was observed. This was due to the nanofiber and matrix properties, favourable nanofiber-matrix interaction, a good dispersion of nanofibers and the MFC network. Novel nanocomposite foams were obtained by freeze-drying <b>aquagels</b> prepared from 8 wt% solutions of amylopectin starch and MFC. The MFC content was varied from 10 to 70 wt%. For composite foam with MFC contents up to 40 wt%, improved mechanical properties were observed in compression. The mechanical properties depended both on the cell wall properties and the cell-structure of the foam. The effect of moisture (20 - 80 % RH) on the dynamical properties of composite foam with 40 wt% MFC was also investigated and compared to those of neat starch foam. Improved storage modulus was noted with MFC content, which was a result of the nanofiber network in the cell-wall. In addition, the moisture content decreased with MFC content, due to the less hydrophilic nature of MFC. QC 2010111...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} various enzyme-catalysed {{approaches}} towards enantiopure cyanohydrins, which are important building blocks {{in both the}} pharmaceutical and agricultural industry. Common for the methods that have been investigated is that enzymes were used in combination with chemical catalysts in cascade reactions, either in one pot or in consecutive reactions without isolation of the intermediates. Chapter 1 contains an overview of this work, emphasizing the importance of immobilising, either of the enzyme or of the chemical catalyst, for these cascades to be successful. The preparation of (S) -Î³,Î´-unsaturated cyanohydrins in a two-step cascade reaction from Î³,Î´-unsaturated alcohols is described in chapter 2. First the alcohol is oxidised to the corresponding aldehyde utilizing catalytic amounts of immobilised TEMPO, and PhI(OAc) 2 as the stoichiometric oxidant. Due to the instability of the resulting aldehyde, the reaction mixture is used directly for the next step after filtering off the TEMPO and removing the acetic acid formed during the oxidation. The (S) -Î³,Î´-unsaturated cyanohydrins were obtained in a HbHNL-catalysed hydrocyanation of the aldehyde. Only by removing the TEMPO prior to the enzyme reaction, the products could be obtained in excellent optical purity. In chapter 3 a straightforward process for the encapsulation of HbHNL in sol-gels under low methanol conditions is developed. By adding a sol that was prepared by hydrolysis of TMOS/MTMS at pH 2. 8 with continuous removal of methanol to a stirred solution of the enzyme in a buffer at pH 6. 5, at least 65 % of {{the activity of the}} free enzyme could be recovered after the encapsulation. These <b>aquagels</b> were successfully used in the synthesis of (S) -cyanohydrins. Although the recycling of the gels failed, the method holds great potential for the encapsulation of other methanol sensitive enzymes. Chapter 4 describes a straightforward process for the preparation of optically active protected cyanohydrins. Lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALÂ­B) catalyses the kinetic resolution of racemic cyanohydrin acetates under mild conditions. The resulting labile cyanohydrins were reÂ­protected either via an enzyme-catalysed route, involving the addition of vinyl butyrate, or chemically after removal of the enzyme from the reaction mixture. This process gives access to both enantiomers in their pure form and in good yields, while reducing the risks due to HCN considerably. Moreover, a variety of different protection groups were introduced. The base- and lipase-catalysed enantioselective synthesis of cyanohydrin esters via a DKR was investigated (chapter 5) and the problem of previously reported low yields due to residual water in the reaction mixture was addressed. When the lipase was immobilised on Celite R- 633 as a carrier, both the enantioselectivity and the reaction times for this dynamic kinetic resolution improved, thus enabling a highly enantioselective synthesis of aromatic and heteroaromatic cyanohydrin acetates. When the standard conditions for the DKR described in chapter 5 were applied to aliphatic substrates, only a kinetic resolution was observed. This problem was solved (chapter 6) by exchanging the base (Amberlite IRA- 904 OH- form) against NaCN. Then, both quantitative conversions and good enantioselectivities could be obtained. This far, most of the work in the thesis has been focused on the synthesis of enantiopure cyanohydrins and mainly protected as their acetates. In chapter 7 a novel application of these compounds is investigated. The catalytic hydrogenation of acylated cyanohydrins, with subsequent intra-molecular migration of the acyl group to yield pharmaceutically interesting b-hydroxyamides, is shown to be a successful one-pot preparation method. The combination of a multistep DoE approach and high-throughput methodology proved to be an effective strategy for the optimization of the reaction. With the favoured catalyst/solvent combination nickel on alumina in dioxane, both hydrogenation and acyl-group migration proceeded smoothly, giving the b-hydroxyamides in yields of up to 90 % for aliphatic, and 50 % for benzylic substrates, which are more prone to side reactions. When enantiopure cyanohydrin esters were used, no racemization was found to occur at the chiral centre of an aliphatic molecule, though a minor decrease in ee was observed for a benzylic substrate.

In this research, encapsulation of Horseradish peroxidase-Glucose oxidase (HRP-GOx) enzymes in silica <b>aquagel</b> from rice hull ash by sol-gel process has been carried out. In addition, the effect of several parameters (weight ratio of HRP to GOx, pH, temperature, sodium ion concentration) on enzyme activity was studied, as well. Rice hull ash, which was produced by ashing at 700 °C, was extracted it's silika by NaOH solution 1 M at 100 °C for two hours to produce sodium silikate (Na 2 SiO 3) solution. The Na 2 SiO 3 solution with pH of 13 was added with a strong cation exchanger resin, to produce sol solution with the pH of 4. Encapsulation was emphasized by mixing sol solution and phosphate buffer pH 7 containing HRP-GOx solution at volume ratio of buffer to sol solution 1 : 5. The mixture was transferred into 96 -microwell plate and was aged for 24 hours. Enzymatic reaction {{was carried out by}} adding chromogenic solution of phenol and 4 -aminoantipyrine (4 -AAP) and b-D-glucose solution (as substrate) into the microwell. Enzymatic activity was examined by measuring absorbance of product solution at 490 nm with ELISA reader.

Results showed that at the investigated condition, HRP-GOx enzymes gave high activity at weight ratio of HRP to GOx 10 : 1 and pH 7 for both SGE and EB.

40|$|Bentonite {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{additives}} to cement to form grouts for completion of monitor wells. Recent studies have indicated that these grouts may not be the most appropriate method for completing monitor wells, because of fractures that form during curing of the grouts. Within grouts examined with optical microscopy, a reaction halo is present around the fracture. Further microprobe examinations indicate a zonation of elements around the fractures. Studies on cement-bentonite grouts that are used for slurry walls have indicated that montmorillonite dissolution and the formation of secondary minerals can lead to fracturing of the cement-bentonite grouts. This study will examine cement-bentonite grouts, which were used in the optical microscopy and microprobe study, to determine if secondary minerals can be identified. The study used powdered x-ray diffraction to examine the minerals present within four differently prepared cement-bentonite grouts and one neat cement grout. Three minerals were identified with x-ray diffraction in all mixtures of cement-bentonite grouts and the neat cement-grout. Those minerals were calcite, vaterite, and portlandite. The three minerals had variable intensities within each grout. There was one unidentified peak within the grouts that contained <b>Aquagel?.</b> Based on the results of the x-ray diffraction combined with the results of previous work, the unidentified peak was determined to be calcium silicate hydrate, which is a common secondary mineral formed from the dissolution of montmorillonite. It was concluded that the variation in intensity of the identified minerals was likely the result of excessive or inadequate hydration depending on the mixing method. It was also concluded that the fracturing within these grouts is the result of the dissolution of montmorillonite and formation of the secondary minerals. Based upon these results, it is clear that the common practice of completing monitor wells with cement-bentonite grouts in most geologic conditions is inappropriate. It is recommended that cement-bentonite grouts should only be used to complete monitor wells that are in fractured hard rocks, because the fracturing of the grout will be similar to that of the local rock...|$|E
40|$|For Thermal Power Company, Geothermal Division"The {{compilation}} of public geophysical {{data for the}} Kilauea east rift zone has been completed at a scale of 1 : 100, 000. The known geothermal resource is well expressed as a maximum in the self-potential data and as one of several resistivity lows in the electrical resistivity data base. Regional aeromagnetic data indicate a complex geologic structure for the east rift zone that is not apparent in the gravity or regional resistivity data. I conclude that a detailed, low level aeromagnetic survey offers the most promise for defining the subsurface structural features (and possibly the gross temperature distribution) of the east rift zone in a cost effective manner. The subsurface temperature data base {{is limited to a}} small portion (Puna area) of the east rift zone, and the self-potential data base is also incomplete. The HGP-A geothermal reservoir appears to be localized by the intersection of the center of the rift zone and a north-northwest trending structure, probably a transform fault. The structure is indicated by gravity, aeromagnetic, microearthquake and self-potential data. This reservoir is not well delineated by the resistivity data due to numerous problems in obtaining detailed electrical resistivity data in this volcanic environment. Although the HGP-A area appears to be the most promising setting for a geothermal reservoir, based on the existing data, a resistivity (8) and self-potential anomaly (A) seven kilometers southwest of HGP-A also seems promising. Other geothermal reservoirs may be present but not clearly indicated because of the irregular distribution of electrical resistivity, self-potential and well temperature data. A detailed, low level aeromagnetic survey is recommended as the highest priority for further exploration. Such a survey offers the possibility of determining the position and geometry of structural features and relative magnetizations along the rift. Suggested survey parameters are 1) line spacing no greater than 400 m in the Puna area but as much as 800 m for areas to the west; 2) a smoothly draped flight path between 200 and 300 meters above mean terrain level; 3) flight direction north-south or northwest perpendicular to the rift; 4) several tie lines along the trend of the rift to closely define irregularities within the rift itself. Acquisition of additional (proprietary) geophysical data may well be cost-effective if the duplication with existing data is not great, and the data are of good quality. It is apparent that all roads and trails of even marginal accessibility have been considered for ground electrical work (resistivity andself-potential) and acquiring new survey data without reasonable access will be both costly and slow. Pending a review of available proprietary data and detailed aeromagnetic data, preferably at a scale of 1 : 24, 000, the cost-effectiveness of new surveys should again be evaluated. Controlled source audiomagnetotelluric (CSAMT) may be a cost-effective technique for mapping the low resistivity second layer in detail, but the expected responses should be numerically modeled prior to undertaking new surveys. Seismic refraction surveys have provided a useful regional velocity model and the best estimates {{to the top of the}} dike complex. In a conceptual sense one would like to map the detailed velocity structure including and surrounding the geothermal areas. In practice this would be difficult to carry out, would require large receiver arrays and should be considered high risk in terms of results versus costs. Shot-to-receiver distances of 5 to 15 km would be required for velocity mapping for depths of one to two km. This would probably require charges greater than 10 pounds of <b>Aquagel,</b> based on Suyenaga's experience, and would dictate offshore or remote area shot locations. There may be some merit to considering refraction fan arrays in hopes of determining small velocity lags near the geothermal sites which could be interpreted in terms of fracturing or alteration. Any additional refraction surveys should be given a lower priority than the proposed detailed magnetic survey and the acquisition of proprietary resistivity data. There is much interest in determining the total power production potential for the east rift zone to facilitate economic planning. Present estimates of the lateral extent of the reservoir, based on microearthquake data must be considered premature and subject to considerable error. It is apparent that maps of microearthquake epicenter locations and density (i. e. Plate VII) are heavily biased by the location and extent of the seismographnet and the limited period of observation for the data reviewed here. A geometric definition of the reservoir through magnetic and resistivity data, integrated with multiple well production test results is required to determine the power generating potential of the known geothermal reservoir...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{organic and}} polymer layers on solid {{substrates}} {{play a key}} role in many processes aimed at modifying surface properties. Both "grafting to" and "grafting from" methods have been used in this project to modify a variety of surfaces including cellulose, resins and carbon nanotubes (CNT) with functional polymers. Living radical polymerisation and Huisgen [2 + 3] cycloaddition (often termed "click" reaction) were used to carry out these modifications. Living radical polymerisation was first used to synthesize different α-functional polymers and used for surface modification. For example, Living radical polymerisations of methyl methacrylate and a fluorescent comonomer with 2 -bromo- 2 -methyl-propionic acid 3 -azido-propyl ester and 2 -bromo- 2 -methyl-hept- 6 -yn- 3 -one as initiators have been successfully employed for the synthesis of fluorescently tagged azide and alkyne terminated PMMA with molecular weight (Mn) close to that predicted and polydispersity index (PDi) less than 1. 20 and good first order kinetics that would be expected for living radical polymerisation. Cotton and organic resin surfaces have been functionalised with alkyne groups using simple condensation with 4 -chlorocarbonyl-butyric acid prop- 2 -ynyl ester. The surfaces have been further modifies using a Huisgen [2 + 3] cycloaddition (click) reaction of both polymeric and small molecule azides. Different functional azides, namely mono azido-PEG and a new fluorescent hostasol derivative have also been prepared and tested as model substrates for cotton surface modification. This approach is shown to be very general allowing soft and hard surfaces with different geometries to be modified. In particular it is an excellent method to alter the nature of organic resins allowing the incorporation of many different functionalities. The covalent immobilization of a range of carbohydrate derivatives onto resin beads was then carried out. Copper-catalysed Huisgen [2 + 3] cycloaddition was used to graft mannose-containing azides to complementarily functionalised alkyne surfaces, namely: a) Wang resin or b) "Rasta" particles consisting of a "clickable" alkyne polymer loose outer shell and a Wang resin inner core. For the second approach, Wang resin beads were first converted into immobilized ATRP initiators, and then polymerisation of trimethylsilanyl-protected propargyl methacrylate followed by deprotection with TBAF· 3 H 2 O afforded the desired polyalkyne clickable scaffold. An appropriated α-mannopyranoside azide was then clicked onto it, to give a mannose functionalized "Rasta" resin. The binding abilities of these D-mannose-modified particles were then tested using fluorescein labelled Concanavalin A (Con A), a lectin known for its ability of binding certain mannose-containing molecules. Our preliminary results indicated that the novel glycohybrid materials presented in this work are able to efficiently recognize mannose-binding model lectins such as Con A, opening the way for their potential application in affinity chromatography, sensors and other protein recognition/separation fields. Other functional polymers with antibiotic or chiral properties were also grafted from surfaces. Living radical polymerisation of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and a metronidazole monomer (MTD-MA) has been successfully employed for the synthesis of antibiotic metronidazole containing polymers with Mn close to that predicted, narrow polydispersity and good first order kinetics that would be expected for living radical polymerisation. Using the monomers PEGMA and MTD-MA, with preformed immobilized initiator on cotton, surface initiated LRP was carried out to give cotton bearing antibiotic polymers. Surface initiated living radical polymerisation of GMA was then successfully carried out for the synthesis of PGMA containing bead base on <b>Aquagel</b> resin. The hydroxyl groups of the PGMA moiety were then reacted with a single enantiomer (R) -(+) - 1 - phenylethyl isocyanate (EtPhNCO). This demonstrates a convenient way of immobilise enantiomer moiety onto resin surface and the resulting solid support may be used as chiral stationary phases (CSP) for HPLC chromatography. To modify CNTs with functional polymers not only increase the dispersability of the CNTs, it has also enlarged the application areas of CNT’s due to the polymers' own functional properties. MWCNTs were first converted to a solid support LRP initiator by an esterification reaction and styrene was grafted from MWCNTs through surfaceinitiated LRP, the PSt modified CNTs were then used to form isoporous membranes. Similarly, Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrons were covalently attached to MWCNTs and dendron-MWCNT-Ag(0) hybrid materials were made afterwards which occurred via Ag(I) coordination to the PAMAM dendron nitrogen donors, followed by reduction with formaldehyde. Finally, noncovalent method was used to make a thermo-sensitive water soluble CNTs. The homopolymerisations and copolymerisation of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (DEGMA) using a pyrene-containing initiator and a Cu(0) /Me 6 -Tren catalyst system was investigated. The pyrenefunctionalised polymers synthesised were then used to modify CNTs and thus thermosensitive water-dispersible CNTs were made.

Although the HGP-A area appears to be the most promising setting for a geothermal reservoir, based on the existing data, a resistivity (8) and self-potential anomaly (A) seven kilometers southwest of HGP-A also seems promising. Other geothermal reservoirs may be present but not clearly indicated because of the irregular distribution of electrical resistivity, self-potential and well temperature data. A detailed, low level aeromagnetic survey is recommended as the highest priority for further exploration. Such a survey offers the possibility of determining the position and geometry of structural features and relative magnetizations along the rift. Suggested survey parameters are 1) line spacing no greater than 400 m in the Puna area but as much as 800 m for areas to the west; 2) a smoothly draped flight path between 200 and 300 meters above mean terrain level; 3) flight direction north-south or northwest perpendicular to the rift; 4) several tie lines along the trend of the rift to closely define irregularities within the rift itself. Acquisition of additional (proprietary) geophysical data may well be cost-effective if the duplication with existing data is not great, and the data are of good quality. It is apparent that all roads and trails of even marginal accessibility have been considered for ground electrical work (resistivity andself-potential) and acquiring new survey data without reasonable access will be both costly and slow. Pending a review of available proprietary data and detailed aeromagnetic data, preferably at a scale of 1 : 24, 000, the cost-effectiveness of new surveys should again be evaluated. Controlled source audiomagnetotelluric (CSAMT) may be a cost-effective technique for mapping the low resistivity second layer in detail, but the expected responses should be numerically modeled prior to undertaking new surveys. Seismic refraction surveys have provided a useful regional velocity model and the best estimates {{to the top of the}} dike complex. In a conceptual sense one would like to map the detailed velocity structure including and surrounding the geothermal areas. In practice this would be difficult to carry out, would require large receiver arrays and should be considered high risk in terms of results versus costs. Shot-to-receiver distances of 5 to 15 km would be required for velocity mapping for depths of one to two km. This would probably require charges greater than 10 pounds of <b>Aquagel,</b> based on Suyenaga's experience, and would dictate offshore or remote area shot locations. There may be some merit to considering refraction fan arrays in hopes of determining small velocity lags near the geothermal sites which could be interpreted in terms of fracturing or alteration. Any additional refraction surveys should be given a lower priority than the proposed detailed magnetic survey and the acquisition of proprietary resistivity data. There is much interest in determining the total power production potential for the east rift zone to facilitate economic planning. Present estimates of the lateral extent of the reservoir, based on microearthquake data must be considered premature and subject to considerable error. It is apparent that maps of microearthquake epicenter locations and density (i. e. Plate VII) are heavily biased by the location and extent of the seismographnet and the limited period of observation for the data reviewed here. A geometric definition of the reservoir through magnetic and resistivity data, integrated with multiple well production test results is required to determine the power generating potential of the known geothermal reservoir...|$|E
