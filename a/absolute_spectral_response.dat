40|$|Traditionally, {{satellite}} {{instruments that}} measure Earth-reflected solar radiation in the visible and near infrared wavelength regions have been calibrated for radiance response in a two-step method. In the first step, the <b>spectral</b> <b>response</b> {{of the instrument}} is determined using a nearly monochromatic light source, such a lamp-illuminated monochromator. Such sources only provide a relative <b>spectral</b> <b>response</b> (RSR) for the instrument, since they do not act as calibrated sources of light nor do they typically fill the field-of-view of the instrument. In the second step, the instrument views a calibrated source of broadband light, such as lamp-illuminated integrating sphere. In the traditional method, the RSR and the sphere spectral radiance are combined and, with the instrument's <b>response,</b> determine the <b>absolute</b> <b>spectral</b> radiance responsivity of the instrument. More recently, an absolute calibration system using widely tunable monochromatic laser systems has been developed, Using these sources, the <b>absolute</b> <b>spectral</b> responsivity (ASR) of an instrument can be determined on a wavelength-hy-wavelength basis.
