40|$|A Joss-Waldvogel type {{disdrometer}} {{was installed}} at Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, and Sreeharikotta (SHAR) during various periods. This paper presents {{results from the}} analysis of the data. Drop Size Distribution (DSD) and rainfall rate for each minute were computed from the disdrometer data, and the entire data for each month were sorted by rainfall rate. The data were then divided into different ranges of rainfall rate and DSD computed for each. The average DSD for each range was fitted with a lognormal distribution function of the form N(D) = (a 0 /D) exp (- 0. 5 (ln (D) -a 1) /a 2) 2 where D = drop diameter, N(D) = number of drops/m 3 /mm interval. The results show the following: For the lowest rainfall intensity, the distribution is narrow and is dominated by small drops. With increase in intensity, the distribution spreads out and more larger drops appear. However, in some cases, the data does not follow the lognormal distribution. The total number of drops, NT, geometric mean diameter, Dg and standard geometric deviation, σ was derived from the <b>ai.</b> <b>NT</b> showed a tendency to increase slightly with rainfall rate. Dg followed a simple power relationship of the form Dg = b 0 R b 1. The standard geometric deviation did not show any significant dependence on rainfall rate. The characteristics of rainfall in terms of the three parameters for coastal stations on the west coast are similar. The rate of increase of NT is higher at SHAR than at Kochi. NT is higher at SHAR than at Kochi for any particular rainfall rate, indicating that, unlike Kochi and other stations on the western coast, rainfall at SHAR is made up of more number of smaller drops...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Breast cancer {{patients}} {{have an increased}} risk of endometrial pathology. To investigate whether the incidence of endometrial abnormalities and their clinicopathological features were affected by receiving tamoxifen (TAM), non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (AIs) or no treatment (NT), 333 peri/postmenopausal breast {{cancer patients}}, who were referred to the Department of Gynecological, Obstetrical Sciences and Reproductive Medicine for gynecological assessment, were reviewed retrospectively. Transvaginal ultrasonographic (TVUS), hysteroscopic and histological findings were investigated. Endometrial histological find-ings included: atrophy in 61, 94. 3 and 55. 6 % of cases in the TAM, <b>AIs</b> and <b>NT</b> groups, respectively; polyps in 30. 9, 31. 4 and 42. 2 % of cases in the TAM, <b>AIs</b> and <b>NT</b> groups, respectively; hyperplasia in 3 % of patients in the TAM group and 11. 1 % of patients in the NT group; and cancer in 3. 8 % of cases in the TAM group and 11. 1 % of cases in the NT group. There was a significant correlation between the duration of TAM treatment and the severity of endometrial pathology. In all groups, there was a significant correlation between hysteroscopic and histological findings with regard to the diagnosis of endometrial atrophy, polyps, hyperplasia and cancer (P 3 mm, hysteroscopy with directed biopsy is the appropriate diagnostic method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Rapid {{progress}} is being made in our ability to modify the aging process. Rather than serving as a period of debility and decreasing health, for many people, the later years of life are becoming a period of continued productivity, independence and good health. Progress is also being made in increasing average lifespan. The leading causes of death (cardiovascular disease, cancer, lung disease, diabetes) are the end result of decades-long processes. With current knowledge, it is possible to delay the onset of these diseases. This can be assisted by lifestyle choices incorporating healthful diet, exercise, stress management, and nutritional supplementation. Emerging genomics technology will allow individuals to establish personalized programs, while early detection of heart disease and cancer will contribute to longevity. Biotechnological therapies involving stem cells, recombinant DNA, proteomics, therapeutic cloning and gene-based therapies are expected to play major roles in promoting successful aging. We are at the threshold of artificial intelligence (<b>AI)</b> and nanotechnology (<b>NT).</b> <b>AI</b> will allow for a merging of our biological thinking with advanced forms of non-biological intelligence to vastly expand our ability to think, create and experience. NT will ultimately allow us to build devices able to build molecules much like our current cellular machinery does, one atom at a time. It is the goal of today’s antiaging medicine to forestall disease and aging long enough for people to utilize the powerfu...|$|R
40|$|In cattle, 9 - 30 % of cloned pregnancies reach full terrn. Independent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that a large fraction of gestational failures occur within the first 50 days of pregnancy. From earlier microarray experiments conducted by our group we hypothesized that cloning disrupts WNT-related gene expression, resulting in abnormal signaling leading to pregnancy loss. To test this hypothesis, bovine gestations were initiated with embryos produced by artificial insemination (AI) or somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT). Samples of extraembryonic tissue (EET) and corresponding endometrium tissues (caruncle and intercaruncle) were collected at day- 18 (AI=ll, NT=lO) and 34 (AI= lO, NT= 08) of gestation. Using in situ hybridization, the mRNAs of WNTSA, FZD 4, FZDS, LRPS, CTNNB 1, GNA/ 2, AOF 2, BCL 2 L 1, SFRP 1, and DKK 1 genes were localized in the EET, whereas, SFRP 1 and DKK 1 were localized in the endometrial tissues. Additionally, the expression levels of WNT 5 A, FZDS, CTNNB 1, AOF 2, SFRP 1, and DKKJ were tested by quantitative PCR. Overall, the genes tested were localized in the same EET cell types in both cloned and control conceptuses. Similar levels of gene expression were observed between <b>NT</b> and <b>AI</b> samples from EET at day- 18 or trophoblast and allantois at day- 34. The exception was the higher expression of WNTSA in allantois from <b>NT</b> compared to <b>AI</b> samples. In trophoblast, WNT 5 A, FZDS, CTNNB 1 and DKK 1 increased mRNA expression from day- 18 to day- 34, while AOF and SFRPJ had a decrease in expression. Expression levels of these genes in endometrial tissue were similar between samples collected from uteruses harboring <b>AI</b> and <b>NT</b> embryos. In both caruncular and intercaruncular tissues, expression of WNT 5 A, FZD 5, CTNNBJ, AOF 2 was lower at day- 34 compared to day- 18. The exception was DKKJ, which had higher expression at day- 34 in intercaruncular tissue from AI compared to day- 18 samples. Our results demonstrate that WNT 5 A signaling is likely not {{a major factor in the}} failure of cattle clones to implant. Interestingly enough, the expression pattern of genes in WNT pathway suggests that non-canonical signal transduction is activated in trophoblast during the establishment of feto-matemal attachment...|$|R
