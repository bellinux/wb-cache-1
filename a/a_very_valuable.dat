5|$|Historical eclipses are <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>valuable</b> {{resource}} for historians, {{in that they}} allow a few historical events to be dated precisely, from which other dates and ancient calendars may be deduced. A solar eclipse of June 15, 763 BC mentioned in an Assyrian text {{is important for the}} chronology of the ancient Near East. There have been other claims to date earlier eclipses. The Book of Joshua 10:13 could refer to an annular eclipse on 30 October 1207 BC. The King Zhong Kang supposedly beheaded two astronomers, Hsi and Ho, who failed to predict an eclipse 4,000 years ago. Perhaps the earliest still-unproven claim is that of archaeologist Bruce Masse, who putatively links an eclipse that occurred on May 10, 2807 BC with a possible meteor impact in the Indian Ocean on the basis of several ancient flood myths that mention a total solar eclipse.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that auxiliaries received the substantial cash bonuses (donativum) handed to legionaries on the accession of a new emperor and other occasions. Although irregular, these payments (each worth 75 denarii to a common legionary) averaged once every 7.5 years in the early 1st century and every three years later. Duncan-Jones has suggested that donativa may have been paid to auxiliaries also from the time of Hadrian onwards, {{on the grounds that the}} total amount of donative to the military increased sharply at that time. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>valuable</b> benefit paid to legionaries was the discharge bonus (praemia) paid on completion of the full 25 years' service. At 3,000 denarii, this was equivalent to ten years' gross salary for a common legionary after the pay increase of 84AD. It would enable him to purchase a substantial plot of land. Again, there is no indication that auxiliaries were paid a discharge bonus. For auxiliaries, the discharge bonus was the grant of Roman citizenship, which carried important tax exemptions. However, Duncan-Jones argues that the fact that service in the auxilia was competitive with the legions (deduced from the many Roman citizens that joined the auxilia) that a discharge bonus may have been paid.|$|E

25|$|From the 15 {{original}} captaincies, only two, Pernambuco and São Vicente, prospered. The {{failure of}} most captaincies {{was related to}} the resistance of the indigenous people, shipwrecks and internal disputes between the colonizers. Pernambuco, the most successful captaincy, belonged to Duarte Coelho, who founded the city of Olinda in 1536. His captaincy prospered with sugarcane mills used to produce sugar, which were installed after 1542. Sugar was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>valuable</b> good in Europe, and its production became the main Brazilian colonial produce for the next 150 years.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with instructions from Spain, Cebrián y Agustín gathered ethnological, historical and statistical {{information about the}} colony. He directed the geographer José Antonio Villaseñor y Sánchez to prepare an official estimate {{of the population of}} New Spain, to be transmitted to the Court. The estimate was completed in April 1744, and the population was found to be 3,865,000. Another result of this information-gathering was Villaseñor's book, Theatro Americano, descripción general de los reinos y provincias de la Nueva España (2 vols., 1746–48). The work is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>valuable</b> source for colonial historians.|$|E
25|$|The sagas mention Icelanders {{traveling}} to Greenland to trade. Settlement chieftains and large farm owners controlled this trade. Chieftains would {{trade with the}} foreign ships and then disperse the goods by trading with the surrounding farmers. The Greenlanders' main commodity was the walrus tusk, which was used primarily in Europe {{as a substitute for}} elephant ivory for art décor, whose trade had been blocked by conflict with the Islamic world. Professor Gudmundsson suggests <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>valuable</b> narwhal tusk trade, through a smuggling route between western Iceland and the Orkney islands.|$|E
25|$|The {{non-deterministic}} property {{has been}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>valuable</b> one, as it lets the user abstract {{a large number}} of properties (depending on what the net is used for). In certain cases, however, the need arises to also model the timing, not only the structure of a model. For these cases, timed Petri nets have evolved, where there are transitions that are timed, and possibly transitions which are not timed (if there are, transitions that are not timed have a higher priority than timed ones). A subsidiary of timed Petri nets are the stochastic Petri nets that add nondeterministic time through adjustable randomness of the transitions. The exponential random distribution is usually used to 'time' these nets. In this case, the nets' reachability graph {{can be used as a}} continuous time Markov chain (CTMC).|$|E

25|$|During a {{party at}} the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is {{pregnant}} with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>valuable</b> piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.|$|E
25|$|While the Snows {{were settled}} back in America, Ed would {{continue}} to travel {{back and forth between}} home and Europe. His books and reporting on China had earned him critical acclaim in the U.S. This success made Ed <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>valuable</b> asset as a war correspondent. President Roosevelt often looked to Ed for his understanding on matters in Asia. Roosevelt personally suggested Ed become a war correspondent once again, to which Ed agreed. Though {{he did not want to}} report on World War II directly after his time in China, his personal struggles with Helen and encouragement from Roosevelt pushed Ed to travel and cover the war. In 1945, the couple legally separated. Ed started a new relationship with actress Lois Wheeler and sought a divorce from Helen. The divorce proceedings took several years as the two were stalemated in terms of settlement. The couple formally divorced in 1949. Ed married Lois less than ten days after the official date of the divorce. He lived in exile in Switzerland until he died from cancer in 1972.|$|E
25|$|All Medicare Advantage {{plans are}} {{required}} to limit out-of-pocket (OOP) spending by a beneficiary for Parts A and B {{to no more than}} $6,700 (as of 2016) per year for in-network providers. The OOP limit may be higher for out of network providers in a PPO; out of network providers are typically not permitted in an HMO. The average OOP limit in 2016 is around $5000. Note that an OOP limit is not a deductible as is often reported; it is instead <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>valuable</b> financial-protection benefit although is very rare that a Medicare Advantage beneficiary spends anywhere near the amount of his or her annual OOP limit. Original Medicare provides no similar OOP spending cap and the exposure of an Original Medicare beneficiary to a financial catastrophe is unlimited (but equally rare). Once the OOP maximum is reached for an individual, the plan will pay 100% of medical services {{for the remainder of the}} calendar year, with no lifetime maximum. This OOP limit does not apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered drug coverage (which has its own different means of addressing catastrophic costs).|$|E
