40|$|The OECD Competition Committee debated {{competitive}} {{effects of}} land <b>use</b> <b>restrictions</b> in February 2008. Land <b>use</b> <b>restrictions</b> often serve valuable social purposes. The benefits of particular policies for land use must be balanced against the costs, though. The social harms that can arise when land <b>use</b> <b>restrictions</b> create “entry barriers” are rarely considered explicitly. Land <b>use</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{can raise the}} price and reduce supply of {{a broad range of}} real estate and, by preventing new and innovative stores from opening, reduce shopping options available to consumers. More careful integration of policy on land <b>use</b> <b>restrictions</b> with competition policy could benefit consumers and many entrepreneurs and reduce the likelihood that public or private restrictions will lead to supply scarcity. This roundtable examines competition problems affecting commercial construction and use permits, geographic density tests, adverse impact tests, access condition to rights of ay and private <b>restrictions</b> on land <b>use.</b> Steps are identified for improving public policies towards land <b>use</b> <b>restrictions.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the {{analysis}} of genetic <b>use</b> <b>restriction</b> technologies (GURTs) {{from the perspective of the}} diffusion of crop improvements to developing countries. One of the possible consequences of genetic <b>use</b> <b>restriction</b> technologies is a distinct downward shift in the growth trajectories of agricultural productivity in developing countries by restricting the flow of innovations to which these countries have had access in the past. In this case, developing countries are likely to face cumulative losses in agricultural productivity growth as a result of widespread adoption of GURTs by crop innovators. This paper presents the results of a study on hybrid crops, a precursor technology, to establish the negative effect of <b>use</b> <b>restriction</b> technologies on diffusion and discusses the implications of widespread use of GURTs for developing countries.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{determinants}} of moral obligation of car use reduction {{and acceptance of}} car <b>use</b> <b>restriction</b> were investigated. This was based on attitudinal image variables for cars and public transport, including symbolic/affective, instrumental, and social orderliness attitudinal-aspects. Attitudinal data were collected {{by means of a}} questionnaire survey in Japan and Thailand, specifically in the cities of Tokyo (n = 402), Bangkok (n = 100), and Ubon Ratchathani (n = 76). Results from structural equation modeling indicated that image variables had no effect on the acceptance of car <b>use</b> <b>restriction</b> in Thailand; however, some image variables had certain impacts in Japan. The findings imply that communicative strategies to change the image of car and public transport would be effective in increasing public acceptance of coercive transportation measures in Japan, but such strategies might not be promising in Thailand. In addition, it was found that fewer attitudinal-aspects of car use had significant effects on a moral obligation to reduce car use and acceptance of car <b>use</b> <b>restriction</b> in Thailand than in Japan. This finding also implies that it might not be easy to reduce car use in Thailand by utilizing communicative measures such as mobility management that have proven to be effective in Japan...|$|R
