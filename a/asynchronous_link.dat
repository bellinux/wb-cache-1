40|$|Several {{multilevel}} converter topologies have stimulated widespread interests amongst researchers {{because they}} have the capabilities of (i) reaching high voltage ratings without magnetics and transformers and (ii) attaining low Total Harmonic Distortions (THD), using the low switching frequencies of gate-turn-off thyristors (GTOS). This thesis focuses on the diode-clamped multilevel converter topology as the basic module for realizing the high kV voltage rating and the high MVA rating in controllers for the Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS). The thesis has extended the topology configurations to include: (i) multiple modules of multilevel converters and (ii) multimodules of multilevel converters in a back-to-back rectifier/inverter link. These configurations form the backbones for the following multilevel FACTS controllers: (a) the Shunt STAT(ic) COM(pensator), (b) the Series STATCOM, (c) the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) and (d) the <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>Link.</b> A number of key technical innovations have been assembled together to make the new multilevel FACTS controllers possible. On the sides of the ac lines, the Fundamental Frequency Switching strategy has been extended so that it succeeds in simultaneously (a) lowering the Total Harmonic Distortions in the voltage and current waveforms, (b) controlling directly the ac voltage magnitudes, and (c) sharing the current loading in the parallel modules.

This paper focuses {{on some of those}} areas related to {{home automation}}. The paper draws attention to wireless communications issues on embedded systems. Specifically, the paper discusses the multi-hop networking together with Bluetooth technology and latency, as a quality of service (QoS) metric.

40|$|The Network-on-Chip (NoC) {{paradigm}} {{has been}} proposed as a potentially viable onchip communication infrastructure for multiprocessor SoC. This thesis investigates the development and validation of efficient links that improve NoC performance, power consumption and reliability. There is emphasis on low-level simulation and validation of the NoC links throughout and gate level circuits are given to provide practical implementations. The {{first part of the}} thesis investigates the use of compression in bit-serial point-to-point links as a means of increasing the available bandwidth of the links in NoC. A bit-serial link reduces the cost of interconnect by reducing the number of wires, but at the expense of reduced throughput. Compression is used to improve the throughput of the serial link by reducing the amount of data transmitted through unused significant bit removal. The compression is performed in real time and the overhead of the extra circuitry is small. The link is modelled in VHDL and simulated to check functionality and correct operation. The second part of the thesis investigates the development of serial asynchronous links to overcome issues such as power and interconnect area overhead in NoC links. Serialization is used to reduce the interconnect cost of a link by reducing the number of wires needed. The combination of asynchronous circuitry and serialization allows for a lower wiring area and reduced power NoC link, in particular for increased link length. The serial <b>asynchronous</b> <b>link</b> is compared to a fully synchronous link of similar characteristics. Power, area and throughput is compared between the asynchronous and synchronous solutions. Validation is performed on FPGA to confirm the correct functionality of the serialized <b>asynchronous</b> <b>link.</b> Unreliability due to soft errors is becoming an issue with scaling of technology. The third part of the thesis investigates a novel data coding technique for the asynchronous links developed earlier which offers resilience to soft errors. Resilience is achieved by coding the data using symbols for each bit and a common reference so that transient errors on the NoC link wires can be detected by comparing the symbols and reference to obtain validity of the data and the value of the data.

40|$|The {{squirrel-cage}} {{induction machine}} is very attractive for small and medium power generation schemes {{because of its}} low cost, robustness and high power density (W/kg). However, the magnitude {{and the frequency of}} the generated voltage depend upon the rotor speed, the amount of capacitive excitation, and the load in stand-alone systems with unregulated prime movers.

This thesis investigates the use of a single reduced rating ac-dc converter, or voltage source inverter (VSI), connected to the stator of a self-excited induction generator (SEIG) for regulating purposes. Reactive power control is used to regulate the voltage magnitude while active power control, made possible by using a battery bank at the dc side of the VSI, regulates the voltage frequency.

40|$|A network-on-chip (NoC), the de-facto {{communication}} backbone in manycore processors, consumes {{a significant}} portion of total chip power, competing against the computation cores for the limited power and thermal budget. On the other hand, overall system performance of manycore chips increasingly relies on on-chip latency and bandwidth as core counts scale. This thesis aims to design low-power yet high-performance NoCs through circuit and microarchitecture co-design contrary to the traditional approaches where NoCs sacrifice latency and/or bandwidth for low-power operation; then demonstrate such design concepts through test chip prototyping, enabling detailed measurements for rigorous analysis of {{the pros and cons of}} the proposed NoCs. The thesis starts with a 4 x 4 mesh NoC chip prototype that tries to simultaneously optimize energy, latency and throughput for all kinds of traffic (unicasts, multicasts and broadcasts). Its extensive experiment results make it possible to accurately analyze energy/performance benefits and timing/area overheads of the virtually bypassed, multicast-optimized router design; energy savings, area overheads and reduced reliability of the clocked low-swing datapath circuits; and a power gap between simulated estimations and measurement results. Next demonstrated is a link test chip of two clockless low-swing repeater designs, a self-resetting logic repeater (SRLR) optimized for transmission energy and a voltage-locked repeater (VLR) for transmission delay. This second chip prototype shows that the clockless, single-ended low-swing signaling of SRLRs armed with variation-robust circuit techniques has lower energy and smaller area than clocked, differential lowswing signaling. Featured with lower delay than full-swing repeaters, VLRs provide the fundamental building block to the single-cycle reconfigurable NoC that enables potential power saving at architecture level through single-cycle multi-hop <b>asynchronous</b> <b>link</b> traversal on dynamically configurable routes. The last one-third of this thesis explores a 3 D-IC chip prototype of a throughsilicon via (TSV) interconnect that can support simultaneously bi-directional (SBD) signaling. While TSVs, as 3 D-IC NoC links, offer an appealing solution to manycore architectures that require huge off-die bandwidth, existing TSV technologies impose considerable power and area overheads (using spare TSVs) to improve reliability. The proposed SBD TSV circuit shows better energy efficiency and smaller area than unidirectional TSVs, thus providing reliable 3 D signaling within tight power/silicon budget. Such SBD signaling also enables configurable off-die bandwidth, and hence, can be the basis of a bandwidth-adaptive 3 D NoC that efficiently supports highly dynamic traffic on manycore chips. by Sunghyun Park.

40|$|Abstract—To {{accommodate}} {{the growing number}} of applications integrated on a single chip, Networks on Chip (NoC) must offer scalability not only on the architectural, but also on the physical and functional level. In addition, real-time applications require Guaranteed Services (GS), with latency and throughput bounds. Traditionally, NoC architectures only deliver scalability on two of the aforementioned three levels, or do not offer GS. In this paper we present the composable and predictable aelite NoC architecture, that offers only GS, based on flit-synchronous Time Division Multiplexing (TDM). In contrast to other TDMbased NoCs, scalability on the physical level is achieved by using mesochronous or <b>asynchronous</b> <b>links.</b> Functional scalability is accomplished by completely isolating applications, and by having a router architecture that does not limit the number of service levels or connections.
