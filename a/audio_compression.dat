5|$|DAB {{has also}} been marketed as having two major {{advantages}} over analogue radio broadcasting in that using MPEG-1 Audio Layer II lossy <b>audio</b> <b>compression</b> technology and more recently DAB+ using High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding, parts of the audio spectrum that cannot be heard by humans are discarded, meaning less data needs to be sent over the air. This, as well as multiplexing technology, allows a number of channels to be broadcast together on one frequency as opposed to one channel for analogue radio broadcasts.|$|E

25|$|Both Krasner and Schroeder {{built upon}} the work {{performed}} by Eberhard F. Zwicker {{in the areas}} of tuning and masking of critical frequency bands, that in turn built on the fundamental research in the area from Bell Labs of Harvey Fletcher and his collaborators. A wide variety of (mostly perceptual) <b>audio</b> <b>compression</b> algorithms were reported in IEEE's refereed Journal on Selected Areas in Communications. That journal reported in February 1988 {{on a wide range of}} established, working audio bit compression technologies, some of them using auditory masking as part of their fundamental design, and several showing real-time hardware implementations.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{there were}} two {{available}} proposals that were assessed for an MPEG audio standard: MUSICAM (Masking pattern adapted Universal Subband Integrated Coding And Multiplexing) and ASPEC (Adaptive Spectral Perceptual Entropy Coding). As proposed by the Dutch corporation Philips, the French research institute CCETT, and the German standards organization Institute for Broadcast Technology, the MUSICAM technique was chosen due to its simplicity and error robustness, {{as well as for}} its high level of computational efficiency. The MUSICAM format, based on sub-band coding, became the basis for the MPEG <b>Audio</b> <b>compression</b> format, incorporating, for example, its frame structure, header format, sample rates, etc.|$|E

25|$|Other lossy formats exist. Among these, mp3PRO, AAC, and MP2 are {{all members}} of the same {{technological}} family as MP3 and depend on roughly similar psychoacoustic models. The Fraunhofer Society owns many of the basic patents underlying these formats as well, with others held by Alcatel-Lucent, and Thomson Consumer Electronics. There are also open compression formats like Opus and Vorbis that are available free of charge and without any known patent restrictions. Some of the newer <b>audio</b> <b>compression</b> formats, such as AAC, WMA Pro and Vorbis, are free of some limitations inherent to the MP3 format that cannot be overcome by any MP3 encoder.|$|E
25|$|QuickTime 3.0 {{added support}} for {{graphics}} importer components that could read images from GIF, JPEG, TIFF and other file formats, and video output components which served primarily to export movie data via FireWire. Apple also licensed several third-party technologies {{for inclusion in}} QuickTime 3.0, including the Sorenson Video codec for advanced video compression, the QDesign Music codec for substantial <b>audio</b> <b>compression,</b> and the complete Roland Sound Canvas instrument set and GS Format extensions for improved playback of MIDI music files. It also added video effects which programmers could apply in real-time to video tracks. Some of these effects would even respond to mouse clicks by the user, {{as part of the}} new movie interaction support (known as wired movies).|$|E
25|$|Psychoacoustics {{is applied}} within many fields from {{software}} development, where developers map proven and experimental mathematical patterns; in digital signal processing, where many <b>audio</b> <b>compression</b> codecs such as MP3 and Opus use a psychoacoustic model to increase compression ratios; {{in the design}} of (high end) audio systems for accurate reproduction of music in theatres and homes; as well as defense systems where scientists have experimented with limited success in creating new acoustic weapons, which emit frequencies that may impair, harm, or kill. It is also applied today within music, where musicians and artists continue to create new auditory experiences by masking unwanted frequencies of instruments, causing other frequencies to be enhanced. Yet another application is {{in the design of}} small or lower-quality loudspeakers, which can use the phenomenon of missing fundamentals to give the effect of bass notes at lower frequencies than the loudspeakers are physically able to produce (see references).|$|E

500|$|In digital {{television}} broadcasting, {{there are three}} competing standards {{that are likely to}} be adopted worldwide. These are the ATSC, DVB and ISDB standards; the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All three standards use MPEG-2 for video compression. ATSC uses Dolby Digital AC-3 for <b>audio</b> <b>compression,</b> ISDB uses Advanced Audio Coding (MPEG-2 Part 7) and DVB has no standard for <b>audio</b> <b>compression</b> but typically uses MPEG-1 Part 3 Layer 2. The choice of modulation also varies between the schemes. In digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the Digital Audio Broadcasting standard (also known as the Eureka 147 standard). The exception is the United States which has chosen to adopt HD Radio. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a transmission method known as in-band on-channel transmission that allows digital information to [...] "piggyback" [...] on normal AM or FM analog transmissions.|$|E
500|$|Nintendo Power {{praised the}} story {{and the number of}} lightsaber combos but criticized the game's {{easiness}} and hack-and-slash gameplay. It also praised the Wii version for its story and Force powers, but criticized the game's lightsaber controls and linear gameplay. GameSpot noticed visual glitches and problematic <b>audio</b> <b>compression</b> that detracted from the Wii version's [...] "mature and exciting" [...] story, adding that the reduced number of Force-manipulable objects helps mitigate the targeting problems experienced on other platforms. Referring to the Wii remote and nunchuck controls, GameSpot also speculated that The Force Unleashed is [...] "possibly the most waggle-heavy" [...] Wii game. Zero Punctuation criticized the Wii version's graphics and compared lightsaber combat to [...] "trying to follow an aerobics routine with both your arms tied to different windmills". The ability to upgrade Starkiller's abilities in the PS2 version, according to IGN, is not as [...] "robust" [...] as it should be, and the game's targeting system is sometimes frustrating. IGN said the PS2's real-time cutscene rendering made Starkiller seem emotionless, and that pre-rendered cutscenes would have been better. GameSpot found the DS version's plot interesting but the storytelling itself [...] "lackluster". While the DS version is easy, with Starkiller killing enemies [...] "like a hot knife through butter", GameSpot said the player's sense of power is not matched by a sense of freedom. GameSpot called the PSP version's camera [...] "unwieldy", but added that smaller and less cluttered environments make the targeting system less frustrating than on other platforms. The Wii version was a nominee for multiple Wii-specific awards from IGN in its 2008 video game awards, including Best Story and Best Voice Acting.|$|E
2500|$|... mp3PRO is an unmaintained {{proprietary}} <b>audio</b> <b>compression</b> codec {{that combines}} the MP3 audio format with the spectral band replication (SBR) compression method. At {{the time it}} was developed it could reduce the size of a stereo MP3 by as much as 50% while maintaining the same relative quality. This works, fundamentally, by discarding the higher half of the frequency range and algorithmically replicating that information while decoding.|$|E

50|$|Disadvantages include being {{dependent}} on a single source for telephony, such that if the nearest cell tower experiences an outage, there is no landline {{to use as a}} backup for anything except emergency calls. The companding, <b>audio</b> level <b>compression,</b> and <b>audio</b> data <b>compression</b> used in mobile telephony also ruin any data signals used by modem-based devices, including fax machines, medical monitoring devices, and even set-top boxes for satellite TV, preventing their use for anything except displaying the caller ID for incoming calls.|$|R
2500|$|VCD's most {{noticeable}} disadvantage compared to DVD is image quality, due {{both to the}} more aggressive compression necessary to fit video into such a small capacity {{as well as the}} compression method used. Additionally, VCDs are available only in stereo, while DVDs are capable of six channels of discrete surround sound. [...] The <b>audio</b> <b>compression</b> of VCDs also suffers from not being able to pull off the Haas effect for matrixed surround sound.|$|E
2500|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, a cosine filter is used to smooth {{the rise and fall}} times of the audio {{waveform}} and eliminate key clicks. [...] All subsequent amplification of the signal must be linear to preserve the modulation waveform and ensure minimum occupied bandwidth. In practice, this means limiting the transmit audio volume to below the level where the transmitter generates [...] Automatic Level Control (ALC) feedback and disabling any <b>audio</b> <b>compression</b> or speech processing.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Levitin {{consulted}} for M Sound {{as an expert}} listener assisting {{in the design of}} the first commercial satellite and subwoofer loudspeaker systems, an early version of which were used by Steely Dan for mixing their album Pretzel Logic (1974). [...] Following that, he worked at A Broun Sound in San Rafael, California, building speaker cabinets for The Grateful Dead, for whom he later worked as a consulting record producer. [...] Levitin was one of the golden ears used in the first Dolby AC <b>audio</b> <b>compression</b> tests, a precursor to MP3 <b>audio</b> <b>compression.</b> From 1984–1988, he worked as Director and then Vice President of A for 415 Records in San Francisco, becoming President of the label in 1989 before the label was sold to Sony Music. [...] Notable achievements during that time included producing the punk classic Here Come the Cops by The Afflicted (named among the Top 10 records of 1985 by GQ magazine); engineering records by Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers, Santana, and the Grateful Dead; and producing tracks for Blue Öyster Cult, the soundtrack to Repo Man (1984), and others. Two highlights of his tenure in A were discovering the band The Big Race (which later became the well-known soundtrack band Pray for Rain); and for having had the chance to, but not signing M.C.

2500|$|Examples {{of common}} re-amping {{objectives}} include taking a pre-recorded electric guitar track and adding musically pleasing amplifier distortion/overdrive, room tone such as reverb, <b>audio</b> <b>compression,</b> EQ/filters, envelope followers, resonance, and gating. Re-amping {{is often used}} to [...] "warm up" [...] dry tracks, which often means adding complex, musically interesting effects. By playing a dry signal through a studio's main monitors and then using room mics to capture the ambiance, engineers are able to create realistic reverbs and blend the [...] "wet" [...] (modified) signal with the original dry recorded sound to achieve the desired amount of depth.|$|E
2500|$|It {{can explain}} how a sharp clap {{of the hands}} might seem painfully loud in a quiet library, but is hardly {{noticeable}} after a car backfires on a busy, urban street. [...] This provides great benefit to the overall compression ratio, and psychoacoustic analysis routinely leads to compressed music files that are 1/10th to 1/12th the size of high quality masters, but with discernibly less proportional quality loss. Such compression is a feature of nearly all modern lossy <b>audio</b> <b>compression</b> formats. Some of these formats include Dolby Digital (AC-3), MP3, Opus, Ogg Vorbis, AAC, WMA, MPEG-1 Layer II (used for digital audio broadcasting in several countries) and ATRAC, the compression used in MiniDisc and some Walkman models.|$|E
2500|$|These {{different}} {{boundary conditions}} strongly affect the {{applications of the}} transform and lead to uniquely useful properties for the various DCT types. [...] Most directly, when using Fourier-related transforms to solve partial differential equations by spectral methods, the boundary conditions are directly specified {{as a part of}} the problem being solved. [...] Or, for the MDCT (based on the type-IV DCT), the boundary conditions are intimately involved in the MDCT's critical property of time-domain aliasing cancellation. [...] In a more subtle fashion, the boundary conditions are responsible for the [...] "energy compactification" [...] properties that make DCTs useful for image and <b>audio</b> <b>compression,</b> because the boundaries affect the rate of convergence of any Fourier-like series.|$|E
