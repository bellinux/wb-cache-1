5|$|In Norse mythology, Iðunn is {{a goddess}} {{associated}} with apples and youth. Iðunn is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, {{written in the}} 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.

5|$|Hugh was <b>a</b> <b>keeper</b> of the king's seal, {{serving as}} deputy to Simon of Wells, the Archdeacon of Wells who was Keeper of the Great Seal from around 1199 to 1204. Simon {{was also a}} {{relative}} of Hugh's, and seems to have helped secure positions for both Hugh and Jocelin in the royal administration. Hugh was a royal clerk in the chancery, the royal secretariat, and was named Archdeacon of Wells sometime before 25 April 1204.

5|$|The game's prologue sees Garrett, the protagonist, {{describing}} his youth as a homeless orphan on the City's streets. He is caught {{while attempting to}} pickpocket a suspicious man who reveals himself to be <b>a</b> <b>Keeper.</b> Impressed by Garrett's ability to see him, he offers him the chance to join his order. Garrett accepts, but later leaves the order to pursue a life of thievery. Years later, Garrett works as a thief, and is under pressure to join a crime ring. As punishment for his failure to pay a protection fee, he is targeted for assassination by the crime lord Ramirez. Garrett evades the assassins, and robs Ramirez's mansion in retaliation. Following this, he is approached by a woman named Viktoria—the representative of an anonymous client who was impressed by Garrett's theft from Ramirez. He is contracted to steal a sword from Constantine, an eccentric nobleman who recently arrived in the City. After Garrett completes the mission, Viktoria takes him to Constantine, who explains that he hired Garrett to steal his own sword as a test. Constantine offers him a fortune to steal The Eye—a gem kept within a sealed and deserted Hammerite cathedral.|$|E

25|$|Sir George Crichton {{handed over}} the Crichton lands, {{including}} Blackness Castle, to James II in 1453.

25|$|A well {{recorded}} as Bloak Well was first discovered in 1800, around 1826 (Paterson 1866) or 1810 or 1800, {{by the fact}} that pigeons from Lainshaw House and the neighbouring parishes were found to flock here to drink. Mr. Cunningham of Lainshaw built a handsome house over the well in 1833 and appointed <b>a</b> <b>keeper</b> {{to take care of it}} as the mineral water was of some value owing to healing properties attributed to it. The well was located in the middle of the kitchen.|$|E
25|$|Naultinus {{are also}} kept in captivity by enthusiasts in {{overseas}} countries {{but it should}} be stressed that trade is incredibly difficult, and one must obtain adequate CITES permits for importation and exportation. This process is regulated by the CITES Management Authority, which ascertains whether or not founding stock were obtained by <b>a</b> <b>keeper</b> in a particular country prior to 1981. This is often quite difficult, and usually prohibitive of international trade between Europe (where most stock resides outside of New Zealand) and other countries.|$|E
