The methodology employed {{for data collection}} is only primary source, which involved the use of questionnaires, in which 100 questionnaire were administered to the selected bank staff, out of which only 92 questionnaires were completed and returned. Also this study make use of Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) annual reports for data relating to total <b>amount</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>frauds</b> and forgeries, ten banks with the highest fraud cases and categories of bank staff <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>frauds</b> and forgeries. The paper concludes that {{in the fight for}} the prevention of fraud, banks should have in place sound/effective internal control mechanism/checks and balances and provide adequate remuneration and reward for excellence and good conduct while the incessant and periodic downsizing of bank staffs should be discouraged. There should be steadfastness in punishing offenders and adoption of zero tolerance to corruption. The society should imbibe cultural value system of treating fraudsters with contempt...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the volume}} and {{frequency}} of fraudulent practices in Nigerian banks {{have been on the}} increase with obvious implications on bank performance. The performance of Nigerian banking industry is a product of its returns and services rendered to the public as a whole. However, the occurrence and frequency of <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> the banking sector over the years has negatively affected the performance of these banks in Nigeria. It is on this note that this paper examines the problem of fraud and its implications for bank performance in Nigeria through empirical analysis. The sources of data used for the paper were extracted from the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) Annual Report from 2004 to 2009. Statistical methods such as parametric table and Pearson correlation were employed in the evaluation of the data. The study revealed that Nigerian banks recorded the highest <b>fraud</b> cases <b>in</b> 2008. The result of the hypothesis shows that, there is a significant relationship between total <b>amount</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>fraud</b> cases and bank’s profit. On this note, it was recommended that fraud can be reduced by complying effectively with the policy measures which the government, monetary and supervisory authorities designed to curb the menace of bank <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the application of}} forensic auditing <b>in</b> <b>fraud</b> control <b>in</b> Nigerian banks. Nigerian banks over the past decades suffered from the menace of frauds which resulted to distresses and liquidations which hamper the roles of banks in the economy. The external auditors failed to detect the <b>frauds</b> <b>in</b> the course of carrying out their work. Regulatory evidences have shown that bank frauds increase on daily basis. Analysis {{of the types of}} frauds and forgeries perpetrated show that the most common types are: ATM fraud; fraudulent transfers/withdrawals; internet banking; lodgement of stolen warrants; presentation of forged cheques; suppression of customer deposit. The study analysed the trend <b>in</b> <b>fraud</b> cases from 2001 - 2012, included are the <b>amounts</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>frauds,</b> the most frequent types of fraud, and the losses sustained by banks. The analysis revealed that there are up and down movements <b>in</b> <b>fraud</b> cases. Since banks continually lose huge sums of money {{as a result of the}} inability of the auditors and the supervisory regulators to curtail the trend, there is therefore the need to devise different means of tackling <b>frauds</b> <b>in</b> the banks. The study therefore suggests employment of forensic auditing in Nigerian banks by amending the existing statutes, in such a way that forensic auditors are included in the audit team. Through this, auditors will have more tools to effectively deal with challenges in detecting frau...|$|R
40|$|White-collar {{crime is}} {{financial}} crime committed by white-collar criminals. Sensational white-collar crime cases regularly {{appear in the}} international business press and studies in journals of ethics and crime. Many of these scholars apply anecdotal evidence to suggest what might be included and what might be excluded from the concepts of white-collar crime and white-collar criminals. On contrast, with a larger sample, we can study white-collar crime convictions using statistical techniques to identify relationships between variables. For example, {{it has been suggested}} that the <b>amount</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the crime (<b>fraud,</b> corruption, etc.) is an important factor when the judge decides the length of the prison sentence. In our sample of 255 criminal cases we identified 88 corporate criminals and 167 occupational criminals. Age when convicted was 47 years for occupational criminals and 49 years for corporate criminals. Furthermore, occupational criminals served 2. 2 years in prison, while corporate criminals served only 2. 1 years. This is particularly interesting, when the amount of money that was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the crime is taken into account. While occupational criminals on average abused 26 million Norwegian kroner, corporate criminals on average abused as much as 121 million Norwegian kroner. So, even if the magnitude of the financial crime in terms of money was substantially and significantly larger for corporate crime, occupational crime was nevertheless judged more severely in terms of imprisonment...|$|R
