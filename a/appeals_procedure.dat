25|$|Sandiford {{subsequently}} {{launched an}} appeal against the court's decision. She had funded her own defence costs {{during the initial}} trial but had no money for representation at appeal. Funds were subsequently raised {{to pay for an}} appeal lawyer, and the <b>appeals</b> <b>procedure</b> began. In the United Kingdom lawyers applied to seek a judicial review of the government's stance of not providing financial aid for Britons facing criminal proceedings overseas, but their legal challenge was dismissed by judges at the High Court of England and Wales on the grounds that Sandiford had little chance in successfully appealing the sentence. An appeal arguing the government's position was unlawful was also rejected. The British government submitted a statement to the Court in Bali alleging unlawful behaviour towards Sandiford by officials {{at the time of her}} arrest. The High Court in Bali rejected the first stage of Sandiford's appeal in April 2013, upholding the death sentence. An appeal was subsequently lodged with the country's Supreme Court, but in August this was also rejected.|$|E

500|$|Political parties, {{candidates}} and voters who have endorsed a particular candidate (or state) in presidential, parliamentary or European Parliament elections may file complaints with the State Electoral Commission regarding irregularities {{in the election}} process within 48 hours of a disputed activity. In the European Parliament elections, voter complaints are required to be endorsed by at least 100 voters (or {{five percent of the}} voters). If the commission finds the complaint valid, it will order the part of the election process directly affected by the disputed activity to be repeated (possibly postponing the election date if there is insufficient time left). The commission must provide its decision within 48 hours after the complaint is submitted. The decision may be appealed before the Constitutional Court of Croatia within 48 hours of its receipt and once petitioned, the court must return a ruling within 48 hours. In local council elections, [...] complaints are processed by county, city or town electoral commissions (as appropriate). In mayoral elections, complaints are filed with the county electoral commission. This does not apply to Zagreb mayoral elections, where complaints are submitted to the State Electoral Commission (the case also in county prefect elections).

2500|$|In 1971, Thurmond asked Nixon {{to appoint}} Albert Watson to the United States Court of Military Appeals, but Democratic U.S. Senator George McGovern of South Dakota opposed him.

Nixon retreated from a Senate showdown over the nomination because {{of civil rights}} ramifications that would emerge from a confirmation fight. Years later, Thurmond expressed disappointment that Nixon would not pursue the Watson nomination because the former congressman was [...] "so well qualified." [...] In October 1972, Nixon instead named Watson to a one-year appointment, which did not require Senate confirmation, as special assistant in the Social Security Administration. Watson was charged with streamlining the <b>appeals</b> <b>procedure.</b> Watson later was appointed as a Social Security administrative law judge in Columbia, a position from which he subsequently retired.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>appeals</b> <b>procedure</b> offered three remedies: appel, reformatie and reductie (the {{latter was}} reformatie of an {{arbitration}} award). Appel (comparable to interlocutory appeal) {{was an immediate}} review, even before the final verdict, from any kind of decree of a lower court. Such an appel had to be lodged within a short period after the decree was taken (usually forty days) and suspended the decree. Reformatie reviewed {{a case in which}} a final verdict by a lower court had been pronounced. It did not suspend that verdict (except in cases where the execution would do irreparable harm) and had to be lodged within a year of the final verdict in question. In a number of cases an appeal bypassing the Hof directly to the [...] "Great Council" [...] or Hoge Raad (i.e. an appeal omisso medio) was expressly prohibited.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The Annual Professional Performance Review (APPR) is the {{new teacher}} {{evaluation}} system adopted by New York State in 2012. Through APPR, each New York State teacher’s performance is evaluated annually. If a teacher is rated Ineffective, {{he or she must}} take part in a Teacher Improvement Plan (TIP). If a teacher is rated Ineffective for two consecutive years, the teacher may be dismissed even if that teacher has tenure. Given these potential consequences, the ability to appeal APPR ratings and how those ratings are conducted has been a major issue for teachers and their unions. Under New York Education Law 3012 -c, which establishes APPR, each school district negotiates its own APPR procedure with its local teachers union, including any procedures for appealing the performance review. This report examines the APPR <b>appeals</b> <b>procedures</b> established by school districts in order to investigate the following: Which aspects of the APPR process can teachers appeal? Who has the fi nal say in that appeals process? How much time do appeals processes take? Can teachers appeal APPR issues through the regular contractual grievance-arbitration procedure? This report addresses these questions by analyzing APPR <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> for all New York State school districts. The data analyzed was gathered by coding the provisions of the APPR <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures,</b> which are publicly available on the New York State Department of Education website (1) ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> for Nebraska {{property}} taxes are confusing. Amendments made to correct specific problems have, in turn, {{created their own}} problems. While taxpayers are technically provided due process by the existing procedures, practically they are not. The {{purpose of this article}} is to promote greater practical due process in Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s property tax <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures.</b> In achieving that purpose, this article analyzes Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s property tax <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> for {{property taxes}} administered by the counties, shows how those procedures lack practical due process, and suggests several changes which would give practical due process to those paying property taxes in Nebraska. Lack of practical due process can shift the property tax burden to the homeowner and small business person. This article focuses on such taxpayers and the property taxes they pay to their local governments. To show that such taxpayers will find the cost of appealing their local property taxes difficult and costly, this article discusses the issues of valuation and equalization—how and when they must be raised if they are to be successfully argued. The article explains how a taxpayer may be assessed without the right to notice or protest when real property has been undervalued, and it discusses exemptions and the unique rules which apply. Finally, it explains when and how refunds may be obtained...|$|R
