40|$|The {{average annual}} {{decreasing}} {{rate of the}} total solar irradiance (TSI) is increasing from the 22 -nd to the 23 -rd and 24 -th cycles, because the Sun since the 1990 is in the phase decline of quasi-bicentennial variation. The portion of the solar energy absorbed by the Earth is decreasing. Decrease in the portion of TSI absorbed by the Earth since 1990 remains uncompensated by the Earth's radiation into space at the previous high level over a time interval determined by the thermal inertia of the Ocean. A long-term negative deviation of the Earth’s average <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> from the equilibrium state is dictating corresponding variations in it’s the energy state. As a result, the Earth will have a negative average <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> also in the future. This {{will lead to the}} beginning of the decreasing in the Earth's temperature and of the epoch of the Little Ice Age after the maximum phase of the 24 -th solar cycle approximately since the end of 2014. The influence of the consecutive chain of the secondary feedback effects (the increase in the Bond albedo and the decrease in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to cooling) will lead to an additional reduction of the absorbed solar energy and reduce the greenhouse effect. The start of the TSI’s Grand Minimum is anticipated in the solar cycle 27 ± 1 in 2043 ± 11 and the beginning of the phase of deep cooling of the 19 th Little Ice Age for the past 7, 500 years around 2060 ± 11...|$|E

40|$|A {{simplified}} double grade {{meteorological data}} {{model for the}} simulation of the annual performance of a domestic-size renewable energy system is proposed. With the model, only two representative days (clearest and cloudiest) during each season of the year are necessary to estimate <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balances,</b> carbon emissions and the running costs. The model was chosen in preference to other simplified models based on the error distributions {{from the results of}} the continuous simulations in a test period. Detailed numerical simulation studies show that the carbon emissions from the renewable energy system are about 16 % of a comparable conventional system. The thermal energy produced by a solar collector during the winter season, however, is insufficient to meet all the loads so that frequent heat pump operations and the auxiliary boiler are necessary in cold climate regions...|$|R

The technical feasibility of a self-sufficient energy supply system based on photovoltaic, battery and hydrogen storage was demonstrated. The overall efficiency based on the <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> excluding the photovoltaic efficiency varied from 51 % to 64 %. The battery bank was able to supply energy to the load for three days {{in the absence of}} solar radiation. Around 50 - 52 % of the demands were delivered by the battery. In addition, another 20 - 25 % of the demand was supplied by the fuel cell, which indicates that the energy should be stored in a long-term storage system. Thus, the highest level of energetic reliability can be achieved with relatively low battery capacity and hydrogen storage. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The paper extends {{a simple}} Budyko-Sellers mean <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> climate model with {{diffusive}} transport {{to include a}} seasonal cycle. In the model the latitudinal distribution of the zonal average surface temperature is represented by Legendre polynomials and its time-dependence by a Fourier sine-cosine series, and it has three parameters adjusted so that the observed amplitudes of the Northern Hemisphere zonal mean surface temperature are recovered. The seasonal model is used to reveal how the annual mean climate and the sensitivity to changes in incident radiation differ from the predictions obtained with the corresponding mean annual model. The distribution of the incident solar radiation in the models is shown to be insensitive {{to changes in the}} eccentricity and the longitude of perihelion and sensitive only to changes in the obliquity of the earth, and for past orbital changes both the seasonal and the mean annual model fail to produce glacial advances of the magnitude that are thought to have occurred...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{definition}} of a zero energy building (ZEB) is a stand-alone building which does not use any offsite energy source for its operation. The definition is easily extended to buildings with a net-zero <b>annual</b> on-site <b>energy</b> <b>balance,</b> where a building {{is connected to the}} electricity grid and <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> use is the same as energy exported to the grid. In this paper we expand the ZEB definition adding a life cycle perspective including the embodied energy (cradle to site) of materials, which is considered as an additional off-site supply. The consideration of embodied energy adds a level that will help discern the life cycle benefits of different demand or supply side building design strategies to achieve ZEBs. Calculations of operational energy use and embodied energy for different house design options are presented, analyzing what options would move closer to this ZEB definition. Results show how the achievement of extreme reductions on energy demand by using high quantities of energy intensive materials are not an optimum solution over the life cycle of a building, active technologies becoming a better option after certain limits...|$|R
40|$|The {{basic concept}} of a Net Zero Energy Building (Net ZEB) is that on-site {{renewable}} energy generation covers the <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> load. The main objective {{of this study is}} to analyse the increase of embodied energy compared to the decrease of the energy use related to building operation; partly by a literature review, partly by detailed analysis of eleven case studies; taking the step from a low energy building to a Net ZEB. The literature review shows that the metric of evaluation, assumed life-span, boundary conditions, age of database and the origin of database differ in different studies and influence the result of embodied energy, The relationship between embodied energy and life cycle energy use is almost linear for all cases studied herein. During the last two decades, embodied energy in new buildings has decreased slightly. However, the relative share of embodied energy related to life cycle energy use has increased. The detailed life cycle energy analysis show that taking the step from a low energy building to a Net ZEB results in a small increase of the embodied energy. However, the energy savings achieved in the <b>annual</b> operating <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> clearly exceed the increase in embodied energy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Permafrost thawing is {{essentially}} {{determined by the}} surface <b>energy</b> <b>balance,</b> which potentially triggers the activation of a massive carbon source, if previously frozen organic soils are exposed to microbial decomposition. In this article, we present {{the first part of}} a comprehensive <b>annual</b> surface <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> study performed at a polygonal tundra landscape in northeast Siberia, realized between spring 2007 and winter 2009. This part of the study focuses on the half year period from April to September 2007 – 2008, during which the surface <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> is obtained from independent measurements of the radiation budget, the turbulent heat fluxes and the ground heat flux at several sites. The short-wave radiation is the dominant factor in the surface <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> during the entire observation period. About 50 % of the available net radiation is consumed by latent heat flux, while the sensible and the ground heat flux are both on the order of 20 to 30 %. The ground heat flux is mainly consumed by active layer thawing, where 60 % of soil energy storage are attributed to. The remainder is used for soil warming down to a depth of 15 m. The controlling factors for the surface energy partitioning are in particular the snow cover, the cloud cover and the soil temperature gradient. Significant surface temperature differences of the heterogeneous landscape indicate spatial variabilities of sensible and latent heat fluxes, which are verified by measurements at different locations. However, differences in the partition between sensible and latent heat flux for the different sites only exist during conditions of high radiative forcing, which only occur occasionally...|$|R
40|$|Models of the Mars {{polar cap}} energy balance {{suggest that the}} south cap has two {{possible}} configurations at the current epoch. It can be covered all year by CO 2 frost, as was observed by the Viking spacecraft, or the CO 2 frost can disappear at midsummer to expose an underlying surface. The {{difference between the two}} states depends on the role of energy conducted into the subsurface. If the cap was exposed the previous year, conducted energy will cause less CO 2 frost to condense in winter, and the frost will disappear completely in summer. If the cap was covered the previous year, there will be no conducted energy, and it will stay covered again. Subtle effects in the atmosphere can perturb the cap energy balance sufficiently to cause the cap to jump between states. This behavior might provide an explanation for the large southern summer water vapor abundances observed in 1969. It also explains the observed differences between {{the north and the south}} residual caps as resulting in part from a difference in the role in the <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> of energy conducted into the subsurface...|$|E

The seasonal cycle of dekadal daytime latent heat fluxes mostly followed net radiation cycle with two minima and range between 50 – 200 Wm - 2 but differed from the latter during the period when soil wetness and cloudiness were not coupled. Dekadal evaporative fraction closely followed the seasonal dryness-wetness cycle thus minimizing the effect of wind on energy partitioning as compared to diurnal variation. Daytime latent heat fluxes were found to have linear relationship with canopy net assimilation rate (Y = 0. 023 X + 0. 171, R 2 = 0. 80) though nonlinearity exists between canopy latent heat flux and hourly net CO 2 assimilation rate. Night-time plant respiration was found to have linear relationship (Y = 0. 088 + 1. 736, R 2 = 0. 72) with night-time average vapour pressure deficit (VPD). Daily average soil respiration was found to be non-linearly correlated to average soil temperatures (Y = - 0. 034 X 2 + 1. 676 X – 5. 382, R 2 = 0. 63) The coupled use of empirical models, seasonal energy fluxes and associated parameters would be useful to annual water and carbon accounting in subtropical pine ecosystem of India in the absence high-response eddy covariance tower...|$|E
40|$|Predicting the {{vulnerability}} of permafrost carbon (C) to climate change requires simulation of the permafrost’s annual dynamics coupled with the C cycle, {{as well as the}} soil water status which determines aerobic or anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. Quantitative long-term water and <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> studies are particularly scarce circumpolar and almost absent from Siberia, but are of great importance for the validation of climate and permafrost surface schemes within climate models. Furthermore, due to the complex nature and non linearity of processes, quantitative predictions vary largely. Within the research group SPARC (Sensitivity of the permafrost system’s water and <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> under changing climate: A multiscale perspective) the carbon, water, and heat flux cycles in the complex Arctic landscapes at scales that range from metres to kilometres are investigated. Two field sites, located in the continuous permafrost environment are studied in detail since 1998 : Bayelva (close to Ny-Alesund, Spitsbergen) and Samoylov (Lena Delta, Siberia). We combine field measurements of permafrost processes, pools, and fluxes, with remote sensing data and numerical climate models at local and regional scales. A quantitative process understanding is developed by identifying key processes of the seasonal and <b>annual</b> <b>energy,</b> water and carbon balance and the factors that affect these processes. This includes: representation of sub-grid cell variability in the landcover (especially with regard to water bodies), the quantification of the <b>annual</b> surface <b>energy</b> <b>balance,</b> the importance of snow cover formation and ablation for the permafrost thermal regime and the relationships between thermal and hydrologic processes and carbon cycle.

40|$|It is {{acknowledged}} that the conventional design methods can easily lead to oversized system or unsatisfactory performance for different design conditions. Most existing studies on design optimization of {{net zero energy building}} (nZEB) are conducted based on deterministic data/information. However, the question is: How is the actual performance of a design nZEB in different years considering uncertainties? This study, therefore, proposed a robust design method for sizing renewable energy systems in nZEB concerning uncertainties in renewable resources and demand load. The proposed robust design method is applied to the planning of renewable energy system for the Hong Kong Zero Carbon Building. The annual performance of nZEB under the optimal design options are systematically investigated and compared using the proposed robust design method and the deterministic method. It is meaningful to obtain a fitting formula to identify the relationship between the probability of achieving <b>annual</b> zero <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> and the design mismatch ratio. On the basis of Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation methods, the uncertainty of nZEB performance is quantified which provides flexibility for designers in selecting appropriate design options according to the required probability of achieving nZEB during the design stage.

40|$|This study details {{seasonal}} {{characteristics in}} the <b>annual</b> surface <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> of upland and lowland tundra during the 1998 – 99 water year (Y 2). It contrasts the results with the 1997 – 98 water year (Y 1) and relates the {{findings to the}} climatic normals for the lower Mackenzie River basin region. Both years were much warmer than the long-term average, with Y 1 being both warmer and wetter than Y 2. Six seasons are defined as early winter, midwinter, late winter, spring, summer, and fall. The most rapid changes in the surface <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> occur in spring, fall, and late winter. Of these, spring is the most dynamic, and there is distinct asymmetry between rates of change in spring and those in fall. Rates of change of potential insolation (extraterrestrial solar radiation) in late winter, spring, and fall are within 10 % of one another, being highest in late winter and smallest in spring. Rates of change in air temperature and ground temperature are twice as large in spring as in fall and late winter, when they are about the same. Rates of change in components of the <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> in spring are twice and 4 times as large as in fall and late winter, respectively. The timing of snowpack ripening and snowmelt is the major agent determining the magnitude of asymmetry between fall and spring. This timing {{is a result of}} interaction between the solar cycle, air temperature, and snowpack longevity. Based on evidence from this study, potential surface responses to a 18 C increase in air temperature are small to moderate in most seasons, but are large in spring when increases range from 7 % to 10 % of average surface energy fluxes. 1...|$|R

The application of this system {{is part of a}} solution on handling a large scale deployment of grid connected distributed generators, especially PV system. By implementing the PV based active generator, it will be very flexible able to manage the power delivery from the active generator sources (e. g. PV system, energy storage technologies, active power conditioning devices). In Southern Norway, a smart village Skarpnes is developed for ZEBs. These ZEBs have Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) system. The energy efficient housing development should consider that a building should produce the same amount of electrical energy as its annual requirements (i. e. ZEB). In future, ZEBs are going to {{play a significant role in}} the upcoming smart grid development due to their contribution on the on-site electrical generation, energy storage, demand side management etc. In this work the main objective is to evaluate the usefulness of ZEBs for load matching with BIPV generation profiles and grid interaction analysis. Impact of BIPV system has been investigated on the distributed network power flow as well as on protection and protective relays analysis. Furthermore, techno-economic analysis of BIPV system is presented which will be useful to the utility for developing new business models as well as demand side management (DSM) strategies and for decentralized energy storage. The real operational results of a year are analyzed for <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> with on-site BIPV generation and local load. This work provides quantitative analysis of various grid interaction parameters suitable to describe energy performance of the BIPV. The load matching and grid interaction parameters are calculated for a house to find relationship of BIPV generation and building load. The loss of load probability is analyzed for fulfilling the local load at desired reliability level. Results of this work are going to be useful for developing DSM strategies and energy storage as well as import/export energy to the grid.

40|$|This thesis treats angle-resolved optical {{properties}} {{and the energy}} efficiency of windows. A theoretical evaluation of optical and thermal properties of windows is briefly surveyed and the energy performance of a large selection of windows, under different conditions, is examined. In particular, angle dependent {{optical properties}} are analysed. A new model assessing angle dependence of the total solar energy transmittance, g, of windows is presented. A comparison of simple models for angle-dependence prediction has been performed, including both fictitious and measured real window glazings. The new proposed model illustrates low errors for both the real and the fictitious glazings. The impact of inaccuracy in the angle dependence of the g-factor has been assessed and found to be clearly noticeable but not necessarily critical. A simple model for comparing the energy efficiency of different windows in different types of buildings and different climates has been further developed and analysed for several conditions. The energy performance {{of a large number}} of windows has been analysed using this model, and also by using other building and window simulation models. Typical savings when changing from a standard double glazed window to the optimal window for the investigated case is in the order of 100 - 150 kWh/m 2 yr. The <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> of modern low emittance windows illustrates that they can be annual energy savers rather than energy losers, unlike traditional windows. However, it is shown that it is not important to argue about small changes (~ 0. 01) of the thermal emittance value. Furthermore, advance solar control glazings effectively reduce solar transmittance with maintained high light transmittance. AR-coatings and low-iron glazings can increase the transmittance of glazings considerably. In fact, a "super" low emittance window with a U-value below 1 W/m 2 K can have higher light transmittance than a common double-glazed unit. Windows with variable transmittance, switchable windows, are compared with high-performing solar control windows, illustrating some degree of potential energy savings compared to high performing static solar control windows, depending on the type of control that is used. This is accompanied by the potential for automatic thermal comfort- and glare control. Different models for energy rating of windows have been evaluated, demonstrating that a simple linear rating depending on the U and g-factor of the window may be sufficient with certain restrictions. Division into climate zones is essential. In all, the results demonstrate that energy-efficient windows provide huge energy-saving potentials on a large (regional, national, global) scale...|$|E

For these reasons, a particular building, like an organism or an ecosystem must seek self-sustenance for its design to prevail in competition with other building designs in a time with limited availability of energy and materials Self- organization of systems to maximize useful power {{is the key to}} self-sustenance. To this extent, Net Zero Energy (NZE) buildings achieve a net <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> in their operations. However, approaching a NZE building goal based on current definitions is flawed for two principal reasons — they only deal with energy quantities required for operations and related emissions, and they do not establish a threshold which ensures that buildings are optimized for reduced consumption before renewable systems are integrated to obtain an energy balance. Current definitions and calculations of net energy do not include the energy flows from the sun, wind, rain, and geological cycles and so- forth from the beginning. ^ This dissertation develops a method to maximize renewable resource use through emergy (spelled with an 2 ̆ 2 m 2 ̆ 2) analysis to close the gap between current approaches to environmental building design and the over-arching goal of creating buildings that contribute to the sustainability of the geobiosphere.

This study proposes using a 2 ̆ 2 Renewable Emergy Balance 2 ̆ 2 (REB) in environmental building design as a tool to maximize renewable resource use through disinvestment of all non-renewable resources that may be substituted with renewable resources. REB buildings preserve a high standing by optimizing buildings over their entire life-span from formation-extractionmanufacturing to maintenance and operation cycles. If such an approach were adopted, it would expand conscious decision-making and, possibly, lead to a paradigm shift in the way non-renewable resources are used in the manufacturing of building materials, which is currently of interest, but remains unchecked. ...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The development and use of a computer simulation program incorporating an interactive spreadsheet software package to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of cogeneration systems is described. Three hypothetical case studies including a comprehensive sensitivity analysis were completed to demonstrate the employment of the simulation program. The simulation can model cogeneration systems using either a gas turbine, internal combustion (IC) engine or steam turbine prime mover for both electrical and thermal load matching. The modeled systems can be arranged in either a simple or combined cycled configuration. The heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) model developed for the program incorporates a fixed surface effectiveness calculation and includes correlations for off-design performance. The HRSG can also be operated in a fired or unfired mode. The IC engine prime mover model also includes a water jacket energy recovery unit. The program simulates the system on an hourly and monthly basis using variable predefined daily and monthly profiles. The program also includes hourly and <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balances</b> for the combined system. The economic results are in terms of conventional parameters including the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and the years to zero net present value (payback time).

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} heterogeneity of climate, soils, topography and vegetation control the water and <b>energy</b> <b>balances</b> among catchments. Two well-known hydrological theories underpinning these processes are the Budyko framework and the Dunne diagram. Relating the scaling of water–energy balances (Budyko) and runoff generation mechanisms (Dunne) raises some important catchment comparison questions, namely: (i) how do streamflow characteristics {{vary according to the}} <b>annual</b> water and <b>energy</b> balances?; (ii) to what extent do biophysical drivers of runoff explain the observed streamflow variability?; and (iii) are there quantifiable process overlaps between these two approaches, and can they offer insights into the mechanics of catchment co-evolution? This study addresses these questions by analysing daily streamflow and precipitation time series data to quantify hydrological similarity across 355 catchments located along a tropical–temperate climatic gradient in eastern Australia. We used eight hydrological metrics to describe the hydrological response over a 33 -year period (1980 – 2013). Hierarchical cluster, ordination analysis, the Budyko framework, and generalized additive models were used to evaluate hydrological similarity, extract the dominant response, and examine how the landscape and climatic characteristics of catchments influence the dominant streamflow response. The catchments were classified into five clusters based on the analysis of their hydrological characteristics and similarity, which vary along the <b>annual</b> water and <b>energy</b> <b>balances</b> gradient in the Budyko framework. Furthermore, we show that the streamflow similarity is explained by six catchment-specific biophysical factors that overlap with those described by the Dunne diagram for runoff generation, which in this case have the following order of relative importance: (i) Dryness Index; (ii) Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation; (iii) Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity; (iv) Soil Depth; (v) Maximum Slope and (vi) Fraction of Woody Vegetation Cover.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the world is {{becoming}} more aware on {{the burden of the}} fossil fuels on the planets ecosystem as well as climate. One of the major reasons is, due to greenhouse gasses in which most of them are caused by carbon release by consumption of fossil fuels. The building sector in almost every country is a major contributor to the consumption of carbon-based fuels either for space conditioning, water heating or for electricity. Operational energy in buildings must be lowered by bold measures to a point or the building should generate as equal as renewable energy as they consume. However it is not realistic to match the consumed energy if the building does not go through an energy refurbishment to reduce operational energy consumption. Refurbishment of ill performing building gives an advantage on not only reducing the operational energy consumption but also user comfort could be increased in the building. Refurbishment in the report is integrated with the SUI project, which aims to create zero energy neighborhoods in Ramplaankwartier, Haarlem. The building to be refurbished is selected accordingly f and natural gas usage is aimed to be eliminated while <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> is sustained in the building. The report starts with a thorough literature research on four different topics. First of the topics is zero energy building definitions globally defined along with most commonly used zero energy building definitions in the Netherlands to highlight the important aspects in defining a zero energy design approach. Second topic is refurbishment strategies for the building envelope regarding different applications and scales are checked to determine viable options. Third one is the regulations for refurbishment applications, necessary thermal performance values in the refurbishment buildings and the necessary comfort conditions in the buildings. Lastly the final topic is a to check refurbishment examples on row-houses in the Netherlands to highlight possible measures of refurbishments, their application and detailing, impact on residents and consumed energy reduction. Case study design is based on achieving annual zero energy balance in case study building. Application of refurbishment strategies for the building envelope is divided into two for increasing the varieties of measures later on these measures are given detail on how they could be executed in real life. The case study measures aim to influence the building envelope composition such as Insulation levels, glazing thermal performance with passive solar gain and the infiltration rate of the building skin. Comfort in primary spaces will be tinkered to achieve necessary user comfort requirements in dwellings, while ventilation system is determined along with comfort provision in space. After comfort measures are applied, building services will be evaluated to systems will be switched to full electricity to eliminate natural gas usage for space heating and domestic heated water. With the lowered energy consumption, energy generation on site will be utilized to create annual balance for the building to achieve zero energy building criteria’s. Eventually all the refurbishment and energy generation measures will be applied to neighboring buildings to evaluate the advantages of application of energy generation in combination with the other refurbished buildings rather than individual generation. Effects of individual and group application of energy generation measures will be compared to determine advantages of each approach. It is possible to use different measures for energy refurbishment to reduce space and heating energy and possibly energy on lighting itself. Usage of higher insulation values, better glazing, lower infiltration is always an option in building refurbishments however it all comes to the application of the theoretical measures accepted through calibration and the execution of these accepted measures is important to deliver accurate conditions in the refurbished buildings. Different energy generation methods can be applied besides PV panels. Integration of wind energy for electrical building systems can be interesting. Totally integrated building services and on-site generation system with wood pellets and boiler system for individual or larger scale to provide zero energy balance for a group of buildings in a constant period of time. Energy storage for photovoltaic options could be used to eliminate seasonal energy mismatch for operational energy in a large scale for the neighborhood or for individual purposes with batteries.

The proposed energy management strategy is an adaptative optimization-based strategy that minimizes the operation {{cost of the}} facility taking into account RES generation prediction errors. It is shown that with an Adaptative Optimized Five-step Charge Controller (AOFC 2) {{the use of the}} different equipment is optimized and the overall operation cost is minimized considering the entire life of the facility. The proposed energy management strategy is coordinated with power management strategies to offer advanced functionalities (peak-shaving, reactive power control and back-up service) that provide added-value to the facility. The paper demonstrates by means of offline and real-time simulations, that an adequate energy and power management structure permits the optimal economic exploitation of an advanced ZEB (that includes an energy storage system), providing not only a zero <b>energy</b> <b>annual</b> <b>balance</b> but also interesting added-value features to the grid and to the local consumers.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} status of our {{understanding}} of the Earth's <b>annual,</b> global mean <b>energy</b> <b>balance,</b> the hemispheric <b>energy</b> <b>balances</b> and the symmetry observed about the equator, and explores the influence of latitudinal changes of energy both on the annual mean and seasonal transports of energy from low latitudes to higher latitudes. Based on the best available information we show that our planet continues to be out of balance with additional heat being added to it at the rate of 0. 6 ± 0. 4 Wm− 2. This heat appears to be taken up primarily by the oceans of the SH and perhaps mostly equatorward of 37 S. The nature of the adjustments applied to our best estimates of individual, annual mean fluxes of energy to produce a balance are described and the results of applying a more formal constraint for these adjustments are discussed. The <b>energy</b> <b>balances</b> of the Southern and Northern Hemispheres are then shown to be practically identical which in turn suggests the transport of energy across the equator in the net is close to zero. In fact the hemispheres are not identically symmetrical with the SH being slightly out of balance absorbing the additional heat and transporting a small amount of net heat across the equator to the balanced NH. The symmetry in absorbed solar and the near symmetry in OLR are remarkable in their own right and are a result of the effects of clouds both on solar reflection and OLR that act to offset land–ocean interhemispheric differences. We then demonstrate important interhemispheric seasonal influences on the heat transported to the winter pole that conspire to make these seasonal transports lopsided. This asymmetry {{is a direct result of}} the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit that induces larger energy losses from the southern winter hemisphere. This in turn produces a latitudinal asymmetry in the location of on the tropical trough zone, a region from which energy is always moved to the winter pole, requiring it be located deeper into the NH...|$|R

40|$|There is momentum, globally, to {{increase}} the use of plant biomass {{for the production of}} heat, power and liquid transport fuels. This review assesses the evidence base for potential impacts of large-scale bioenergy crop deployment principally within the UK context, but with wider implications for Europe, the USA and elsewhere. We focus on second generation, dedicated lignocellulosic crops, but where appropriate draw comparison with current first-generation oil and starch crops, often primarily grown for food. For lignocellulosic crops, positive effects on soil properties, biodiversity, <b>energy</b> <b>balance,</b> greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, carbon footprint and visual impact are likely, when growth is compared to arable crops. Compared to replacement of set-aside and permanent unimproved grassland, benefits are less apparent. For hydrology, strict guidelines on catchment management must be enforced to ensure detrimental effects do not occur to hydrological resources. The threat of climate change suggests that action will be required to ensure new genotypes are available with high water use efficiency and that catchment-scale management is in place to secure these resources in future. In general, for environmental impacts, less is known about the consequences of large-scale deployment of the C 4 grass Miscanthus, compared to short rotation coppice (SRC) willow and poplar, including effects on biodiversity and hydrology and this requires further research. Detailed consideration of GHG mitigation and <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> for both crop growth and utilization suggest that perennial crops are favoured over <b>annual</b> crops, where <b>energy</b> <b>balances</b> may be poor. Similarly, crops for heat and power generation, especially combined heat and power (CHP), are favoured over the production of liquid biofuels. However, it is recognized that in contrast to heat and power, few alternatives exist for liquid transportation fuels at present and research to improve the efficiency and <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> of liquid transport fuel production from lignocellulosic sources is a high current priority. Although SRC, {{and to a lesser extent}} energy grasses such as Miscanthus, may offer significant benefits for the environment, this potential will only be realized if landscape-scale issues are effectively managed and the whole chain of crop growth and utilization is placed within a regulatory framework where sustainability is a central driver. Land resource in the UK and throughout Europe will limit the contribution that crops can make to biofuel and other renewable targets, providing a strong driver to consider sustainability in a global context. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} in existing buildings {{is a primary}} concern for the European Union and Sweden in fighting climate change. To achieve the 20 % energy reduction in buildings target by 2020, the broad base of building owners must understand the technical and financial benefits of choosing energy efficient upgrades when renovating their properties. This report is a technical supplement to the upcoming publication by the Swedish HVAC industry organization VVS Företagen, which seeks to inform their customer base about energy efficiency. Nine common Swedish apartment buildings from 1945 up to 1985 have been modeled in Design Builder building energy modeling software, with three energy saving packages applied. The energy saving packages represent a decision to choose more expensive, but more energy efficient equipment that can be installed during routine renovations. In each case, the data reported are total <b>annual</b> <b>energy</b> usage, heat <b>balance,</b> accumulated cash flow over a 40 -year period and the {{internal rate of return}} for each package. The technical and financial performance of each building varies significantly depending on type, but most packages on most buildings have an IRR greater than 5 %. While the results displayed here cannot directly represent a specific building, the data is a good resource for owners to understand what performance they can expect for their specific building. The technical information reported here is appropriate for the VVS Företagen publication. QC 2012031...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented {{of the long-term}} <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> of a small water body in south-east Queensland, Australia. The main focus {{of this study was}} on the use of scintillometry to determine the turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat. A novel approach is utilized for identifying periods where the scintillometry measurement footprint extends beyond the water surface. This approach relies on comparison of ‘inferred’ water surface temperature and measured skin temperature. The ‘inferred’ temperature is an independent assessment of water skin temperature derived through rearrangement of key equations in the scintillometry calculation scheme. An extensive dataset is used to investigate the processes controlling heat and vapour fluxes and to develop simple relationships {{that can be used for}} reliable predictions. These relationships are used to fill missing measurements in the dataset and to construct a complete <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> for an 18 month period.
