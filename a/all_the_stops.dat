5|$|As with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> on the Westside MAX, {{displays}} of public artwork {{were included in}} the construction of the stop. Overall the artwork at the station reflects the gathering and dispersal of people and the harvest. Christine Bourdette, a sculptor, working with the architects from OTAK designed some of the artwork at Hatfield Station. Described as a “clash of sensibilities” and “organically abstract”, items include sculptures of bronze baskets and granite balls installed at the southern end of the station. Attached to the station's building is a bronze work entitled “Gathering Rail” which resembles twine woven together and is intended to represent the various themes of the community coming together.|$|E

25|$|Ironically, England whose fielding {{had been}} so lacklustre in the Australian first innings pulled out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> in the second, when they had no chance of winning.

25|$|When an 8-year-old {{girl was}} raped in March 1998, the police {{initially}} described two black males as the culprits.

500|$|Critics have praised Williams' score, {{comparing}} it favorably to the original. Williams [...] "uses {{a few basic}} elements of the original—the obligatory shark motif, for one—and takes the music off in some new and interesting directions." [...] The score is [...] "more disturbing in places" [...] than the original, and [...] "Williams [...] some new and hugely memorable out to sea adventure music." [...] Because Jaws 2 [...] "isn't a film that requires subtlety ... Williams pulls out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> {{to make it as}} exciting and hair raising as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of Donna's pivotal episodes were {{selected}} as recommended viewing by critics. [...] "Myself, Coming Back", the series ten episode {{in which she}} goes on a road-trip and discovers the existence of her niece, Mia, was named a televisual highlight by the Daily Mirror, Birmingham Post, and Liverpool Daily Echo, with the latter publication deeming it [...] "refreshingly different" [...] following the [...] "doom and gloom" [...] of preceding episodes. Many regional newspapers named [...] "Promises", in which she decides to adopt Mia, a [...] "pick of the day", and Sarah Morgan of the Daily Record cited Jacobs' appearance as Donna in the premiere episode of Casualty twenty-fifth series as a positive example of the BBC [...] "pull out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> {{to make sure the}} first edition in this latest run is something of a cracker." ...|$|E

500|$|A Junior Vasquez remix of {{the song}} was {{performed}} at the 1995 Brit Awards. Madonna wore a white Versace dress and had long blonde extensions, her look being similar to the Versace advertisement campaign she was promoting at the time. She even invited Björk to feature in the performance; the singer turned it down, saying [...] "I {{was supposed to get}} [...] personal number and call her up, but it just didn't feel right. I'd love to meet her accidentally, really drunk in a bar. It's just all that formality that confuses me". The performance was ranked number four on Marie Claires [...] "30 Best Brit Award Moments" [...] list. It was described by the magazine as the [...] "best opening performance" [...] at the Brits. A writer described that [...] " [...] pulled out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops,</b> treating the audience to a light show and trio of satin-clad male dancers".|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{received}} orders on 8 June 1945, {{to report}} to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. At a 13 June San Antonio homecoming parade held for returning Texas veterans, {{a quarter of a}} million people cheered Murphy, Charles P. Cabell, Lucian Truscott, Harold L. Clark and others. He was then assigned to the Army Ground & Services Redistribution Station at the base and given 30 days leave. Murphy was the home grown hero, and on a visit to Dallas, the media followed his every move, interviewing and photographing him. Farmersville pulled out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops,</b> giving him an escort caravan, and five thousand local citizens showed up to hear a band concert and speeches in his honor. He was the star attraction at the 2 to 4 July McKinney rodeo where he opened the event every night. The 16 July issue of Life magazine brought Murphy national attention when its cover story proclaimed him [...] "most decorated" [...] next to a smiling image of him in full dress uniform. Photographers for the magazine followed him to a birthday party in his honor, to his first civilian haircut since 1942, and around to visit friends and relatives.|$|E
500|$|During 1957 Gielgud {{directed}} Berlioz's The Trojans at Covent Garden {{and played}} Prospero at Drury Lane, but the production {{central to his}} career over the late 1950s and into the 1960s was his one-man show The Ages of Man. He first appeared in this in 1956 and revived it every year until 1967. It was an anthology of Shakespearean speeches and sonnets, compiled by George Rylands, in which, wearing modern evening clothes on a plain stage, Gielgud recited the verses, with his own linking commentary. He performed it all over Britain, mainland Europe, Australasia and the US, including a performance at the White House in 1965. He found there were advantages to performing solo: [...] "You've {{no idea how much}} easier it is without a Juliet. When there's a beautiful girl above you on a balcony, or lying on a tomb with candles round her, naturally the audience look at her the whole time, and Romeo has to pull out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> to get any attention." [...] His performance on Broadway won him a Special Tony Award in 1959, and an audio recording in 1979 received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. He made many other recordings, both before and after this, including ten Shakespeare plays.|$|E

500|$|In July 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the 6000th episode of Neighbours would see Paul pushed from the mezzanine of Lassiter's Hotel. This then kicks off a whodunit storyline with Diana being one of six suspects. Susan Bower said that as the Neighbours team was developing the storyline, they decided to add to the story that Paul's financial situation leads to him embezzling, which in turn leads to Diana arriving. Badler said it was [...] "great" [...] {{to be involved in the}} storyline and said she was largely featured in the 6000th episode. [...] Diana becomes a suspect in the attempt on Paul's life because he jilts her [...] "in the boardroom and the bedroom". Paul then humiliates Diana and sends her packing from Lassiter's. On Diana's reason to kill Paul, Badler said [...] "Seeing her name splashed across the Erinsborough News prompts Diana to pull out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> in order to bring Paul down. And she still has friends in high places!" [...] Diana is seen placing a call asking for something to be taken care of and she hands money over to a stranger just before Paul is pushed. Following the attempt on Paul's life, Diana's earring is found at the scene and the police manage to catch her at the airport before she returns to America. Diana diverts the police attention to Rebecca by telling them that she revealed Paul's affair to her.|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{dealing with}} [...] "one {{of the most}} {{divisive}} issues in American society" [...] according to The New York Times, became a subject of controversy after its broadcast. The authors of The Marriage and Family Experience called it [...] "one of the more controversial episodes of a frequently controversial cartoon." [...] Several conservative groups and American Christian conservatives thought it was promoting same-sex marriage. Parents Television Council president L. Brent Bozell III criticized [...] "There's Something About Marrying" [...] for bringing up the issue. Even though {{he had not seen}} the episode himself, he commented that [...] "at a time when the public mood is overwhelmingly against gay marriage, any show that promotes gay marriage is deliberately bucking the public mood." [...] A researcher for the American Family Association, named Ed Vitagliano, claimed the presentation of same-sex marriage in the episode was [...] "very one-sided". He said that this episode proved [...] "Hollywood's blatant pro-homosexual bias" [...] because despite The Simpsons being [...] "generally kind of a wacky animated program" [...] it was not neutral on the issue. Bozell also worried about the influence the episode would have on children, despite the parental discretion advisory at the beginning, commenting: [...] "You've got a show watched by millions of children. Do children need to have gay marriage thrust in their faces as an issue? Why can't we just entertain them?" [...] Similarly, Vitagliano said that many children watch The Simpsons and Hollywood [...] "will pull out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> to promote same-sex marriage — and children will be influenced by it." ...|$|E

The motor cars had heating in the passenger saloons, a considerable benefit compared with the four-wheel coaches on conventional trains.

2500|$|Hughes put {{the full}} {{proposal}} to Caucus and Cabinet. He pulled out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> in the advocacy of his proposal, claiming that France {{was on the}} verge of collapse, Imperial forces were stretched to the limit, and Germany was winning the war just about everywhere. Furthermore, if the government could not take the steps necessary to win the war, then the public would elect an opposition who could. He claimed, amongst other things, that 80% of the population wanted conscription, and that the opposition that had emerged would be carried for the proposal by the end of the campaign. He ended his argument with the statement: [...] "Don't leave the boys in the trenches. Don't see them butchered. Don't leave them below their strength or you cover Australia with shame".|$|E
