40|$|Description of a {{coherent}} wide-angle multiplexing approach which is 4 to 8 dB more efficient in the utilization of satellite power as compared to a multicarrier transmission accessing a single TWT amplifier transponder. The wide-angle multiplexing approach achieves this performance by efficiently trading the modulation power improvement against backoff at the satellite earth terminal phase modulator. A simple addition of an <b>amplitude</b> <b>clipper</b> at the modulator input {{is critical to the}} proper operation of the system...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{models are}} used to {{estimate}} the meridional overturning and transports along the paths of two hydrographic cruises, carried out in 1997 and 2002 from Greenland to Portugal. We have examined {{the influence of the}} different paths of the two cruises and found that it could explain 0. 4 to 2 Sv of difference in overturning (the precise value is model-dependent). Models show a decrease in the overturning circulation between 1997 and 2002, with different <b>amplitudes.</b> The <b>CLIPPER</b> ATL 6 model reproduces well the observed weakening of the overturning in density coordinates between the cruises; in the model, the change is due to the combination of interannual and high-frequency forcing and internal variability associated with eddies and meanders. Examination of the -coordinate overturning reveals modelâ€“data discrepancies: the vertical structure in the models does not change as much as the observed one. The East Greenland current variability is mainly wind-forced in the ATL 6 model, while fluctuations due to eddies and instabilities explain {{a large part of the}} North Atlantic Current variability. The time-residual transport of dense water and heat due to eddy correlations between currents and properties is small across this section, which is normal to the direction of the main current...|$|R
