40|$|Amorphous {{polymers}} in glassy state undergo secondary or beta (β) relaxations {{relating to}} localized segmental {{motion of the}} polymer side chains. It is hypothesized that these non-cooperative β relaxations in <b>acrylate</b> <b>polymers</b> affect the diffusion coefficients of permeant molecules.

At isothermal temperatures the frequency dependence of relaxation on the diffusion kinetics of moisture across these polymers was found to be a ratio of their activation energies as predicted from the model. The magnitude of correlation between relaxation and diffusion which is dependent on the ratio of permeant to polymer pathway size also increases as the activation energy for diffusion increases.
