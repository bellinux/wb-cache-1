5|$|In 2004, {{the number}} of people {{employed}} in the motor vehicle <b>assembly</b> <b>industry</b> in Ohio was reported to be around 31,000, down from about 40,000 throughout the 1990s, while in the motor vehicle parts production industry in Ohio, in December 1997, employment stood at approximately 122,000 employees; however, that number dropped by about 26% to 90,000 employees by 2004. Despite the growth facts above, the loss of employment is more likely to directly affect Ohio's economy. The Ohio Bureau of Labor Market Information estimates that there will be 3,300 less assembly employees and 2,400 less parts manufacturing employees in 2012 than 2002. Major firms operating in the state include Ford, Honda, and General Motors. Some major motor vehicle assembly production plants in the state include the Toledo Complex, Lordstown Assembly, Marysville Auto Plant, East Liberty Auto Plant, Ohio Assembly, and Toledo North Assembly. France-based Faurecia Group operates a division in Toledo.|$|E

50|$|Analysts {{continue}} {{to debate the}} actual benefits of the shift away from the import-substitution industrialization (ISI) policies of the 1960s and 1970s toward a new focus on free zones and <b>assembly</b> <b>industries</b> in the 1990s. Critics point to the apparent lack of commitment by foreign manufactures to any one country site or {{to the creation of}} permanent infrastructure and employment. They question whether new employment will be enough to offset the loss of jobs in the more traditional manufacturing sector. A value of US$195 million to the Honduran economy from <b>assembly</b> <b>industries</b> in 1991—when the value of clothing exports was greater than that of coffee—was a compelling argument in favor of the shift, however.|$|R

50|$|Hundreds {{of small}} {{manufacturing}} firms, the traditional backbone of Honduran enterprise, {{began to go}} out of business beginning in the early 1990s, as import costs rose and competition through increasing wages for skilled labor from the mostly Asian-owned <b>assembly</b> <b>industries</b> strengthened. The small Honduran shops, most of which had manufactured clothing or food products for the domestic market, traditionally received little support in the form of credit from the government or the private sector and were more like artisans than conventional manufacturers. Asian-owned export assembly firms (maquiladoras), operating mostly in free zones established by the government on the Caribbean coast, attract thousands of job seekers and swell the populations of new city centers such as San Pedro Sula, Tela, and La Ceiba. Those firms employed approximately 16,000 workers in 1991.|$|R
50|$|The country's {{manufacturing}} sector was small, contributing only 15 {{percent to the}} total GDP in 1992.

50|$|The small Honduran firms {{could not}} begin {{to compete with the}} <b>assembly</b> <b>industry</b> forlabor because of the maquiladoras' {{relatively}} high wage scale of close to US$4 per day. Small firms also found it increasingly difficult to meet the high cost of mostly imported inputs. Membership in the Honduran Association of Small and Medium Industry (Asociación Hondureña de Empresas Pequeñas y Medianas) declined by 70 percent by 1991, compared to pre-maquiladora days, foreshadowing the likely demise of most of the small shops.|$|E
40|$|Competitive {{pressures}} {{of the world economy}} are continuously reshaping the global supply chains of manufacturing firms. At the same time, global competition is altering the nature of output offered by manufacturers, shifting it towards a higher share of service elements. The goal {{of this paper is to}} investigate how these two factors are combined, using a sample of manufacturing companies from 13 European countries belonging to the <b>assembly</b> <b>industries</b> of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment. The results indicate that different business models became dominant in the less developed Eastern European and the developed Western European region. Involving measures of business performance and reasons for plant location, this study also argues that in terms of service offerings and supply chain position, other types of business models can coexist and successfully prevail in the two regions...|$|R

The local managing director of General Motors responded that the failure of chassis imports to grow was [...] "entirely due to public preference and price".|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{the field}} of ramp-up {{management}} has received wide attention in both science and industrial practice. However, current research mainly focuses on discrete manufacturing and <b>assembly</b> <b>industries,</b> whereas companies in process-oriented industries are still lacking a practicable approach to manage their highly interdependent ramp-up operations. This paper presents findings of a detailed requirements analysis at a world leading metal producing and processing company. It outlines the specific characteristics of such hybrid industries and emphasizes the need for agility considerations in ramp-up management in order to outperform competitors in increasingly volatile and uncertain business environments. Main criteria for agile ramp-ups are derived from theoretical as well as industry-specific considerations and first steps towards a practice-oriented management approach are taken. This paper shows that early and reliable information on product and process maturity is a major imperative for process-oriented industries and reveals how standardized ramp-up readiness levels shall contribute substantially {{to the success of}} future ramp-up projects...|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the ergonomic physical exposure, organizational and psychosocial factors in a truck assembly plant for two different cycle times (11  min and 8  min). A self-reported questionnaire was applied to evaluate subjective physical exposure, organizational and psychosocial factors by operators in two organization of an assembly process. The initial cycle time was 11  min (system A) and the new was 8  min (system B). The same work and assembly tasks had to be completed in both systems. However, the organization and distribution of the tasks and workstations were reorganized. The results of the questionnaire showed that subjective estimation by the operators regarding ergonomic risk factors was better in the new organization and self-reported WR-MSDs symptoms were fewer. However, exposure to risk factors and WR-MSDs symptoms was not statistically different between two cycle times. The findings provide better understanding of how organizational changes can modify ergonomic exposure in manufacturing <b>assembly</b> <b>industries.</b> Effective interventions are thus not only engineering solutions but also organizational and administrative adaptations. </p...|$|R
