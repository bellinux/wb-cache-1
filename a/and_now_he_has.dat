[...] When Bryan accepted his nomination with a lengthy address in New York, the senator-elect commented, [...] "Mr. Bryan made himself by one speech, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> unmade himself by one speech". [...] Although Foraker went to Europe {{for four weeks}} (his sole trip abroad), he gave almost 200 speeches for the Republicans once he returned.

500|$|Dibnah {{was praised}} by many notable British people. [...] After {{reporting}} on his death, television presenter Peter Sissons remarked: [...] "They don't make them like that any more". Comedian Peter Kay said: [...] "It's very sad news. He {{was one of}} a kind <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> gone I think there will be no one else like him. He was enthusiastic about {{a way of life that}} has virtually disappeared now." [...] Brian Tetlow, chairman of the Bolton and District Civic Trust, said: [...] "He's unique, not just to Bolton but to Britain and the world. Our thoughts are with his wife and children." ...|$|E
500|$|Though an {{accomplished}} comic, Hardee was arguably more highly {{regarded as a}} [...] "character", a compère and talent-spotting booker at his own clubs, particularly The Tunnel Club in Greenwich, South East London, which gave vital and early exposure to up-and-coming comedians {{during the early years}} of British alternative comedy. In its obituary, The Times opined that [...] "throughout his life he maintained a fearlessness and an indifference to consequences" [...] and one journalist claimed: [...] "To say that he has no shame is to drastically exaggerate the amount of shame that he has". In a publicity quote printed in Hardee's autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake, Arthur Smith wrote that Hardee had [...] "led his life as though for the perfect autobiography <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> paid himself the compliment of writing it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2015, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly called Tyrion's {{meeting with}} Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) an [...] "iconic meetup" [...] that [...] "delighted fans, who were universally {{enthusiastic}} (for once!) about the showrunners making a narrative move not yet found in George R.R. Martin’s novels." [...] Dinklage {{said in the}} interview, [...] "That’s {{the great thing about}} my character: He’s been everywhere. He’s the only character that goes searching. He’s been to The Wall <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to find the dragons." [...] Benioff and Weiss said that the conversation between Tyrion and Daenerys focused on the parallels between their lives, as Tyrion had a [...] "lot of empathy" [...] toward Daenerys for being an orphan, like himself, and both had [...] "terrible fathers". Tyrion realized that Varys might be right about Daenerys being the [...] "last hope for Westeros". Benioff and Weiss also suggested that Tyrion believes that Daenerys could bring him [...] "back into power".|$|E
500|$|Gjokaj {{was cast}} in the role in August 2014. [...] "He was a soldier, {{and he had been}} very active all his life, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{to figure out how to}} use his brains, how to try to be smart," [...] Gjokaj {{explained}} of the character. [...] "He accepts his injury, he accepts his compromised status in society ... Peggy says, 'Forget this. I'm Peggy Carter. I'm going to do something else.' I think that's the difference between the two of them." [...] Considering a potentially romantic relationship between Sousa and Carter, Gjokaj said, [...] "I think there’s definitely a situation where … if she hadn't dated Captain America, he might ask her out for a drink. It’s like if your new girlfriend dated Ryan Gosling. It’s going to make you sweat a bit." [...] For the second season, Gjokaj said, [...] "you’ll see him deal with actually being part of the machine. Not trying to get [...] the machine, but being the boss. The first season was him trying to be listened to, and now he’s being listened to by a lot of people." [...] The costumes for the SSR agents in the series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters: Sousa wears [...] "sweater vests under his sport coats and pleated pants".|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{explores the}} idea that Reyes made a deal that {{involved}} becoming the Ghost Rider, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> [...] "this thing in" [...] him that wants to murder people which Reyes is [...] "ambivalent" [...] about. Bell {{said that this is}} the main aspect of their version that grounds him in [...] "a sadness ... and a weight", particularly when interacting with his brother Gabe. In terms of the season's overarching plot, Bell said it was important to tell Reyes' origin story in the episode, rather than earlier or later, because it also reveals the [...] "truth about Eli, and they're very connected." [...] He also drew comparison to the Marvel Netflix television series which often wait to tell the origin story of their heroes later in the season, using flashbacks, saying, [...] "It kind of helps {{to know more about the}} character, and be emotionally invested in the character, before you then go back and show what turned them into this person. And so part of it was that if you just began with a guy and showed the origin right away, I don't know if it would have been as compelling, I don't know if it would have been as emotional as I think it is. Bell noted that the series always shows Reyes' transformations into Ghost Rider as painful, but when that is shown happening for the first time in this episode [...] "he screams in pain like a lunatic".|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, {{when talking}} {{about the effects of}} {{coaching}} fast bowlers, Geoffrey Boycott commented, [...] "Remember what happened to Graham Dilley, who started out as a genuinely quick bowler.

2500|$|West, however, criticized President Obama when Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, {{saying that}} it would be {{difficult}} for Obama to be [...] "a war president with a peace prize".

[...] In November 2012, West said in an interview that he considered Obama a [...] "Rockefeller Republican in blackface." ...|$|E

2500|$|For a {{considerable}} period of time, Ferbert {{was out of}} contact in the Klondike, but he emerged on the Seward Peninsula. [...] An article published in 1909 after his return reported that Ferbert had struck it rich.

60|$|He {{was sorry}} for Bob, but <b>he</b> would not <b>have</b> been human (which he {{certainly}} was) if the triumph of having won through at last into the first eleven had not dwarfed commiseration. It had been his one ambition, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> achieved it.|$|R
