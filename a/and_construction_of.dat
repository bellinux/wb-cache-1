5|$|After the {{creation}} of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1933, nine camps and eight subcamps were set up in Boise National Forest, but the number of camps was reduced from 1934 until the program was closed in 1942.

5|$|Although {{the legal}} {{right-of-way}} was cleared by January 1974, cold weather, {{the need to}} hire workers, <b>and</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the Dalton Highway meant work on the pipeline itself did not begin until March.

Thousands of workers came to Alaska, attracted by the prospect of high-paying jobs at a time when most of the rest of the United States was undergoing a recession.|$|E

5|$|During {{development}} <b>and</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the park, many {{structures were}} added, redesigned or modified. These changes often resulted in budget increases. For example, the bandshell's proposed budget was $10.8million. When the elaborate, cantilevered Gehry design required extra pilings {{to be driven}} into the bedrock to support the added weight, {{the cost of the}} bandshell eventually spiraled to $60.3million. The cost of the park, as itemized in the following table, amounted to almost $500million.|$|E
5|$|During {{early years}} of colonisation, the {{surrounding}} trees were cut down and the river's gravel used in road making <b>and</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> buildings. As the natural environment was removed, the banks were eroded and the riverbed gradually levelled as waterholes filled. By 1878 the river was noted to be a malodorous, black sewer rather than the sylvan stream of the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|Even {{prior to}} the cost {{increases}} which plagued the design <b>and</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the tram, the project has been subject to criticism from the public. Many residents in the neighborhoods under the tram's route object to the tram's presence. The cost increases themselves, and the perceived machinations of public officials, have been controversial. Some consider the project an unworthy use of public funds at any price, either {{due to a lack}} of benefit for those not associated with OHSU, or due to opposition to such projects in general.|$|E
