25|$|King Kong {{is often}} used in {{commercial}} culture, for example in advertisements for Coca-Cola and Energizer Batteries. A New York insurance company used clips from the film to persuade people of the hazards of city life. A two-part Energizer Battery commercial had the 1933 Kong himself contracted by a rival battery corporation (SuperVolt) {{to get rid of}} the Energizer Bunny for them. The commercials were done in black-and-white, and used cleverly edited 1933 Kong sequences (possibly combined with new computer-generated Kong shots). The concluding second-part had Kong cornering the Bunny on the roof of a New York City building, complete with biplanes flying in the sky. His foot in an open window interrupts <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>that</b> resemble Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll having a romantic moment. The woman, extremely annoyed, slams the window on Kong's toes, making him lose his balance and grip, sending him falling. In 1990 Kongfrontation became one of the original rides at Universal Studios Florida.|$|E

500|$|Lyricist and {{composer}} Jeffrey Comanor recorded [...] "We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again" [...] for the album A Rumor in His Own Time, which debuted in September 1976. Produced by John Boylan and released on Epic Records, both the album {{and the single}} failed to chart. [...] "We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again" [...] describes <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>that</b> spends a night together, one which the narrator wishes [...] "would never end". Comanor, who wrote the song, stated that his lyrical inspiration originated from a girl he dated who owned a wooden KLH radio that continued to play music quietly when he attempted to turn it off. When Comanor's next girlfriend, Molly, left the city where he lived, he remembered their last night together and how he [...] "hated that night to end": {{a combination of the}} two memories formed the introductory lyrics of the song.|$|E

Around this time, an unknown McCartney original was recorded, {{with the help of}} engineer Geoff Emerick. The songs that McCartney would work on were voted upon democratically: McCartney comments, [...] "I pulled up some [...] from my memories, when I was a kid and we had family sing-songs, which was the original inspiration for the whole idea, I said to Tom, 'Let's look at these ones. This is the kind of era I want to look at.' Tommy himself suggested some; a girl in my office; [...] Diana [...] suggested some. Then I played Tommy <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>that</b> I'd written, and he said, 'Whoa, that's a great idea,' so we selected a couple of those.

IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode as 8.5 out of 10, finding that the [...] "only downside" [...] was that [...] "it felt less a tale about the Daleks than an adventure that just happened to have them in it". Maureen Ryan, writing for The Huffington Post, felt it was a [...] "ripping start to the season" [...] that redeemed the Daleks from [...] "Victory of the Daleks". While she commended Gillan and Darvill's acting during Amy and Rory's emotional confrontation, she noted that they were not <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>that</b> would break up because of infertility.|$|E

It is written in the key of D minor with Wonder's vocals ranging from C4 to A5; it is additionally accompanied by the instrumentation of a piano and a guitar. The lyrics of the composition describe <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>that</b> is {{nearing the end of}} their relationship; Wonder purposely uses [...] "cliché lines" [...] to get his point across and to prove the clichés true. Janine McAdams from Billboard found [...] "dramatic intensity" [...] within the lyrics, [...] "I should have never left your side / The writer takes his pen / To write the words again / That all in love is fair". Author Herb Jordan included the track's lyrics in his book Motown in Love: Lyrics from the Golden Era; they were placed under the section for songs in which the lyrics detail [...] "lessons of love".|$|E

She, like Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford), is not meant to be some happy housewife, married to a boy scout. Chloe needs a sparring partner and partner-in-crime. She is way too much woman to be cheated on by someone like Chance." [...] Also unfavorable of the relationship was Sara Bibel of Xfinity, who wrote that [...] "Chance and Chloe never had much chemistry. [...] She was attracted to him because she thought he was a safe, dependable guy who would not cheat on her", describing Chance as [...] "the anti-Billy" [...] in Chloe's eyes.|$|E
