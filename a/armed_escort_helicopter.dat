50|$|The V-60 was a {{projected}} light (3500 kg) <b>armed</b> <b>escort</b> <b>helicopter</b> from Kamov {{based on the}} civil Kamov Ka-126. Only {{a model of the}} original V-60 exists. The existing model shows four missiles as its sole armament. The project was abandoned in the 1980s and is often confused to be an early concept of the Ka-60.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} fleet grew from crop spraying aircraft to larger transports and helicopters {{used to support}} ground troops and transport personnel. As these operations became more involved in direct combat, a further need for search and rescue and <b>armed</b> <b>escort</b> <b>helicopters</b> was evident. Operations in the 1980s and 1990s were primarily carried out in Colombia, Guatemala, Peru, Bolivia and Belize. Many aircraft have since been {{passed on to the}} governments involved, as they became capable of taking over the operations themselves.|$|R
500|$|Prior to the {{development}} of the AH-56, all armed helicopters had been modifications to existing aircraft designed for unarmed uses. In 1962, then U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara convened the Howze Board to review Army aviation requirements. The board recommended an airmobile division supported by 90 armed helicopters.

50|$|The combat evaluation, PAVE COIN, {{was done}} in June and July 1971. The AU-23A was tested for eight {{possible}} missions: <b>armed</b> <b>escort</b> of <b>helicopters,</b> close air support, hamlet defense, STOL airlift and resupply, armed reconnaissance, border surveillance, forward air control, and counter infiltration. USAF crews flew 73 missions (94 sorties) and RVNAF crews flew 68 missions (85 sorties). Several types of weapons were test dropped/fired including 2.75-inch rockets (explosive and smoke), cluster bomb units (CBU-14), MK 6 Mod 3 flares, and MK 81, 82 and 106 practice bombs. More than 8,000 rounds of 20mm ammunition was fired also—both high explosive incendiary and target practice tracer types. Several problems were discovered during the PAVE COIN program, the most serious was the extreme vulnerability of the aircraft to all but the lightest antiaircraft fire (below 12.7mm). Despite the problems, the USAF continued with the development program and ordered 15 AU-23As for further testing.|$|R
