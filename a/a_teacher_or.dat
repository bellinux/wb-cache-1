25|$|The word {{refers to}} the {{presence}} and prominence of the bishop's or archbishop's chair or throne, raised above both clergy and laity, and originally located facing the congregation from behind the High Altar. In the ancient world the chair, on a raised dais, was the distinctive mark of <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>or</b> rhetor and thus symbolises the bishop's role as teacher. A raised throne within a basilican hall was also definitive for a Late Antique presiding magistrate; and so the cathedra also symbolises the bishop's role in governing his diocese.|$|E

25|$|Endel Puusepp {{was born}} into a family of Estonian peasants living in Yeniseysk Governorate, Siberia. His parents moved there, drawn by an offer of the Russian {{government}} to be given as much land as they could manage to cultivate. Thus, thousands of Estonians settled in Siberia and built farms, where they preserved their language and culture. Ever since early childhood, Puusepp dreamed of becoming a pilot. His parents, however, envisaged a different career for him: either <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>or</b> an agronomist. Having completed 7 grades of school, Puusepp moved to Leningrad to study at the Estonian-Finnish Teachers' College.|$|E
25|$|Performance jobs include {{playing as}} a freelancer in small groups, {{playing in a}} chamber music group, large ensembles, or {{performing}} solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting ("subbing") for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for many cello players {{to be able to}} find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist can come to this is in the case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>or</b> coach, or in another group.|$|E
