2500|$|When you {{get right}} down to it, Cain’s [...] plan is a 25 percent {{flat-rate}} consumption tax — not all that different from the FAIR tax that he says is his ultimate goal. This tax would be paid three times: first on wage income, again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> as a sales tax, and yet again by businesses on their sales minus their cost of goods and services. For tax junkies, the first is a flat tax. The second is a retail sales tax and the third a business transfer tax. [...] But they are all consumption taxes.|$|E

50|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} the Colruyt company was almost bankrupt, {{competing}} with newcomer Aldi. From 1988 the company slowly returned to profitability. Activities included {{the continuation of}} low prices on about 300 products. In 1987 the company replaced the punched card with price labels and 'full scanning' <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register.</b> Replenishment, stock management and orders were automated with bar code scanners.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{the rise}} of {{electronic}} cheque clearing (and debit cards as preferred instruments of payment) has made this difference less important than it once was. In some stores in the United States checks are scanned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> and handed back to the customer. The scanned information is forwarded to a payment processor, which transfers the money using the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network.|$|E

5000|$|When {{paying a}} cashier, {{it is common}} to place the money in their hand. Change is usually placed in your hand in return.

Paying <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> is most often {{the best way to avoid}} confusion.|$|E

5000|$|Others {{have been}} {{reported}} to print fake receipts which they use to return stolen merchandise for a cash refund. However, this is nearly impossible now that most stores use individually numbered receipts. Scanning the receipt's barcode <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> links legitimate returns to a database that validates the original purchase. (Despite this, some stores that have had such systems for years still refuse to accept a photocopy of a legitimate receipt where the original may have been misplaced, or obscured due to the store's use of cheap thermal paper or very light ink.) ...|$|E
50|$|According to the {{analysis}} of Howard Gleckman the Tax Policy Center,When you get right down to it, Cain’s 9-9-9 plan is a 25 percent flat-rate consumption tax — not all that different from the FAIR tax that he says is his ultimate goal. This tax would be paid three times: first on wage income, again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> as a sales tax, and yet again by businesses on their sales minus their cost of goods and services. For tax junkies, the first is a flat tax. The second is a retail sales tax and the third a business transfer tax. But they are all consumption taxes.|$|E
50|$|Decision fatigue can {{influence}} irrational impulse purchases at supermarkets. During {{a trip to}} the supermarket, trade-off decisions regarding prices and promotions can produce decision fatigue, hence by the time the shopper reaches the cash register, less willpower remains to resist impulse purchases of candy and sugared items. Sweet snacks are usually featured <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> because many shoppers have decision fatigue {{by the time they get}} there. Florida State University social psychologist Roy Baumeister has also found that it is directly tied to low glucose levels, and that replenishing them restores the ability to make effective decisions. This has been offered as an explanation for why poor shoppers are more likely to eat during their trips.|$|E

5000|$|Value in {{the most}} basic sense can be {{referred}} to as [...] "Real Value" [...] or [...] "Actual Value." [...] This is the measure of worth that is based purely on the utility derived from the consumption of a product or service. Utility derived value allows products or services to be measured on outcome instead of demand or supply theories that have the inherent ability to be manipulated.Illustration: The real value of a book sold to a student who pays $50.00 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> for the text and who earns no additional income from reading the book is essentially zero. However; the real value of the same text purchased in a thrift shop at a price of $0.25 and provides the reader with an insight that allows him or her to earn $100,000.00 in additional income is $100,000.00 or the extended lifetime value earned by the consumer. This is value calculated by actual measurements of ROI instead of production input and or demand vs. supply. No single unit has a fixed value.|$|E

5000|$|The {{last time}} I saw my brother Avraham Yitzhak, {{he was lying}} on a {{stretcher}} in an ambulance. He had a bandage on his face. He was four years old. Now our parents are not alive either.

A medic, I don’t know his name, took me to an ambulance and that is where I saw Avraham Yitzhak for the last time.I said to him, 'Avraham Yitzhak.' But he didn’t say anything. After that they took me on a stretcher to the hospital, and I had to have an operation to remove the screws that entered my liver and leg. I saw a sign on the door that said 'Operating Room' and started to cry. After that I didn’t see anything.In my house, they are sitting 'shiva' right now. My brothers came here with their torn shirts. I asked them 'Why are your shirts torn?' but they didn’t want to tell me that my parents were dead. My brothers were not with us in the restaurant. They found me first. After that, they found out that my sister and my brother were dead.My little sister was always happy. I remember her so well. She used to laugh all day long. On the day of the terror attack she was very happy. Daddy went to the bank, and we went into the restaurant and asked if we could order first and pay later, after Daddy came. They said no - so we went to wait for him at the bank. When he came out, we returned to the restaurant, and that's when the explosion occurred. I loved that restaurant very much. It had very, very good pizza.|$|E
