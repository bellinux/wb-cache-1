40|$|Providing a solid diet in {{addition}} to sow milk during lactation (creep feed) is a management commonly recommended to producers. This practice was introduced as a strategy to minimize the deleterious effects of <b>abrupt</b> and <b>early</b> <b>weaning,</b> {{as well as to}} standardize the litters to be weaned, to increase weaning weight, and to accelerate the adaptation of the gastrointestinal tract of piglets to solid diets. Creep feeds are formulated to present high levels of digestibility and palatability and to contain high-quality and high-cost ingredients. However, the results of studies indicating that the simple offer of creep feed is efficient in minimizing the deleterious effects of weaning or in facilitating the adaptation of piglets to early diets are still sparse and poorly consolidated. The objective {{of this study was to}} review factors that influence the consumption of creep feed and the effects of consumption of these diets on performance during lactation, as well as possible effects on enzyme production, occurrence of diarrhea episodes and postweaning performance of piglets weaned at 21 to 28 days of age. The results indicate that the intestinal maturity of suckling piglets is not sufficient to permit voluntary consumption and adequate digestion of the diets. Even animals ready for consumption did not ingest sufficient amounts to promote enzymatic adaptation or to improve postweaning performance. Contrary to expectations, the consumption of creep feed, especially in low amounts, may be associated with sensitization of the gastrointestinal tract which results in hypersensitivity reactions and postweaning diarrhea. It can be concluded that the simple offer of creep feed is not efficient in promoting growth during lactation and postweaning, nor does it facilitate the <b>early</b> adaptation of <b>weaned</b> piglets to solid diets. Studies in this area are therefore necessary to develop techniques that can effectively minimize losses resulting from the practice of <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> of piglets. </span...|$|R
40|$|The modern {{consumer}} of sheep meat requires uninterrupted market supply with qualitatively standardized meat, without excess fat and with high tenderness, which has encouraged producers to slaughter young sheep. A lamb’s diet during the pre-weaning phase was {{discussed in this}} review because it is of great importance for achieving success in a meat production system, given the high speed of lambs’ growth during their first weeks of life. Supplying palatable concentrate in creep-feeders from {{the first days of}} life promotes pre-stomach development and adapts the animal to a solid diet consumption; important processes for enhancing animal performance, since nutritional requirements, especially for energy, are high during this period and can only be met by milk for a short time. An <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> technique can be adopted from 35 days old, when adequate nutritional support is provided. Unweaned lamb slaughtering combined with creep feeding and controlled feeding have superior effects to <b>early</b> <b>abrupt</b> <b>weaning,</b> probably by avoiding the adverse effects generated by post-weaning stress. The use of a milk replacer is seldom reported due to the difficulty in finding specific products for sheep and its high cost. Controlled suckling does not affect the performance of lambs.

40|$|Background: Many {{years of}} bracing {{represent}} {{a burden to}} the patients. <b>Early</b> <b>weaning</b> {{may be the result}} of poor compliance, but may also be planned in patients with a long expected treatment time and a reduced stable primary curve during bracing. The aim of the present cohort study was to compare curve size, health related quality of life and surgical rates at long-term follow-up after ordinary bracing, planned and unplanned <b>early</b> <b>weaning.</b> Methods: Three hundred eighty-one patients (353 girls/ 28 boys) with late-onset juvenile (n = 30) and adolescent (n = 351) idiopathic scoliosis and a mean primary major curve of 33. 1 (range 20 – 57) ° were treated with Boston brace and followed prospectively. Results: Ordinary brace treatment was completed in 290 (76 %) patients, planned <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> at bone age < 14 years in 59 (16 %), and unplanned <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> in 32 (8 %), while 14 (5 %), 1 (2 %), and 12 (38 %) had surgery, respectively. Forty-eight (81 %) of the patients had a primary curve ≤ 25 ° at planned <b>early</b> <b>weaning.</b> Six-teen (27 %) of those who had planned <b>early</b> <b>weaning,</b> resumed bracing after a mean time of 2. 0 years. The mean curve size at long-term follow-up in average 23. 4 years after weaning, was smaller (p < 0. 001) in patients with planned <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> (25. 1 °) compared with ordinary bracing (34. 0 °) and unplanned <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> (34. 8 °).

40|$|Background and Aims: The {{clinical}} onset {{and severity}} of intestinal disorders in humans and animals can be profoundly impacted by early life stress. Here we investigated the impact of <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> stress in pigs on intestinal physiology, clinical disease, and immune response to subsequent challenge with enterotoxigenic F 18 E. coli (ETEC). Methodology: Pigs weaned from their dam at 16 d, 18 d, and 20 d of age were given a direct oral challenge of F 18 ETEC at 26 d of age. Pigs were monitored from days 0 to 4 post-infection for clinical signs of disease. On Day 4 post-ETEC challenge, ileal barrier function, histopathologic and inflammatory cytokine analysis were performed on ileal mucosa. Results: <b>Early</b> <b>weaned</b> pigs (16 d and 18 d weaning age) exhibited a more rapid onset {{and severity of}} diarrhea and reductions in weight gain in response to ETEC challenge compared with late weaned pigs (20 d weaning age). ETEC challenge induced intestinal barrier injury in <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> pigs, indicated by reductions in ileal transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and elevated FD 4 flux rates, in <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> pig ileum but not in late weaned pigs.

40|$|Behaviour {{problems}} {{are common in}} companion felines, and problematic behaviour {{may be a sign}} of chronic stress. In laboratory animals, <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> increases the risk for aggression, anxiety, and stereotypic behaviour. However, very few studies have focused on <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> in one of the world's most popular pets, the domestic cat, although weaning soon after the critical period of socialisation is common practice. To study the effects of <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> (< 12 weeks) on behaviour, a large data set (N = 5726, 40 breeds) was collected from home-living domestic cats through a questionnaire survey. The results show that weaning before 8 weeks of age increases the risk for aggression, but not fearful behaviour. Moreover, cats weaned after 14 weeks of age have a lower probability for aggression towards strangers than <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> cats and a lower probability for stereotypic behaviour (excessive grooming) than cats weaned at 12 weeks. The effect of weaning age on stereotypic behaviour is partially explained by the effects on aggression.

Performance was assessed by average daily gain (ADG) and body condition score (BCS) measurements. Metabolic profile was delineated by measuring serum albumin, urea, creatinine, cholesterol, glucose and aspartate aminotransferase. Weaning reduced ADG by 92 g/d and the ADG for weaned and suckling lambs were 113 g/d and 205 g/d, respectively. Supplementation increased ADG by 117 g/d and the ADG was 99 g/d for non-supplemented and 216 g/d for supplemented lambs. Body weight and BCS at the end of trial were lower in weaned and non-supplemented animals (20. 7 kg and 1. 5 points), and higher in those on creep feeding (35. 3 kg and 3. 3 points). Weaning decreased serum levels of albumin, cholesterol and aspartate aminotransferase. Supplementation increased serum albumin and decreased serum aspartate aminotransferase.

Recent studies, however, have proposed anticipating weaning age for the dual purpose of reducing doe energy output for milk production and consequent body energy deficit and providing better coverage for kit nutritional requirements through the administration of specific starter diets. Previous studies have demonstrated that the <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> of rabbits has no detrimental effects on health or growth performance when performed from 21 d onwards and is compatible with the behaviour of wild rabbits. <b>Early</b> <b>weaning</b> has been observed to improve doe body condition and energy balance by decreasing the lactation period and increasing the dry period.

Animal welfare may present another critical point against <b>early</b> <b>weaning,</b> even if survival is guaranteed whenever kits can easily access water and food. Specific starter diets appear useful in stimulating digestive functions and microflora development, although studies have shown that kits can be successfully <b>weaned</b> at an <b>early</b> stage regardless of the weaning diet adopted.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> on circadian rhythm and the behavioral satiety sequence in adult rats. Male Wistar rat pups were weaned for separation from the mother at 15 (D 15), 21 (D 21) and 30 (D 30) days old. Body weight and food intake was measured every 30 days until pups were 150 days old. At 90 days of age, the circadian rhythm of food intake was evaluated every 4 h for three days. Behavioral satiety was evaluated at 35 and 100 days of age. This work demonstrated that body weight and food intake were not altered, but the behavioral satiety sequence demonstrated that the D 15 group delayed satiety compared with the D 30 group at 100 days of age.

CBG binding capacity decreased during treatment, and it was significantly lower at day 18. At this age, GR levels and distribution in the gastric mucosa were also reduced as compared with suckling counterparts. To reduce corticosterone activity during <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> and to explore cell proliferation responses, we administered RU 486 to 15 -d-old pups. We found that cytoplasmic GR reached a peak after 48 h, whereas nuclear levels remained constant, thereby confirming the inhibition of receptor function. Next, by checking gastric proliferative responses, we observed that RU 486 induced higher DNA synthesis and mitotic indices in test subjects as compared with control groups. Conclusions: We demonstrated that <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> changed corticosterone activity by increasing hormone levels, reducing CBG binding capacity, and decreasing GR distribution in the gastric epithelium. These modifications seem to be important to the reorganization of gastric growth after the abrupt interruption of suckling.

40|$|Objective: Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} {{the effects of a}} dietary regimen (suckling or <b>early</b> <b>weaning)</b> and feeding status (fed or fasted) on the distribution of transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-beta 3) and TGF receptor-I (T beta RI) in the gastric epithelium of pups Methods: Wistar rats were used At 15 d, half of the pups were separated from dams and fed with hydrated powered chow On day 17, suckling and early weanling rats were subjected to fasting (17 h). Four different conditions were established. suckling fed and fasted and early weanling fed and fasted At 18 d stomachs were collected under anesthesia and were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde for immunohistochemistry The number of immunostained epithelial cells per microscopic field was determined for TGF-beta 3 and T beta RI in longitudinal sections from the gastric mucosa Results: We found that during suckling, fasting reduced the number of immunolabeled cells per field of both molecules when compared with the fed group (P < 0. 05), whereas in <b>early</b> <b>weaning,</b> food restriction increased TGF-beta 3 and T beta RI distributions (P < 0. 05) We also observed that TGF-beta 3 and T beta RI were more concentrated in parietal cells in the upper gland in suckling pups, whereas after <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> these were displaced to parietal and chief cells {{at the bottom of the}} gland Conclusion: Suckling and <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> directly influence TGF-beta 3 and T beta RI distributions in the gastric epithelium in response to fasting, such that <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> anticipates the effects observed in adult rats. Furthermore, the differential concentrations of TGF-beta 3 and T beta RI indicate that they might be important for cell proliferation events in growth control (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Two weaning diets (C and S) {{and three}} weaning ages (21, 25, and 28 days) were {{compared}} in a two factorial arrangement {{to evaluate their}} effect on growth performance, body composition and caecal fermentation activity of young rabbits. One hundred litters born the same day from multiparous does were used. Sixty litters were <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> at 21, 25 and 28 days of age (20 litters per weaning age), put in collective cages (nine kits per cage) (W 21, W 25, and W 28 litters) and offered the control diet C (crude protein (CP) : 175 g/kg dry matter (DM); ether extract : 20 g/kg DM; starch : 157 g/kg DM; acid-detergent lignin (ADL) : 60 g/kg DM; digestible energy (DE) : 11 • 08 MJ/kg DM) or the starter diet S (CP : 173 g/kg DM; ether extract : 41 g/kg DM; starch : 112 g/kg DM; ADL : 51 g/kg DM; DE : 11 • 31 MJ/kg DM). At 32 days of age, 180 <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> rabbits (three rabbits {{from each of the}} 60 litters above) were selected : 60 animals were slaughtered; 120 animals were placed into individual cages and offered a fattening diet (CP : 166 g/kg DM; ether extract : 23 g/kg DM; starch : 177 g/kg DM; ADL : 49 g/kg DM; DE : 11 • 26 MJ/kg DM) from 32 to 56 days of age. At 56 days of age, another 60 representative rabbits were slaughtered. The administration of diet S to the <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> rabbits increased litter weight at 32 days (6160 v. 6027 g; P 0 • 05) of weaning age was recorded on growth performance or caecal fermentation traits, but EB protein remained lower in the <b>earliest</b> <b>weaned</b> rabbits (P < 0 • 05). In conclusion, feeding a high-fat low-starch diet to <b>early</b> <b>weaned</b> rabbits stimulated growth and body fat and energy retention of kits at 32 days of age with no effect on caecal fermentation. The <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> successfully performed at 21 days of age strongly stimulated caecal fermentation but reduced body protein reserves...|$|R
40|$|Research {{investigating}} {{the effects of}} weaning calves at three different ages was conducted over four years at the Dalbey-Halleck Farm.

40|$|The term “Early Weaning” {{tends to}} be used rather loosely in the Beef Industry, and {{producers}} can find many articles claiming benefits of <b>early</b> <b>weaning.</b> A few questions arise. How <b>early</b> is <b>early</b> <b>weaning?</b> Is there economic benefit to <b>weaning</b> <b>early?</b> We will address these questions in this paper. At the Range Beef Cow Symposium XIV, Whittier (1995) categorized <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> as 1) weaning {{before the start of}} the breeding season (birth to 90 days) or 2) weaning during the breeding season (90 to 160 days). Weaning calves {{before the start of the}} breeding season has shown to improve reproductive performance of cattle during the year in which calves are weaned (Geary et al., 2006; Lusby et al., 1981). Improved reproduction can be due to removal of the sucking stimulus and/or from improved energy balance of the cattle. Cattle that are in marginal to thin body condition score at the start of breeding may benefit more than well conditioned cattle (Whittier, 1995). Weaning calves late in the breeding season likely will not yield any improvements in reproduction during the year in which calves are weaned. While calves can be weaned at 60 - 100 days, more intense calf management is necessary, making the practice unpractical for many producers. Recent worked out of Miles City, MT showed that calves <b>weaned</b> <b>early</b> at 80 days and put on a growing ration until herd-mates were weaned at about 215 days resulted in the <b>early</b> <b>weaning</b> system having significantly less net income than the normal weaning system (Waterman et al., 2006). Weaning towards the end of the breeding season, 120 - 160 days, is more practical and can have benefits in certain situations. This paper will focus on time of weaning calves from 120 days and beyond...|$|R
