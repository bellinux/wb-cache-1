40|$|International audienceIn {{the quest}} to give a formal {{compositional}} semantics to natural languages, semanticists have started turning their attention to phenomena that have been also considered as parts of pragmatics (e. g., discourse anaphora andpresupposition projection). To account for these phenomena, the very kinds of meanings assigned to words and phrases are often revisited. To be more specific, in the prevalent paradigm of modeling natural languagedenotations using the simply-typed lambda calculus (higher-order logic) this means revisiting the types of denotations assigned to individual parts of speech. However, the lambda calculus {{also serves as a}} fundamental theory of computation, and in the study of computation, similar type shifts have been employed to give a meaning to side effects.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the effects of both word-form {{rehearsal}} and language experience on fast mapping production and comprehension skills. This experiment studied thirty Spanish-English bilingual young adults. The experimental portion of the study contained four main parts: (1) word-form rehearsal, (2) presentation (3) production, and (4) comprehension. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of three word-form rehearsal conditions. Each participant began the experiment by repeating a set of sixteen novel nonwords either fifteen times each, five times each, or zero times (control group). Next, the participants were presented a visual and auditory nonword stimulus simultaneously. Next, each participant was aurally asked to verbally produce the nonword when presented with a visual stimulus. Finally, each participant was asked to identify a specific visual stimulus that corresponds with an aurally resented nonword. The participants completed these four tasks in two phonologically similar <b>anguages</b> (English and Spanish) and one phonologically unfamiliar language (Cantonese).

40|$|Subjects {{listened to}} a story {{containing}} sentences with five different quantifiers (all, many, some, a few, and none). They were then given a recognition test in which for each sentence {{they were asked to}} rate all the quantifiers as to how certain they were that each had appeared in the sentence. The degree of confusion between any two quantifiers (measured by both mean certainty ratings and first choice frequencies) declined monotonically with the separation of the two terms in a linear order. The confusion pattern was identical regardless of whether subjects were given intentional or incidental learning instructions. Successive interval scaling and the Luce biased choice model were both used to derive unidimensional scales of quantifier values that accurately described the obtained confusion matrix. A semantic feature model was also able to provide a fairly good overall account of the data, except hat it had difficulty explaining the high frequency of confusions between all and many. The results raise the possibility that a major component of the memory trace for quantifiers is an essentially analog representation f magnitude. English and other natural <b>anguages</b> contain a number of words that express degrees of quantity (e. g., all, some, several, often).

40|$|A {{major step}} forward in devioe {{technology}} is being made {{with the introduction of}} low-cost integrated circuits and large-scale integration (181), the implications of which seem to go beyond those of any previous improvement in computer components. Whereas the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors brought about a tremendous increase in reliability and decrease in physical Yolume, any increase in physical size was a by-product of these rather than a main effect. What LSI offers is sheer quantity of deVices, ata low cost and in a small space- so many devices in fact that the completa processor of a digital computer, or all the active elements of an analog computer, may beoome a single component. This paper discusses the impact of LSI on computer systems and computing techniques, and suggests that the major effects will be to make special-purpose computers for specific problem areas very much more attractive, and to blur the distinction between aoftware and hardware- in the sense that computer-assisted deSign and computer program compiling will merge into a general translation technique from problem specification to both. module interconnection (hardware) and variable sto~ed-program (software).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 Language shift {{happens when}} a group of people stops using one {{language}} in favor of another, such that subsequent generations no longer acquire the original language. Research on the sociolinguistics of language shift has tended to focus on <b>anguages</b> in advanced states of endangerment, where most or all children in the community have already stopped acquiring the language. Less work has been done on the long-term processes that can turn a moderately threatened language into a critically endangered or moribund language. A better understanding of the long-term dynamics of language shift would improve not only our understanding of the current language endangerment crisis, but also our understanding of language ecology and language contact at earlier periods in human history. To this end, the present study takes Fishman's concept of language maintenance versus shift as different outcomes of intergenerational mother tongue transmission, and formalizes it for quantitative research. Mongolian in China can be considered a moderately-threatened language. Though it is the national language of Mongolia, more than half the world’s Mongolian speakers live in China, and most major dialect branches are spoken only in China. Within China, Mongolian speakers are a small minority even in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR), where they are most concentrated. Contact between Mongolian and Chinese speakers has gone on in southern Inner Mongolia since at least the 1700 s, but during the 20 th century it intensified and expanded to the rest of IMAR, especially after the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Previous research has established that some portion of ethnic Mongol children in the IMAR are no longer acquiring Mongolian, while most adult speakers are bilingual with Chinese. Mongolian has overt prestige as a cultural symbol, but is seen as backward and less useful than Chinese. This thesis presents results from a field survey of over 600 ethnic Mongols born between 1920 and 2007 in the IMAR. It investigates two processes, the spread of Chinese among Mongolian speakers (i. e. the growth of bilingualism), and the maintenance versus loss of Mongolian among children in bilingual communities. It also demonstrates a new method for the quantitative study of language shift and intergenerational language transmission in language communities that are too large to be observable through ethnography alone. The unit of analysis is the intergenerational dyad rather than the individual speaker. Results are analyzed over time, based on speakers’ age, and across space, based on speakers’ location of residence and how urban that location was. The analysis shows that Chinese proficiency spread rapidly through the Mongolian-speaking population during the mid to late twentieth century, reaching a saturation point among Mongolian speakers born in the 1980 s and later, nearly all of whom are proficient in Chinese. Surprisingly, given claims in previous literature, the loss of Mongolian has been much more gradual, and there is no identifiable “shifting generation” or “transitional generation” in this sample. Instead, the rate of shift among children raised by Mongolian-Chinese bilingual parents remains the same for all age cohorts born {{in the latter half of}} the twentieth century. Urban versus rural residence, however, plays an important role. The proportion of shifting individuals is much higher among children raised in large cities than among those raised in medium-size towns or rural areas, regardless of birth year. As China’s population becomes more urbanized, shift from Mongolian to Chinese may accelerate in the near future. Even if the rate of shift stays the same, a steady proportional decline in each generation will still have a cumulative effect, resulting in an exponential decline in the population of Mongolian speakers. This observation helps to explain how language shift can proceed in a gradual manner for many decades and even centuries, then (apparently suddenly) overtake the remaining speakers in a single generation...|$|R
