5|$|Last year I decided I'm {{not doing}} music until I'm excited again, then this {{came along and}} also I did end up making another record which I'll release at some point. It's just being mastered, it's a lovely album; I didn't write this one, this is old songs <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> sort out my situation- I don't want the same problem as before.|$|E

It's that comic-book guy right down the block.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell them, 'No, it's every comic-bookstore guy in America.'" [...] Cast member Hank Azaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a student who went by the name [...] "F" [...] and lived in the room next door at his college.|$|E
500|$|J. Gresham Barrett {{brought up}} {{legislation}} in the U.S. House of Representatives which, among other things, referred to Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. Congress members Tom Lantos, Jim Saxton, Thad McCotter, Chris Shays, Charles Boustany, Alcee Hastings, and Robert Wexler referred to Hezbollah as a terrorist organization in their speeches supporting the legislation. Shortly before a speech by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, U.S. Congressman Dennis Hastert said, [...] "He [...] denounces terrorism, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take him at his word. Hezbollah is a terrorist organization." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Daily Telegraph Madonna further explained her inspiration behind the song and stated that [...] " [...] a song most people who work can relate to. If part of your work is travelling, and the person you are with also works and travels, you find yourself separated a lot {{and it can be}} very frustrating, [...] I'm American and he [...] is British, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> come to America all the time. [...] Especially at the beginning of our relationship, that long-distance thing was very frustrating. I also think it's easier for people to say things from a distance; it's safer." ...|$|E
500|$|Wan {{shot the}} short with a 16mm camera in {{over two days}} and {{transferred}} the footage to DVDs to ship along with the script. Whannell wanted to play the lead character in the feature film. The short helped show that Wan and Whannell was a [...] "director-actor team" [...] rather than just wanting to sell the script. Wan said, [...] "Leigh and I just loved the project so much and we wanted a career in filmmaking so we stuck to our guns and said, 'Look, guys, if you want this project, we're coming on board - Leigh has to act in it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> direct it." ...|$|E
500|$|Bergkamp's {{nickname}} is the [...] "Non-Flying Dutchman" [...] due to {{his fear}} of flying. This stemmed from an incident with the Netherlands national team at the 1994 World Cup where the engine of the plane cut out during a flight, prompting a journalist to joke about having a bomb in his bag. Following this incident, Bergkamp decided he would never fly again but did consider seeking psychiatric help:I've got this problem <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live with it. I can't do anything about it, it is a psychological thing and I can't explain it. I have not flown on a plane for two years. The Dutch FA has been sympathetic, so have Arsenal, so far. I am considering psychiatric help. I can't fly. I just freeze. I get panicky. It starts the day before, when I can't sleep.|$|E

500|$|Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere della Sera {{mentioned that}} Madonna would play in Italy {{as part of}} a world tour to promote Bedtime Stories in spring or fall 1995. However, Madonna and her manager Freddy DeMann cancelled all plans after she was offered the role of Eva Perón on the film Evita, directed by Alan Parker. Her spokesperson Liz Rosenberg considered a [...] "shorter tour" [...] because of filming, however, Madonna commented, [...] "I've waited years for this role, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put every ounce of concentration into it. I love touring, and I very much want to go out with this album. But I can't—I'd be going straight from months on the road right into filming; I'd be exhausted and strained. It wouldn't be {{in the best interests of}} the movie for me to be at any less than my peak of energy".|$|E
500|$|Following his {{graduation}} from La Salle University, Garland {{signed with the}} sports agent Gilad Berkowitz from Berkowitz Career Ventures. Berkowitz, a law student at Duke University, was certified with the National Basketball Players Association but was only {{two years older than}} his client. The agent said, [...] "What he has to overcome is his size and range <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> overcome my age. We are going to market ourselves to NBA teams". Garland's connections with Berkowitz helped him get to know trainer Kendrick Williams and get an endorsement deal with Under Armour. He had hopes of playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA), regardless of whether he had to compete in Europe before reaching that level. In mid-October 2014, Garland planned on entering the 2014 NBA Development League Draft. However, on November 16, he agreed to terms with Michelin Etha Engomis Nicosia of the Cyprus Basketball Division 1, but would not make an official appearance for them.|$|E
500|$|In a December 2012 interview, Winkelman {{expressed}} some regret {{about what}} had happened. [...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come back. I'm {{going to}} Europe next week, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come {{to look after}} my boat, here; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wanted to say good-by to Maynard. I {{was just going to}} speak to Maynard, and then sail my boat over to Leyden." ...|$|R

500|$|During {{production}} of the fourth season, Beaver joined the limited series Harper's Island. Although he initially feared that it would prevent future appearances of Bobby, {{he was able to}} maintain his Supernatural [...] "quota" [...] with seven episodes. The character's role increased for the fifth season, which made sense for the actor due to the apocalyptic storyline. The season also introduced a new story arc for Bobby: his use of a wheelchair. Series creator Eric Kripke explained that it [...] " [...] the Apocalypse matter"; the writers wanted [...] "real stakes and real loss and real obstacles thrown in our heroes' way" [...] to differentiate it from prior seasons. Though he found it to be a challenge, Beaver enjoyed the experience because he could perform tricks on set that his wheelchair-using college roommate had taught him. However, the actor did [...] " [...] very seriously", and commented, [...] "I can get out of the chair {{at the end of the}} day and go home and I recognize that, so many people can't <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be considerate to them and respect that." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Chelsea's victory, player-manager Vialli was {{satisfied}} with his club's performance, commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix: [...] "He decided he had a feeling and he was right". Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed. I am still the player-manager <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be one next season. We are very happy to win, but we do not want to stop here. We want to keep improving and next season we will start trying to win the Premier League, which is our aim now." ...|$|E
500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E

500|$|Undone {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Although some critics felt the songwriting and music were too {{similar to the}} band's previous efforts, others praised the album's 'personal' style. Kim Jones of About.com gave the album five out of five stars, saying that [...] " [...] has been called by many people {{as one of the}} best new releases of 2004 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> agree". Johnny Loftus of Allmusic gave it three out of five stars, saying that [...] "With its slick production and MercyMe's full lineup of guitars, percussion, and keys, [...] suggests the tangent of Nashville contemporary country that favors straightforward pop melody over any sort of hard twang. Likewise, the album's more upbeat moments reflect the trend in secular adult alternative toward earnest vocals over whitewashed rock (à la Vertical Horizon). Both sounds work well for MercyMe on Undone, doubtless giving fans of the band's music and devotion plenty more to believe in". David McCreary of CCM Magazine gave Undone an A, calling it [...] " [...] most mature, personal recording to date", also praising Bart Millard's vocals. Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten stars, calling it a [...] "huge improvement" [...] over Spoken For (2002).|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the UNICEF charity record [...] was released; it is a {{collection}} of seventeen eclectic remixes of [...] "Army of Me". All profits went directly to the charity, to assist the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Live at Shepherds Bush Empire was released as a VHS in November, 1998, containing the last performance of the Post Tour, which took place at Shepherds Bush Empire in February 1997. Post Live, a live album consisting of songs recorded during the Post Tour, was included in the 2003 box set Live Box. The 2002 box set Family Tree includes demos and alternate versions of various tracks off the album. Post has been reissued several times, adapting to different formats such as colored records, 180g vinyl, and DualDisc. A remastered version of the album in surround sound was included in the box set Surrounded, which was released in 2006 on Elektra Records. In 2012, Universal Japan issued a limited edition of Debut and Post together as one compilation [...] In 2008, when asked how she felt about the album in retrospect, Björk reflected: [...] "I listened to [...] when we did the surround mixes of it like {{two or three years ago}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say I was kinda surprised how the odd spastic thing of the album had actually aged well. I was very aware of it at the time that I needed to be musically promiscuous and have almost every song [...] different mood/style and so on." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Ryder {{hinted at}} a {{possible}} {{return for the}} sequel as well by saying, [...] "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy {{but it sounds like}} it might be happening. It's 27 years later. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|King {{did not do}} {{detailed}} preliminary {{drawings for}} his lithographs. Nor did he make an artist’s print when printing them.
