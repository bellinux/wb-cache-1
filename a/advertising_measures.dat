40|$|Agriculture {{is under}} {{environmental}} pressure since its modernization, mainly after the Second World War, which generated {{the use of}} large quantities of chemical products as pesticides and fertilizers. However, during the three last décades, {{the preservation of the}} quality of the environment progressively became a priority of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and different measures were successively implemented, some of them being compulsory and other ones not, or not yet. This paper focuses on the implementation of agricultural Policy measures at the regional level of Wallonia, the Southern part of Belgium, a founder state of the European Union. Three aspects are presented and analyzed: (1) the greening of the CAP, through the so-called "green payment" and its conséquences (permanent pasture maintenance, crop diversification, and the establishment of ecological focus areas); (2) the development of organic farming; and (3) the increasing number of specific quality labels. The paper argues that, supported by the CAP and the Walloon regional government through financial, research, education, extension, and <b>advertising</b> <b>measures,</b> the Walloon agriculture is farmed on the direction toward a more sustainable model, a more resilient onte to environnemental pressure.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of alcohol {{advertising}} on adolescent alcohol consumption. The theory of an industry response function and evidence from prior studies indicate the importance of maximizing the variance in <b>advertising</b> <b>measures.</b> Monitoring the Future (MTF) and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY 97) data are augmented with alcohol advertising, originating on the market level, for five media. The large sample of the MTF allows estimation of race and gender-specific models. The longitudinal nature of the NLSY 97 allows controls for unobserved heterogeneity with state-level and individual fixed effects. Price and advertising effects are generally larger for females relative to males. Controls for individual heterogeneity yield larger advertising effects, implying that the MTF results may understate {{the effects of}} alcohol advertising. Results from the NLSY 97 suggest that a 28 % reduction in alcohol advertising would reduce adolescent monthly alcohol participation from 25 % to between 24 and 21 %. For binge participation, the reduction would be from 12 % to between 11 and 8 %. The past month price-participation elasticity is estimated at − 0. 26, consistent with prior studies. The results show that reduction of alcohol advertising can produce a modest decline in adolescent alcohol consumption, though effects may vary by race and gender.

40|$|While {{there are}} many <b>measures</b> of <b>advertising</b> awareness, there are few {{guidelines}} about which of these a researcher should select. We examine how using the brand influences consumer responses to three measures commonly used in advertising tracking instruments. We find that for both top-of-mind and total unprompted <b>advertising</b> awareness <b>measures,</b> brand users are about 2. 5 {{times more likely to}} recall advertising exposure than non-users; however, this ratio was lower for brand-prompted advertising awareness, with brand users only about 1. 7 times more likely than non-users. This, we find, is because non-users respond more to brand-prompted <b>advertising</b> awareness <b>measures.</b> This result influences the scores for small brands, which get 80 % of their responses from non-users only when they are prompted with the brand name. Our conclusion is therefore that scores from different <b>advertising</b> awareness <b>measures</b> are not directly comparable, unless split into separate brand user/non-user groups. Further, practitioners interested in the results for small-share or new brands should use brand-prompted measures, otherwise they risk underestimating the advertising reach and effectiveness of these brands. ...|$|R
40|$|While much {{is known}} about the {{economic}} determinants of tobacco use, very little {{is known about}} the economic determinants of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use. This paper is the first econometric study to examine the impact of advertising on NRT demand. Pooled cross-sectional time-series scanner-based data for 50 major metropolitan markets in the USA covering the period between the second quarter of 1996 and the second quarter of 2002 are used in the analysis. Fixed-effects modeling is employed to estimate the NRT demand equation. The estimates indicate that increased advertising of Nicoderm CQ transdermal patches and Nicotrol transdermal patches increases per-capita sales of established Nicoderm CQ and Nicotrol products, respectively. However, increased advertising of Nicorette polacrilex (gum) was found not to significantly increase sales of established Nicorette products. Moreover, decreases in the price of NRT and increases in the price of cigarettes were found to increase per-capita sales of NRT products. Given the documented efficacy of NRT, measures to increase peoples' awareness of NRT products through <b>advertising,</b> <b>measures</b> to decrease the price of NRT, and measures to increase the price of cigarettes would be effective means to increase the use of NRT, likely leading to decreased cigarette smoking and reductions in the future public health burden caused by tobacco use.

40|$|Background: 'Neuromarketing' is a {{term that}} has often {{been used in the}} media in recent years. These public discussions have {{generally}} centered around potential ethical aspects and the public fear of negative consequences for society in general, and consumers in particular. However, positive contributions to the scientific discourse from developing a biological model that tries to explain context-situated human behavior such as consumption have often been neglected. We argue for a differentiated terminology, naming commercial applications of neuroscientific methods 'neuromarketing' and scientific ones 'consumer neuroscience'. While marketing scholars have eagerly integrated neuroscientific evidence into their theoretical framework, neurology has only recently started to draw its attention to the results of consumer neuroscience. Discussion: In this paper we address key research topics of consumer neuroscience that we think are of interest for neurologists; namely the reward system, trust and ethical issues. We argue that there are overlapping research topics in neurology and consumer neuroscience where both sides can profit from collaboration. Further, neurologists joining the public discussion of ethical issues surrounding neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience could contribute standards and experience gained in clinical research. Summary: We identify the following areas where consumer neuroscience could contribute to the field of neurology: First, studies using game paradigms could help to gain further insights into the underlying pathophysiology of pathological gambling in Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, epilepsy, and Huntington's disease. Second, we identify compulsive buying as a common interest in neurology and consumer neuroscience. Paradigms commonly used in consumer neuroscience could be applied to patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia to advance knowledge of this important behavioral symptom. Third, trust research in the medical context lacks empirical behavioral and neuroscientific evidence. Neurologists entering this field of research could profit from the extensive knowledge of the biological foundation of trust that scientists in economically-orientated neurosciences have gained. Fourth, neurologists could contribute significantly to the ethical debate about invasive methods in neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience. Further, neurologists should investigate biological and behavioral reactions of neurological patients to marketing and <b>advertising</b> <b>measures,</b> as they could show special consumer vulnerability and be subject to target marketing.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three main chapters following the introduction. The focus lies on two applications for a novel individual level dataset. Chapter 2 contains detailed information on the dataset {{that is used to}} estimate two differentiated product demand models in the chapters 3 and 4. The model in chapter 3 is an individual level model, whereas in chapter 4 the data is modified to study the impact for a market level model. In the following I outline the three chapters. In chapter 2, I give an overview of a German dataset collected by the marketing research company A. C. Nielsen. The chapter is intended for potential users of the dataset and contains numerous details. Therefore, the focus is on describing and not on analyzing the data. The data highlight the recent tendency to have very detailed profiles of tracked households. The data comprise a panel of consumer households over a period of two years. Product purchases and the associated exposure to TV advertisements are recorded. The main feature of the dataset is a nationwide collection of this information for the same households with a matured technology. The purchases are available for two product categories: detergents and chocolate. The data comprise a record of the advertisement contacts of each household for all advertisements that were nationally broadcast on TV. Moreover, the dataset includes common sociodemographic information on the households. I give file descriptions, detailed variable discussions and descriptive statistics. I outline the steps necessary to prepare the data for discrete choice analysis. Finally, a basic analysis with binary choice and discrete choice models demonstrates the possibilities and usefulness of the dataset. In chapter 3, I study five causes for the price endogeneity bias in differentiated products demand models. Previous work tackled the bias by suggesting a price endogeneity correction, but never accounted for all causes simultaneously. The five causes are (i) variety characteristics (ii) unobserved retail activity (iii) TV advertising (iv) household inventories and (v) state dependence/habits. I discuss each cause in detail and how it relates to the endogeneity correction. In particular, I discuss the causes that the endogeneity correction cannot capture. The model estimated with the data from chapter 2 is an individual level discrete choice mixed logit model. The data enable a treatment of the five causes simultaneously under two regimes where prices enter nominally or in efficiency units. Besides, I propose a new approach to construct instruments in the absence of wholesale prices. The results, measured in terms of price elasticities, shed light on the relative importance of the five causes under both price regimes. The importance of the endogeneity correction and a favorite candidate cause for price endogeneity, TV advertising, are studied as well. Previous literature put an emphasis on studying causes in detail, without a focus on price endogeneity. In chapter 4, I assess the role of local TV advertising and retail activity information for aggregate demand outcomes. Commonly, due to nationwide synchronicity of the TV program, {{it is not possible to}} measure local advertising exposure of geographically distinct markets within a country. Therefore, only national advertising has been accounted for in previous approaches. I construct a market level dataset with local advertising information from the rich individual panel dataset from chapter 2 and use a state of the art standard market level discrete choice model with random coefficients. I estimate the model on the constructed data to evaluate the importance of advertising. Just as the model in chapter 3, the model allows for price endogeneity caused by an unobserved product characteristic and again advertising is one of the candidate explanations. As the construction of the dataset is not unique, as first step I compare 120 possible setups with the simple discrete choice logit model to assess the role of advertising. Advertising is analyzed for twenty differently constructed <b>advertising</b> <b>measures.</b> Commonly, this first necessary step has not been discussed in previous applications. For four candidate setups that give clear results in the first step and are economically plausible, I estimate the random coefficients version, considering the recent advances and caveats of this model class. I implement versions with and without local sociodemographic market information to find out whether this impacts the findings for local advertising...|$|E

METHODS: Data on recall of televised campaigns from 1, 968 adult smokers residing in England through four waves of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) United Kingdom Survey from 2005 to 2009 were merged with estimates of per capita exposure to government-run televised tobacco control <b>advertising</b> (<b>measured</b> in GRPs, or Gross Rating Points), which were categorised as either “positive” or “negative” according to their emotional content.

40|$|Childhood obesity {{around the}} world, and {{particularly}} in the United States, is an escalating problem that is especially detrimental as its effects carry on into adulthood. In this paper we employ the 1979 Child-Young Adult National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to estimate the effects of fast-food restaurant advertising on children and adolescents being overweight. The <b>advertising</b> <b>measure</b> used is the number of hours of spot television fast-food restaurant advertising messages seen per week. Our results indicate that a ban on these advertisements would reduce the number of overweight children ages 3 - 11 in a fixed population by 10 percent and would reduce the number of overweight adolescents ages 12 - 18 by 12 percent. The elimination of the tax deductibility of this type of advertising would produce smaller declines of between 3 and 5 percent in these outcomes but would impose lower costs on children and adults who consume fast food in moderation because positive information about restaurants that supply this type of food would not be banned completely from television. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} determining optimal sample sizes in advertising pretests, where two or more copies are compared for their relative <b>advertising</b> effectiveness <b>measured</b> on a dichotomous (0 or 1) scale. As the sample size is increased, sampling variations decrease so that the pretest {{has a better chance}} of identifying the truly best ad. Consequently, increasing the sample size decreases the opportunity costs of not selecting the best ad which, however, have to be balanced against the increased sampling costs. Taking these two considerations into account, three approaches (indifference zone, minimizing maximum loss and Bayesian) for determining sample size are discussed. The minimizing maximum loss approach seems to offer the best compromise in terms of realistic modelling and practical implementability. Extensions of the approaches to the case where <b>advertising</b> effectiveness is <b>measured</b> on an interval scale are outlined. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{previous}} {{result is}} explained by the two effects that advertising exerts on welfare: On the one hand, advertising has a direct effect, captured by k, which depends on the private profits associated with <b>advertising</b> (<b>measured</b> by γ) and the nuisance costs (measured by δ), {{but on the other}} hand, advertising also has an indirect effect on welfare by affecting the distribution of audience shares between the two platforms. Obviously, because of the direct effect, the publicly owned platform undertakes a greater level of advertising than the private platform if and only if advertising is socially profitable (region I). However, note that the interplay between the direct and indirect effect explains why advertising by the publicly owned platform is positive in region (II), despite the harmful direct effect in this region. This interplay is positive because the negative direct impact exerted by advertising on welfare is outweighed by the positive effect associated with the fact the publicly owned platform’s advertising increases the size of the private platform audience, which is socially profitable if the quality differential of the publicly owned platform is small (compared with k).|$|R
