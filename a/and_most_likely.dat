5|$|An {{outline of}} the origins of the {{parasitic}} life style has been proposed. Epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans on fish hosts are basal in the Neodermata and were the first shift to parasitism from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary step was a dietary change from epithelium to blood. The last common ancestor of Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> sanguinivorous.|$|E

They include Aechmophorus grebes, American coot, American white pelican, Anas and Aythya ducks, black-crowned night heron, eared grebes, pied-billed grebes <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> shorebirds.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was commissioned in 1546 after Titian {{had made a}} number of portraits of Paul. He had already depicted Pier Luigi and three of his children – Vittoria, Alessandro and Ranuccio. Ottavio was perhaps again portrayed by him in 1552, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> commissioned the original Naples panel in Titian's Danaë series, although Lodovico Dolce believed it was Alessandro who had approached Titian.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius offered {{peace to}} Khosrow, presumably in 624, {{threatening}} otherwise to invade Persia, but Khosrow rejected the offer. On March 25, 624, Heraclius left Constantinople {{to attack the}} Persian heartland. He willingly abandoned any attempt to secure his rear or his communications with the sea, marching through Armenia and modern Azerbaijan to assault the core Persian lands directly. According to Walter Kaegi, Heraclius led an army {{of no more than}} 40,000, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> between 20,00024,000. Before journeying to the Caucasus, he recovered Caesarea, in defiance of the earlier letter that Khosrow had sent him.|$|E
5|$|In writing {{polyphonic}} {{settings of}} psalms, Josquin was a pioneer, and psalm settings form {{a large proportion}} of the motets of his later years. Few composers prior to Josquin had written polyphonic psalm settings. Some of Josquin's settings include the famous Miserere, written in Ferrara in 1503 or 1504 <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> inspired by the recent execution of the reformist monk Girolamo Savonarola, Memor esto verbi tui, based on Psalm 119, and two settings of De profundis (Psalm 130), both of which are often considered to be among his most significant accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13 {{is a star}} in the Lynx constellation. The star is similar, {{in terms}} of {{metallicity}} and mass, to the Sun, although it is hotter <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> older. The star was first observed in 1997, according to the SIMBAD database, and was targeted by SuperWASP after the star was observed by one of the SuperWASP telescopes beginning in 2006. Follow-up observations on the star led to the discovery of planet WASP-13b in 2008; the discovery paper was published in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Although Centre {{was known}} as one of Kentucky's {{foremost}} colleges, Cooper's father wanted him to broaden his education and, after one year at Centre, Cooper transferred to Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut. At Yale, he was a classmate of his future U.S. Senate colleague, Stuart Symington. Cooper was active in many extracurricular activities at Yale, including the Sophomore German Committee, the Junior Promenade Committee, the Student Council, the Class Day Committee, the Southern Club, the University Club, and Beta Theta Pi. A member of the Undergraduate Athletic Association, he played football and basketball, becoming the first person in Yale history to be named captain of the basketball team in his junior and senior years. In his senior year, he was accepted into the elite Skull and Bones society but regretted not being accepted into Phi Beta Kappa. Upon graduation, he was voted most popular <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to succeed in his class.|$|E
5|$|By 20:00 {{that evening}} {{a large number}} of South Koreans were {{retreating}} in disarray through a gap in the line held by the brigade, the majority of them moving through the Australians. The South Korean 6th Division later regrouped in positions behind 27th Brigade, but was now reduced to less than half its original strength. Meanwhile, as the 20th Army veered to the west as part of the Chinese main effort against Seoul, the Chinese 118th Division continued its secondary advance down the Kapyong Valley, closely pursuing the retreating South Koreans. Racing down the northeast running valley, the 354th Regiment reached the Australian positions by about 22:00. Intent on capturing the important crossroads of Route 17 south of Kapyong, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> unaware of the location of the Australian blocking position, the Chinese vanguard remained in the low ground, splitting as they approached a long, low north-south running ridge that rose like an island in the mouth of the valley.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the three}} lifeboats, the James Caird was deemed the strongest <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> {{to survive the}} journey. Shackleton had named it after Sir James Key Caird, a Dundee jute-manufacturer and philanthropist, whose {{sponsorship}} had helped finance the expedition. Before its voyage, the ship's carpenter Harry McNish strengthened and adapted the boat to withstand the mighty seas of the Southern Ocean. Surviving a series of dangers, including a near capsizing, the boat reached the southern coast of South Georgia after a voyage lasting 16days. Shackleton and two companions then crossed the island's mountainous interior to reach a whaling station on the northern side. Here he organised the relief of the Elephant Island party, {{and the return of}} his men home without loss of life. After the end of the First World War in 1918, the James Caird was brought back from South Georgia to England in 1919 and put on permanent display at Shackleton's old school, Dulwich College from 1922.|$|E

5|$|On 25 February 2012, in a {{match against}} Wigan Athletic, Bent landed awkwardly on his ankle after {{tangling}} with Antolín Alcaraz. He was stretchered off the pitch {{with what was}} thought to be a serious injury. This was later confirmed two days later, after Bent had a scan on his ankle that revealed he had ruptured ligaments. He was out for three months which effectively ended his season with Villa <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> his chance to play at UEFA Euro 2012. Bent had recovered from his injury by mid-May and was in contention for Villa's final match of 2011–12 against Norwich City but was ultimately left out. This also gave him the possibility of making new England manager Roy Hodgson's Euro 2012 England squad. Bent vowed to prove his fitness to Hodgson, in the hope he would be selected to play in the tournament. Bent once again finished as Villa's top scorer with 10 goals in 25 appearances and vowed to stay on at the club.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Great Moravia made {{room for}} the {{expansion}} of the Czech or Bohemian state, which likewise incorporated some of the Polish lands. The founder of the Přemyslid dynasty, Prince Bořivoj, was baptized by Methodius in the Slavic rite during the later part of the 9th century and settled in Prague. His son and successor Spytihněv was baptized in Regensburg in the Latin rite, which marks the early stage of East Frankish/German influence in Bohemian affairs, which was destined to be decisive. Borivoj's grandson Prince Wenceslaus, the future Czech martyr and patron saint, was killed, probably in 935, by his brother Boleslaus. Boleslaus I solidified the power of the Prague princes <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> dominated the Vistulan and Lendian tribes of Lesser Poland and at least parts of Silesia.|$|E
5|$|Zigrasimecia {{is known}} for its unusual morphology, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> had habits no longer seen in extant species. It has a highly movable head that {{suggests}} mobility was an important factor for them (this is probably for feeding behavior). The morphology of the mandibles would have prevented nest excavation, so the rugose projections on the head may have provided assistance. There is no evidence that Cretaceous ants exhibited nesting behavior, although the queen caste in Z. tonsora suggests that a dealate queen was needed for creating nests. Also, Zigrasimecia and Gerontoformica ants coexisted with each other; this is evident as a recovered piece of amber showed both genera trapped inside. This means that the two ants may have shared some of their ecological niches and possibly interacted with each other through fighting.|$|E

5|$|Both Björn Kurtén and Camille Arambourg {{promoted}} an Asiatic origin for the species; Kurtén focussed {{his arguments}} on the Plio-Pleistocene taxon Crocuta sivalensis from the Siwaliks, a view defended by Arambourg, who nonetheless allowed {{the possibility of}} an Indo-Ethiopian origin. This stance was contested by Ficarelli and Torre, who referred to evidence of the spotted hyena's presence from African deposists dating from the early Pleistocene, a similar age to the Asian C. sivalensis. Studies on the phylogeographic distribution of mtDNA haplotypes indicates three migration events from Africa to Eurasia, though neither the topology of the phylogenetic tree or the fossil record exclude {{the possibility of an}} Asian origin. The earliest migration of spotted hyenas from Africa to Eurasia began less than 3.5 million years ago, most probably from the area where the first spotted hyena fossils were discovered, reaching East Asia <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> also Pakistan. The second migration of spotted hyenas occurred less than 1.3–1.5 million years ago and resulted in the first arrival of hyenas in Europe and a separation of African spotted hyenas into a southern and a northern population. The third spotted hyena migration took place 0.36 million years ago, starting from the northern African population and reaching both Europe and Asia. Unlike other African carnivores, {{with the exception of the}} leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that spotted hyenas underwent a genetic bottleneck during the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Rainilaiarivony's first royal wife, Queen Rasoherina, died on 1 April 1868, and was {{succeeded by}} her cousin RanavalonaII (crowned on 3 September 1868) who, like Rasoherina, was a widow of RadamaII. RanavalonaII was a pupil of Protestant missionaries and had {{converted}} to Christianity. Rainilaiarivony recognized the growing power of Christianity {{on the island}} and identified the need to bring it under his influence in order to avert destabilizing cultural and political power struggles. The Prime Minister encouraged the new queen to Christianize the court through a public baptism ceremony at Andohalo on 21 February 1869, the day of their marriage. In this ceremony the supernatural royal talismans were ordered to be destroyed and replaced by the Bible. The Christianization of the court and the establishment of the independent royal Protestant chapel on the palace grounds prompted the wide-scale conversion {{of hundreds of thousands of}} Malagasy. These conversions were commonly motivated by a desire to express political allegiance to the Crown, and as such were largely nominal, with the majority of converts practicing a syncretic blend of Christian and traditional religions. Rainilaiarivony's biographers conclude that the Prime Minister's own conversion was also largely a political gesture <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> did not denote a genuine spiritual shift until late in his life, if ever. Some local officials attempted to force conversions to Protestantism by mandating church attendance and persecuting Catholics, but Rainilaiarivony quickly responded to quell these overzealous practices. The Prime Minister's criminalization of polygamy and alcohol consumption, as well as the declaration of Sunday as a day of rest, were likewise inspired by the growing British and Protestant influences in the country. The Christianization of the court came at a steep personal price: with the outlawing of polygamy, Rainilaiarivony was forced to repudiate his first wife. The Prime Minister was deeply saddened by this necessity and by the consequent souring of his relationships with Rasoanalina and their children after the divorce.|$|E
