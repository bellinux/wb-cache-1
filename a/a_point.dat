5|$|Graphically {{bounding}} {{the production}} set for fixed input quantities, the PPF curve shows the {{maximum possible production}} level of one commodity for any given production level of the other, given the existing state of technology. By doing so, it defines productive efficiency {{in the context of}} that production set: <b>a</b> <b>point</b> on the frontier indicates efficient use of the available inputs (such as points B, D and C in the graph), <b>a</b> <b>point</b> beneath the curve (such as A) indicates inefficiency, and <b>a</b> <b>point</b> beyond the curve (such as X) indicates impossibility.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{are also}} applied {{in many other}} {{mathematical}} areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying {{the properties of the}} corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups. For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus <b>a</b> <b>point.</b> The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to <b>a</b> <b>point.</b> The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to <b>a</b> <b>point.</b> The fundamental group of the plane with <b>a</b> <b>point</b> deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.|$|E

5|$|Viète {{began by}} solving the PPP case (three points) {{following}} {{the method of}} Euclid in his Elements. From this, he derived a lemma corresponding {{to the power of}} <b>a</b> <b>point</b> theorem, which he used to solve the LPP case (a line and two points). Following Euclid a second time, Viète solved the LLL case (three lines) using the angle bisectors. He then derived a lemma for constructing the line perpendicular to an angle bisector that passes through <b>a</b> <b>point,</b> which he used to solve the LLP problem (two lines and <b>a</b> <b>point).</b> This accounts for the first four cases of Apollonius' problem, those that do not involve circles.|$|E
5|$|Viète {{used this}} {{approach}} to shrink one of the given circles to <b>a</b> <b>point,</b> thus reducing the problem to a simpler, already solved case. He first solved the CLL case (a circle and two lines) by shrinking the circle into <b>a</b> <b>point,</b> rendering it a LLP case. He then solved the CLP case (a circle, a line and <b>a</b> <b>point)</b> using three lemmas. Again shrinking one circle to <b>a</b> <b>point,</b> Viète transformed the CCL case into a CLP case. He then solved the CPP case (a circle and two points) and the CCP case (two circles and <b>a</b> <b>point),</b> the latter case by two lemmas. Finally, Viète solved the general CCC case (three circles) by shrinking one circle to <b>a</b> <b>point,</b> rendering it a CCP case.|$|E
