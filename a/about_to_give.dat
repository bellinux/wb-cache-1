5|$|The {{case was}} argued {{before the court}} on March 28, 2006. Katyal argued on behalf of Hamdan, and Paul Clement, the Solicitor General of the United States, argued {{on behalf of the}} government. Chief Justice Roberts recused himself because he had {{previously}} ruled on this case as part of the three judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Critics called for Justice Antonin Scalia to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing oral arguments ("I'm not <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy") but he chose not to do so.|$|E
5|$|Complex taboos and rites are {{associated}} with a woman's first childbirth. When <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth she is secluded in a special birthing house called a komby. The leaves she eats from and the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle for seven days, at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead and cheeks of the mother and baby and must be worn for seven days. On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink rum and celebrate with wrestling matches, but the mother must stay in the komby. She is not allowed to consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he {{hits his}} foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis was to use serious games as a tool <b>to</b> teach <b>about</b> {{obligation}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> notice. Obligation <b>to</b> <b>give</b> notice means that certain professionals need to report to social services {{if a child is}} being harmed. This thesis studied if case-based storytelling could bring a relevant teaching experience, if storytelling could help participants learn <b>about</b> obligation <b>to</b> <b>give</b> notice and how instant and delayed feedback affect the learning. Participants played a story-based game with either instant or delayed feedback and answered three questionnaires <b>about</b> obligation <b>to</b> <b>give</b> notice. The study found that participants did find that the storytelling was useful for learning and gaining more knowledge <b>about</b> <b>about</b> obligation <b>to</b> <b>give</b> notice. For the feedback it was found that both types of feedback made the participants learn significantly more but {{there was no significant difference}} when comparing the feedbacks to each other...|$|R

5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He picks up the phone with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E
5|$|The episode's story {{focuses on}} married couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). In late 2004, on the island, they debate whether to defect to the rival faction of {{survivors}} led by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn). Intercut throughout the episode, {{a series of}} off-island scenes show Sun <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth and Jin experiencing a series of difficulties {{in his efforts to}} reach the hospital with a gift of a stuffed panda. The ending shows that Jin's and Sun's scenes do not focus on the same birth; Jin's scenes are flashbacks to events before the plane crash, while Sun's are flashforwards to sometime after she escapes the island. A subplot follows Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) on board the Kahana, where they learn more about the freighter's mission and find somebody they once knew.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{begins a}} {{relationship}} with Riley Costello (Rob Norbury). Riley's father, Carl (Paul Opacic), takes an instant disliking to Mercedes. This causes tension between Mercedes and Carl and they have sex. Carl and Mercedes begin an affair and Riley later proposes to Mercedes, which she accepts. Carl's son and Riley's brother, Seth (Miles Higson), discovers the affair and threatens to tell Riley. Mercedes tells Seth that he cannot reveal the affair because she is pregnant with Riley's child. She later tells Myra that she lied and is not pregnant. Myra tells Mercedes to fake a miscarriage, which she refuses to do. Mercedes attends an awards ceremony with Riley, where he becomes intoxicated. He accepts an award and attempts to get Mercedes onto the podium, but her high heel becomes trapped in the step. As Riley pulls her, she loses her balance and falls to the ground. Myra then declares that Mercedes is having a miscarriage. Mercedes is taken to hospital, where she is told that she is in fact twelve weeks pregnant. She explains to Myra that she is unsure of the child's paternity. On her wedding day to Riley, she reveals her affair with Carl. Riley's grandfather, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle), who is a serial killer, kidnaps Mercedes {{as a result of}} her behaviour and holds her captive in a basement, planning to kill her when the baby is born. While Mercedes is in the basement, Silas is arrested for four murders, leaving Mercedes trapped while she goes into labour. Lynsey asks Silas to tell them where Mercedes is, but he refuses. She taunts him until eventually he reveals her whereabouts. Riley finds Mercedes, who is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth. Mercedes gives birth to a baby boy, who is put in an incubator because of breathing difficulties. Mercedes is hurt when, after the birth, Riley declares he wants nothing more to do with Mercedes or the baby. However, he later continues to visit Mercedes and the baby who Mercedes names Bobby. Mercedes returns to live with the McQueens and after Riley refuses to see Bobby, Mercedes agrees to do a paternity test. The results confirm that Riley is Bobby's biological father. Mercedes and Riley argue over Bobby until Riley is transferred to a football club in Leeds and Mercedes asks him to take Bobby with him.|$|E

25|$|However, Toronto was not <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up on Bargnani yet and {{committed}} the entire summer coaching {{him to become}} a more effective interior player, forcing him to drive to the basket more and settle less for jump shots. The arrival of six-time NBA All-Star Jermaine O'Neal also meant that Bargnani was likely to come off the bench in most games, with Bosh and O'Neal forming the starting frontcourt. During the summer he worked hard on his body, putting up some more weight (adding some 15 pounds of muscle); this work showed his effects in the first games of the regular campaign, when the Italian was more willing to rebound in traffic and drive to the basket. He also seemed to rediscover his shooting stroke, had better shot selection and became a consistent shot-blocker, and he was soon moved to the starting line-up as small forward.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} antique Testament of Solomon, Abyzou (as Obizuth) is {{described}} as having a âgreenish gleaming face with dishevelled serpent-like hairâ; {{the rest of her}} body is covered by darkness. The speaker (âKing Solomonâ) encounters a series of demons, binds and tortures each in turn, and inquires into their activities; then he metes out punishment or controls them as he sees fit. Put to the test, Abyzou says that she does not sleep, but rather wanders the world looking for women <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth; given the opportunity, she will strangle newborns. She claims also to be the source of many other afflictions, including deafness, eye trouble, obstructions of the throat, madness, and bodily pain. Solomon orders that she be chained by her own hair and hung {{up in front of the}} Temple in public view. The writer of the Testament appears to have been thinking of the gorgoneion, or the icon of the Medusaâs head, which often adorned Greek temples and occasionally Jewish synagogues in late antiquity.|$|E
