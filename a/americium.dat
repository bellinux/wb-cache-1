5|$|<b>Americium</b> is an {{artificial}} element of recent origin, and thus {{does not have}} a biological requirement. It is harmful to life. It has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of <b>americium</b> and other heavy metals from rivers and streams. Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus Citrobacter precipitate <b>americium</b> ions from aqueous solutions, binding them into a metal-phosphate complex at their cell walls. Several studies have been reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of <b>americium</b> by bacteria and fungi.|$|E
5|$|<b>Americium</b> is {{produced}} mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 100grams of various <b>americium</b> isotopes, mostly 241Am and 243Am. Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore <b>americium,</b> together with other long-lived actinides, must be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where <b>americium</b> is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, {{but it is still}} being developed for <b>americium.</b> The transuranic elements from <b>americium</b> to fermium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|Another known form {{of solid}} {{tetravalent}} <b>americium</b> chloride is KAmF5. Tetravalent <b>americium</b> {{has also been}} observed in the aqueous phase. For this purpose, black Am(OH)4 was dissolved in 15-M NH3F with the <b>americium</b> concentration of 0.01 M. The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum {{which is similar to}} that of AmF4 but differed from other oxidation states of <b>americium.</b> Heating the Am(IV) solution to 90°C did not result in its disproportionation or reduction, however a slow reduction was observed to Am(III) and assigned to self-irradiation of <b>americium</b> by alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{chemical}} {{diversity among}} actinides is observed in <b>americium,</b> which can have valence between 2 and 6. Divalent <b>americium</b> is obtained only in dry compounds and non-aqueous solutions (acetonitrile). Oxidation states +3, +5 and +6 are typical for aqueous solutions, {{but also in}} the solid state. Tetravalent <b>americium</b> forms stable solid compounds (dioxide, fluoride and hydroxide) as well as complexes in aqueous solutions. It was reported that in alkaline solution <b>americium</b> can be oxidized to the heptavalent state, but these data proved erroneous. The most stable valence of <b>americium</b> is 3 in the aqueous solutions and 3 or 4 in solid compounds.|$|E
5|$|The longest-lived {{and most}} common {{isotopes}} of <b>americium,</b> 241Am and 243Am, have half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370 years, respectively. Therefore, any primordial <b>americium</b> (<b>americium</b> that was present on Earth during its formation) should have decayed by now.|$|E
5|$|<b>Americium</b> readily {{reacts with}} oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common {{oxidation}} state for <b>americium</b> is +3, in which <b>americium</b> compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, <b>americium</b> is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent <b>americium</b> forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation {{states have been}} observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am4+ (yellow-reddish), AmV; (yellow), AmVI (brown) and AmVII (dark green). All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm.|$|E
5|$|In other regions, {{the average}} {{radioactivity}} of surface soil due to residual <b>americium</b> {{is only about}} 0.01picocuries/g (0.37mBq/g). Atmospheric <b>americium</b> compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 1,900 times higher concentration of <b>americium</b> inside sandy soil particles than in the water present in the soil pores; an even higher ratio was measured in loam soils.|$|E
5|$|The known {{chalcogenides}} of <b>americium</b> {{include the}} sulfide AmS2, selenides AmSe2 and Am3Se4, and tellurides Am2Te3 and AmTe2. The pnictides of <b>americium</b> (243Am) of the AmX type {{are known for}} the elements phosphorus, arsenic, antimony and bismuth. They crystallize in the rock-salt lattice.|$|E
5|$|<b>Americium</b> is {{paramagnetic}} {{in a wide}} temperature range, {{from that}} of liquid helium, to room temperature and above. This behavior is markedly {{different from that of}} its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. The thermal expansion coefficient of <b>americium</b> is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2)/°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2± 0.4)/°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of <b>americium</b> metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Am3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Am3+/Am0 is −2.08 ± 0.01V.|$|E
5|$|<b>Americium</b> often enters {{landfills}} from discarded smoke detectors. The rules {{associated with}} the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the <b>americium</b> from about 100 smoke detectors {{in an attempt to}} build a breeder nuclear reactor. There have been a few cases of exposure to <b>americium,</b> the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 {{as a result of an}} explosion in his lab. McCluskey died at the age of 75 of unrelated pre-existing disease.|$|E
5|$|As {{a highly}} {{radioactive}} element, <b>americium</b> {{and its compounds}} must be handled only in an appropriate laboratory under special arrangements. Although most <b>americium</b> isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials, many of the daughter products emit gamma-rays and neutrons which have a long penetration depth.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, <b>americium</b> is located {{to the right}} of plutonium, to the left of curium, and below the lanthanide europium, with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. <b>Americium</b> is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12g/cm3, <b>americium</b> is less dense than both curium (13.52g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8g/cm3); but has a higher density than europium (5.264g/cm3)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. <b>Americium</b> is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. Its melting point of 1173°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639°C) and europium (826°C), but lower than for curium (1340°C).|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>americium</b> and curium in 1944 was {{closely related to}} the Manhattan Project; the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children Quiz Kids five days before the official presentation at an American Chemical Society meeting on 11 November 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war. After the {{discovery of}} <b>americium</b> isotopes 241Am and 242Am, their production and compounds were patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor. The initial <b>americium</b> samples weighed a few micrograms; they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity. The first substantial amounts of metallic <b>americium</b> weighing 40–200 micrograms were not prepared until 1951 by reduction of americium(III) fluoride with barium metal in high vacuum at 1100°C.|$|E
5|$|The redox {{potential}} \mathit E_\frac{M^4+}{AnO2^2+} increases from −0.32 V in uranium, through 0.34 V (Np) and 1.04 V (Pu) to 1.34 V in <b>americium</b> revealing the increasing reduction {{ability of the}} An4+ ion from <b>americium</b> to uranium. All actinides form AnH3 hydrides of black color with salt-like properties. Actinides also produce carbides with the general formula of AnC or AnC2 (U2C3 for uranium) as well as sulfides An2S3 and AnS2.|$|E
5|$|About 19 {{isotopes}} and 8 {{nuclear isomers}} {{are known for}} <b>americium.</b> There are two long-lived alpha-emitters, 241Am and 243Am with half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370years, respectively, and the nuclear isomer 242m1Am has a long half-life of 141years. The half-lives of other isotopes and isomers range from 0.64microseconds for 245m1Am to 50.8hours for 240Am. As with most other actinides, the isotopes of <b>americium</b> with odd number of neutrons have relatively high rate of nuclear fission and low critical mass.|$|E
5|$|<b>Americium</b> {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1944 {{by the group}} of Glenn T. Seaborg from Berkeley, California, at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, {{a part of the}} Manhattan Project. Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most <b>americium</b> is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100grams of <b>americium.</b> It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors, as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope 242mAm, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer.|$|E
5|$|As 241Am has {{a roughly}} similar {{half-life}} to 238Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), {{it has been}} proposed as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators, for example in spacecraft. Although <b>americium</b> produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7mW/g for 241Am and 6.31mW/g for 243Am (cf. 390mW/g for 238Pu) – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, the European Space Agency is considering using <b>americium</b> for its space probes.|$|E
5|$|Halides of <b>americium</b> {{are known}} for the {{oxidation}} states +2, +3 and +4, where the +3 is most stable, especially in solutions.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, B. B. Cunningham {{obtained}} the first bulk chemical compound of a transplutonium element, namely <b>americium</b> hydroxide. Over {{the next three}} to four years, milligram quantities of <b>americium</b> and microgram amounts of curium were accumulated that allowed production of isotopes of berkelium (Thomson, 1949) and californium (Thomson, 1950). Sizeable amounts of these elements were produced only in 1958 (Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thomson), and the first californium compound (0.3µg of CfOCl) was obtained only in 1960 by B. B. Cunningham and J. C. Wallmann.|$|E
5|$|Most americium(III) halides form {{hexagonal}} crystals with slight {{variation of}} the color and exact structure between the halogens. So, chloride (AmCl3) is reddish and has a structure isotypic to uranium(III) chloride (space group P63/m) and the melting point of 715°C. The fluoride is isotypic to LaF3 (space group P63/mmc) and the iodide to BiI3 (space group R). The bromide is an exception with the orthorhombic PuBr3-type structure and space group Cmcm. Crystals of <b>americium</b> hexahydrate (AmCl3·6H2O) can be prepared by dissolving <b>americium</b> dioxide in hydrochloric acid and evaporating the liquid. Those crystals are hygroscopic and have yellow-reddish color and a monoclinic crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{isotopes}} of <b>americium</b> {{are known}} with mass numbers from 232 to 248. The most important are 241Am and 243Am, which are alpha-emitters and also emit soft, but intense γ-rays; {{both of them}} can be obtained in an isotopically pure form. Chemical properties of <b>americium</b> were first studied with 241Am, but later shifted to 243Am, which is almost 20 times less radioactive. The disadvantage of 243Am is production of the short-lived daughter isotope 239Np, which has to be considered in the data analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} <b>americium</b> {{in a typical}} new smoke {{detector}} is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the <b>americium</b> decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the <b>americium</b> in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E
5|$|The {{transuranic}} elements from <b>americium</b> to fermium, including berkelium, occurred naturally {{in the natural}} nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|Three <b>americium</b> oxides are known, {{with the}} {{oxidation}} states +2 (AmO), +3 (Am2O3) and +4 (AmO2). Americium(II) oxide was prepared in minute amounts {{and has not}} been characterized in details. Americium(III) oxide is a red-brown solid with a melting point of 2205°C. Americium(IV) oxide is the main form of solid <b>americium</b> which is used in nearly all its applications. As most other actinide dioxides, it is a black solid with a cubic (fluorite) crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Americium</b> is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Am and atomic number 95. It is a transuranic {{member of the}} actinide series, in the periodic table located under the lanthanide element europium, and thus by analogy was named after the Americas.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is intrinsic to <b>americium.</b> It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of <b>americium</b> {{and some of its}} properties, such as electrical resistivity. So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for <b>americium</b> is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.|$|E
5|$|At ambient conditions, <b>americium</b> {{is present}} in its most stable α form which has a {{hexagonal}} crystal symmetry, and a space group P63/mmc with lattice parameters a= 346.8pm and c= 1124pm, and four atoms per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium. The crystal structure of <b>americium</b> changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry, space group Fmm and lattice constant a= 489pm. This fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. Upon further compression to 23 GPa, <b>americium</b> transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa. There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770°C it changes into an fcc phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075°C it converts to a body-centered cubic structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of <b>americium</b> is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium.|$|E
5|$|Curium was {{chemically}} identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now Argonne National Laboratory) at the University of Chicago. It was {{the third}} transuranium element to be discovered {{even though it is}} the fourth in the series – the lighter element <b>americium</b> was unknown at the time.|$|E
5|$|Formation of the {{complexes}} of {{the type}} Am(n-C3H7-BTP)3, where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C3H7-BTP and Am3+ ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with <b>americium</b> and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a Hanford {{technician}} named Harold McCluskey {{received the}} largest recorded dose of <b>americium</b> following a laboratory accident. Due to prompt medical intervention, he survived the incident and died eleven years later of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{experiments}} yielded four <b>americium</b> isotopes: 241Am, 242Am, 239Am and 238Am. Americium-241 {{was directly}} obtained from plutonium upon absorption of two neutrons. It decays by emission of a α-particle to 237Np; the half-life of this decay was first determined as 510 ± 20 years but then corrected to 432.2 years.|$|E
5|$|Metallic <b>americium</b> is {{obtained}} by reduction from its compounds. Americium(III) fluoride {{was first used}} for this purpose. The reaction was conducted using elemental barium as reducing agent in a water- and oxygen-free environment inside an apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar <b>americium</b> can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both <b>americium</b> and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas <b>americium</b> oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, {{neptunium}} and <b>americium</b> form {{two basic}} oxides: An2O3 and AnO2. Neptunium trioxide is unstable; thus, only Np3O8 {{could be obtained}} so far. However, the oxides of plutonium and neptunium with the chemical formula AnO2 and An2O3 are well characterized.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged {{irradiation}} of <b>americium,</b> curium, and plutonium with neutrons produces milligram {{amounts of}} californium-252 and microgram amounts of californium-249. As of 2006, curium isotopes 244 to 248 are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium-252 with lesser amounts of isotopes 249 to 255.|$|E
5|$|All {{actinides}} are radioactive {{and release}} energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and synthetically produced plutonium {{are the most}} abundant actinides on Earth. These are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and <b>americium</b> {{is used in the}} ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors.|$|E
