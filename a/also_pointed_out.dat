5|$|In 1910 Theodore Roosevelt {{visited the}} province. Before his arrival, Governor R.C.R. Owen {{informed}} Governor General Sir Reginald Wingate {{that everything would}} be done for {{the former president of}} the United States, but <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that his troops had not even one donkey.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well received by music critics for being musically diverse. One critic <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that it resembled some of McLaughlin's {{work that he}} released in the 1970s. Commercially, the album fared well on two jazz music Billboard charts, peaking at numbers 9 and 14 on the Top Jazz Albums and Jazz Albums charts, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{general idea}} for Sycorax's {{character}} {{may have come}} from the classical literature familiar to many in Shakespeare's day. Sycorax is similar to Medea, a witch in Ovid's Metamorphoses, in that both are powerful, magical female figures. Scholars have <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that Sycorax resembles the magical Circe from Greek mythology as well as perhaps a version of Circe found in the mythology of the Coraxi tribe in modern-day Georgia.|$|E

5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|Critics <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{that the}} index could allow {{the city to}} reach lethally high levels of carbon {{monoxide}} without any alert if the levels of other pollutants remained low. However, the department {{had to contend with}} the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at that time, and many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative. During the 1966 smog, one of the former commissioners said he would have readily adopted a better system, if one existed.|$|E
5|$|Obligatory {{psychological}} {{testing for}} gun owners {{is a common}} subject of discussion, but {{it has always been}} rejected. Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.|$|E

5|$|On May 27, 2004, a {{judge ruled}} {{that the police had}} {{reasonable}} justification to raid Goliath's. Defense lawyers countered that none of the anonymous information the police acted uponfor example that live sex shows were being staged and drugs sold on the premisesfeatured in the charges made against the seventeen men. They <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the police failed to call in the force's gay community liaison officer. Goliath's reopened {{a little more than a}} month after the raid.|$|E
5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Horner <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the tyrannosaur lineage {{had a history of}} steadily improving binocular vision. It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators.|$|E
5|$|The dodos on this islet may not {{necessarily}} {{have been the last}} members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715. The authors <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed out of hand.|$|E

5|$|British {{palaeontologist}} David Bruce Norman has stressed how remarkable {{it is that}} Owen, {{who previously}} had propounded that dinosaurs were active quadrupedal animals, largely neglected Scelidosaurus though it {{could serve as a}} prime example of this hypothesis and its fossil {{was one of the most}} complete dinosaurs found at that time. Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study of a large number of even more interesting newly discovered extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx. Norman <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Croatian {{historian}} Davor Marijan {{concluded that}} the battle was too complex for the HV and especially for the HVO. He <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the HV and HVO suffered from ineffective command structures and poor intelligence, noting that they had failed to detect {{the presence of the}} VRS 16th Motorised and the 1st Armoured Brigades early on. Marijan also claims the HV had demobilised ten infantry brigades shortly before the battle, and his view is supported by Colonel General Novica Simić, commander of the VRS 16th Motorised Brigade, assigned to Tactical Group 1, which had been established by the 1st Krajina Corps to carry out the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the experiment in American Medicine, physician Augustus P. Clarke criticized the experiment's validity. Clarke noted {{that at the time of}} death there is a sudden rise in body temperature as the lungs are no longer cooling blood, causing a subsequent rise in sweating which could easily account for MacDougall’s missing 21 grams. Clarke <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that, as dogs do not have sweat glands, they would not lose weight in this manner after death. Clarke's criticism was published in the May issue of American Medicine. Arguments between MacDougall and Clarke debating the validity of the experiment continued to be published in the journal until at least December that year.|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} criterion {{is widely}} used in measuring the level of naturalness, although it fails for some examples. We discuss the mathematics behind the fine-tuning problems, <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the widely adopted sensitivity criterion of naturalness can not reflect the level of naturalness correctly. We <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the dimensional effect {{is the main reason}} why the sensitivity criterion fails. To solve these problems, we proposed a new criterion to replace the sensitivity criterion, and <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the physical meaning of the fine-tuning level...|$|R
5|$|In 2012, Leo Joseph {{and colleagues}} {{acknowledged}} the finding but {{pointed out that}} the sample might have been damaged and that further testing was needed before the issue could be fully resolved. They also noted that if Mascarinus was confirmed to be embedded within the Coracopsis genus, the latter would become a junior synonym, since the former name is older. In 2012, Hume expressed surprise at these findings due to the anatomical similarities between the Mascarene parrot and other parrots from the Mascarene islands that are believed to be psittaculines. He <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that there is no fossil evidence found on other islands to support the hypothesis that the species evolved elsewhere before reaching Réunion.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that {{four sets of}} European human remains found could possibly be women. He initially suspected that DNA testing would not offer up anything more, but to his surprise they registered {{that there was no}} 'Y' chromosomal element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that {{it could be that the}} DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could not rule it out completely.|$|E
5|$|In another study, Gregory S. Paul {{pointed out}} that the flexed kneed and digitigrade adult Tyrannosaurus were much better adapted for running than {{elephants}} or humans, pointing out that Tyrannosaurus had a large ilium bone and cnemial crest that would have supported large muscles needed for running. He also mentioned that Alexander's (1989) formula to calculate speed by bone strength was only partly reliable. He suggests that the formula is overly sensitive to bone length; making long bones artificially weak. He <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the lowered risk of being wounded in combat may have been worth the risk of Tyrannosaurus falling while running.|$|E

5|$|On 16 August 2007, {{acting on}} a suo motu notice, the Supreme Court of Pakistan took up the extrajudicial killings {{of the people at}} the Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa complex. Performance of the Islamabad {{administration}} attracted the reprimand of the court for its slow pace. The court was informed that 61 students were in custody, of whom 39 were on bailable offences. The Chief Justice of Pakistan ordered immediate release of 20 people considered innocent, as recommended by a joint investigation team. National Crisis Management Cell Director Javed Iqbal Cheema told the court that 28 DNA tests had not been confirmed. The Chief Justice <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ali had stated that 30 bodies remained unidentified.|$|E
5|$|The latest {{definite}} {{sighting of}} dodos, on Amber Island in 1662, {{may not necessarily}} {{have been the last}} members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715.

5|$|A December 2007 QSR Magazine {{article about}} the {{conflict}} claimed that Burger King Brands had devised a contingency plan to remove itself from the dispute. Citing internal company documents, the Associated Press stated BK had concerns that such agreements might {{prove to be a}} possible violation of anti-trust laws, had possible tax implications, and that there were issues with third-party oversight for the agreements. As part of the company's plan, QSR Magazine claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement. In response, the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming that while it is a large purchaser, it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer. BK <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships (through its Have it Your Way Foundation) for family members of CIW workers.|$|E
