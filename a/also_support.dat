5|$|A new viticultural area {{along the}} Snake River was {{established}} on April 9, 2007. Principally located in Idaho, the area also encompasses two large counties in Eastern Oregon, Baker County and Malheur County. The region's climate is unique among AVAs in Oregon; the average temperature is relatively cool and rainfall is low, creating a shorter growing season. Current production {{is led by}} hardy grapes such as Riesling, Gewürztraminer, and Chardonnay. The climate also lends itself extremely well {{to the production of}} ice wine. However, the AVA is quite large and warmer microclimates within the area can <b>also</b> <b>support</b> different types of grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.|$|E

Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a Pelton turbine.

5|$|In some rhythm games, {{the screen}} {{displays}} an avatar who performs {{in reaction to}} the player's controller inputs. However, these graphical responses are usually in the background, and the avatar is more important to spectators than it is to the player. In single-player modes, the player's avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality input devices. These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads. However, most rhythm games <b>also</b> <b>support</b> more conventional input devices, such as control pads.|$|E

5|$|Within the Florida {{mangrove}} systems live 220species of fish, and {{a variety}} of crabs, crayfish, shrimp, mollusks, and other invertebrates, which serve as the main source of food for many birds. Dozens of bird species use mangroves as nurseries and food stores, including pelicans, grebes, tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor), gulls, terns, hawks and kites, and arboreal birds like mangrove cuckoos (Coccyzus minor), yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia), and white-crowned pigeons (Patagioenas leucocephala). The mangroves <b>also</b> <b>support</b> 24species of amphibians and reptiles, and 18species of mammals, including the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).|$|E
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on June 8, 2015, at Apple's WWDC that the iPad 2 would support iOS 9. This makes the iPad 2 the first iPad and only iOS device to support six major versions of iOS. As with previous releases, though, many headline features are unavailable on the iPad 2, including predictive Siri, translucency effects, split-view, slide-over and picture-in-picture multitasking, Low Power Mode and the Health app. iOS 9 {{is said to}} feature performance improvements that may help the aging device function more smoothly, and initial tests suggest {{that it did not}} significantly impact available space.

5|$|Meanwhile, in 1999, Sharon Jansa {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a molecular phylogenetic {{study of the}} Nesomyinae, the native Malagasy rodents, using the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b. Their results suggested that the current definitions of Eliurus and Voalavo may not be correct, because they found that northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the remaining species of Eliurus. However, the DNA of Petter's tufted-tailed rat, a possible close relative of northern voalavo, could not be sampled, so Jansa and colleagues recommended further evaluation of the problem. According to a 2003 report, data from nuclear genes <b>also</b> <b>support</b> the relationship between northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, but Petter's tufted-tailed rat remains genetically unstudied and the taxonomic issue has not been resolved.|$|E
5|$|The Australian air {{units were}} {{under the command of}} the RAF, which had 306 squadrons located in the UK {{at the time of the}} {{landings}} in Normandy. Two RAAF squadrons were assigned to the Second Tactical Air Force (2TAF), which was to provide direct support to the Allied armies during the campaign; No.453 Squadron operated Spitfire fighters as part of No.125 Wing and No.464 Squadron flew Mosquito light bombers as part of No.140 Wing. Four Australian heavy bomber squadrons formed part of RAF Bomber Command; No.460, No.463 and No.467 Squadrons were equipped with Lancasters and No.466 Squadron flew Halifaxes. No.456 Squadron, which was a specialist night fighter unit equipped with Mosquitos, formed part of Air Defence of Great Britain and was assigned to protect the invasion force. Three other RAAF squadrons in the UK would <b>also</b> <b>support</b> operations in Normandy as part of Coastal Command; No.10 and No.461 Squadrons were equipped with Sunderland flying boats and flew patrols of the waters around the UK and France, while No.455 Squadron operated against German surface shipping using Beaufighter strike aircraft.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{stakeholders}} {{in many countries}} such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would <b>also</b> <b>support</b> an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency. When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards, they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about {{the pros and cons}} of rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor’s decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting.|$|E
