5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam, {{known in}} Japan <b>as</b> , , <b>and</b> , are three Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon {{franchise}} that are linked through evolution. Abra evolves into Kadabra after gaining enough experience in battle, and Kadabra evolves into Alakazam after being traded to another trainer. Created by Ken Sugimori, they {{first appeared in}} the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and later appear in subsequent sequels. They have appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Known as the Psi Pokémon, using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its abilities unless rested. This behavior ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. Able to remember everything since its birth, Alakazam's IQ is around 5000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Alakazam {{is also one of the}} handful of Pokémon to be capable of undergoing Mega Evolution, which increases its strength and makes it appearance undergo a few noticeable changes.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry {{in which}} predators, parasites or parasitoids share similar signals, using a {{harmless}} model, allowing them to avoid being correctly identified by their prey or host. In its broadest sense, it could include various types of exploitation, as when an orchid exploits a male insect by mimicking a sexually receptive female (see pseudocopulation), but will here be restricted to forms of exploitation involving feeding. An alternative term Peckhamian mimicry (after George and Elizabeth Peckham) has been suggested, but is seldom used. The metaphor of a wolf in sheep's clothing can be used as an analogy, but with the caveat that mimics are not intentionally deceiving their prey. For example, indigenous Australians who dress up <b>as</b> <b>and</b> imitate kangaroos when hunting would not be considered aggressive mimics, nor would a human angler. Treated separately is molecular mimicry, which also shares some similarity; for instance a virus may mimic the molecular properties of its host, allowing it access to its cells.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad {{was born}} in 1316 or 1318. His father was Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad {{and his mother was}} Bayad, a singer and a slave girl freed by Emir Bahadur <b>As</b> <b>and</b> {{possibly}} given to an-Nasir Muhammad. At the time of his birth, Ahmad was an-Nasir Muhammad's only son (three other sons had died before Ahmad was born) and the only son of an-Nasir Muhammad born to Bayad. Bayad and an-Nasir Muhammad later divorced and the former married Maliktamur al-Sarjuwani, an emir who became Ahmad's stepfather. As a youth, Ahmad spent frequent bouts of time in the desert fortress of al-Karak under orders from his father. He was first sent there in 1324 under supervision and with a large budget to begin training in horsemanship and hunting. He was sent again in April 1326. Since Ayyubid times, but particularly during an-Nasir Muhammad's reign, al-Karak, which was isolated from the other Mamluk centers, became akin to a private academy for young Mamluk emirs where they could gain and perfect chivalric skills. Thus, Ahmad's residency in al-Karak was intended to imbue in him knightly qualities. While at al-Karak, Ahmad was under the supervision of its governor, Bahadur al-Badri. Nothing about Ahmad in the Mamluk-era sources is known between 1326 and 1331.|$|E

5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known <b>as</b> <b>and</b> its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} new high school built in several years, many unorthodox ideas were suggested. After many of the ideas were criticized the school {{district}} requested parental input on {{the direction of the}} school's curriculum and held meetings around the city to show their plans for the curriculum. School officials wished to create a balance of college prep classes and vocational programs. The school was planned <b>as</b> <b>and</b> is now a citywide magnet school with no attendance boundary. An emphasis on technology was integrated into the plans for the school.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 14, McCabe won a {{scholarship}} to the Catholic St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill in Sydney due to his sporting ability. Run by the Marist Brothers, the large school’s centerpiece stone castle-like building overlooks Sydney Harbour. After {{a month in the}} Second XI, McCabe was promoted to the Senior First XI at 14 as an all-rounder. He did not make a good start, registering a duck in his first innings. However, he impressed observers with his ability to hit the ball precisely. McCabe was always short, and playing against boys three years his senior, he could not rely on brute force. Aside from playing cricket, he was also full-back in the school's championship winning Rugby union team in 1926. During his time at St Joseph’s McCabe grew larger and batted more powerfully, and his exploits were regularly featured in the yearbook. In 1925, he struck his maiden century against Sydney Boys High School and score two more the following year. Such was his power that the backyard fence at the home of a friend had to be reinforcedMcCabe’s powerful square drives had been dislodging it. McCabe did not receive special coaching attention from the school's staff, who merely encouraged him to hit the ball hard and along the ground. In his later years at school, he was selected for Combined Great Public Schools of Sydneya combined team from Sydney's private schoolsfor the state schoolboys' carnival. McCabe studied hard and placed first in the class in each of his three years at St Joseph’s. At the end of 1926, he earned his Intermediate Certificate with five <b>As</b> <b>and</b> two Bs. McCabe then left school and became an accountant’s assistant.|$|E

5|$|Britain {{contributed to}} the Manhattan Project by helping {{initiate}} the effort to build the first atomic bombs in the United States during World War II, and helped carry it through to completion in August 1945 by supplying crucial expertise. Following the discovery of nuclear fission in uranium, scientists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch at the University of Birmingham calculated, in March 1940, that the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235 was as little <b>as</b> , <b>and</b> would explode {{with the power of}} thousands of tons of dynamite. The Frisch–Peierls memorandum prompted Britain to create an atomic bomb project, known as Tube Alloys. Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist working in Britain, was instrumental in making the results of the British MAUD Report known in the United States in 1941 by a visit in person. Initially the British project was larger and more advanced, but after the United States entered the war, the American project soon outstripped and dwarfed its British counterpart. The British government then decided to shelve its own nuclear ambitions, and participate in the American project.|$|E

The new film, La Vallée, featured two travellers on a spiritual quest in New Guinea, and Schroeder thought Pink Floyd would be suitable to provide the music.

5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with <b>AS,</b> <b>and</b> tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
