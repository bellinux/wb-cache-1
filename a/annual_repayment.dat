25|$|Corporate finance {{concerns}} the two money raising options for limited companies. Equity finance involves the traditional method of issuing shares {{to build up}} a company's capital. Shares can contain any rights the company and purchaser wish to contract for, but generally grant the right to participate in dividends after a company earns profits and the right to vote in company affairs. A purchaser of shares is helped to make an informed decision directly by prospectus requirements of full disclosure, and indirectly through restrictions on financial assistance by companies for purchase of their own shares. Debt finance means getting loans, usually {{for the price of a}} fixed <b>annual</b> interest <b>repayment.</b> Sophisticated lenders, such as banks typically contract for a security interest over the assets of a company, so that in the event of default on loan repayments they may seize the company's property directly to satisfy debts. Creditors are also, to some extent, protected by courts' power to set aside unfair transactions before a company goes under, or recoup money from negligent directors engaged in wrongful trading. If a company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, UK insolvency law requires an administrator to attempt a rescue of the company (if the company itself has the assets to pay for this). If rescue proves impossible, a company's life ends when its assets are liquidated, distributed to creditors and the company is struck off the register. If a company becomes insolvent with no assets it can be wound up by a creditor, for a fee (not that common), or more commonly by the tax creditor (HMRC).|$|R
40|$|The Moc Chau State farm has had Holstein-Friesian cows since 1964 and has {{received}} bilateral aid {{from various sources}} since then. The political changes in the 1980 's, as the country moved towards a market economy, resulted in the Government giving less financial support to state farms. The present availability of milk (0. 4 l /capita /year) is extremely low and the Government has plans to increase four-fold the number of cows by the year 2000. The interest and support of UNDP and FAO {{dates back to the}} late 1970 's and culminated in the drafting of the current project. The original document (VIE/ 80 / 013) entitled "Strengthening Milk Production at Moc Chau State Farm" was signed by the 3 parties (Government, FAO and UNDP) in August 1986 and became operational in November 1987. The UNDP contribution (period of 4 years and 5 months) amounted to US$ 1, 625, 532 with an additional bilateral Australian input of US$ 85, 052 or a total of US$ 1, 710, 584. The FAO/UNDP recruited technical staff on both long- term assignments and short-term consultancies to do specialised work. There were two project phases until its completion in late 1992. During the first phase emphasis was on developing sound technical and economically viable systems of milk production and processing. With the subdivision of the state farm into smallholdings for phase two, the primary concern from then on was to establish an upgraded and viable milk production, processing and marketing system based on smallholders dairy farms. More than a year of valuable time (August 1986 -November 1987) elapsed between signing the project document and starting the project. The main outputs of the first phase were the development of a national dairy development programme, the establishment of a pilot training and demonstration centre and the improvement of milk production and processing facilities at the Moc Chau state farm. A lack of animal feed impeded project progress and there was little improvement until 1992 when, as a result of trials by a consultant showing the potential for grasses and legumes, these fodders were grown successfully. Milk production increased also as a result of giving smallholders their own area of land, especially those having more than 20 cows. At the Moc Chau dairy plant milk intake for 1992 was only 6. 3 above that for 1991. However, milk intake until September 1993 showed a 34. 7 increase which is a yardstick of improved smallholder performance and confidence. The MCSF has borrowed Vnd 5, 300 million from two banks and the <b>annual</b> <b>repayments</b> are Vnd 2, 500 or Vnd 2, 000 per litre of milk purchased (US$ 1 = Vnd 10, 500). There was heavy expenditure in buildings and equipment and it is estimated that 40 of the construction costs were unnecessary. All this means that, with the present turnover, the MCSF cannot service its debts in spite of having received Vnd 5, 000 million of free equipment. This is partly caused by the low amount (5, 500 kg/day) of milk being processed, well below its daily capacity of 12, 000 kg. New markets must be sought as smallholders have recently shown their willingness to produce more milk. In view of these historical developments, and by learning from some past mistakes, the Government should give full consideration to the following proposals and recommendations in order that future milk production in Vietnam might approach the planned target levels :-The agreements drawn up between the MCSF and smallholders should not be changed at short notice. Once in the past, cow prices were increased by 250, without prior notice to the producers, with some disastrous consequences. Smallholders should be invited to discuss in advance all planned activities so that they {{will have the opportunity to}} make alternative plans. -The Government gives all its support to the project in the form of credit and, because of this, smallholders who are new to dairying have repayments of 30 or more of what they get for their products. This unnecessary burden should be relieved by the Government giving its entire contribution to the project as a grant. -A rescue package was implemented for a large number of poor smallholders in a difficult financial plight, in the form of assistance with pasture establishment and the receipt of more easily managed crossbred (versus pure Friesian) cattle. To ensure the viability of smallholders in difficult situations, sound policies and financial advice must be part of the package which might also include writing off part or most of the loans. -Since the MCSF was the first state farm to have undergone the transition to private ownership, it could serve as a future model. This can be so provided that, prior to the transition, MCSF management staff are well trained, especially on the financial side. Of most concern should be the viability of smallholders and, secondly, the business side such as feed mill, dairy plant and other business supports. -If the MCSF accepts that certain unpopular decision...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Agric.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. The South African (SA) Sugar Industry is {{committed}} to transformation in land ownership and supports the SA government's target to transfer 30 % of freehold sugarcane land to previously disadvantaged individuals (PDls) by 2014 via the land market under the willing buyer/willing seller principle. The medium-scale farmer scheme for emerging commercial sugarcane farmers, which was introduced in 1996 to help redistribute commercial sugarcane farmland to PDIs {{is an important component}} of the SA Sugar Industry's land reform strategy. The average financial performance of emerging commercial farmers (now called New Freehold Growers or NFGs) in the SA Sugar Industry was below that of large-scale commercial farmers during 1997 - 2007 (real average annual net return per hectare of R 390 versus R 3 075 in 2007 Rand). Given that this trend raises concerns about the long-term viability of NFGs, the first aim of this study is to identify factors that distinguish between successful, less successful and unsuccessful NFGs using a stratified random sample of 96 NFGs in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) surveyed during July-November 2008. These NFGs were classified according to whether their mortgage loans were current (successful), in arrears (less successful) or in the process of legal action (unsuccessful). Student t-tests indicate that successful NFGs, on average, had statistically significantly more experience in farming sugarcane, larger farm sizes (proxied by average annual gross farm income), greater solvency and liquidity, and larger areas annually replanted to sugarcane than the less successful and unsuccessful NFGs. The successful NFGs also placed relatively more emphasis on computerized record keeping systems that can save time in conducting production and financial analyses to improve farm profitability. They also on average tended to make more use of their own financial record keeping system in addition to the services of bookkeepers, and used more risk management strategies than unsuccessful NFGs, in particular having off-farm investments and keeping cash and credit reserves. A multinomial logit model of factors affecting the sample NFGs' mortgage loan repayment status estimated that extension contact, production and financial risk management capacity, farm financial and production management ability, own record keeping and cash management, and having more sugarcane farm experience to operate larger farm sizes were key determinants of successful loan repayment. The results suggest that policy makers can promote the viability of NFGs by (1) encouraging them to manage solvency and liquidity levels and implement replanting schedules in line with industry norms (e. g. debt:asset ratio of 0. 5 or lower, and the replanting of 10 % of the area under cane (AUC) per annum); and (2) facilitate the transfer of adequate size farms (expected annual gross farm income can meet <b>annual</b> loan <b>repayments)</b> in commercial transactions or transactions funded via government grants to farmers who have the relevant farming experience. New Freehold Growers are also encouraged to build business relationships with industry support staff, implement good record keeping practices, and develop strategies to manage risk (e. g. off-farm investment and holding cash and credit reserves). The second aim of this study was to document the NFGs' perceptions of the scheme and industry role players in order to identify what aspects could be improved for both current and future farmers. The results suggest that most sample respondents (84 %) can identify with, or have experienced the relatively low current returns (cash flow problems) usually associated with the early years after land purchase, while about 60 % of the sample NFGs would have preferred to first lease their land before buying. Future NFGs, or the beneficiaries of other land reform initiatives, must be informed that an investment in land has low current returns relative to capital growth and that the annual profit from farming is low relative to the land value. The possibility of leasing could also be considered for future land transfers to NFGs or other land reform beneficiaries to help manage the liquidity constraints associated with land purchase. Ninety-nine percent of the sample NFGs felt that it was important for new farmers to have a mentor. Post-settlement support thus needs attention from industry role players, and a sustainable mentorship programme could, in part, meet this need...|$|R
40|$|Researchers have {{continually}} {{questioned the}} economic {{viability of the}} Central Arizona Project (CAP). The completion of CAP in 1993 triggered the repayment obligation to the federal government. Despite enormous federal subsidies {{and the existence of}} several revenue sources other than from water sales the <b>annual</b> <b>repayment</b> obligation caused CAP's total expenses to exceed total costs for the two years following 1993. Using various combinations of repayment terms this study solves for pricing schedules that generate annual revenues equal to annual costs. Using estimates of water demand and water supply, price schedules are determined by maximizing consumer surplus subject to a revenue constraint. Under the current repayment terms the initial increases in water prices are less than twenty percent. After the first year increase, prices decline in real terms over the 50 year repayment horizon. In some cases future CAP prices actually drop below current water prices in real terms. Using alternative repayment terms that partially remove large federal subsidies results in first year percentage increases of up to fifty-two percent. In summary, the massive federal subsidies inherent in CAP keep the second-best prices from becoming exorbitantly high. The relatively small impact to the individual water user from the initial increase in prices suggests that CAP will likely remain financially viable. Based on the decreasing trends exhibited by the second-best prices it is possible that CAP may someday generate significant excess revenues to be used to further develop, improve and maintain Arizona's water resources...|$|E
40|$|The cost {{of capital}} in the country has {{displayed}} steep increase in recent times as interest rates have continued to rise. This in turn has affected the profitability of real estate development. The huge capital commitment in real estate development often times drive developers to exploiting other sources of capital, apart from equity, which will incur a cost {{that has to be}} financed by part of the profit from such investment, thereby affecting the profitability of the development to the developer. This research examined the effect of increasing {{cost of capital}} on the profitability of real estate developments in Benin City, Nigeria. In carrying out investigation, questionnaires were administered to selected real estate developers who developed for income generating purposes, as well as structured interview with the officials of Central Bank of Nigeria. Data collected were analyzed using the simple percentage analysis to determine the relative strength of responses drawn and the <b>annual</b> <b>repayment</b> model to determine cash flow from real estate development. It was revealed that cost of capital created negative rate of returns which implied that the increasing cost of capital reduces the profit level of real estate development in Benin City property market. The study therefore concluded that the increasing cost of capital in Nigeria affects the profitability of real estate development negatively. However, the Federal Government of Nigeria was advised to revitalize the National Housing Fund Scheme in order to boost investors’ opportunity of accessing loans and manage interest rates as a way of stimulating the economy to starve off inflation...|$|E
