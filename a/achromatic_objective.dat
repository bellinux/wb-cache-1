5000|$|The {{fabrication}} of the two-element <b>achromatic</b> <b>objective</b> lens, the largest lens ever {{made at the}} time, caused years of delay.

He gave the contract for casting the high quality optical glass blanks, of a size never before attempted, to the firm of Charles Feil in Paris. One of the huge glass disks broke during shipping, and making a replacement was delayed. Finally, after 18 failed attempts, the lens was finished, transported safely across country, and on December 31, 1887, was carefully installed in the telescope tube. The builders had to wait for three days for a break in the clouds to test it. On the evening of January 3 the telescope saw [...] "first light" [...] — and they found that the instrument couldn't be focused.

5000|$|The {{compound}} microscope {{was just being}} introduced to serious scientific use as the introduction of <b>achromatic</b> <b>objective</b> lenses made it superior to the simple microscope for research use.

Oberhaeuser's objective lenses were consistently judged to be very good. [...] He adopted the system used by Amici of several lenses in fixed sequence where each lens served a purpose in correcting aberrations caused by the overall system. The lenses were not independently usable objectives. [...] Several competitors continued to use the system described by J. J. Lister in his famous paper; stacked independent objectives. The path pioneered by Amici and Oberhaeuser proved more flexible and ultimately became the most common design used in higher magnification objectives. A modern comparison of a Dutch museum collection supports the contemporary evaluations. The later Oberhaeuser objectives show very good resolution even by modern standards.Oberhaeuser continued to develop stands to suit the requirements of researchers and introduced the pattern which was to shape {{the image of the}} microscope for over a century in 1854; the Oberhaeuser horseshoe foot stand.|$|E

50|$|The first simple {{condensers}} {{were introduced}} on pre-achromatic microscopes in the 17th century. Robert Hooke used {{a combination of}} a salt water filled globe and a plano-convex lens, and shows in the 'Micrographia' that he understands the reasons for its efficiency. Makers in the 18th century such as Benjamin Martin, Adams and Jones understood the advantage of condensing the area of the light source to that of the area of the object on the stage. This was a simple plano-convex or bi-convex lens, or sometimes a combination of lenses. With the development of the modern <b>achromatic</b> <b>objective</b> in 1829, by Joseph Jackson Lister, the need for better condensers became increasingly apparent. By 1837, the use of the achromatic condenser was introduced in France, by Felix Dujardin, and Chevalier. English makers early took up this improvement, due to the obsession with resolving test objects such as diatoms and Nobert ruled gratings. By the late 1840s, English makers such as Ross, Powell and Smith; all could supply highly corrected condensers on their best stands, with proper centring and focus. It is erroneously stated that these developments were purely empirical - no-one can design a good achromatic, spherically corrected condenser relying only on empirics. On the Continent, in Germany, the corrected condenser was not considered either useful or essential, mainly due to a misunderstanding of the basic optical principles involved. Thus the leading German company, Carl Zeiss in Jena, offered nothing more than a very poor chromatic condenser into the late 1870s. French makers, such as Nachet, provided excellent achromatic condensers on their stands When the leading German bacteriologist, Robert Koch, complained to Ernst Abbe, that he was forced to buy a Seibert achromatic condenser for his Zeiss microscope, in order to make satisfactory photographs of bacteria, Abbe produced a very good achromatic design in 1878.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{diagnose}} cancer, a sample must be removed, prepared, and examined under a microscope, which is expensive, invasive, and time consuming. Fiber optic fluorescence endomicroscopy, where an image guide {{is used to}} obtain high-resolution images of tissue in vivo, has shown promise {{as an alternative to}} conventional biopsies. However, the resolution of standard endomicroscopy is limited by the fiber bundle sampling frequency and out-of-focus light.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to measure the spatial resolution, {{particularly}} in z-axis, of an image obtained from an optical arrangement where a linear sensor was integrated. Comparing the experimental results and theorethical expressions for z-axis resolution [1, 2] in confocal microscopy we will expect to show that from this concept could arise a promising approach to this field. The optical setup consists in a reflection epi-illuminated configuration and different layouts were tested: 1) full and line-illumination; 2) wide-field or confocal pinholes of two different diameters; 3) Aspheric and <b>achromatic</b> <b>objective</b> lens.

30|$|Micro-photoluminescence (micro-PL) {{measurements}} were performed using non-resonant non-linear spectroscopy. In this technique, the excitation energy {{falls in the}} bandgap of the structure, and hence only transitions by multiple-photon absorption are possible. We have found [14] that such excitation results in almost total suppression of the background emission from the underlying wetting layer and yet relatively strong QD emission can still be observed. This {{is very important in}} the present study since the photons related to this background would mask the signature of single photons emitted from the QD. Another advantage of this technique in the current study is that it allows for wide separation between the excitation and collection wavelengths. Non-linear excitation was achieved using 1 -ps pulses from a Ti:sapphire laser followed by a pulse-picker {{in order to reduce the}} repetition rate. A 50 × <b>achromatic</b> <b>objective</b> was used to focus the laser to a spot of ~ 1 μm. This, together with non-linear excitation, gave sufficient spatial resolution to resolve single QDs. The PL was collected using the same microscope objective and separated by a dichroic mirror from the excitation path. The reflection of the mirror was ~ 100 % for the QD emission wavelength, and its transmission was ~ 100 % for the laser wavelength. This allows for the separation of the excitation and collection paths with very little loss of the collected photons. Time-integrated spectra were recorded using a cooled CCD mounted on a 0.3 m spectrometer with a 1, 200 g/mm grating.|$|E
40|$|This {{system was}} one of the test methods {{considered}} for measuring the radius of curvature of {{one or more of the}} 18 segmented mirrors that form the 6. 5 m diameter primary mirror (PM) of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The assembled telescope will be tested at cryogenic temperatures in a 17 -m diameter by 27 -m high vacuum chamber at the Johnson Space Center. This system uses a Leica Absolute Distance Meter (ADM), at a wavelength of 780 nm, combined with beam-steering and beam-shaping optics to make a differential distance measurement between a ring mirror on the reflective null assembly and individual PM segments. The ADM is located inside the same Pressure-Tight Enclosure (PTE) that houses the test interferometer. The PTE maintains the ADM and interferometer at ambient temperature and pressure so that they are not directly exposed to the telescope s harsh cryogenic and vacuum environment. This system takes advantage of the existing <b>achromatic</b> <b>objective</b> and reflective null assembly used by the test interferometer to direct four ADM beamlets to four PM segments through an optical path that is coincident with the interferometer beam. A mask, positioned on a linear slide, contains an array of 1. 25 mm diameter circular subapertures that map to each of the 18 PM segments as well as six positions around the ring mirror. A down-collimated 4 mm ADM beam simultaneously covers 4 adjacent PM segment beamlets and one ring mirror beamlet. The radius, or spacing, of all 18 segments can be measured with the addition of two orthogonally-oriented scanning pentaprisms used to steer the ADM beam to any one of six different sub-aperture configurations at the plane of the ring mirror. The interferometer beam, at a wavelength of 687 nm, and the ADM beamlets, at a wavelength of 780 nm, pass through the objective and null so that the rays are normally incident on the parabolic PM surface. After reflecting off the PM, both the ADM and interferometer beams return to their respective instruments on nearly the same path. A fifth beamlet, acting as a differential reference, reflects off a ring mirror attached to the objective and null and returns to the ADM. The spacings between the ring mirror, objective, and null are known through manufacturing tolerances as well as through an in situ null wavefront alignment of the interferometer test beam with a reflective hologram located near the caustic of the null. Since total path length between the ring mirror and PM segments is highly deterministic, any ADM-measured departures from the predicted path length can be attributed to either spacing error or radius error in the PM. It is estimated that the path length measurement between the ring mirror and a PM segment is accurate to better than 100 m. The unique features of this invention include the differential distance measuring capability and its integration into an existing cryogenic and vacuum compatible interferometric optical test...|$|E
