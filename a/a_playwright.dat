5|$|In May 1840, {{while serving}} as Prince Sturdza's private secretary, he became co-director (with Alecsandri and Negruzzi) of the National Theater Iași. This {{followed}} the monarch's decision to unite the two existing theaters in the city, one of which hosted plays in French, into a single institution. In later years, this venue, which staged popular comedies based on the French repertory of its age and had become {{the most popular of}} its kind in the country, also hosted Alecsandri's debut as <b>a</b> <b>playwright.</b> Progressively, it also became subject to Sturdza's censorship.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{novel was}} based on events from the childhood of the author's son, screenwriter David Paterson. When he asked his mother if he could write a screenplay of the novel, she agreed {{in part because of}} his ability as <b>a</b> <b>playwright.</b> Production began in February 2006, and the film was finished by November. Principal photography was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took several months. This was Michael Chapman's last film as cinematographer before his retirement.|$|E
5|$|When Fielding {{returned}} {{to working with}} the Royal Theatre, his piece The Lottery became an immediate success and lasted for decades after. Combined with The Modern Husband, Fielding could have received up to 1,000 pounds from the plays' first run. This placed Fielding at the position of being the main contributor of plays to the Royal Theatre. Currently, Fielding is primarily viewed as a novelist, but his plays suggest that he wished to be <b>a</b> <b>playwright</b> and that his career would be in theatre. Although Fielding wrote twenty-six plays, {{only a handful of}} them were ever published in critical editions before 1990.|$|E
5|$|And Still I Rise {{is author}} Maya Angelou's third volume of poetry, {{published}} by Random House in 1978. It was published {{during one of}} the most productive periods in Angelou's career; she had written three autobiographies and published two other volumes of poetry up to that point. Angelou considered herself a poet and <b>a</b> <b>playwright,</b> but was best known for her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her poetry has also been successful. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Although her poetry collections have been best-sellers, they have not received serious critical attention.|$|E

5|$|Born in Teddington, {{south-west}} London, Coward {{attended a}} dance academy in London as a child, making his professional stage début {{at the age}} of eleven. As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as <b>a</b> <b>playwright,</b> publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as Hay Fever, Private Lives, Design for Living, Present Laughter and Blithe Spirit, have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta Bitter Sweet and comic revues), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel Pomp and Circumstance, and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works.|$|E
5|$|Henri-Georges Clouzot {{was born}} in Niort, France, to mother Suzanne Clouzot and father Georges Clouzout, a book store owner. He {{was the first of}} three {{children}} in a middle-class family. Clouzot showed talent by writing plays and playing piano recitals. In 1922, Clouzot's father's bookstore went bankrupt and his family moved to Brest, France, where his father became an auctioneer. In Brest, Henri-Georges Clouzot went to Naval School, but was unable to become a Naval Cadet due to his myopia. At the age of 18, Clouzot left for Paris to study political science. While living in Paris, he became friends with several magazine editors. His writing talents led him to theater and cinema as <b>a</b> <b>playwright,</b> lyricist and adaptor-screenwriter. The quality of his work led producer Adolphe Osso to hire him and send him to Germany to work in Studio Babelsberg in Berlin, translating scripts for foreign language films shot there.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Coward was conscripted {{into the}} Artists Rifles but was {{assessed}} as unfit for active service {{because of a}} tubercular tendency, and he was discharged on health grounds after nine months. That year he appeared in the D W Griffith film Hearts of the World in an uncredited role. He sold short stories to several magazines to help his family financially. He also began writing plays, collaborating {{on the first two}} (Ida Collaborates (1917) and Women and Whisky (1918)) with his friend Esmé Wynne. His first solo effort as <b>a</b> <b>playwright</b> was The Rat Trap (1918) which was eventually produced at the Everyman Theatre, Hampstead, in October 1926. During these years, he met Lorn McNaughtan, who became his private secretary and served in that capacity for more than forty years, until her death.|$|E

5|$|List began lecturing {{on these}} subjects; for instance, in February 1893 {{he spoke to}} the {{nationalist}} Verein 'Deutsches Geschichte' ("'German History' Association) on the ancient priesthood of Wotan. He also worked as <b>a</b> <b>playwright,</b> and in December 1894 his play Der Wala Erweckung ("The Wala's Awakening") was premiered at an event organised by the Bund der Germanen (Germanic League) which was devoted to the German nationalist cause, with Jews being explicitly banned from attending the event. Alongside his affiliation with the Bund, List was {{also a member of the}} Deutscher Turnverein (Germanic Gymnastic League), a strongly nationalistic group to whom he contributed literary works for their events.|$|E
5|$|Server Sundaram {{was based}} on a 1960s comedy-drama play of the same name that was written by K. Balachander, then <b>a</b> <b>playwright.</b> The play was staged by his own company Ragini Recreations, formed in 1958. Balachander stated that he wrote the story of Server Sundaram for Nagesh after {{watching}} his performance in Naanum Oru Penn (1963). Director duo Krishnan–Panju had earlier made Nallathambi (1949), which featured comedian N. S. Krishnan in the lead role, and wanted to make another film with a comedian as the protagonist. Hence they chose Nagesh for the job by informing him of their wish while travelling with the actor from Salem to Tiruppur. After returning from Tiruppur, Krishnan–Panju and Nagesh met Balachander and the trio asked Balachander to write a stage play for Nagesh. Balachander agreed. Krishnan–Panju also offered to produce a film adaptation of the play if it became a success.|$|E

5|$|Słowacki {{was not a}} {{very popular}} figure in Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his {{favorite}} genre, yet he was <b>a</b> <b>playwright</b> who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Barton Fink is {{loosely based on}} Clifford Odets, <b>a</b> <b>playwright</b> from New York who in the 1930s joined the Group Theatre, a gathering of dramatists which included Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. Their work emphasized social issues and employed Stanislavski's system of acting to recreate human experience as truthfully as possible. Several of Odets' plays were successfully performed on Broadway, including Awake and Sing! and Waiting for Lefty (both in 1935). When public tastes turned away from politically engaged theatre and toward the familial realism of Eugene O'Neill, Odets had difficulty producing successful work, so he moved to Hollywood and spent 20 years writing film scripts.|$|E
5|$|Adler was {{not content}} to {{continue}} long in this mode, and sought <b>a</b> <b>playwright</b> who could create pieces that would appeal to the Jewish public, while still providing a type of theater he could be proud to perform. He recruited Jacob Gordin, already a well-respected novelist and intellectual, recently arrived in New York and eking out {{a living as a}} journalist at the Arbeiter Zeitung, precursor to The Forward. Gordin's first two plays, Siberia and Two Worlds were commercial failures—so much so that Mogulesko and Kessler quit the company—but The Yiddish King Lear, starring Adler and his new wife Sara was such a success that the play eventually transferred to Finkel's larger National Theater. This play (based only very loosely on Shakespeare) played well with the popular audience, but also with Jewish intellectuals who until this time had largely ignored Yiddish Theater, ending for a time the commercial dominance of operettas such as those of Horowitz and Joseph Lateiner. The next year, Gordin's The Wild Man solidified this change in the direction of Yiddish theater, which was entering what is retrospectively seen as its first period of greatness.|$|E

5|$|Another ancient name is Charita as {{identified}} by General Alexander Cunningham of the Archaeological Survey of India, which was later spelled as Che-li-ta-lo by Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang. When the present temple {{was built by}} the Eastern Ganga king Anantavarman Chodaganga in the 11th and 12th centuries AD, it was called Purushottamkshetra. However, the Moghuls, the Marathas and early British rulers called it Purushottama-chhatar or just Chhatar. In Moghul ruler Akbar's Ain-i-Akbari and subsequent Muslim historical records it was known as Purushottama. In the Sanskrit drama Anargha Raghava Nataka as well, authored by Murari Mishra, <b>a</b> <b>playwright,</b> in the 8th century AD, it {{is referred to as}} Purushottama. It was only after the 12th century AD that Puri came to be known by the shortened form of Jagannatha Puri, named after the deity or in a short form as Puri. It is the only shrine in India, where Radha, along with Lakshmi, Saraswati, Durga, Bhudevi, Sati, Parvati, and Shakti, abodes with Krishna, who is also known by the name Jagannath.|$|E
5|$|Geyer's love of {{the theatre}} came to be shared by his stepson, and Wagner took part in his performances. In his {{autobiography}} Mein Leben Wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel. In late 1820, Wagner was enrolled at Pastor Wetzel's school at Possendorf, near Dresden, where he received some piano instruction from his Latin teacher. He struggled to play a proper scale at the keyboard and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear. Following Geyer's death in 1821, Richard {{was sent to the}} Kreuzschule, the boarding school of the Dresdner Kreuzchor, at the expense of Geyer's brother. At the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the Gothic elements of Carl Maria von Weber's opera Der Freischütz, which he saw Weber conduct. At this period Wagner entertained ambitions as <b>a</b> <b>playwright.</b> His first creative effort, listed in the Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis (the standard listing of Wagner's works) as WWV 1, was a tragedy called Leubald. Begun when he was in school in 1826, the play was strongly influenced by Shakespeare and Goethe. Wagner was determined to set it to music, and persuaded his family to allow him music lessons.|$|E
5|$|Since 1863, Verne {{had been}} under {{contract}} with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, who published each of his novels, beginning with Five Weeks in a Balloon (1863) and Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and continuing {{through the rest of}} his books to form the novel sequence Hetzel called the Voyages Extraordinaires. The arrangement gave Verne prominence as a novelist and a certain amount of financial stability, but {{under the terms of the}} contract Verne's profits barely earned him a living wage. Verne's fortunes changed markedly in 1874, when the stage adaptation of his novel Around the World in Eighty Days was a smash hit, running for 415 performances in its original production and quickly making Verne wealthy as well as famous as <b>a</b> <b>playwright.</b> Adapted with the collaboration of the showman d'Ennery, the play invented and codified the pièce de grand spectacle, an extravagant theatrical genre that became intensely popular in Paris throughout the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Verne and d'Ennery went on to adapt two other Verne novels, The Children of Captain Grant and Michael Strogoff, as similarly spectacular plays.|$|E
