40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} a rat model of frostbite and {{to evaluate the}} effects of different <b>administration</b> <b>methods</b> of Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Decoction (HGWD), a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine for warming meridians to disperse cold, on rats with frostbite. Methods: Frostbite in rats was induced by the method of soaking feet in hypothermia ethanol-water mixture. Levels of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor-β (TNF-β), thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) and 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 α (6 -keto-PGF 1 α) in serum of rats treated with different <b>administration</b> <b>methods</b> of HGWD, such as oral administration (Oral HGWD), soak (Soak HGWD), and oral administration plus soak (Oral-soak HGWD), were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: IL- 6, TNF-β, TXB 2 levels were significantly higher (P 0. 05) was observed in the soak HGWD group, {{and there was no}} interaction (P> 0. 05) between the two <b>administration</b> <b>methods</b> in regulating the level of IL- 6. The levels of TNF-β obviously decreased (P 0. 05) and there was no interaction (P> 0. 05) between the two <b>administration</b> <b>methods.</b> The level of 6 -keto-PGF 1 α was obviously increased (P 0. 05) in the soak HGWD group as compared with the untreated group, and there was interaction (P< 0. 05) between the two <b>administration</b> <b>methods</b> in regulating the level of 6 -keto-PGF 1 α. Conclusion: Rats with frostbite has immunologic dysfunction and a state of forming thrombus easily. The oral-soak HGWD can improve frostbite of local skin in rats. The therapeutic mechanism of HGWD may be to regulate the dysfunction of immune system and the imbalance of TXB 2 -PGF 1 α...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{increased}} emphasis on quality assurance of teaching, {{it is crucial that}} student evaluations of teaching (SET) methods be both reliable and workable in practice. Online SETs particularly tend to raise criticisms with those most reactive to mechanisms of teaching accountability. However, most studies of SET processes have been conducted with convenience, small and cross-sectional samples. Longitudinal studies are rare, as comparison studies on SET methodological approaches are generally pilot studies followed shortly after by implementation. The investigation presented here significantly contributes to the debate by examining the impact of the online <b>administration</b> <b>method</b> of SET on a very large longitudinal sample at the course level rather than attending to the student unit, thus compensating for the inter-dependency of students’ responses according to the instructor variable. It explores the impact of the <b>administration</b> <b>method</b> of SET (paper based in-class vs. out-of-class online collection) on scores, with a longitudinal sample of over 63, 000 student responses collected over a total period of 10 years.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the efficacy of the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS) in identifying children at risk for feeding difficulties when given to parents by interview versus without assistance. Thirty subjects from Emory Developmental Progress Clinic (Emory DPC) participated in the study and were randomized to receive the BPFAS either by interview or without assistance. Mean BPFAS scores were compared by survey <b>administration</b> <b>method</b> and nutrition referral status for the total cohort as well as by age (1. 5 year) and weight status (3 ̆c 25 th percentile, 25 - 75 th percentile, 3 ̆e 75 th percentile) using the t-test. The association between survey <b>administration</b> <b>method</b> as well as nutrition referral status and referral score category (84) was determined using the Chi-square test, as was the relationship between nutrition referral status and the response to each BPFAS question. No difference in mean BPFAS score or referral score category by survey <b>administration</b> <b>method</b> was found in the total cohort. However, a higher BPFAS score was observed for children 3 ̆e 1. 5 years of age who were referred for nutrition intervention vs. not referred (95. 33 vs. 62. 5, respectively; p= 0. 004). There was also a significant association between the number of patients referred for nutrition intervention vs. not referred and referral score (11 vs. 19, respectively; p= 0. 041). There was no association between responses to individual BPFAS questions and nutrition referral status. In conclusion, evaluation of other feeding assessment surveys or the in-house development of a screening tool may be better alternatives for the Emory DPC...|$|E

In humans, these medications are taken orally, usually once per day. Unfortunately, administration of antidepressant medications in rodent models is often through injection, oral gavage, or minipump implant, all relatively stressful procedures. The aim of the present study was to investigate how administration of the commonly used SSRI, fluoxetine, via a wafer cookie, compares to fluoxetine administration using an osmotic minipump, with regards to serum drug levels and hippocampal plasticity. For this experiment, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided over the two administration methods: (1) cookie and (2) osmotic minipump and three fluoxetine treatment doses: 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day. Results show that a fluoxetine dose of 5 [*]mg/kg/day, but not 10 [*]mg/kg/day, results in comparable serum levels of fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine between the two administration methods. Furthermore, minipump administration of fluoxetine resulted in higher levels of cell proliferation in the granule cell layer (GCL) at a 5 [*]mg dose compared to a 10 [*]mg dose.

40|$|Background: Screening, brief intervention, and {{referral}} to treatment (SBIRT) is an efficacious prevention practice. However, {{little research has}} assessed differences in prescreening outcomes between inpatient and outpatient primary care or among different prescreening administration methods. This study tested whether <b>administration</b> <b>method</b> (self-administered vs interview) and setting (inpatient versus outpatient) predicted prescreening outcomes in a large sample of primary care patients. Then, among patients who prescreened positive, it tested whether full screening scores differed by <b>administration</b> <b>method</b> and setting. Methods: Researchers used binomial logistic regression to assess predicted prescreening outcomes and analysis of variance to assess differences in SBIRT screening scores across a total of 14 447 unique patient visits in 10 outpatient sites and 1 centrally located hospital. Results: Controlling for gender, depression, and other substance use, both medical setting and method of prescreening, predicted prescreening results. Among patients who prescreened positive for alcohol, setting also was associated with mean screening scores. However, outcomes were not uniform by substance (eg, alcohol vs other drugs). Conclusion: The results support previous studies on this topic that had utilized cross-study comparison or that were not specific to SBIRT prescreening/screening mechanisms. At the same time, nuanced findings were observed that had not previously been reported and {{suggest the need for}} further research in this area...|$|E
