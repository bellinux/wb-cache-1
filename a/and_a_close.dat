5|$|Bids for {{construction}} were forwarded to the Australian Government by Reid on 7 March 1910, and Prime Minister Alfred Deakin approved the submission by John Brown & Company {{to construct the}} hull and machinery, with separate contracts awarded to Armstrong and Vickers for the battlecruiser's armament. The total cost of construction was set at £2million. Contracts were signed between the Admiralty and the builders to avoid the problems of distant supervision by the Australian Government, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> watch on proceedings was maintained by Reid and Captain Francis Haworth-Booth, the Australian Naval Representative in London.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Permian, {{increasing}} aridity and the {{diversification of}} reptiles contributed into {{a decline in}} terrestrial temnospondyls, but semiaquatic and fully aquatic temnospondyls continued to flourish, including the large Melosaurus of Eastern Europe. Other temnospondyls, such as archegosaurids, developed long snouts <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> similarity to crocodiles, although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group. These temnospondyls included the largest known batrachomorph, the 9-m-long Prionosuchus of Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Kaldalis is a protoss zealot <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> {{friend of}} Hierarch Artanis. Kaldalis {{takes pride in}} the history of the protoss and the Khala, though does not express {{prejudice}} towards the Nerazim, and believes that driving them away was a sin. A scar runs down his left eye. Kaldalis survived the zerg conquest of Aiur during the Great War. Afterwards, he joined the Protoss Protectorate led by Hierarch Artanis. Kaldalis was impressed by Artanis' vision of a unified protoss society, the Daelaam: incorporating the cultures of Khalai, Nerazim, Tal'Darim and Purifiers.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1891, {{a general}} meeting {{took place at}} Royal Street Hall, near Everton Valley. Everton's {{chairman}} John Houlding proposed that a limited company be formed and that the company should purchase his land and local brewer Joseph Orrel's adjacent land for a combined £9,237. A club run as a limited company was unusual for the time as football clubs were usually run as “sports clubs” with members paying an annual fee. The proposal was supported by William Barclay, the club secretary <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> friend of Houlding.|$|E
5|$|Schreck, a {{founding}} member of the SA <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> confidant of Hitler, became the first SS chief in March 1925. On 15 April 1926, Joseph Berchtold succeeded him as chief of the SS. Berchtold changed the title of the office to Reichsführer-SS (Reich Leader-SS). Berchtold was considered more dynamic than his predecessor, but became increasingly frustrated by the authority the SA had over the SS. This led to him transferring leadership of the SS to his deputy, Erhard Heiden, on 1 March 1927. Under Heiden's leadership, a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA.|$|E

5|$|The 1886 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team represented the United States Naval Academy in the 1886 college football season. The team marked {{the second time}} that the school played a multiple-game season. The squad was captained by halfback Clarence Stone. The year began with consecutive wins over rivals St. John's College and Johns Hopkins, but then reversed with a loss to the former <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> victory over the latter. The year concluded with shutout losses to the Princeton reserve squad and Gallaudet. The season was the program's longest until 1890, when that year's team played seven games.|$|E

5|$|The Smithsonian {{hoped to}} salvage Langley's {{aeronautical}} reputation by proving the Aerodrome could fly; Curtiss {{wanted to prove}} {{the same thing to}} defeat the Wrights' patent lawsuits against him. The tests had no effect on the patent battle, but the Smithsonian made the most of them, honoring the Aerodrome in its museum and publications. The Institution did not reveal the extensive Curtiss modifications, but Orville Wright learned of them from his brother Lorin <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> friend of his and Wilbur's, Griffith Brewer, who both witnessed and photographed some of the tests.|$|E

One of the most financially successful restaurants in Chicago, the Park Grill remains exempt from property taxes after a multi-year litigation which reached the Illinois Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach has {{sometimes}} {{been identified as a}} certain Margaðr who appears in various mediaeval sources documenting the contemporary Irish Sea adventures of Margaðr and Guthormr Gunnhildarson. One such source is Haralds saga Sigurðarsonar, within Heimskringla. According to this source, Margaðr was King of Dublin, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> friend of Guthormr, an accomplished man who was a nephew of the Norwegian kings Óláfr and Haraldr Sigurðarson. Late one summer, the saga relates that Margaðr and Guthormr took part in particularly successful raid in Wales. As their loot of silver was being assessed, Margaðr demanded Guthormr's share, forcing the latter to fight for his portion of the plunder. Although outnumbered sixteen ships to five, the saga relates that, through the miraculous intervention of God and Guthormr's saintly uncle (Óláfr), Guthormr was able to defeat and slay Margaðr and all his followers in the ensuing battle.|$|E
5|$|Keats {{meanwhile}} {{had engaged}} and defeated Saint Antoine, forcing the wounded Commodore Julien le Ray to surrender following {{an action that}} had lasted just half an hour. Casualties on Saint Antoine were heavy, although Superb had just 15 men wounded. The rest of the British squadron, following up in the darkness, mistook Saint Antoine as being still active, and all fired on the ship as they passed, intending to catch the remainder of Moreno's squadron as it sailed northwest along the Spanish coastline. At 04:00 the Formidable, now {{under the command of}} Captain Amable Troude, was seen to the north in Conil Bay near Cape Trafalgar and Saumarez sent Venerable to chase the French ship, Hood accompanied by Thames under Captain Aiskew Hollis. At 05:15, Venerable came within range <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> action soon followed, Hood ordering Hollis to bring his ship close to Troude's stern and open up a raking fire. Formidable had the better of the action however and at 06:45, with casualties mounting, Hood's mainmast collapsed over the side.|$|E

5|$|The {{peaceful}} town of Duisburg, untroubled {{by political}} and religious unrest, was the perfect place for the flowering of his talent. Mercator quickly {{established himself as a}} man of standing in the town: an intellectual of note, a publisher of maps, and a maker of instruments and globes. There, he also gave a globe to John Dee. Mercator never accepted the privileges and voting rights of a burgher for they came with military responsibilities which conflicted with his pacifist and neutral stance. Nevertheless, he was on good terms with the wealthier citizens <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> friend of Walter Ghim, the twelve times mayor and Mercator's future biographer.|$|E
5|$|The postcards used to {{introduce}} a country and their participants were shot in their respective countries and featured the artists using unique ways to create their country's flag, e.g. the postcard for the United Kingdom features Molly creating the Union Flag from AEC Routemaster buses, Royal Mail vans, and people wearing blue raincoats along with strips of red and white paper, and the postcard for Denmark featuring Basim and his singers using old furniture and red and white paint to paint the Danish flag. The postcards then ended with the act taking a picture on a camera or phone <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> up of the resulting artwork was shown onscreen. The flag created by the artist(s) is then captured into a diamond and it transitions to the official flag. It then swirls round for the before-hand details of the artist/composer. For example, the entry for San Marino features the painting of the flag that Valentina Monetta (the artist) created, transitioning into the official flag for San Marino.|$|E
