25|$|The FBI is {{organized}} into functional branches and the Office of the Director, which contains most administrative offices. An executive assistant director manages each branch. Each branch is then divided into offices and divisions, each headed by an assistant director. The various divisions are further divided into sub-branches, led by deputy assistant directors. Within these sub-branches {{there are various}} sections headed by section chiefs. Section chiefs are ranked analogous to special <b>agents</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|R

The Norm Analysis Method consists of four steps for eliciting and formalizing norms: responsibility analysis, protonorm analysis, trigger analysis and detailed dynamic behavior specification (cf.

Trigger analysis focuses on the conditions that should happen and thus the action that will be performed.|$|R

25|$|The FBI, which {{continues}} to investigate the theft, has said {{it is no longer}} interested in identifying the thieves as the statute of limitations on the crime expired in 1996 and no one can be prosecuted for it (although those knowingly in possession of the stolen works could still be charged for that offense). However, it apparently does not put much credence in the theory that Donati was behind the crime. Kurkjian writes that he shared the details of his conversation with the FBI <b>agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the investigation, but at a news conference a month later, the agent did not mention Donati at all and apparently seemed to still be embracing an earlier FBI theory of the crime.|$|E
