5|$|According to Herodotus, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of {{the battle}} Xerxes {{attempted}} to build a causeway across the channel to attack the Athenian evacuees on Salamis, but this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Allies might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges. His general Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while Xerxes retreated to Asia with {{the bulk of the}} army. Mardonius over-wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.|$|E

He and former Confederate general Jubal Early presided over lottery drawings and made numerous public appearances, lending the effort some respectability. For 15 years the two generals served in these positions, but the public became opposed to government-sponsored gambling and the lottery was closed down by the legislature.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss,</b> MacShara {{withdrew from}} the case but Rudzewicz appealed the {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In the filing, Rudzewicz claimed that since they were residents of Michigan, and because the claims did not arise within the Southern District of Florida, that District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. Additionally Rudzewicz argued that the long-arm statute violated the 14th Amendment and was unconstitutional. Citing a similar case, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, the Appeals court agreed with the defendants and overturned the lower court's decision. The court also agreed with Rudzewicz's assertion of the constitutionality of Florida's long arm statute in its application to the case.|$|E

Shackleton reported that McNish calmly mentioned his narrow escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of the Endurance, as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions.

La Salle had little money with which to replenish supplies, and finally two of the merchants aboard the expedition sold some of their trade goods to the islanders, and lent their profits to La Salle. To fill the gaps left after several men deserted, La Salle recruited a few islanders to join the expedition.|$|E

The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of Estonia to the Russian Empire in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern Ukraine, where they founded a village, Gammalsvenskby ("Old Swedish Village"). A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.|$|E

5|$|Harper was an {{accomplished}} scholar (Semiticist) {{and a member}} of the Baptist clergy who believed that a great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus, to prepare students for careers in teaching and research and ministers for service to the church and community.
