40|$|Carbon fiber {{composites}} {{are continually}} seeing increased use in aerospace applications. It {{is necessary to}} understand their failure modes in order to properly design and perform analysis on structures constructed primarily from them. This thesis studies woven carbon fiber composites with and without double-edge notches {{in a series of}} static and fatigue tests performed on an Instron 8801 servo-hydraulic testing system. Specimens were constructed of Advanced Composites Group product # LTM 45 EL woven carbon fiber pre-preg/epoxy and were cut to approximately 9 -inch in length and 1 -inch in width. Notches were cut into some of the specimens using <b>a</b> <b>slitting</b> <b>saw</b> blade of 0. 006 -in. thickness. Ultimate strength, Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for specimens were determined to be 119, 418 psi, 7, 149, 000 psi and 0. 05, respeictively. Fracture stress for specimens with notch depths of 0. 10, 0. 15, 0. 20, 0. 25, 0. 30 and 0. 35 was determined to be 93, 481 psi, 88, 193 psi, 86, 968 psi, 81, 112 psi, 84, 197 psi and 81, 955 psi, respectively. The results from these tests showed that the specimens followed Griffith’s model for brittle failure. Average number of cycles to failure was determined to be 6, 600, 37, 200, 94, 300 and 293, 400 for fatigue tests with maximum stresses of 72. 5 %, 75 %, 77. 5 % and 80 % of the ultimate strength. Fatigue tests performed on notched specimens produced data that was too scattered from which to draw a statistically significant result.

40|$|As is {{generally}} known, discrete-frequency noises are radiated from fans due to rotor-stator interaction. Their fundamental frequency is the blade-passage frequency, which {{is determined by}} the number of rotor blades and their rotating speeds. To reduce such noises, several types of silencers have been designed. Among them, the authors noted a slitlike expansion chamber (hereafter referred to as slit, for simplicity) and have studied its performance. <b>A</b> <b>slit</b> is <b>a</b> simple expansion chamber with a very short axial length that is placed in <b>a</b> duct. <b>A</b> <b>slit</b> with <b>a</b> circular cross-section that is concentric with a circular duct may be studied using the same interpretation as is used for a side-branch resonator muffler (closed-end tube connected to a duct); that is, the resonant frequency of <b>a</b> <b>slit</b> depends on its depth (with an open-end correction). It is expected, hence, that <b>a</b> <b>slit</b> might be applicable as a simple and axially compact silencer that is effective on discrete-frequency noises. In this article, the properties of <b>a</b> <b>slit</b> are introduced, and the applicability of <b>a</b> <b>slit</b> to actual rotating machinery is described using experimental data...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{solution}} of a linear Restricted Solid [...] on [...] Solid (RSOS) model confined to <b>a</b> <b>slit.</b> We include <b>a</b> field-like energy, which equivalently weights the area under the interface, and also include independent interaction terms with both walls.

This work generalises previous work on the RSOS model in the half-plane which has a solution that was shown recently to exhibit a novel mathematical structure involving basic hypergeometric functions _ 3 ϕ_ 2. Because of the mathematical relationship between half-plane and slit this work hence effectively explores the underlying q-orthogonal polynomial structure to that solution. It also generalises two other recent works: one on Dyck paths weighted with an osmotic pressure in <b>a</b> <b>slit</b> and another concerning Motzkin paths without an osmotic pressure term in <b>a</b> <b>slit...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringTension or {{compression}} fracture behavior {{studies are}} normally initiated with open hole tension or compression tests {{performed at the}} laminate level. While these test data serve as an excellent starting point in residual strength studies in small notch sizes, the need to evaluate and verify the residual strength for larger structures and at larger notch sizes region is still there. An experimental study was performed with the focus on large notch sizes of circular hole and narrow slit flaw configurations on laminates fabricated with a carbon/epoxy oven-cure capable prepreg material system. The current {{part of the study}} focused on uniaxial tension loading with a constant width and height to flaw dimension ratio. Experimental test data were then combined with lamina and laminate level data for residual strength curves generation and the curves were validated against Whitney-Nuismer and Mar-Lin fracture mechanics models. The effects of flaw sizes and the flaw type towards the residual strength capability of a laminate turn out to be substantial as the notch size gets larger than one inch. Test results showed that <b>a</b> narrow <b>slit</b> or <b>saw</b> cut damage is far more critical than a circular hole cut-out. The notch sensitivity order of a saw cut flaw is also roughly three times more than that of a circular hole. Analytical studies were also performed to evaluate several finite element method variable effects on residual strength prediction and to discover the best practice in stress analyses of notched composite laminates. Point Stress failure criterion was used in the analyses and predicted failure loads were compared to the experimental data. Good agreements and correlations were found between the analytical predictions and the experimental data. It can be concluded that the residual strength of a notched laminated composite can be reasonably predicted from finite element analyses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this study, eight {{techniques}} including coping <b>saw,</b> metal <b>slitting</b> <b>saw,</b> razor blade, cubic {{boron nitride}} (CBN) disc, scoring, die-cutting and guillotining, diamond disc, and laser cutting methods {{were used to}} produce pre-cracked fracture toughness (Kc) test specimens made of poly(methyl methacrylate) /graft-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene blends. The influences of notch shape (radial, rectangular, or angular-shaped and variety of thicknesses), pre-cracking method, chip removing or non-chip removing, and the contact or non-contact methods on the results obtained in fracture toughness tests were investigated. The results were analyzed by two methods, quantitatively and qualitatively, by comparing the obtained Kc results and studying the SEM and optical microscopy images, respectively. The {{results indicated that the}} different conditions of a produced pre-crack including; geometry of pre-crack due to geometry of tools, residual stress due to pre-crack creation, heat affected zone, damage of crack tip, and producing crazing around the crack tip could affect the fracture toughness. The maximum difference resulted from different pre-cracking methods was equal to 0. 24 MPa. m 0. 5 and the lowest value of fracture toughness Kc, 2. 53 MPa. m 0. 5, belonged to the scoring method but the highest value, 2. 77 MPa. m 0. 5, belonged to the metal <b>slitting</b> <b>saw</b> method. Also, the results indicated that the effects of notching on toughness of RT-PMMA had a low notch sensitivity and the differences between minimum and maximum Kc values was found about 9 %...|$|R
