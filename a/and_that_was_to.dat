Coppell took them to the Division Two play-off final in 2002 after they had narrowly missed out on automatic promotion, conceding a late equaliser to Coppell's future side Reading in the end-of-season decider.

25|$|President Andrew Johnson had {{the public}} {{rooms on the}} State Floor {{refurbished}} in 1866. His wife, Eliza McCardle Johnson, was in frail health and did {{little in the way}} of entertaining or overseeing the White House. Johnson instead relied on his daughter, Martha Patterson (wife of Senator David T. Patterson). In May, the East Room was cleared of furnishings. Mrs. Patterson oversaw the selection of new yellow wallpaper with a black and gold border, lace curtains, and reupholstered furniture. The ceiling was repainted and frescoes added, and the ceiling centerpieces and cornices were regilded. Only once did Mrs. Johnson intervene, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> request that the paint applied to ceiling be of the highest quality. Patterson also had the three large marble-topped tables removed from the East Room and placed in the family private quarters, and two of the four pier tables added to the Family Dining Room. The East Room was finished in early 1867.|$|E
25|$|His family {{originated}} from Kashmir {{and came to}} England in the 1960s with a dream of a better life. Khan was born in Birmingham, attended Somerville Primary school {{and then went on}} to Oldknow secondary school (later to become Small Heath School). At the age of 12 he displayed a remarkable passion and talent for cricket and it was through sheer luck that his talent was discovered in the playground by a cricket mad teacher, Pete Bolland. Later that year in 1983, he was selected for the Warwickshire Under 13's team where his potential as a leader was spotted very early, resulting in him being awarded the captaincy. Khan was the only state school boy in that team. His determination to succeed was evidenced by the fact that despite having never played hard ball cricket before, he top scored in his first year. Khan only had one dream <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make it at the highest grade and play professional cricket. As a young boy, he would find ways to get into Edgbaston to watch Warwickshire play and vowed to his friends that one day, he too would be out there.|$|E
500|$|Four {{days after}} Kesler's return, Jannik Hansen was {{involved}} in a controversial hit on the Chicago Blackhawks' Marian Hossa. As both players went up for an airborne puck, Hansen struck Hossa {{in the back of the}} head with his forearm and elbow. Hossa then laid on the ice for a few minutes, during which time the training staff examined him before he was able to leave under his own power. Hansen was given a two-minute minor for roughing and Hossa did not return to the game. Opinions of the hit varied with former NHL referee Kerry Fraser, stating that he did not believe that there was any deliberate or malicious intent, and that he would be surprised if Hansen received a suspension for the play. Meanwhile, former Blackhawks analyst Ed Olczyk stated, [...] "there’s no doubt in my mind, once he didn’t play the puck, he had one thing in his mind, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> put his forearm or elbow in the back of the head of Marian Hossa," [...] and he would be surprised if Hansen was not suspended. Hossa returned to practice the following day. Hansen was suspended for one game due to what Brendan Shanahan called [...] "the carelessness and force of which the blow was delivered." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wills was {{reported}} to be introverted and detached. On court, she rarely showed emotion, ignored her opponents, and took no notice of the crowd. Kitty McKane Godfree, who in 1924 inflicted the only defeat Wills suffered at Wimbledon during her career, said, [...] "Helen was a very private person, and she didn't really make friends very much." [...] Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman said, [...] "Helen was really an unconfident and [...] awkward girl—you have no idea how awkward.... I thought of Helen as an honestly shy person who was bewildered by how difficult it was to please most people." [...] Because of her unchanging expression, Grantland Rice, the American sportswriter, bestowed on Wills the nickname [...] "Little Miss Poker Face". As her success and, ironically, unpopularity with the public increased, she was called [...] "Queen Helen" [...] and [...] "the Imperial Helen".

If he had once lost confidence in a man, justly or unjustly, that man could do no right in his eyes. He was as bad an enemy as he was a good friend ... once he had lost confidence in (Lanrezac) he ignored him and acted as if he and his Army did not exist." [...] Spears also recorded that at a conference with Joffre on 30 August 1914 French, the back of his tunic wet with sweat from riding hard to reach the meeting, was [...] "one of the coolest and calmest people at GHQ". This was at the time when he had decided that the BEF would have to retreat behind the Seine to refit.|$|E

2500|$|One of Reed's sore points {{resulting}} from that unauthorized re-editing {{was that the}} [...] "heavenly wine and roses" [...] melody was cut out of [...] "Sweet Jane". In the original recording, this part was intended to provide a perfectly flowing bridge to a full-fledged plagal cadence two-chord version of the chorus (earlier choruses in the song have a 4-chord riff). In Reed's initial solo performances, he would include the verse (see for instance American Poet), until 1973, when he would routinely leave it out, as the bridge fits less well in a more hard rock version (as heard for instance on Rock 'n' Roll Animal). However, the post-Reed, Doug Yule-led Velvets always performed the song with the verse included. A career-spanning retrospective of Reed's recordings with the Velvet Underground and as a solo artist, NYC Man (The Ultimate Collection 1967–2003), which Reed compiled himself, uses the shorter version. When asked about the shortened versions of [...] "Sweet Jane" [...] and [...] "New Age" [...] and Reed's long-standing claims that they were re-edited without his consent, Yule claimed that Reed had in fact edited the songs himself. [...] "He edited it. You have to understand at the time, the motivation was... Lou was, {{and all of us}} were, intent on one thing <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be successful and what you had to do to be successful in music, was you had to have a hit, and a hit had to be uptempo, short, and with no digressions, straight ahead basically, you wanted a hook and something to feed the hook and that was it. 'Sweet Jane' was arranged just exactly the way it is on the original Loaded release exactly for that reason—to be a hit! 'Who Loves The Sun' was done exactly that way for that reason—to be a hit." ...|$|E
