Optimum machining parameters of milling operations are great concern with manufacturing environment. In this experimental investigation was observed the machining performance with various cutting speed, feed and depth of cut using side and face milling cutter. Mainly surface roughness where investigated employing Taguchi design of experiments and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The significant machining parameters are identified by using signal to noise ratio. The result of the experiments indicates cutting speed play a dominating role in surface roughness in milling process parameters...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Multi-objective {{optimization}} {{technology and}} Fuzzy theory {{were applied to}} design truck differential based on consideration on its force condition. The mathematical model for the multi-objective optimization design was set up under {{the objective of the}} minimum volume of the differential, maximal strength of planet gear, with the design variable of planet gear teeth number Z 1, <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>gear</b> teeth number Z 2, section modulus ms and working width b. Then, the fuzzy solution of multi-objective optimization were use to solve the model. Practical example of calculation shows that, the fuzzy optimization result is superior to that of regular optimization and traditional design, differential volume deceased by 32. 73 % and 1. 92 % respectively. Comparing with nominal design, the load of planet gear increases 17 %, but is far below its permissible value, and also reduced by 9. 04 % than that of regular optimization...|$|E

50|$|Although {{a widely}} used system, {{this system is}} not as {{efficient}} as a system with locking hubs. A CAD system spins the <b>axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> spider <b>gears,</b> and side gears in the carrier during normal driving. Locking hubs disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving. Not as efficient as locking hubs, a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the axle completely locked in.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDry {{machining}} {{is gaining}} {{more and more}} importance in today's manufacturing science because of health hazards imposed {{by the use of}} coolants while machining. This paper presents a detailed analysis of surface topology in dry machining of EN- 8 steel which is widely used material for general-purpose <b>axles,</b> <b>shafts,</b> <b>gears,</b> bolts and studs. Regression models are developed for Ra, Rq, and Rz parameters of surface topology which are very significant parameters from contact stiffness, fatigue strength and surface wear point of view. For all the regression models a good correlation is found between surface roughness and cutting parameters and hence these models can be used to predict the surface roughness within the range of cutting parameters under investigation. Regression models are compared with experimental values of roughness and with available geometrical models. Percent errors are also calculated by comparing regression models and experimental values and a geometrical model. It is found that the percent errors are very small for regression model as compared to geometrical model. Finaly performance of dry machining is compared with that of machining with coolant, no significant difference is found for the surface roughness with the dry machining and that of machining with coolant...|$|R

50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R

Both {{companies}} used Dana 70 front axles until the mid-1970s (Dodge W300 pickup up until 1978, discontinued in 1979). All of these Dana 70 front axles were closed knuckle, with king pins and had a GAWR of 6000 lbs.
