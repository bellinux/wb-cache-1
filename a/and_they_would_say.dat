500|$|... "Hair" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Gaga and RedOne, {{and the name}} of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011. On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was a kid, I used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling my identity... My hair was my glory. It was the only thing that I could change about myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Letters {{began to}} pour in for her {{from all over}} the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (<b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{that will}} show that a child was born, but the proof that I am that child rests entirely with your sister. It might have died when its mother did, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that your sister was trying to palm off her own child, or someone else's, as his. Of course, Mrs. Callaghan {{would be able to}} prove that your sister arrived {{immediately}} after the surrender of Limerick, bringing a child with her, and that she said it was the son of James O'Carroll; and that she went a year later to Kilkargan, and left it there with John O'Carroll. Moreover, I could get plenty of evidence, from those on the estate, that I was the child so left." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought of}} my dead godmother, of the night when I read to her, of her {{frowning}} so fixedly and sternly in her bed, of the strange place I was going to, of the people I should find there, <b>and</b> what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be like, <b>and</b> what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to me, when {{a voice in the}} coach gave me a terrible start.|$|R
60|$|So {{then he was}} in a fidget for {{the rain}} to let up, so we could turn out and run across some of the people <b>and</b> see if <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} about it to us. And he said if they did we must be horribly surprised and shocked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{he often}} does, {{to all of}} us, for their house is full, and we are so fond of them. My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know, so it is quite natural that we {{children}} should play together," [...] <b>and</b> Meg hoped <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> no more.|$|R
6000|$|But I {{think one}} thing, if anything, would stagger their simple old Saxon faith; one thing {{would make them}} fearful, as indeed it makes the preacher this day, that the time of real brotherhood and peace is still but too far off; and that the {{achievements}} of our physical science, the unity of this great Exhibition, noble as they are, are still only dim forecastings and prophecies, as it were, of a higher, nobler reality. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> sadly to us, their children: [...] "Sons, {{you ought to be}} so near to God; He seems to have given you so much and to have worked among you as He never worked for any nation under heaven. How is it that you give the glory to yourselves, and not to Him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Do you {{understand}} that? Then think {{what would happen}} if you pricked a hole in the ball. The air inside would come hissing out, and the ball would sink again into the water. But the ants would probably fancy the very opposite. Their little heads would be full of the notion that the ball was solid and could not move, just as our heads are full of the notion that the earth is solid and cannot move; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Ah! here is the water rising again." [...] Just so, I believe, when the sea seems to ebb away during the earthquake, the land is really being raised out of the sea, hundreds of miles of coast, perhaps, or a whole island, at once, by the force of the steam and gas imprisoned under the ground. That steam stretches and strains the solid rocks below, till they can bear no more, and snap, and crack, with frightful roar and clang; then out of holes and chasms in the ground rush steam, gases--often foul and poisonous ones--hot water, mud, flame, strange stones--all signs that the great boiler down below has burst at last.|$|E
6000|$|But {{even after}} Uncle William {{had given his}} formal consent, I didn't {{want to get married}} till I could leave him safely. Only he got along so well in his [...] "territory" [...] of the Bowery from the very start that he was soon quite all right. He used to go out every morning with his trayful of badges and pencils and shoe-strings and he was a success at once. All the people got to know him by sight <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> when they saw him, [...] "Here comes the Emperor," [...] or [...] "Here comes Old Dutch," [...] and very often there would be quite a little crowd round him buying his things. Uncle {{regarded}} himself always as conferring a great dignity on any one that he sold a badge to, but he was very capricious and he had certain buttons and badges that he would only part with as a very special favour and honour. Uncle got on so fast that presently Cousin Ferdinand decided that {{it would be all right}} to know him again and so he came over and made a reconciliation and took away Uncle's money,--it was all in small coins,--in a bag to invest for him.|$|E

6000|$|Method and Genius: an Apologue.--"There was a {{question}} between Grimm and M. Le Roy of creative genius and co-ordinating method. Grimm detests method; according to him, it is the pedantry of letters. Those who can only arrange, would do as well to remain idle; those who can only get instruction from what has been arranged, would do as well to remain ignorant. What necessity is there {{for so many people}} knowing anything else besides their trade?

6000|$|Peter's {{heart was}} {{so glad that}} he felt he must sing all day long, just as the birds sing for joy, but, being partly human, he needed an instrument, so he made a pipe of reeds, {{and he used to}} sit by the shore of the island of an evening, practising the sough of the wind and the ripple of the water, and {{catching}} handfuls of the shine of the moon, and he put them all in his pipe and played them so beautifully that even the birds were deceived, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to each other, [...] "Was that a fish leaping in the water or was it Peter playing leaping fish on his pipe?" [...] and sometimes he played the birth of birds, and then the mothers would turn round in their nests to see whether they had laid an egg. If you are a child of the Gardens you must know the chestnut-tree near the bridge, which comes out in flower first of all the chestnuts, but perhaps you have not heard why this tree leads the way. It is because Peter wearies for summer and plays that it has come, and the chestnut being so near, hears him and is cheated.|$|E
6000|$|Liddy {{was always}} a [...] "leetel chap," [...] and looked no more than nine when twelve, {{so that he could}} do no heavy work; but he was a very willing and active little fellow, with a sweet temper, and so lively and full of fun as to be a {{favourite}} with everybody in the village. The men would laugh at his pranks, especially when he came from the fields on the old plough horse and urged him to a gallop, sitting with his face to the tail; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that he was like his father, and would never be much good except to make people laugh. But the women had a tender feeling for him, because, although motherless and very poor, he yet contrived to be always clean and neat. He took the greatest care of his poor clothes, washing and mending them himself. He also took an intense interest in his wethers, and almost every day he would go to Caleb, tending his flock on the down, to sit by him and ask a hundred questions about sheep and their management. He looked on Caleb, as head-shepherd on a good-sized farm, as the most important and most fortunate person he knew, and was very proud to have him as guide, philosopher, and friend.|$|E

Al-Asbagh, one of the students of Malik's companions said of him, [...] "Ibn Wahb was the companion of Malik with the most knowledge of the Sunnah and traditions although he related from men who were weak". Ibn Wahb himself recognised that some of his hadiths were weak. He said, [...] "if it had not been that Allah rescued me through Malik and al-Layth, I would have been lost.

He would always begin with respectful seriousness, or a frankness equal to her own, but never, never again would he offend as he had offended under the buckeyes! And now, with her pretty face shining upon him, all his plans, his speeches, his preparations vanished, and left him dumb. Yet he moved towards her with a brief articulate something on his lips,--something between a laugh and a sigh,--but that really was a kiss, and--in point of fact--promptly folded her in his arms.|$|R
5000|$|The working {{title of}} [...] "Eros" [...] was {{announced}} in January 2008. The tentative title stemmed from an inside joke between the band members.

In September 2008, Deftones began playing the new song [...] "Melanie" [...] during live performances. Around this time, Date began mixing some of the songs at his home studio in Seattle, Washington. They had also planned on releasing one video of studio updates online per week leading up to the album's release, but only released five before production was put on hold.|$|R

They want churches to book whole theaters and take their congregations, want it to be a Youth Group event, want magazines like this one to publish Discussion Questions at the end of their reviews—want the system to churn away, all the while netting them cash, without ever having to have cared a shred about actual Christian belief.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the way ordinary members of the public, who were present at the celebrations for the 2011 UK royal wedding, were constructed in the televised coverage of the event on the BBC and ITV. It draws on theories of media events and on theories of the mediated construction of the views of ordinary citizens, and focuses on the way vox-pop interviews and inferences about what the public thinks were used by the two television channels. It argues that by presenting {{the people on the}} scene of the celebrations as a homogenized group which thought and acted as one, by inferring what was in the mind of this group <b>and</b> what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> if <b>they</b> spoke, <b>and</b> by allowing individual members of the public relatively little flexibility in expressing themselves in their own terms during vox-pops, the coverage contributed to a dramatization of the event {{and at the same time}} constructed public acceptance of the centrality and significance of the day. Moreover these techniques functioned as an invitation to the viewer of the broadcast to identify with the group, its thoughts and emotions...|$|R

5000|$|Early church {{services}} in the Darling Downs were often an itinerant affair conducted from private houses, inns or courthouses, and the origins of Roman Catholic worship {{in the region are}} to be found in the transient rituals conducted during the early 1840s. In 1843, Australia's first Catholic Archbishop, John Bede Polding, accompanied by Benedictine abbott, Dr Henry Gregory, toured the pastoral stations in Moreton Bay and Darling Downs with a portable altar. Along the way they preached to the shepherds <b>they</b> met <b>and</b> it was recorded in June 1843 that they [...] "carried their own blankets with them and preferred sleeping on a sheet of bark on the floor [...] [...] [...] the custom of the Catholic priests [...] [...] [...] was, after a little desultory conversation, to ask if there were any Catholics present and that was all. In the morning the priest would walk out into the bush, accompanied by whoever was of his persuasion <b>and</b> there <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> what <b>they</b> had to say to each other". Five years later, Polding again visited the Darling Downs and that same year Father W. McGinty was appointed parish priest of Ipswich and the Darling Downs. Although McGinty regularly toured the Darling Downs to celebrate Mass, parishioners of the area became more vociferous in their call for a resident priest after Queensland separated from New South Wales in 1859.|$|R
