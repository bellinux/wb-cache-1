40|$|Mastitits had {{economic}} importance {{which resulted}} in reduced milk production. The diagnosis of clinical mastitis either by visual examination of milk and udder for apparent signs of mastitis or culturing and screening tests for subclinical mastitis (Quinn et al., ١٩٩٤). This study {{was carried out in}} North Kordofan State to determine the prevalence of mastitis in lactating she-camels on bases of the questionnaire survey and bacterial isolates. Also to evaluate the W. S. T and S. C. C. in diagnosis of mastitis and to determine the susceptibility of various bacterial isolates to antibiotics which were used for mastitis treatment. A total of ١١٨ camel owners were interviewed and the general investigation showed ٩٩٪ of owners confirm that mastitis was present in lactating she-camels, ٩٧٪ and ٩٢٫٣٧٪ did not clean the udder or their hands before milking, respectively. Also ٨٥٫٠٩٪ of them did not receive Veterinary and extension services, ٩٦٫٦١٪ used the anti-suckling devices and ٨٥٫٠٥٪ showed that presence of <b>anti-sucking</b> devices without milking of lactating she-camel as the main causes of mastitis. Moreover, sampling questionnaire revealed that ١٠٠٪ of lactating shecamels were infested with ticks in their udder and ٥٦٫٦٧٪ had teats lesions. Out of ٦٠ lactating she-camels, ٢١٦ quarter milk samples were collected and examined by W. S. T., S. C. C. and bacteriological examinations. The results of positive tests were ١٦٫٥%, ١٨٫٦٦٪ and ٤٥٫٨٣٪ respectively. furthermore, the prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis represented ٤٥٫٣٧٪ and clinical mastitis ٠٫٩٣٪. In this study the bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus (٨٠٫٣٠٪), Streptococcus (١٫٥٢), Corynebacteria (٣٫٠٣٪), Bacillus (٩٫٠٩٪) and Pasteurella (٦٫٠٦٪). Furthermore, the species of Staphylococcus isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (٢٢٫٧٥٪), S. hyicus (٣٫٠٣٪), S. intermediatius (٧٫٥٦٪). S. delphini (٣٫٠٣٪) S. epidermidus (١٢٫١٢٪), S. simulans (٦٫٠٦٪),S. kloosii (٤٫٥٥٪), S. chromogenes (١٫٥٢٪), S. lentus (٣٫٠٣٪), S. lugdunensis (٣٫٠٣٪), S. sacchrolyticus (١٫٥٢٪), S. saprophyticus (٣٫٠٣٪), S. haemolyticus (٦٫٠٦٪) and S. carnosus (١٫٥٢٪). This study confirmed the strong relationships between S. C. C. and W. S. T. with bacteriological examinations. The antibiotic sensitivity test revealed the high sensitivity of the isolates to Ciprofloxacin, Gentamycin, Offlaxacin Cephalexine, Tetracyline and Co-trimoxazole and intermediate sensitivity to Ampicillin and Cefotaxime. However, the tested organisms confirmed the resistance to Coloxacillin and Lincomycin...|$|E
