A novel flexure-based joint was {{developed}} for Squishbot 1 by a team at MIT, which can be made small (sub-cm), or much larger. Here, pseudo-rigid-body modeling is {{used in conjunction with}} the geometry of the joint mechanism in order to create analytic models of the forces at play in the joint, so as to better enable their design and use. Two mechanisms are analyzed: one in which the flexure is pinned to the moving legs, and one in which it is fixed. Systems of equations are generated for fixed flexure and pinned flexure joints, which are provided for the reader to use in order to develop their own mechanisms, and optimize them to their own applications. The fixed flexure, no leg contact model is tested for a particular configuration, and less than 3 % error is found between the experimental and model data.
