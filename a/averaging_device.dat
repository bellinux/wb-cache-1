40|$|Abstract—Presented in {{this paper}} are two new {{approaches}} for the acquisition of both iso-thermal dc current-voltage (–) characteristics and microwave-parameters of power RF LD-MOSFETs. In the first approach, three-dimensional (3 -D) tensor product B-spline representation is used to extract iso-thermal dc – characteristics from dc – characteristics measured at various substrate temperatures. The <b>average</b> <b>device</b> surface temperature is measured using an infrared sensor. A single effec-tive thermal resistance is found to map the entire electrothermal profile of the device justifying the iso-thermal dc – definition used. In the second approach, iso-thermal – and microwave data are directly measured with an efficient procedure that keeps the <b>average</b> <b>device</b> surface temperature constant. Excellent agreement is obtained between the numerical extraction and the direct measurement approach.

40|$|Studies of induced {{currents}} {{were the}} main activity of the month. Preliminary frequency response studies were started and detailed marigram analysis was resumed. Studies of induced currents involved development of methods, running of tests and analysis of data. Some currents are induced in the harbor by the waves which pass through the entrance. These were the currents studied. They give basic data. Tidal changes and outer ocean currents will be superposed later to learn of composite effects. Frequency response studies were initiated this month also. The present wave machines were designed to make such tests possible, since both amplitude and frequency of the wave trains can be controlled over wide ranges. It is intended to run tests through the entire spectrum after observing and measuring the effects of certain calculated frequencies. The calculated frequencies were the fundamentals and harmonics of each division of the harbor.

40|$|From the {{proceedings}} of a conference sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the American Institute for Biological Sciences. The conference was held in San Francisco in September 1968 to discuss current problems {{in the study of}} average evoked potential. The purpose of most studies of the average evoked potential (AEP) is {{to determine the extent to}} which the complex waveform of the AEP varies with the parameters of the stimulation, the state of the subject, and the recording site. Data analysis techniques in AEP research should, therefore, provide for reliable, objective, and easy-to use methods for measuring and specifying differences between any two AEP. Statistical analysis provides us with a body of tools whose purpose is to allow the investigator to evaluate and judge differences of this nature. However, there are two major difficulties in applying classical statistical analysis to AEP data, namely, the fact that the AEP is a multidimensional observation and that more often than not the format in which the data are available is that of the graphic output of an <b>averaging</b> <b>device.</b> The multidimensionality of the AEP makes it insufficient to state that two AEPs are 2 ̆ 2 different 2 ̆ 2; this statement must. always be supplemented by a more detailed specification of the difference. Thus, two AEPs might have identical waveshapes but different amplitudes; the difference might be limited to a small segment of the AEP, or the two AEPs might be virtually identical except for a major difference in one or more components. The differences might be caused by changes in the general waveform, or they might be caused by shifts in the latency of specific components. For these reasons, general statements that two AEP waveforms are different are relatively devoid of meaning...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 A waveform-preserving, {{variable}} time-delay system {{capable of}} several milliseconds delay {{is described in}} this thesis. These considerably long delays are achieved by judicious use of the relatively low sonic velocity of gases. Initial system design criteria specified a time delay of ten milliseconds and a signal bandwidth of 0 - 10 KC. Due to limiting parameters of available system components, optimum performance may not be obtained for delays in serious excess of five milliseconds and maximum signal frequency which may be passed through the system is two KC. Acoustic waveguides {{in the form of}} circular tubes are used to contain the gaseous transmission media. Energy conversion is achieved by electroacoustic transducers placed {{at each end of the}} waveguide. With air as the delay medium, a time delay of 0. 885 milliseconds per foot of waveguide propagation distance may be obtained for an ambient temperature of 20 degrees C. Since the attenuation properties of acoustic waveguides are very non-linear functions of frequency, intelligence transmission is best accomplished by frequency modulating an ultrasonic carrier. An FM carrier of 40 KC was used to accommodate available transducers. A unique FM modulator based on the principles of mutual inductance and current division was designed for use in the system. These principles allow it to possess a very large frequency-voltage transfer ratio at low carrier frequencies in contrast with other types of sinusoidal FM modulators. Detection is performed by means of a capacitive pulse <b>averaging</b> <b>device.</b> Strongest limitations of the system with respect to feasible delay time are imposed by reflection coefficients of waveguide terminations and sensivity of reception apparatus. These factors serve to determine the longest practical propagation distance which may be used for a given modulation index and signal frequency while maintaining percent distortion in the output below a desired level. System bandwidth is limited to two KC by transducer passbands. Very good reproduction of delayed signals may be obtained by operating the system under its optimal modes of performance as dictated by these limitations. Several possible applications of ultrasonic waveguide systems are discussed, among them the implementation of time delay generators in correlation function computation systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{object of}} this paper is to operate a fifteen-level Hybrid {{inverter}} of an induction motor drive at an <b>average</b> <b>device</b> switching frequency limited to rated fundamental frequency by using Synchronous optimal pulse width modulation(SOP) technique. To reduce the number of separate dc sources, a three-level transistor clamped inverter was used as a cell in the fifteen-level hybrid inverter. Using SOP technique, optimal fifteen-level waveforms were obtained by offline optimization assuming steady-state operation of the induction machine. The switching angles for each semiconductor switch are then obtained from optimal fifteen-level waveforms based on the criteria to minimize the switching frequency as well as unbalance in dc-link capacitor voltages. Simulation results obtained from the 1. 5 -kW induction motor drive show THD < 5 % for stator currents.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a modified phase-shifted carrier-based pulsewidth-modulation (PSC-PWM) scheme for modular multilevel converters (MMC). In {{order to reduce}} the <b>average</b> <b>device</b> switching frequency, a reduced switching-frequency (RSF) voltage balancing algorithm is developed. This paper also proposes a circulating current suppressing controller (CCSC) to minimize the inner circulating current in an MMC.

Simulation results based on a detailed PSCAD/EMTDC model prove the effectiveness of the modified PSC-PWM method and the RSF voltage-balancing algorithm. The proposed CCSC not only eliminates the inner circulating current but also improves the quality of the converter ac output voltage. A simple loss evaluation demonstrates that the RSF voltage-balancing algorithm and the CCSC reduce the converter power losses...|$|R

However, using Y sacrificial layers to isolate the graphene from processing conditions improves the yield (from 73 % to 97 %), <b>average</b> <b>device</b> performance (three-fold increase of mobility, 58 % lower contact resistance), and the device-to-device variability (standard deviation of Dirac voltage reduced by 20 %).

40|$|Efficiency, lifetime, and {{reliability}} are {{important factors in}} the selection of a particular power converter to meet today?s industrial needs. There have been many recent advances in power converter topologies and power converter semiconductor devices which have allowed for higher efficiency, smaller converter sizes, and improved output voltage and current characteristics which reduce the stresses on the motors being driven. Multilevel converters have been researched extensively and their benefits over traditional two level converters are well-known. A drawback of multilevel inverters is the potential for unbalanced semiconductor losses and thermal stress at particular operating points. These imbalances lead to decreased overall converter lifetime which is based on the most stressed device. This work presents two algorithms, one open loop and one closed loop, along with high bandwidth junction temperature estimation to more equally balance the balance the losses for each semiconductor device in a Three-Level Neutral Point Clamped inverter to reduce the overall <b>average</b> <b>device</b> stresses and to increase the overall converter lifetime at particular operating points.

A series of naphthalene and perylene diimide (NDI and PDI, respectively) based 3 D-shaped non-fullerene acceptors were synthesized and their optical and electronic properties were studied {{as described in}} this thesis. Chapter 2 focuses on four NDI-based NFAs with different non-planar central core units. It was found that these materials have broader absorptions compared to typical fullerenes, and the strong tendency of planar NDIs to aggregate was hindered by the non-planar structure that arises when four naphthalene diimides are connected to a core.

MethodsForty isolation rooms at the Queens Hospital (700 beds) in North London, UK, were sampled for aerobic bacteria after patient discharge, after manual cleaning with a hypochlorous acid–troclosene sodium solution, and after PX-UV disinfection. PX-UV device efficacy on known organisms was tested by exposing inoculated agar plates in a nonpatient care area.

ResultsAfter PX-UV disinfection, the bacterial contamination measured in colony forming units (CFU) decreased by 78. 4 %, a 91 % reduction from initial bioburden levels prior to terminal cleaning.

40|$|The {{scaling of}} {{conventional}} silicon based MOSFETs is increasingly difficult into the nanometer regime due to short channel effects, tunneling and subthreshold leakage current. Ultra-thin body silicon-on-insulator based architectures offer a promising alternative, alleviating these problems through their geometry. However, the transport behaviour in these devices is more complex, especially for silicon thicknesses below 10 nm, with enhancement from band splitting and volume inversion competing with scattering from phonons, Coulomb interactions, interface roughness and body thickness fluctuation. Here, {{the effect of}} the last scattering mechanism on the drive current is examined as it is considered a significant limitation to device performance for body thicknesses below 5 nm. A simulation technique that properly captures non-equilibrium transport, includes quantum effects and maintains computational efficiency is essential for the study of this scattering mechanism. Therefore, a 3 D Monte Carlo simulator has been developed which includes this scattering effect in an ab initio fashion, and quantum corrections using the Density Gradient formalism.
